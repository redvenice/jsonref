I said, Well, the handsome one is obviously me, and I\u0027m guessing that scrawny little kid is you?.\u0027Former team mate George Honeyman also praised Pickford who he says has always been confident. \u0027I played with him all the way through and he\u0027s always been such a fierce competitor,\u0027 he said.\u0027He had his mood swings if he didn\u0027t get his own way, but the main reason he has succeeded is how competitive and aggressive he is.\u0027Off the pitch, he\u0027s the life and soul, no-one dislikes him. Everyone says goalkeepers are mad, but he genuinely is, he\u0027s a nutter, in the nicest way.          Jordan Pickford in Russia: The player has been accompanied by his family (including his brother Richard, pictured) to his World Cup debut          Jordan Pickford\u0027s first call up was in 2016 and friend George Honeyman said looking back they knew he would go to the top\u0027He loves his boxing, motocross, golf, he\u0027s just a full-on, fun guy to be around.\u0027 And coach Ball remembers that well. Once, team mates overheard him telling Jordan he wouldn\u0027t make it with his attitude - to which the goalie replied \u0027I bet I will\u0027. Ball said: \u0027He thought he was the best. He knew he had potential and athletic ability. But you have to work hard to achieve that, and he has.\u0027He wanted to be in the first-team at 17 and was pushy, but I liked that. He challenged me.\u0027And, on the morning of his senior debut at Sunderland Pickford called his former coach, just to say thank you. Pickford is expected to start in England\u0027s game against Sweden on Saturday."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/04/10/4DE94FCD00000578-0-image-m-4_1530697639725.jpg","title":"Britains Got Talent contestant 76 shocked shop assistant pulling shirt aside","story":"The 23-year-old woman told magistrates that her \u0027stomach turned\u0027 when John Gough, 76, (pictured left, outside court, and right, on BGT last year) reached forward to touch her in full view of other customers and staff as he paid for petrol at the Gloucester storeShe could not continue working and she rang her mum and \u0027burst into tears\u0027 as she told her what had happened, she said.Mr Gough, of Gloucester, accepted that his actions amounted to a common assault but denied a charge of sexual assault on the woman on November 22 last year.Parents of two-month-old girl are charged with murder after...British lesbian wins the right to live with her partner in...Share this articleThe driving school boss, who holds records for economical long distance driving on minimal amounts of fuel, told the court he barely touched the woman and had no sexual motive behind his actions.He said he had simply been intrigued by the writing tattooed on her chest but could only see a few of the letters and thought they said \u0027red.\u0027          Record breaking driving instructor and Britain\u0027s Got Talent contestant John Gough gets into his car outside Cheltenham Magistrates courtCCTV of the incident was played to the court. It showed him queueing to pay for fuel and, as he did so, suddenly putting his hand on the shoulder of the woman in front of him for no apparent reason.He then walked forward to the alleged victim\u0027s till and could be seen almost immediately reaching out to the woman\u0027s chest area with his left hand. It was clear in the video that her own hands did not leave the counter.Mr Gough claimed she had moved her polo shirt aside herself so he could read the rest of her tattoo - but the CCTV clearly showed that did not happen and he said he could not understand why not. During yesterday\u0027s trial the court heard that the woman cashier in a Gloucester shoppetrol station had a two line sentence about love tattooed just above her right breast. She said it was positioned so it would be covered up by her work polo shirt and she would look \u0027professional.\u0027When Mr Gough approached her, she said: \u0027Hhis fingers went on my top and pulled it down and to the right.\u0027He pulled it across to reveal the full length of my tattoo. His fingers were on the skin of my chest.\u0027She said she asked if he was trying to read the tattoo but he just grinned and did not really respond and he did not question her about it.\u0027When he pulled my top across he leaned his head down and started looking at it,\u0027 she said. \u0027I was quite shocked. I didn\u0027t know what to do. I just wanted to serve him and get him out of the shop.\u0027She estimated his hand was on her for about five seconds.\u0027It was part of my breast - the top part of my breast, a personal place,\u0027 she said. \u0027When he did go my stomach turned. It made me shake. I felt really uncomfortable, I felt like crying. But I didn\u0027t want to make a scene in front of the customers.          After a half-day trial the magistrates said they believed the woman\u0027s account of what happened but could not be sure beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Gough\u0027s actions were sexually motivated and so found him not guilty of sexual assault\u0027I turned to my colleague and said \u0027He just pulled my top across. Do you mind if I go?\u0027\u0027I felt overwhelmed and emotional. I contacted my mum and I burst into tears. I spoke to my manager and we decided to call the police.\u0027Cross-examined by Tim Burrows, for Mr Gough, she denied that he had asked her about whether the letters \u0027red\u0027 in the tattoo related to Manchester United or Ferrari. He said nothing of the kind, she insisted.Linda Mustoe, the woman in the queue in front of Mr Gough before the incident, told the court he stood quite close behind her and made her feel \u0027uncomfortable.\u0027\u0027Then I felt something touch me. It was a hand on my left shoulder,\u0027 she said. \u0027I quickly looked around and saw the man. He said sorry and moved back. \u0027She said while she was being served Mr Gough went to the next till and after he left she heard the cashier saying \u0027That man has just pulled my top down.\u0027\u0027She was distressed and I said, Actually, he made me feel uncomfortable too. He actually touched me.\u0027In evidence, Mr Gough said the woman\u0027s tattoo was up on her collarbone, not her breast, and he could only see the letters \u0027red\u0027 so he asked \u0027Are you Man U then, or Ferrari?\u0027\u0027She said \u0027Do you want to see it?\u0027 and I said \u0027I don\u0027t mind.\u0027 She pulled it to the side and she laughed.\u0027When I put my hand out I may have flicked her top, I don\u0027t know.\u0027After a half-day trial the magistrates said they believed the woman\u0027s account of what happened but could not be sure beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Gough\u0027s actions were sexually motivated and so found him not guilty of sexual assault.\u0027She said he took hold of her polo shirt and pulled it across to reveal her skin - the CCTV revealed he did,\u0027 said court chairman Andrew Tabor. \u0027He denied touching her at all although grudgingly admitted he might have flicked her clothing. He claimed she opened her shirt to show the tattoo even though CCTV evidence showed her hands not to leave her till.\u0027We are satisfied he did indeed touch her to reveal her tattoo. That action could be perceived to be sexual but we are not convinced that the purpose was sexual.\u0027When the court declared Mr Gough not guilty of sexual assault he raised both hands above his head and said \u0027Correct decision, Sir.\u0027He insisted he had absolutely no sexual motive for what he did.\u0027I have taught 3,000 girls between the ages of 17 and 25 to drive - a total of 90,000 hours in the car on my own with them no problem, and now I get some cock and bull story. I\u0027m sorry, no way,\u0027 he said. Mr Gough appeared on Britain\u0027s Got Talent in May last year and set a world record by reciting the alphabet backwards in four seconds. He also tried to set a new record for telling the most jokes in one minute but dried up and fell well short of his 27 joke target.In 1999 the lifelong driving instructor set a world record after averaging 113 miles per gallon when he drove his car from Exeter to Gloucester. He used only one gallon of unleaded petrol in his 850cc Perodua Nippa car up the M5 but to achieve the record had to go at only 35mph.Then in 2003 Mr Gough set another record by driving a Toyota Yaris 28 miles on just one litre of fuel."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/04/20/4DEC3B8F00000578-5918823-James_was_photographed_walking_along_the_deck_of_the_yacht_in_Po-a-80_1530731662068.jpg","title":"LeBron James family continue vacationing yacht Italy days Lakers deal","story":"    LeBron James is still vacationing in Italy with his family.

The Beckham franchise, when it gets going, will also bring a training center and an academy focused on developing local players to the Miami area.The stadium-location quest is just the latest drawn-out chapter in Beckham\u0027s five-years-and-counting marathon to bring MLS back to Miami. The Miami Fusion played from 1998-2001, folding because of poor attendance.Beckham and MLS announced in January that the franchise would be coming to Miami, but nearly every detail about the club remains unclear. There\u0027s no definitive start date - 2020 has been mentioned repeatedly, even though no new stadium could possibly be ready by then - as well as no team name, no logo, no colors, no coaching staff and no front-office personnel.More than a year ago, Miami-Dade County commissioners approved a deal to sell Beckham nearly three acres of county land for $9 million with the belief that it would be the last parcel he needed for a stadium site in the city\u0027s Overtown neighborhood. But that site was never the preferred choice for Beckham and his group anyway, with the original hope being to build on the waterfront near the Port of Miami.The Overtown site now seems all but doomed, though it\u0027s unclear what would happen if city commissioners or voters block the latest Beckham plan.          Beckham preferred a site near the Port of Miami, but traffic from the port\u0027s bridge and from American Airlines Arena - the home of the Miami Heat - made the intersection unusable    In this January 29, 2018, file photo, David Beckham speaks at an event where it was announced that Major League Soccer is bringing an expansion team to Miami.

The mansion isn\u0027t the only property in these sprawling North Yorkshire grounds, which also feature a barn in which an 11-man England squad could sleep          Gareth and his wife of 20 years have previously struggled to sell the house and even had to screen visitors when he got the England job to deter nosy fans keen for a tour           The 8,000 sq ft property sits within 4.5 acres of grounds and the only drawback at the site seems to be the rumoured ghost said to haunt its grounds And if the man who oversaw England\u0027s first ever World Cup penalty shoot-out win on Tuesday ever feels short of an impressive tale to tell, he can point guests in the direction of his antiques collection of goblets and statues.  The former Crystal Palace player and his wife, bought the Grade 1 listed home back in 2006 for £3.25m but it isn\u0027t their only property on the site, which boasts a barn big enough to house an 11-man squad.The 8,000 sq ft house sits in 4.5 acres of formal grounds and legend has it that a ghost occupies the main building.

If they can\u0027t afford to, though, or they drive a company car, then it starts to become a problem for them.\u0027I think a lot of men feel emasculated by a woman in a powerful position, whether that\u0027s in the boardroom or behind the wheel of a car.\u0027I don\u0027t rise to the comments I get when I\u0027m out driving. I generally reply with a witty putdown to make it clear I\u0027m not just a WAG in a shiny car with no clue how to drive it.\u0027          Company boss Maya Hartge is used to attracting attention when she\u0027s driving her Porsche 981 Spyder convertibleWhile the idea that a man might find it hard to cope with a woman driving a fancy car may sound dated, according to John Groeger, Professor of Psychology at Nottingham Trent University, who has a particular interest in motoring, what Maya experiences is a common reaction.Even in 2018, some men find it hard to cope with the idea that many women are now big earners — and savers — and can splash out on whatever car takes their fancy.\u0027One of the things we\u0027ve noticed in our research is that people will get angry and behave aggressively towards drivers they believe are of a lower status than themselves,\u0027 says Professor Groeger.\u0027Sexism is still rife in all areas of life — and there\u0027s plenty of it lurking in the traffic system, too. We know from experimental studies that others make assumptions about our wealth, status, personality or competence based on the vehicle we drive.\u0027We carried out one experiment using two identical white vans, one of them bearing the livery of an emergency services vehicle. Other drivers drove with far more care and respect around the latter than when it was an unmarked white van.\u0027We also compared reactions to vehicles with and without L-plates. We are quicker to blame, and act aggressively, towards people we feel are lower status — those whose cars carry L-plates, for example. We forgive them less easily, yet are quite prepared to exonerate people we feel are more like ourselves.\u0027So we have a clash between the apparent status of the vehicle and the assumed characteristics of the people who drive them.\u0027According to statistics released in April this year by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), female car ownership is at a record high, and more women than ever are buying into the luxury car market.In recent years, Porsche alone has doubled its sales of vehicles to women. Meanwhile, convertibles are now most likely to be bought by women in their 50s, with sales to this demographic quadrupling in just 15 years.          Zipping around in her Porsche Boxter convertible, Ingrid Lewis (pictured)frequently finds herself up against men keen to prove they are kings of the road.Maya bought her Porsche two years ago as a limited edition, meaning it\u0027s a collectors\u0027 item unlikely to depreciate in value.Her first car was rather different, though.\u0027It was a Fiat Punto HLX 16 valve which cost just over £13,000 when I was 18,\u0027 she recalls. \u0027I worked like a dog, six days a week for a year, in my IT technical support job to save up for it. My friends were out spending their money on having fun and holidaying in Ibiza, but my heart was set on that car.\u0027By the time she was 24 she had her own successful business and had saved enough money to splash out on her first \u0027supercar\u0027 — an Aston Martin DBS coupé that cost around £180,000 and which she still owns.\u0027I buy high performance cars because I love driving them, especially on tracks in the UK and abroad,\u0027 says Maya, who says she inherited her love of fast cars from her father, a former racing driver. She puts her collection of cars to good use by charging for rides in them at events in aid of The Children\u0027s Trust.\u0027I do think it\u0027s a shame that men tar all women with the old stereotype of us not being able to drive or park. When I take my cars on track days, I can see that men there think they\u0027re going to be better drivers than me. I just keep quiet and let my driving prove how wrong they are.\u0027While Maya aims to respond to putdowns with wit and charm, men who take on events director Henrietta Sauleek are less amused when she\u0027s at the wheel of her bright blue £70,000 Audi RS4, which can go from 0-60mph in 4.1 seconds.\u0027On one occasion, in a car park, a man aged about 60 drove slowly past me as I got out of my car. He wound down the window on his family saloon and said to me: \u0027That car is not for a woman.\u0027 What I was thinking is unprintable, but I didn\u0027t give him the satisfaction of a reply.\u0027I\u0027ve had men of all ages cut me up, or they try to stop me joining a lane of traffic if two lanes merge into one. A lot of them are tradesmen in their 30s, driving vans. I doubt they\u0027d do it to my husband if he was driving my car.\u0027Henrietta, 33, who lives in Basingstoke with her husband, a company director and their children, aged four and one, adds: \u0027I\u0027ve had a passion for cars since passing my test at the age of 19, but I\u0027ve never had hassle from men until I got the RS4 a year ago.\u0027I started to think that perhaps it was all in my own head, until last month when the car went into the garage for general maintenance.\u0027She was given a standard Audi A5 saloon as a courtesy car for a couple of weeks while the work was being done.\u0027Suddenly, I was anonymous and invisible on the roads again and didn\u0027t get any aggravation from other drivers,\u0027 she says. \u0027It cemented the fact that I really had been getting derogatory comments from men because I was driving a sports car. I can only assume it\u0027s because they are jealous.\u0027Since getting her RS4 back three weeks ago, she\u0027s again having to put up with sexist assumptions.\u0027We were out as a family a few days ago and were just getting out of the car when a guy walking past said to my husband: \u0027Nice car, mate!\u0027 assuming that it must be his,\u0027 says Henrietta. In fact, her husband drives a rather less flashy VW Golf, albeit top of the range, and says he never gets any trouble at the wheel of either car.It was after spotting a woman at the wheel of a \u0027stunning Porsche\u0027 in a traffic jam 12 years ago that Henrietta vowed to save hard to one day own a sports car herself.\u0027I chose the RS4 purely for me — not to show off but because it\u0027s a stunning car,\u0027 she says. \u0027I\u0027ve worked really hard, we don\u0027t spend much on our social life, and I really appreciate cars.\u0027It\u0027s a fun and empowering car. I love the adrenaline rush I get when I accelerate and the engine roars, but clearly it aggravates certain men. I\u0027ve never experienced any animosity from other women.\u0027 Professor Groeger explains that this sort of reaction is indicative of the human tendency endlessly to compare ourselves to others. It also reveals that many men still see themselves as higher up the social pecking order than women.\u0027Sometimes, when we come off badly, we\u0027re not that upset by it, for example if the other person is a talented sports person driving a great car,\u0027 he says. \u0027But in other cases we feel resentful if we assume that a person has had success in a way that we haven\u0027t, or that we feel is underserved.\u0027So, if a man is well educated, has worked hard and done quite well for himself but sees a woman driving a car he could only dream of being able to afford, he might feel irritated by that, though it\u0027s obviously sexist.\u0027 Zipping around in her Porsche Boxter convertible, Ingrid Lewis frequently finds herself up against men keen to prove they are kings of the road.\u0027Men sit at traffic lights and look at me while revving their engines in anticipation of the lights changing to green, but I tend to be a bit naughty and deliberately leave them standing,\u0027 says Ingrid, who\u0027s now retired from the company she owned and lives with her partner Richard, 62, in Hertfordshire.\u0027They can\u0027t resist overtaking me. If I\u0027m doing 80mph, they want to do 90mph. They glare at me and I can see they\u0027re thinking: \u0027How dare you be in a car like that?\u0027A youthful 70, Ingrid bought her five-year-old Boxter earlier this year (they cost over £40,000 new). Unlike Maya and Henrietta, she says she also encounters aggression from women drivers — and it annoys her because she feels it\u0027s \u0027not sisterly\u0027.\u0027Last week, I was on the motorway in a variable speed area and there was a woman right behind me trying to edge me out of the way so she could get past. Others try to cut me up.\u0027Ingrid\u0027s love affair with sporty cars began when she was 20 and her father bought her a coveted Austin-Healey Sprite.With the roof down on her Boxter, she often attracts admiring glances from men. \u0027Men seem to think me driving a car like this gives them a licence to flirt with me, and even young guys smile at me,\u0027 she says. \u0027I guess those sort of glances are flattering.\u0027And I do see why some men feel they have to compete with me when they see me in the Porsche. I think it stems from cars having been a traditionally macho item.\u0027But they\u0027re just going to have to get used to more women, in better cars, overtaking them in the fast lane.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/05/12/4DF238A600000578-0-image-m-39_1530789105836.jpg","title":"Can spot venomous snake hiding grass","story":"    A keen eye might be able to pick out the red-bellied black snake hiding in this photoAlmost 60 people had a go at spotting the snake, with only a couple being able to correctly identify the lurking predator. One Facebook commenter made their guess, saying, \u0027Stripy looking long thing!

Travel, Rory Boland, said: ‘Not all customers are comfortable booking online, and they should not be penalised for booking over the phone. Airlines that are charging customers more must be clear and transparent about these additional fees.’Both BA and Tui said the charge represented the extra administration and staff costs involved in offering telephone bookings, while Ryanair said fewer than 0.5 per cent of its customers book over the phone.Easyjet said: ‘We encourage passengers to book online. Those using our telephone service are informed of the online discount at the beginning of the call’.It also said that passengers needing special assistance can still receive the online price by phone. The mark-up comes on top of other charges applied by airlines such as passengers being be charged up to £16 to pick their seat. People who choose to put a suitcase in the hold can pay up to £38 for something under 20kg, while going over the weight allowance by the equivalent of a bag of sugar can trigger a £12 charge.          Ryanair said fewer than 0.5 per cent of their customers book over the telephoneAt least one airline now even charges customers a fee of £1.75 each way to take hand luggage into the cabin.A separate survey on airline fees by holiday currency experts FairFX found flight costs can soar once all the add-ons are taken into account.A spokesman said: ‘While many airlines will assign you a seat for free for your journey, if you are travelling with family, young children, friends or a partner, the only way to guarantee you will be sat next to each other is to pay the additional fee to reserve a seat.’FairFX said with each airline imposing its own costs and rules on putting luggage into the hold, it has become both confusing and expensive. For example, Ryanair, Tui and Thomas Cook have a 20kg limit per bag, but the fees vary from £23 to £38. BA, EasyJet and Flybe have a higher 23kg limit and the fees range from £20 to £31. The limit at Jet2 is 22kg and there is a charge of £22.Most short-haul travellers have switched to taking only hand luggage to avoid these fees, but even this is no longer guaranteed to be free. Last summer Jet2 introduced ‘guaranteed cabin luggage’, charging passengers £1.75 each if they want to guarantee their hand luggage does not end up in the hold.FairFX chief Ian Strafford-Taylor said booking holidays has become a ‘financial minefield for families’ and warned them to be aware of the different add-ons, which could soon see the cost of their holidays ‘rocket’. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/05/23/4DF21DB000000578-0-image-m-13_1530831158414.jpg","title":"One seven GP posts vacancy rates three times six years","story":"    One in seven GP posts is empty, with vacancy rates up three-fold in six years, figures revealBut the record shortages are leaving patients with ever-longer waiting times, and make it far more difficult to see the same GP each time.An annual survey of family doctors by Pulse magazine shows the vacancy rate is now at 15.3 per cent – its highest so far. This is up from 4.2 per cent in 2012, when the survey began, 9.1 per cent in 2016 and 12.2 per cent last year.Ministers have repeatedly promised to hire an extra 5,000 GPs by 2020 to free up more appointments, especially out-of-hours.But figures in May showed the NHS has lost a net 1,018 family doctors since ministers first made that pledge in 2015.The survey comes after the head of the NHS’s workforce body revealed last month that four in ten GPs – who each cost the taxpayer around half a million to train – had quit their full-time posts within five years of finishing their training. There are no laughing children splashing in the Avon water...Tesco, Sainsbury\u0027s, Waitrose and Iceland are forced to...Share this articleAnd this week the Royal College of GPs warned that almost every surgery had at least one GP vacancy. The shortage has come about because older doctors are choosing to retire in their 50s as they are fed up with the increasingly intense workloads and form-filling.At the same time millennial GPs are opting to only work part-time or practise as locums, rather than holding down permanent posts.Some of these GPs have families, while others want to mix their time up with research, starting up a business or private work.Dr Richard Vautrey, chair of the BMA’s GP Committee, said: ‘The fact that so many surgeries are unable to recruit GPs provides yet more evidence of the scale of the crisis impacting general practice.           Heavy workloads are seeing senior doctors take early retirement, while their younger colleagues are opting to work part-timeThe Government must prioritise general practice and urgently invest in it to address this growing crisis ... We cannot allow a situation where patient safety is being compromised by a lack of political action.’ The survey asked GPs how many posts were vacant in their own surgery.

It is a situation that is replicated up and down the country, and business rates are playing a major part in deepening the problem.As the Daily Mail’s important and timely Save Our High Streets campaign has highlighted, nearly 6,000 shops went bust last year and 50,000 retail jobs were lost. Outlets from small shops to major chains are closing with terrifying regularity.Nobody is arguing that businesses shouldn’t pay tax. Only that taxes should be fair. And the British Retail Consortium has shown how the retail sector is stumping up more than its share – it pays 10 per cent of all business taxes while accounting for only 5 per cent of the UK economy’s GVA (Greater Value Added), the primary measure used by the Office of National Statistics to gauge economic productivity.By international standards, UK businesses also pay higher taxes on property than in almost any other country.The strain this is putting on businesses is immense and unjust. As a Conservative, I understand instinctively that my party should be on the side of enterprise.We need to do better, and this means the Chancellor has to up his game. Too often since his appointment, he has shown a tin ear to the concerns of precisely the sorts of people the Conservative Party ought to be championing. A tidal wave of avoidable business closures due to an unwillingness to change course on business rates must not be added to that list of failings.Nigel Farage vows he WILL return to frontline politics if...Share this articleThe Government’s position is that it has delivered help to struggling high street businesses in the form of billions of pounds’ worth of business rate relief.But this is a case of trying to apply a sticking plaster to an ever-widening wound: the British Retail Consortium estimates that retailers will pay an additional £2billion over the next three years compared to the previous three.The system itself is broken, and no amount of rate relief can get round that. We need to look at a wholly new system, probably based around the value of product sales rather than property, which would level the playing field between businesses which have a physical presence in our high streets and those operating online.While this new system is designed and consulted on, we should give the high street breathing space by adopting the BRC’s proposal for a two-year freeze in rates increases. As a member of the Treasury select committee, I am anxious that in the meantime we should contribute to that consultation process.Practical steps like this to back business are the right answer to the high street’s woes. Only if we sort out business rates can we distinguish between those businesses that fail because they no longer meet a market need and potentially good businesses which are being taken to the wall because of the current unfair tax regime.Take one of my constituents, Shobu Barua, the owner of a popular new Thai restaurant, Coco \u0026amp Rum, in the seaside resort of Saltburn. He recently took the plunge and moved into a vacant shop in the heart of the town.Immediately, he was hit by a wickedly high business rates bill, which I am working with him to try to reduce. Shobu warns that he may have to close unless the bill comes down.What kind of message are we sending to hard-working people like Shobu who want to invest in their business, take on staff and contribute to the economy?The Chancellor has a duty to listen, and to act. If he gets this right, he will be remembered as a Chancellor who saved the high street. If he fails to act, he risks being remembered as the man who betrayed it.Simon Clarke, MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland and a member of the Commons Treasury select committee  The Mail visited Philip Hammond’s constituency yesterday to see what they thought of the Chancellor’s attitude towards small businesses.In Weybridge, Surrey, where Mr Hammond was voted into office in May 1997, local businesses laid bare the daily struggle they face and hit out at their MP over his lack of help.LIVELIHOOD AT STAKE Sue Bridger, 59, has run cafe French Fancy’s with daughter Tashana French after they built it from scratch three years ago.But spiralling costs are already threatening to put them out of business like so many before them.Mrs Bridger, who has lived in Weybridge for around 20 years, says the high street is a shadow of its former self. ‘It used to be a busy town,’ she said. ‘There were shops for the rich and shops for the poor. Now the wealthy just get in their taxis to Kensington to do their shopping. People have been coming in here asking me where all the shops have gone.’Incredibly, Mrs Bridger wasn’t aware that Mr Hammond – the man with the power to save the high street – is her MP. ‘I never see him around. If he did come down perhaps he would realise what a mess the place is,’ she said.  Inci Malik (left) says spiralling costs have seen her forced to lay off staff at artisan cafe Aromas while Jay Patel has faced crippling business rate increases at her newsagents Business rates on her shop have risen from £10,000 to £11,500 since April, having already increased from £9,000 in 2016. ‘Independent shops are community institutions,’ she said. ‘I like the fact that an 80-year-old grandmother can come in for some company as well as a coffee. If we had to close, that is what I would miss the most.‘This is our livelihood at stake.’Meanwhile, Inci Malik says spiralling costs have seen her forced to lay off staff at artisan cafe Aromas.Her business rates have soared year-on-year, increasing from £13,329 to £14,478 for 2017-2018 after they started at £11,000 when she moved to the town in 2015. The rateable value of the property has risen from £24,000 to £32,750 in that time.Business rates are now equivalent to 6 per cent of her turnover.The 42-year-old said: ‘It is inevitable that we will go out of business if this keeps up. Last year I had to lay off four of my full-time staff. It was upsetting to do. I am now working seven days a week.’Miss Malik urged the Chancellor to stop increasing rates for small shops and focus on ending tax avoidance by large corporations.She said: ‘There’s a Starbucks next door – it’s unfair they get an easy ride, when people like us who are part of the community get hit.’HE DOESN\u0027T CARE RAJ Patel said Mr Hammond was not interested in the plight of small businesses in his constituency.Mr Patel, who owns Weybridge News, said he was ‘unsurprised’ by his MP’s ‘negative’ attitude.‘I had a meeting with him about four years ago,’ he said. ‘He didn’t seem to be very clued up about our situation, nor did he seem particularly interested.‘Most of the time he is here, he is just hanging around outside Waitrose in the run-up to an election.’The 48-year-old, who has run the newsagents with his 46-year-old wife Jay for a decade, said he has faced crippling business rate increases.          Spiralling costs are already threatening to put Tashana French out of business‘These rates are unfair when you compare them to shops that are not on the high street,’ he said. ‘Some of those are much bigger than ours, but they don’t have to pay anywhere near as much.’He said fewer customers and business closures had created a vicious cycle of decline.‘A lot have already moved out, which has been bad for us because not as many people come to the town any more.‘It has been in steady decline. It is becoming a bit of a ghost town.’WE\u0027LL CUT STAFF HUSBAND and wife Ali and Elena Vahedi say rocketing rates will force them to cut staff at their Italian restaurant.Their restaurant Osso Buco has been hit with a 67 per cent increase in its rateable value, from £44,500 to £74,000.Since April last year, they have had to find an extra £3,500 a year after their annual business rates increased to £25,683 from about £22,000.Mr Vahedi, who has owned the restaurant for seven years, said they will have no choice but to cut jobs and that business rates threatened to ‘destroy’ the high street.He said: ‘It will be a big problem, the Government and the council are squeezing us from every angle.‘We can’t cut wages and we can’t put prices up or we will lose customers. So the only way we can get that extra money is to employ less staff and cut jobs.’The 52-year-old added: ‘It shows the Government are out of touch. They don’t seem to understand every penny counts, even a 1 per cent rise has a huge effect.’Mr Vahedi called on Mr Hammond to do more to protect small businesses in his constituency.‘We are looking at a future when there will not be a single independent business left in Weybridge,’ he warned.LAST NAIL IN THE COFFIN EVE Moreve, who owns a women’s fashion store, said soaring rates could be the ‘final nail in the coffin’ for independent shops in the town. The rateable value of Mrs Moreve’s shop, Ben Vestito, has increased from £11,250 to £15,750, taking it above the business rates threshold and meaning she will have to start paying annual rates of £5,831.‘It’s ridiculous,’ she said. ‘High streets everywhere are dying as it is and for many shops this will be the final nail in the coffin.‘I don’t think Philip Hammond has any interest in his local constituency. It seems like the Government want every small business to close.‘Everything they do is geared towards helping big businesses. It’s just wrong. It doesn’t make any sense.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/01/4DF70E2900000578-5923747-image-a-2_1530837574775.jpg","title":"Footie Alfresco Englands crunch World Cup match Saturday","story":"    Is it a television or piece of art? - £14,995  Even the kids can\u0027t break this monster - £9,600 DuraScreen 65in Outdoor TV, £9,600, proofvision.co.ukBEST FOR: Overexcited crowds.WEIGHT: 85kg.WHAT: With screens five times brighter than those of boring old indoor tellies, these sturdy screens are suitable for viewing on the brightest of days, with added anti-reflection technology so you don’ t need to watch the neighbours cat stalking birds in the background of the World Cup action. They can withstand extreme heat and cold (the latter usually being more appropriate in UK climes).

If they can\u0027t afford to, though, or they drive a company car, then it starts to become a problem for them.\u0027I think a lot of men feel emasculated by a woman in a powerful position, whether that\u0027s in the boardroom or behind the wheel of a car.\u0027I don\u0027t rise to the comments I get when I\u0027m out driving. I generally reply with a witty putdown to make it clear I\u0027m not just a WAG in a shiny car with no clue how to drive it.\u0027          Company boss Maya Hartge is used to attracting attention when she\u0027s driving her Porsche 981 Spyder convertibleWhile the idea that a man might find it hard to cope with a woman driving a fancy car may sound dated, according to John Groeger, Professor of Psychology at Nottingham Trent University, who has a particular interest in motoring, what Maya experiences is a common reaction.Even in 2018, some men find it hard to cope with the idea that many women are now big earners — and savers — and can splash out on whatever car takes their fancy.\u0027One of the things we\u0027ve noticed in our research is that people will get angry and behave aggressively towards drivers they believe are of a lower status than themselves,\u0027 says Professor Groeger.\u0027Sexism is still rife in all areas of life — and there\u0027s plenty of it lurking in the traffic system, too. We know from experimental studies that others make assumptions about our wealth, status, personality or competence based on the vehicle we drive.\u0027We carried out one experiment using two identical white vans, one of them bearing the livery of an emergency services vehicle. Other drivers drove with far more care and respect around the latter than when it was an unmarked white van.\u0027We also compared reactions to vehicles with and without L-plates. We are quicker to blame, and act aggressively, towards people we feel are lower status — those whose cars carry L-plates, for example. We forgive them less easily, yet are quite prepared to exonerate people we feel are more like ourselves.\u0027So we have a clash between the apparent status of the vehicle and the assumed characteristics of the people who drive them.\u0027According to statistics released in April this year by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), female car ownership is at a record high, and more women than ever are buying into the luxury car market.In recent years, Porsche alone has doubled its sales of vehicles to women. Meanwhile, convertibles are now most likely to be bought by women in their 50s, with sales to this demographic quadrupling in just 15 years.          Zipping around in her Porsche Boxter convertible, Ingrid Lewis (pictured)frequently finds herself up against men keen to prove they are kings of the road.Maya bought her Porsche two years ago as a limited edition, meaning it\u0027s a collectors\u0027 item unlikely to depreciate in value.Her first car was rather different, though.\u0027It was a Fiat Punto HLX 16 valve which cost just over £13,000 when I was 18,\u0027 she recalls. \u0027I worked like a dog, six days a week for a year, in my IT technical support job to save up for it. My friends were out spending their money on having fun and holidaying in Ibiza, but my heart was set on that car.\u0027By the time she was 24 she had her own successful business and had saved enough money to splash out on her first \u0027supercar\u0027 — an Aston Martin DBS coupé that cost around £180,000 and which she still owns.\u0027I buy high performance cars because I love driving them, especially on tracks in the UK and abroad,\u0027 says Maya, who says she inherited her love of fast cars from her father, a former racing driver. She puts her collection of cars to good use by charging for rides in them at events in aid of The Children\u0027s Trust.\u0027I do think it\u0027s a shame that men tar all women with the old stereotype of us not being able to drive or park. When I take my cars on track days, I can see that men there think they\u0027re going to be better drivers than me. I just keep quiet and let my driving prove how wrong they are.\u0027While Maya aims to respond to putdowns with wit and charm, men who take on events director Henrietta Sauleek are less amused when she\u0027s at the wheel of her bright blue £70,000 Audi RS4, which can go from 0-60mph in 4.1 seconds.\u0027On one occasion, in a car park, a man aged about 60 drove slowly past me as I got out of my car. He wound down the window on his family saloon and said to me: \u0027That car is not for a woman.\u0027 What I was thinking is unprintable, but I didn\u0027t give him the satisfaction of a reply.\u0027I\u0027ve had men of all ages cut me up, or they try to stop me joining a lane of traffic if two lanes merge into one. A lot of them are tradesmen in their 30s, driving vans. I doubt they\u0027d do it to my husband if he was driving my car.\u0027Henrietta, 33, who lives in Basingstoke with her husband, a company director and their children, aged four and one, adds: \u0027I\u0027ve had a passion for cars since passing my test at the age of 19, but I\u0027ve never had hassle from men until I got the RS4 a year ago.\u0027I started to think that perhaps it was all in my own head, until last month when the car went into the garage for general maintenance.\u0027She was given a standard Audi A5 saloon as a courtesy car for a couple of weeks while the work was being done.\u0027Suddenly, I was anonymous and invisible on the roads again and didn\u0027t get any aggravation from other drivers,\u0027 she says. \u0027It cemented the fact that I really had been getting derogatory comments from men because I was driving a sports car. I can only assume it\u0027s because they are jealous.\u0027Since getting her RS4 back three weeks ago, she\u0027s again having to put up with sexist assumptions.\u0027We were out as a family a few days ago and were just getting out of the car when a guy walking past said to my husband: \u0027Nice car, mate!\u0027 assuming that it must be his,\u0027 says Henrietta. In fact, her husband drives a rather less flashy VW Golf, albeit top of the range, and says he never gets any trouble at the wheel of either car.It was after spotting a woman at the wheel of a \u0027stunning Porsche\u0027 in a traffic jam 12 years ago that Henrietta vowed to save hard to one day own a sports car herself.\u0027I chose the RS4 purely for me — not to show off but because it\u0027s a stunning car,\u0027 she says. \u0027I\u0027ve worked really hard, we don\u0027t spend much on our social life, and I really appreciate cars.\u0027It\u0027s a fun and empowering car. I love the adrenaline rush I get when I accelerate and the engine roars, but clearly it aggravates certain men. I\u0027ve never experienced any animosity from other women.\u0027 Professor Groeger explains that this sort of reaction is indicative of the human tendency endlessly to compare ourselves to others. It also reveals that many men still see themselves as higher up the social pecking order than women.\u0027Sometimes, when we come off badly, we\u0027re not that upset by it, for example if the other person is a talented sports person driving a great car,\u0027 he says. \u0027But in other cases we feel resentful if we assume that a person has had success in a way that we haven\u0027t, or that we feel is underserved.\u0027So, if a man is well educated, has worked hard and done quite well for himself but sees a woman driving a car he could only dream of being able to afford, he might feel irritated by that, though it\u0027s obviously sexist.\u0027 Zipping around in her Porsche Boxter convertible, Ingrid Lewis frequently finds herself up against men keen to prove they are kings of the road.\u0027Men sit at traffic lights and look at me while revving their engines in anticipation of the lights changing to green, but I tend to be a bit naughty and deliberately leave them standing,\u0027 says Ingrid, who\u0027s now retired from the company she owned and lives with her partner Richard, 62, in Hertfordshire.\u0027They can\u0027t resist overtaking me. If I\u0027m doing 80mph, they want to do 90mph. They glare at me and I can see they\u0027re thinking: \u0027How dare you be in a car like that?\u0027A youthful 70, Ingrid bought her five-year-old Boxter earlier this year (they cost over £40,000 new). Unlike Maya and Henrietta, she says she also encounters aggression from women drivers — and it annoys her because she feels it\u0027s \u0027not sisterly\u0027.\u0027Last week, I was on the motorway in a variable speed area and there was a woman right behind me trying to edge me out of the way so she could get past. Others try to cut me up.\u0027Ingrid\u0027s love affair with sporty cars began when she was 20 and her father bought her a coveted Austin-Healey Sprite.With the roof down on her Boxter, she often attracts admiring glances from men. \u0027Men seem to think me driving a car like this gives them a licence to flirt with me, and even young guys smile at me,\u0027 she says. \u0027I guess those sort of glances are flattering.\u0027And I do see why some men feel they have to compete with me when they see me in the Porsche. I think it stems from cars having been a traditionally macho item.\u0027But they\u0027re just going to have to get used to more women, in better cars, overtaking them in the fast lane.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/05/16/4DF3D93400000578-0-image-a-130_1530805112329.jpg","title":"Families book holiday flights phone face 20 penalty","story":"    EasyJet said customers are warned at the start of the call the can save money booking onlineConsumer experts at Which? discovered that a telephone booking with Ryanair or Tui, which was formerly known as Thomson, carries a £20 fee on top of the same flights when booked online.Budget airline EasyJet adds an extra £15 for a telephone booking and British Airways charges a fee of £10.The charges apply to all flights, regardless of destination and whether a customer makes the booking by speaking to an operator or using the airline’s website.Jet2 was the only airline in the investigation that did not charge their customers extra for booking via the phone.Flash floods sweep through town centre as storms end day so...TOM UTLEY: I couldn’t bear to live to 125... so why do I...Share this articleThe editor of Which? Travel, Rory Boland, said: ‘Not all customers are comfortable booking online, and they should not be penalised for booking over the phone. Airlines that are charging customers more must be clear and transparent about these additional fees.’Both BA and Tui said the charge represented the extra administration and staff costs involved in offering telephone bookings, while Ryanair said fewer than 0.5 per cent of its customers book over the phone.Easyjet said: ‘We encourage passengers to book online. Those using our telephone service are informed of the online discount at the beginning of the call’.It also said that passengers needing special assistance can still receive the online price by phone. The mark-up comes on top of other charges applied by airlines such as passengers being be charged up to £16 to pick their seat. People who choose to put a suitcase in the hold can pay up to £38 for something under 20kg, while going over the weight allowance by the equivalent of a bag of sugar can trigger a £12 charge.          Ryanair said fewer than 0.5 per cent of their customers book over the telephoneAt least one airline now even charges customers a fee of £1.75 each way to take hand luggage into the cabin.A separate survey on airline fees by holiday currency experts FairFX found flight costs can soar once all the add-ons are taken into account.A spokesman said: ‘While many airlines will assign you a seat for free for your journey, if you are travelling with family, young children, friends or a partner, the only way to guarantee you will be sat next to each other is to pay the additional fee to reserve a seat.’FairFX said with each airline imposing its own costs and rules on putting luggage into the hold, it has become both confusing and expensive. For example, Ryanair, Tui and Thomas Cook have a 20kg limit per bag, but the fees vary from £23 to £38. BA, EasyJet and Flybe have a higher 23kg limit and the fees range from £20 to £31. The limit at Jet2 is 22kg and there is a charge of £22.Most short-haul travellers have switched to taking only hand luggage to avoid these fees, but even this is no longer guaranteed to be free. Last summer Jet2 introduced ‘guaranteed cabin luggage’, charging passengers £1.75 each if they want to guarantee their hand luggage does not end up in the hold.FairFX chief Ian Strafford-Taylor said booking holidays has become a ‘financial minefield for families’ and warned them to be aware of the different add-ons, which could soon see the cost of their holidays ‘rocket’. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/01/4DF70E2900000578-5923747-image-a-2_1530837574775.jpg","title":"Footie Alfresco Englands crunch World Cup match Saturday","story":"    Is it a television or piece of art? - £14,995  Even the kids can\u0027t break this monster - £9,600 DuraScreen 65in Outdoor TV, £9,600, proofvision.co.ukBEST FOR: Overexcited crowds.WEIGHT: 85kg.WHAT: With screens five times brighter than those of boring old indoor tellies, these sturdy screens are suitable for viewing on the brightest of days, with added anti-reflection technology so you don’ t need to watch the neighbours cat stalking birds in the background of the World Cup action. They can withstand extreme heat and cold (the latter usually being more appropriate in UK climes).

This is how the great female 17th-century painter Artemisia Gentileschi portrays herself in a sensational, newly uncovered masterpiece that has just been bought by the National Gallery for £3.6m – a record for her work.Self-Portrait as Saint Catherine of Alexandria is a stunning collision of art and reality that sends a raw and intimate message straight from the 1600s to us. Her eyes look away, as if thinking of a painful memory, yet there is a calm in her monumental pose. She’s got the strong, muscular arms Artemisia always gave the women in her paintings and as she ponders the past, the fingers of her left hand rest on a shattered wooden wheel with vicious metal spikes embedded in its rim. Just a few years before she painted this self-portrait, those fingers were deliberately crushed in a courtroom in Rome, when an 18-year-old Gentileschi was publicly subjected to a thumbscrew-like torture called the sibille. Cords were twisted round her fingers then pulled tight, supposedly to ensure her evidence at the trial of the man who raped her was honest.When I saw the painting in the National Gallery’s skylit conservation workshop earlier this week, the atmosphere was intense. I was the first person from outside the gallery, since it acquired the work, to encounter the spellbinding record of her pain and courage. Just weeks ago, I had written in the  about why the National Gallery urgently needs an example of this great artist’s work, so they had invited me to “come and see her”.There’s something very special about seeing a great work of art on an easel, unframed, still with patches of surface dirt and the odd minor abrasion that will be carefully fixed before it goes on public view next year.  The painting was discovered in 2017. For centuries it had been owned by a French family, its authorship forgotten, but last December it was auctioned in Paris and bought by a London dealer. Letizia Treves, the National Gallery’s curator of baroque art, knew the museum had to have it. This is a historic moment for the gallery. Only a tiny proportion of the art it displays is by female artists. Gentileschi’s painting has just become the 20th work by a woman to enter its collection of more than 2,300 European paintings created between the middle ages and the era of Cézanne.As we contemplate Gentileschi’s gaze in the hidden studio, it is obvious I am not the only one who finds this an emotional moment. Treves points out the palm that Gentileschi is holding in her right hand, the symbol of her victory through martyrdom. But does this palm, wonders Treves, look like a paint brush? If so, it adds yet another autobiographical layer. They tried to break her on the wheel, but she survived to become a painter.Larry Keith, the National Gallery’s head of conservation, who is going to restore the painting over the next six to nine months before it goes on show in 2019, points to a small patch he has already cleaned. There’s a lot of deep, subtle shadow there, he explains, that will give the painting a powerful “sculptural” quality once the remains of bad restorations and varnishes are removed.Gentileschi was born in Rome in 1593, the daughter of the painter Orazio Gentileschi. Having an artist for a father was about the only way women could get access to the training expected of artists in Renaissance and baroque Europe. Artemisia grew up in the heart of a thrilling and radical artistic subculture. Her father was a close friend of the hard-living, hard-painting Caravaggio, whose sensual, stark art blew apart convention at the end of the 1500s. As a child, Artemisia must have met Caravaggio many times. Her paintings – including this one – make plain her devotion to his art.Treves looks forward to seeing this painting hanging next to Caravaggio’s masterpieces in a few months time. It shares his raw passion for life. I see it as a dialogue with his Saint Catherine in Madrid’s Thyssen Collection. In both, there is a still, contemplative mood. Yet when you look at the sword Caravaggio’s model holds, or the spikes next to Gentileschi’s fingers, the threat of violence hangs there like a bad memory.Gentileschi’s access to training as a painter came at a terrible price. Agostino Tassi, the painter friend her father hired as an art teacher, made ever-more menacing advances that culminated in rape. As the father of a “dishonoured” 18- year-old daughter, Orazio brought charges. The resulting trial was a cause célèbre as witness after witness attested to Tassi’s bad character – it seemed he had previously murdered his wife. The facts of his attack on Gentileschi were clearly established, not least by her own eloquent account, where she told how she nearly stabbed him to death. Yet Tassi walked away because the Pope, for whom he was painting frescoes, protected him. It was Gentileschi’s name that was tarnished.Gentileschi poses with the wheel, adopting the iconography of Catherine of Alexandria that had been long established by artists like Raphael (whose version is also in the National Gallery). The wheel is a symbol of suffering overcome, a reminder of violence endured. For us it looks like a direct allusion to her ordeal of rape, torture and humiliation. It would have had that meaning for its first audience, too. The 1612 trial made Gentileschi notorious. She painted this testimony in Florence, where she rebuilt her life and career under the patronage of the Grand Duke of Tuscany. Her gory painting Judith Slaying Holofernes, which can still be seen in Florence’s Uffizi Gallery, seems to fantasise revenge in its gruesome vision of a bearded man who has just woken to find one muscular woman pinioning him on his blood-spattered bed while another is halfway through hacking his head off.No one in Gentileschi’s circles in around 1616 could be unaware of her widely publicised story. Self-Portrait as Saint Catherine is perhaps her most explicitly autobiographical work. Her famous Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting, in the Royal Collection, depicts her from the side as she energetically goes to work. In the former she looks out, and we are drawn deep into her sensitive face.Artemisia is worth 10 average Old Masters. The combination of her brutalised early life and Caravaggio’s lesson that art and life are the same thing drove her to paint from a previously obscured female perspective. When she painted Judith killing Holofernes or the creepy elders spying on Susanna, she brought a personal point of view to these biblical themes. In her hands, they become studies of gender and power. She put her experience of the violent and unquestioned misogyny of her age, which meant that an 18-year-old aspiring artist was considered fodder for a sexual predator, into art that was honoured and admired by fans from the Medici to England’s Charles I. In Self-Portrait as Saint Catherine of Alexandria she has truly survived. She stands by the broken wheel and defies its spikes. She proclaims her triumphant entry into a male-only profession.Four hundred years on, that triumph is finally complete. Her vision will blaze in the National Gallery next to works by her father Orazio and her creative godfather Caravaggio. This gallery may still have pitifully few paintings by women but it matters hugely that one of them is by this truly great artist. This is one of the most important purchases the National Gallery has ever made."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f150c5686980feed68aefe6eb2c6e4a10084688a/0_0_8688_5792/master/8688.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b50df58097aa010a14f94c43d95ee3ad 1400w","title":"agence myop photographers at the arles festival in pictures","story":"For the opening week of the Rencontres Internationale de la Photographie, Agence MYOP photographers occupy an abandoned school in the heart of the old city and present 18 exhibitions of new and unseen work"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2da56cde11daaa3d3ab31eb06c10697a9c9d0e2c/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4076d10e474063e688ef04756f002732","title":"worst epa administrator scott pruitt","story":"The notorious climate denier finally resigned amid scandal. Don’t trust Trump to replace him with someone who actually cares about the environmentScott Pruitt has been cruelly misunderstood. Now that he has quit as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, it’s time to set the record straight. You see, he wasn’t just protecting the environment. He was protecting our president’s soul.“My desire in service to you has always been to bless you as you make important decisions for the American people,” Pruitt wrote to Trump as he shuffled off this mortal coil of government. “I believe you are serving as President today because of God’s providence. I believe that same providence brought me into your service.”You can believe in the science of climate change if you like. Scott Pruitt believes he is a saint, which you can clearly see from his many martyrdoms.For starters, he wasn’t asking his security detail to drive around looking for Ritz-Carlton moisturizing lotion for the sake of his complexion. People outside the EPA have no idea just how much rising temperatures can dry out a cabinet official’s skin. Think of it more like a federal exploration of how climate change affects the epidermis of the executive branch.Speaking of hotels, what kind of malice does it take to suggest that his desperate need for a used mattress from a Trump hotel was some kind of prima donna exercise in sucking up to his boss? You don’t need to have a Harvard medical degree to know that a good night’s sleep might be all that separates us from a newly negotiated Paris climate deal.Yes, of course people have gossiped endlessly about our tireless protector of the environment seeking out a meeting with the CEO of Chick-fil-A to scope out a job for his wife. But honestly, their chicken is rather delicious, even if their politics are not. Besides, how are you going to sell environmental protection to Trump Country without a huge supply of fried food?Some people have sounded shocked that Pruitt would want cut-price accommodation from a Washington lobbyist, or get his young staffers to pay his hotel bills without reimbursing them.But in a cabinet stacked full of super-wealthy Mnuchins and Cohns and Rosses – never mind the less-wealthy Trumps – Pruitt was just a poor boy making good. All those camels couldn’t pass through the eye of a needle like a man who spends lobbyist and staffer money.The founding myth of Trumpland is a tale about the superpowers of the Grand Wizard who survived the black magic of the FBI, the plague of fake news, the video horrors of Billy Bush, and of course the email sorceress known as Hillary. On his way to draining the swamp, our very stable genius wizard has slayed a few dragons called Comey and Truth, but also waved his wand over ugly frogs called Vladimir and Kim.For many moons, our wizard warded off evil by keeping Saint Scott inside the bubble of his benevolent spells. Just last month, he used his protective cloak to single Scott out for special treatment. “EPA is doing really, really well,” he said. “Somebody has to say that about you a little bit. You know that, Scott.”The wizard’s minions told us how he was protecting not just Scott’s front, but also his rear. “We’ve got your back,” was the message, curiously told to the evil media who delighted so much in punishing the protector of the environment. “Keep your head up,” the wizard said.So what does it say about the wizard’s strength now that Saint Scott is gone? If Trump magic can’t protect someone saving our president’s soul through the power of providence, then who is safe in Trumpland?First a Bannon, then a Scaramucci. You fire an Omarosa, then you lose all Hope. You reject a Rex but you can’t get your Gorka back in the bottle.It’s almost like there’s some invisible hand steering this bizarre sequence of hirings and firings, but we can’t figure out what the hand is trying to do. Or if it’s a left or right hand. Or if either hand knows they are connected through the same torso.It is somewhat easier to discern a pattern in Trump’s attitude towards the planet. The real scandal of the Pruitt era was not the personal corruption – not the millions spent on personal security or the thousands spent on a soundproof phone booth. No, the enduring scar left by Scott Pruitt is the political dismantling of the EPA itself. In year one, he rolled back regulations protecting clean water. He scrubbed away references to climate change and stopped collecting data on methane emissions. He blocked regulations designed to cut emissions from cars and power plants.And don’t expect the scar to disappear any time soon. EPA administrators come and go, but Trump cares for the environment the way a logger cares for the rainforest. Pruitt’s deputy is Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist who used to be chief of staff to James Inhofe, the Republican senator for Oklahoma, perhaps the loudest and dumbest climate denier on Capitol Hill. Wheeler is the kind of fossil fuel guy who enjoys The Onion’s parody of him as a pulsating black sludge. Making America Great Again does not extend to the land, water and air we know as America.Wheeler will now serve as the acting administrator, and likely successor to Saint Scott, in much the same way as a fox looks after a henhouse. As if by magic, the fossil fuel industry has taken over the agency that was supposed to protect our environment from the worst effects of that industry. But their new man is enough of a Washington insider to avoid the personal scandals that brought down his old boss.So farewell, Saint Scott. You were the Worst. EPA administrator. Ever.May you feast on Chick-fil-A in what’s left of the pastures that lobbyists have handed you. And may providence protect whatever survives your EPA."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/418427775559f9579df5710acc5c236981820b73/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8e385d125f68bc51ec401098fa4d407","title":"brexit tories jeremy corbyn","story":"The party has abandoned business and the union and now cares only about keeping Jeremy Corbyn out of powerOn the night of the Brexit referendum Michael Gove went to bed, full of red wine and smoked beef, before the results were in. He had campaigned to leave the European Union, but his main concern that night was that remain might win by anything up to 15 points. He slept soundly.He was woken the next morning as his wife, the journalist Sarah Vine, turned on the television to see the press gathered outside their house. According to Tim Shipman in All Out War, as he came out of the shower Vine greeted him with Michael Caine’s most famous quote from The Italian Job, after one of his fellow villains blasts a van to smithereens: “You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off.”The purpose of the Brexit referendum had precious little to do with the EU it was simply the latest in a litany of efforts to quell the decades-long psychodrama within the Conservative party.Not only did it achieve the opposite – deepening and exacerbating the rancour within the party – it spread the infection to the country as a whole. For the past two years our government has been paralysed by an internal party feud that has held the nation’s future hostage.“There are two kinds of European nations,” the Danish finance minister, Kristian Jensen, said last year. “There are small nations and there are countries that have not yet realised they are small nations.” Witnessing that realisation dawn on this government has been painful to watch anticipating the consequences for generations to come has been excruciating.So on Friday at Chequers the government will do what it has been doing for the past two years: spend an inordinate amount of time negotiating with itself before producing a “solution” that is unworkable, only to take it to Brussels and discover it is also unacceptable. The problem is not just that they don’t have a rabbit they don’t even have a hat.Through a series of self-inflicted wounds the Conservative party has reduced itself to this: hovering between delusional and deranged, bluster and buffoonery. Insisting on concessions that have not been offered suggesting solutions that have already been rejected showing up to negotiations with nothing to offer refusing to concede anything, only then to capitulate to everything.For Conservatives this crisis is no longer just about Europe. Brexit has thrown into question their raison d’etre as a party.It’s not difficult to see why. After the British chief executive of the German-owned Siemens, Jürgen Maier, asked for clarity on the deal Britain was looking for – citing Airbus and other companies’ concerns – the nation’s chief diplomat, foreign secretary Boris Johnson, responded, “Fuck\u0026nbspbusiness”.“There are more anti-business Conservatives in the party than at any time in recent history,” the president of the Confederation of British Industry told the Financial Times recently.It used to be the party of the union. But even as its minority government clings to power, thanks to the hardline Democratic Unionist party, Brexit presents perhaps the greatest challenge to the integrity of the United Kingdom for some time. In Scotland the brief surge for independence following the Brexit referendum has waned for now. But for a range of reasons Ireland is different.Johnson finds the apparently irreconcilable concerns in Ireland – about the possibility of a reintroduction of a hard border between north and south, and Unionist worries about retaining the same status as the rest of Britain – “millennium bug stuff”.During a closed-door speech to members of Conservative Way Forward at the Institute of Directors in London last month, he said: “It’s so small and there are so few firms that actually use that border regularly, it’s just beyond belief that we’re allowing the tail to wag the dog in this way … We’re allowing the whole of our agenda to be dictated by this folly.”The issue is not that the Conservatives no longer believe in these things it is that they no longer seem to believe in anything apart from their capacity to remain in power. This alone would not be such a heinous goal if it were accompanied by any real ambition about what to do with the power they have. But they have none. Their domestic agenda is dwarfed by Brexit and they do not have a Brexit agenda they can agree on.So the government limps from crisis to crisis, summit to summit, dragging the country towards a clifftop of unknown altitude, without plan or purpose. Its cabinet is not a balance of talents and expertise but of leave and remain – the sole prism through which all disagreements are viewed. Riven at the highest levels, rudderless at every turn, leaderless in all but name, at the mercy of small numbers, they keep going.The only thing keeping the whole enterprise together at this point is the likelihood that a coup would prompt an election that could make Jeremy Corbyn the prime minister. They fear he will wreck the country – and refuse to give him the pleasure when they are doing such a good job on that front themselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f1f11bb1e77b90a17b3caf4396e1f601e6c29f8/0_275_4754_2853/master/4754.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=736a669fdc775e81da7a3a6b386779fc","title":"jeremy corbyn buses labour","story":"Despite scorn from the Westminster bubble, the Labour leader was right to highlight Britain’s rip-off fares and slashed services this weekA sneer can often reveal far more about the sneerer than the object of their derision. This week, the leader of the opposition used the platform of prime minister’s questions to highlight the long-standing crisis of Britain’s bus services. What with there being 4.65bn bus journeys a year – two and half times more than train journeys – you might think this would be considered quite important. Instead, Tory MPs howled with contempt, bellowing “Taxi!” The commentariat followed in quick step. “A question about buses. That will win it!” spluttered the Sun. “Corbyn on buses. Jesus wept,” eyerolled the Times’s sketch writer. “Is it PMQs or transport questions?” cackled ITV’s political correspondent. “No 10 will not be able to believe their luck,” mocked the Spectator’s political editor.These responses are as unsurprising as they are revealing. If you live in London, where politicians and media commentators spend most of their time, you are spoilt for transport choices – trains, an extensive underground network and a regular bus service. That’s because London resisted Thatcher’s deregulation of buses in 1986. Outside the capital, buses are often a rip-off, unreliable and are being slashed away – the number of trips has halved.If you’ve never lived outside London, and if you’ve always had a car, it’s difficult to understand how dire bus services undermine your standard of living: from being able to get to work, meet friends in the pub, get the weekly shop or take the kids on a day out.Buses may be a joke in the Westminster bubble, but for those outside the capital on modest or low incomes this is a basic bread-and-butter issue that is not being addressed or discussed. We are constantly told that Corbynism is a London metropolitan phenomenon – normally, bizarrely, by metropolitan Londoners in the media – and yet when he raises an issue affecting millions outside the capital, it’s treated as an obscure ersion. Apparently we are supposed to allow Brexit to suck the oxygen out of everything, that everything else must fester by the roadside until it’s all sorted (presumably sometime in the mid-24th century).A more self-aware media response would be: hang on, why do we fail to report this national crisis? It is an obvious point that a profession so dominated by the privileged is going to struggle to understand issues that do not resonate with their lived experiences. Like bus travel outside London. And when such issues are raised, rather than doing their job, they pour scorn at something they do not deem relevant. Until that changes – until we have a national media that is representative of region, class, gender, sexuality, race and religion – then this critical institution will remain out of touch on issues that concern millions of people. The media thought buses were indicative of Corbyn’s own failures. Instead, they merely exposed their own."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05c32c19fb1e9d90d2ed87e1a143eb988d242623/195_0_5467_3282/master/5467.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e944e0fb5b5669d9620d102dcb985a26 1240w","title":"springsummer 2019 the key menswear trends","story":"From short shorts to face masks, handbags to Day-Glo hues, Helen Seamons picks out the key trends to watch out for next year from the springsummer 2019 menswear showsFrom short shorts to face masks, handbags to Day-Glo hues, Helen Seamons picks out the key trends to watch out for next year from the springsummer 2019 menswear showsIt’s not often a menswear season steals as many headlines as the recent run of springsummer 2019 shows, but pilfer they did. Between Virgil Abloh and Kim Jones’s high-profile respective debuts at Louis Vuitton and Dior Men, David Beckham’s first season as ambassadorial president of the British Fashion Council (and a flashbulb-popping appearance at the Kent \u0026amp Curwen presentation alongside wife Victoria), Maison Margiela’s first menswear couture show and Calvin Klein creative director Raf Simons returning to Paris to show his eponymous label, the season became an unrelenting and reinvigorating expression of ideas. Here are the eight main trends to take away. Day-Glo dreams. Neon popped up on sports tops, holsters and body warmers at Louis Vuitton, on sweatshirts at MSGM, on shirts at Xander Chou, on padded bomber jackets at Charles Jeffrey Loverboy and on suiting at Acne and Versace. The upshot? There’s a flavour for every raver.Momentum had been building throughout New York, London, Florence and Milan, but it was one of the final shows in Paris that cemented handbags as a bona fide trend for the boys next year. Newly installed artistic director of Dior Men, Kim Jones, reimagined the iconic women’s Saddle bag for the first time for men in backpacks, cross-body and belt-bags (cue cult status).Elsewhere, Jones’ successor back at Louis Vuitton, Virgil Abloh, was all about the handhelds his red plastic Keepall bags are pegged to be a big hit. Prada and Versace also got the memo creating shoulder and cross-body styles, while clutch bags at Dunhill, lunch boxes at Kenzo and bucket bags courtesy of Lanvin. Safe to say it’s all about the bag.The 90s music scene had a dominating presence at the shows. Britpop offspring could be found on the front row and the catwalk, the Stone Roses were the inspiration for Kent \u0026amp Curwen’s London presentation and an item distinctively synonymous with the era was out in force. Yes, the bucket hat is back and it’s come a long way from Kangol. Valentino, Fendi, Jacquemus, Band of Outsiders and (naturally) Kent \u0026amp Curwen put it back on their agendas. It came printed and textured, patchworked and plain and brimming with with its inherent “care, don’t care” vibes. The new look suit has been elevated for SS19 taking references from the 80s and incorporating couture craft. John Galliano at Maison Margiela unveiled his first artisanal collection in Paris and presented tailoring – like his womenswear – cut on the bias. Kim Jones at Dior, meanwhile, layered organza over embroidered wool to create a 3D effect.Double-breasted variations came oversized and relaxed, styled with a streetwear twist at Dries van Noten, wide-legged trousers and trainers at Paul Smith and with nothing underneath at Giorgio Armani and Ermenegildo Zegna. Shades, meanwhile, ranged from industrial grey to sherbet shades of violet, sky blue and rose-petal pink. At Cottweiler and Missoni they were made of leather at Off-white, they were elasticated and sporty at Fendi, they were given the double-F treatment at Hermés they were crisp and precision cut and at Prada there were no fewer than 23 pairs. Yes, short shorts are firmly on the sartorial agenda for SS19 – all that remains is to pick a tribe. Face masks have been cropping up in menswear periodically this past year, to compelling and dramatic effect. Their purpose varies. At Vetements’ highly politicised off-schedule show, street-cast Georgian models wore guerilla-style face masks with combat-wear in a show to reference Georgia’s war-torn past. At Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana, they were a little more glam with surgical masks covered with fine crystals. At Alyx, Matthew Williams opted for a sportier take, combining anti-pollution masks in a collaboration with Nike.Rick Owens took things one brilliant step further and sent his models out wearing sheer, fringed versions as plumes of primary-coloured sulphur billowed around the set (showgoers were gratefully given them too). A nod to climate change or simply dramatic staging? Perhaps both.Think utility pockets and think fishermen, boy scouts and law enforcers? Tick, tick, tick. The number of pocketed gilets, jackets and harnesses confirmed that next season, its all about safe-keeping. Virgil Abloh at Louis Vuitton led the charge with a multi-compartmentalised body warmer Junya Watanabe and Samuel Ross at A Cold Wall* opted for a functional seatbelt-style numbers while Acne dotted a zipped compartment on sweaters. A word to the wise: just remember what you put where.There’s no stopping the rise and rise of the trench coat. After dominating the womenswear collections, it has set menswear in its sights for SS19. It stole the show at Alexander McQueen, coming in cropped, two-tone and spliced sleeve iterations, while Neil Barrett got eclectic with an abstract oversized leaf print. Berthold and Ami kept it classic, confirming its perennial appeal. Time to belt up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29bc1ddad6c73e7d788c4963f7076f9dc873c38f/0_0_4712_2828/master/4712.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2c1049b8c18be2315baa4c2caca4f31","title":"frederick wiseman i am not a fly on the wall i am at least 2 per cent conscious","story":"From his debut film about the ‘criminally insane’ to his latest on New York’s public library, the award-winning octogenarian is as committed to fighting injustice as ever – especially in the era of TrumpIt’s not easy to prise Frederick Wiseman away from his work. The 88-year-old film-maker is currently holed up in Paris putting the finishing touches to his latest documentary. So our meeting is scheduled for 8.30am on the pavement outside the converted 17th-century convent where he lives in a rented studio for the 10 or so months it takes to edit each film.At 8.30am exactly, the convent gate creaks open and he strides out into the summer sunshine. Over a 50-year career, Wiseman has made 43 films and shows no signs of slowing up. His most recent is a magnificent 197-minute portrait of an institution that is half a world away, in location and tempo, from the French capital.That institution is the New York Public Library and, as the film richly demonstrates, it is part of the central nervous system of the city that never sleeps: “I have a knack of picking places that are open all the time,” he deadpans, adding that, in the 12 weeks it took to shoot, he managed to take a couple of Sundays off, “but you get into a rhythm and you don’t want to miss anything”.From his first solo film, Titicut Follies, which shone a light on the treatment of the “criminally insane” in the late 60s, he has specialised in closeups of social and cultural locales, whether that involves a service – such as 1975’s Welfare, about the New York benefits system – a neighbourhood, such as 2015’s In Jackson Heights, a zoo or a ballet company. His signature style in every case is to present scenes from everyday life with no identifying captions, interviews or explanatory voiceover.As a place historically devoted to the introverted practice of reading, a library might not seem to be his most appealing subject – and at the time he decided to make the film, Wiseman admits he hadn’t set foot inside one for 45 years. “I just thought, without any knowledge whatsoever, that it would be interesting. I thought you went to a library to borrow a book. I had no idea of the vast variety of activities they are involved in.”Ex Libris: The New York Public Library was shaped from 150 hours of footage (100 hours fewer than that of 2013’s At Berkeley, about life at one of the US’s great universities, “but there are 35,000 students at Berkeley and academics like to talk”). For every instantly recognisable Elvis Costello or Patti Smith using the library, the film follows dozens of administrators, librarians, board members and ordinary users as they go about their business, not only in the main library, with its landmark marble lions, Patience and Fortitude, but in more than a dozen of its 92 humbler branches. The relentlessness of life in New York and its libraries is reflected in the film’s beady-eyed and finely choreographed juxtapositions: between a piano recital and a job fair, at which the unemployed are exhorted to join border control or the fire-service, a nocturnal street scene flashes in the lights of a 24-hour pawn shop. While the technique is uncompromising, some of the observations are laugh-aloud funny – as when a telephone operator valiantly attempts to explain that unicorns don’t exist, or a picture librarian demonstrates a system of themed archiving with images of “dogs in action”. “Everything that I find is coincidental, but there’s nothing coincidental about the final film,” explains Wiseman, who is not only the director and editor, but the sound recordist and producer for Zipporah Films, which he set up in 1970 and named after his wife, a law professor.“I come across this thing as a matter of chance, and maybe occasionally good judgment. I take the risk of shooting it because I think it might be interesting – then my job as an editor is to decide what it is saying, whether I want to use it, in what form, and where I’m going to place it.”Running through Ex Libris, as in much of his work, are themes of social and economic injustice. While the glamorous main building hosts celebrity speakers, African-American regulars at a Harlem branch grumble about the indignities of their daily lives, such as being confronted with textbooks that misrepresent their racial history.As a Jewish American who grew up with early and mid-20th century antisemitism, Wiseman is attuned to what he calls “micro-racism”. His father arrived from Ukraine at the age of five while his mother was the only one of nine siblings who wasn’t born in Poland. The family lived in a “middle-class Jewish ghetto” in Boston. “I grew up listening to Hitler on the radio. When I was four years old, a child asked me why I had killed Christ.”After graduating from university, where Jews were still excluded from the fraternity system, he enrolled at Yale Law School, more to avoid being drafted to fight in Korea than due to any ambition to tread in the footsteps of his attorney father. After a couple of years of peaceful national service, he escaped to Paris, where he amused himself shooting 8mm films of street life, before slinking back home when his money ran out. He landed a job at Boston University’s Institute of Law and Medicine.His attempts to counter the boredom of “badly written books on case law” led to two career breakthroughs: a programme of student field trips took him to the Bridgewater state hospital, which would become the subject of his debut film. And splashing out $500 on the rights to a novel about Harlem gang wars, earning his first producer credit in an adaptation of Warren Miller’s The Cool World. “That demystified the process of film-making for me,” he says.By a stroke of good fortune, his career change coincided with technical innovations that made it possible to film synchronous sound on 16mm film without being tethered by a cable. “What struck me was the fairly obvious idea that most subjects hadn’t been filmed because it hadn’t been technically possible before, so much of the world was still available.” By the time Titicut Follies was released in 1967, he was 37 – but, far from making his name, it plunged him into more than two decades of legal limbo after the Massachusetts authorities took offence and a supreme court judge ruled it “an indecent intrusion into the most private aspects of … unfortunate persons”. Shot in black and white, the film makes gruelling viewing, with strip-searches, force-feeding and the interrogation of a fresh-faced young paedophile about his sexual deviances.Wiseman refused to be discouraged and won his first Emmy for Law and Order (1969), with a further two for Hospital (1970). In retrospect, he is proud that none of his subjects complained, but is critical of the didacticism of his early editing. “In my view, my movies are more novelistic than journalistic and I don’t like to read a novel that tells me what I’m supposed to think.”Although he insists that “American life is my subject”, a strong theatrical bent was evident from the opening cabaret of Titicut Follies, and he has turned to Europe for several of his more arty projects. In France, he has made films of the Comédie-Française and the Ballet de l’Opéra National, “because there’s no American repertory company or ballet that has existed for 350 years”. He travelled to London to film 2014’s National Gallery after earlier attempts to hook up with New York’s politan Museum failed. His two films with the Comédie-Françaiseled to his acting debut, at the age of 77, as the husband of the fretful Winnie in his own stage production of Samuel Beckett’s Oh les beaux jours (Happy Days). He is due to make his TV acting debut this autumn in a three-part miniseries, Thanksgiving, by his friend, the French film critic turned director Nicolas Saada.But documentary film-making is his first and abiding love and he is due to finish editing his latest, about the small Indiana town of Monrovia. “It’s not work, it’s my passion – and it also passes the time better than anything else.” He is aware that time has paid a backhanded compliment to Ex Libris, which he finished editing two days after the election of Donald Trump.“In a sense, Trump made it a political film because the values of the people who run it are completely antithetical to what he represents. He’s against science, against reason, against democracy, so the library takes on an even greater importance as a bulwark against his irrational fascist idiocy.” And the best thing about it? “It’s certainly going to outlast Trump.” With that happy thought, he heads off for the metro to start his working day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9eb5ee6bf1d4a9043d95e6f48ff96a916c3eccb0/142_21_892_535/master/892.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a69845720adc2dfd88a284cee1e351b","title":"ideal home review steve coogans celebrity chef cooks up a dud","story":"In this unfunny comedy, Coogan plays half of a gay couple thrown into disarray by the unexpected arrival of his grandsonIt always hurts to see a clever British comedy star forced to conform to a tin-eared Hollywood idea of what a posh Brit should sound like. Russell Brand went through it with the Arthur remake, and now Steve Coogan endures the same thing in this entirely disposable comedy about a super-gay celebrity foodie called Erasmus presenting a cookery show on American TV.He bickeringly lives in a lifestyle-magazine-type hacienda with his long-suffering partner and producer Paul – in which role Paul Rudd does his best. They are living the dream, kind of, until a tousle-haired kid turns up out of the blue. Bill (Jack Gore) turns out to be Erasmus’s grandson, via a rashly experimental heterosexual hookup ages ago, that Paul knew nothing about until now.The resulting grownup son is now in jail on drugs charges but he managed to get Bill away before the police showed up, with instructions to look up his granddad in Santa Fe. Yikes! Do you suppose these squabbling selfish gays are going to be furious at first, but then grow to love the kid, and then face a Kramer vs Kramer crisis with the authorities? Of course, Erasmus could quite plausibly have been Bill’s dad, not granddad, and that would have created a more prominent part for the boy’s mother. Disappointingly, there are no interesting roles for women in this film. The movie concludes with a rather solemn series of photos of real-life gay couples with their babies, running over the credits, just to show that this film’s heart is in the right place. And so it is, but this means the film is chary of the cynicism or satire that it initially appears to be serving up. There are simply no funny lines here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/568aaaff83aa6c531d989b2fe3f43f5bbcc9cb98/0_128_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce476f1af17f5df0871cd2615749f4ad","title":"cinnamon buns and coffee swedish fans in uk gear up for world cup clash","story":"‘It’s good being the underdog’ say expats as wave of optimism sweeps BritainSitting in the sunshine outside the Swedish church in Marylebone, central London, Birger Edström looks fairly relaxed about the prospect of his country’s football team facing England on Saturday.“When I saw we would be facing England I thought ‘yes!’,” he says with a laugh. “It would be harder to play Colombia. We have a very good chance to beat England once again. Yes! I think so!”In this piece of little Sweden, preparations are already under way for Saturday’s game, when the church hall will welcome 130 of London’s Swedish community. The walls are decked with enormous Swedish flags more flutter in beer glasses lined up on the stage where the big screen will go. Beers and coffee have been ordered cinnamon buns, of course, will be baked on the day.“Of course we are all excited,” says the church’s rector, Eric Muhl. “But I think the Swedish attitude is ‘wow this is happening’, and even if we lose we will still think we have done well. The England team have done very well, of course, but the Swedish team are not under the same pressure. We are the underdogs.”That kind of relaxed pragmatism is conspicuous by its absence in the UK, remarks Edström, who admits he is amused by the wave of optimism engulfing his recently-adopted home. “Honestly, I don’t think England have played very well so far,” he says. “They were lucky with the group and they won on penalties against Colombia, and when it is penalties anyone can win. But in this country England are always champions before they start playing. Let’s see afterwards who is the champion.”The match will be an exciting, but family-friendly affair in the main hall just off the Swedish church, which has stood on the same patch of land for 100 years. Sweden’s win against Switzerland on Monday attracted an interesting mix of expats, says Anja Holgersson, who works in the cafe. “There were the football lads in yellow and blue, but then we also had a knitting group of older women meeting in a separate room, and they came and joined in, too,” she says. “We had a lot of families and a play area for the children we had a lot of cinnamon buns and coffee and beers, of course. It was a lovely mix.” A recent arrival in the UK, she is amused by the “friendly abuse” Swedish expats are getting in their workplaces and friendship groups. “It will be very interesting on Sunday,” she says. “But it’s all good fun. I’ll be sad if it’s all over.While the reaction of English fans to Tuesday’s victory against Colombia has been compared to a desperate lover who starts planning a wedding after one decent date, Swedes have been more restrained, says Gunnar Ledwon.Asked what he thinks of his team’s chances, he is quietly confident. “I think England have better players in every position, but I think we are a better team together,” he says. The fact that Sweden’s best-known player, Zlatan Ibrahimović, is not at this World Cup has been unexpectedly positive, he adds. “We have no stars and that is a good thing, they play together as a whole group - both those on and off the pitch. So will the result come down to inidual quality or team spirit? It will be interesting to see.”With a last word of warning to over-exuberant England fans, he notes that despite the stardust, Sweden’s defence have proved very difficult to break down. “Just ask the Italians,” he says.

We should have some common sense: neither euphoria, nor the fear of losing. Keeping your head cool and knowing you have a good collective performance.”Everything made perfect sense. Tite’s calmness and knack for man-management have been revelatory in this World Cup and the two years before it he has instilled a sense of clarity, feathered with a little lightness, into this Brazil team and it was little surprise to hear he learned from the best. Bianchi was renowned, during his spells managing Vélez Sarsfield and Boca Juniors, for his leadership skills and a club director once put it best by lauding his ability to instruct players “to put the toilet in the bathroom and the oven in the kitchen”. It captures the Tite process precisely: everyone accountable everything in its correct spot.The impression, a little more than 24 hours before Brazil were due to kick off against Belgium, was of total authority. Tite has been the most impressive figure among the managers at this World Cup, exuding gravitas and making encounters with the media feel like exchanges of ideas and information rather than exercises in secrecy and caution. Plenty is asked of him and plenty is given: after the win over Mexico on Monday he provided a detailed exposition of his defensive strategy, explaining how a tightly oiled side marks sectors before ball or man here he deconstructed the goals from that game in detail and mused at length about the emotional energy required to take penalties. If the idea is to compress so much openness and candour into half an hour that nobody has the energy to demand more, it is a sound one.That last sentence was accompanied by a smile and a wink. Firmino did not get on the pitch in the Serbia game, hence Tite’s special attention, but scored two minutes after his introduction against Mexico. It adds to the sense Tite has mastered the impossible, managing Brazil’s competing forces and fostering a club-side mentality that, allied to the natural talent at his disposal, creates a formidable beast.Perhaps the definitive evidence is that he seems to have tamed Neymar. It says something that the forward has turned heads more through the economy of his performances than their effervescence Tite talked up his “sense of teamwork, the best virtue” and talked up his appetite for “participating collectively”, perhaps aware that heavy praise can sometimes find a way of self-fulfilling. His philosophy is broadly that a solid, rigorously organised defensive and midfield structure lays the groundwork for – “incentivises”, in his words – those higher up the pitch to work their magic. Everyone is buying into the plan those last two wins have been low-maintenance, relatively low-key and entirely comfortable.In what could have been a largely esoteric ersion, Tite was asked by a Middle East-based journalist to reflect on his spell managing Al-Ain, the Emirati club, for a season in 2007. Back then he was a decade and a half into his managerial career but he replied in typical detail that, given the freedom to test his preferred lines of play, he developed his football philosophy there. He was away from the smothering circus of Brazilian football – or so went the implication – and could perfect his defensive system, trialling two lines of four and working on cohesion. It was a year that influenced him profoundly but, given he had been rattling through clubs at a tremendous rate back home, could not have felt at the time like a petri dish for leading Brazil ever closer to a sixth World Cup.If Belgium are overcome then it will begin to look overwhelmingly likely that those hours outside the spotlight were well spent. “I stopped two weeks ago and told the team: ‘You must believe in the intense way of practising we have … so keep up the good work, we need a full team, mentally strong, and I can feel it,’” he said. “The biggest challenge of a World Cup is fortitude. The pressure is immense, extraordinary.”They are handling it so far. Bianchi once said: “Orders are orders and they have to be clear but you have to give them with tact.” On the pitch and away from it, Tite’s Brazil appear to have struck an equally agreeable balance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/542171846e65bc5d34f3ea603e81768789253b3c/2_0_3021_1814/master/3021.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e3476cb360d110703f7272e3205d8c7","title":"history france uruguay world cup","story":"Four of the countries’ eight meetings have ended goalless. But their clashes have seldom been boring and often pivotal. Reputations have been made. Or ruinedThe four stars on the jerseys worn by Luis Suárez and chums denote Uruguay’s pair of World Cup triumphs (1930 and 1950) and their back-to-back Olympic gold medals, the first of which was won in Paris in 1924. Uruguay had swept to victory in the previous year’s South American championship but this was their first trip outside their continent and little was known about them in Europe. But they seemed like nice chaps so a Yugoslavian player felt moved to apologise in advance for beating them in the first round. He was sorry, all right, when Uruguay won 7-0.La Celeste followed that up with a 3-0 victory over USA. Now Europeans fawned over their impeccable technique and slick passing – “it is stylistic perfection” declared La Gazzetta dello Sport – and the French public became so enamoured of one of their players, the elegant midfielder José Leandro Andrade, that local media nicknamed him the Black Marvel.Uruguay appreciated the hospitality in Paris – particularly by Parisiennes – to such an extent that they reputedly agreed between themselves to go easy on France in the quarter-final and settle for a single-goal win. That’s how things were shaping up until a point in the second half when, with Uruguay leading 2-1, Andrade fouled a Frenchman, after which he was jeered by the home crowd every time he touched the ball.Quelle erreur! Andrade, who had risen from poverty and been a carnival violinist, among other things, was a bon viveur off the pitch but a classy performer on it and had such a sense of decorum that he viewed celebrating goals as crude triumphalism. So being jeered incited him to teach the locals a thing or three. Sashaying through the home defence, he teed up a salvo of goals and inspired Uruguay to a 5-1 win. They then beat the Netherlands and Switzerland to take the gold medal. Four of members of the squad, including Andrade, won it again four years later and also lifted the inaugural World Cup in 1930.The countries renewed acquaintances in London’s White City stadium for a clash in a group that also included the World Cup hosts. Uruguay had opened their campaign by becoming the first team for 17 years to stop England from scoring at home, holding Alf Ramsey’s side to a 0-0 draw with a display of defensive fortitude that appalled and impressed the home crowd. “No doubt if I had to watch Uruguay in action every week I should soon be looking for a more interesting job,” wrote Douglas Saunders in the Daily . “That does not alter my view that they adopted the correct policy last night and employed it with admirable efficiency.”In their next game, against France, Uruguay had to go on the front foot after falling behind to a contentious early penalty, awarded for a foul committed outside the box. The spot-kick was converted by Héctor De Bourgoing, who, after much wrangling, had obtained permission from Fifa to play for Les Bleus after representing Argentina, where he was born to an aristocratic landowning family with French roots. But France did not stay ahead for long, falling behind to strikes by Pedro Rocha and Julio Cortés.“It was no more than justice that the Uruguayans drew level after 26 minutes and took the lead six minutes later,” wrote Albert Barham in the , who saw Les Bleus’ pallid display as evidence of a wider malaise. “Once proud France showed, perhaps, the decline that has overtaken their football at club level … they were again so disappointing as to be almost untrue.” France went on to lose 2-0 to England while Uruguay advanced to the quarter-finals, where their defensive rigour came undone in a 4-0 mullering by West Germany.The Artemio Franchi Trophy, named after the Uefa president killed in a car crash in 1983, was a forerunner of Fifa’s Confederations Cup, pitting, on two occasions, the champions of Europe against the kings of South America. France swaggered to the first intercontinental title with a 2-0 victory that suggested they were even better than when their “magic square” guided them to glory at Euro 84.France later reached the semi-finals in Mexico – and might have gone farther if Touré had not missed the tournament through a serious knee injury which triggered a descent into decadence and ruin. As for Uruguay, they went to the World Cup and kicked the legs off everyone they met, leading Ernie Walker of the Scottish Football Association to denounce them as “cheats and cowards … the scum of world football”.This time France, the reigning European champions, were the aggressors. Apparently a shock defeat by Senegal in their opening World Cup match turned hubris and frustration into something even more sinister, transforming Thierry Henry into a hatchetman. The striker, who went into the tournament as the Premier League’s top scorer, was sent off in the first half for lunging at Marcelo Romero’s ankle. Both sides bungled chances and, in the end, neither qualified from the group. France had travelled to Asia as favourites but returned without having even scored a goal. It was embarrassing. But not a disgrace. That would come eight years later.The atmosphere in the French camp stunk in the days before kick-off in the countries’ first match at the World Cup in South Africa. “I’m fed up with this collective inertia,” France’s manager, Raymond Domenech, wrote in his diary, in which he detailed a few of the rivalries, strops and grievances that players had with each other and with him and which prevented any proper training from getting done. “All I want is to tell them to piss off,” he added. “Let them sort their shit out for themselves.” It never got sorted by anyone. It accumulated until everyone got splattered.The match against Uruguay started badly for France – Sidney Govou slashing wide from six yards – and never got better. But the 0-0 draw turned out to be the high point of their tournament. After that came defeats by Mexico and South Africa the banishment of Nicolas Anelka following a row with Domenech a public fight between Patrice Evra and the team’s fitness coach, Robert Duverne a player mutiny and a global scandal that made Uruguay seem like fine upstanding fellows even while Luis Suárez was slapping a Ghana shot off his line to help his team reach the semi-final."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a513dc8fb88954592bce40885cd7a164b5786ff3/86_251_4416_2649/master/4416.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d7508d4905311cdae68d29ed7565928","title":"samara fans england sweden world cup 2018","story":"As recently as 1990 Samara was a closed city but the World Cup and a new stadium should help get its name in the international consciousnessSergei Leybgrad does not mind admitting that he is exhausted but when it comes to Samara and football, the reserves of energy run deep. He is standing in the basement that has become home to a lifetime’s work, a labour of love in which 17,000 artefacts present an astonishingly textured picture of a city’s relationship with the sport. For the umpteenth time in the past month he has spent an hour talking through the highlights but nobody is allowed to depart without undertaking an essential ritual.In the sixth and final chamber – “the magic room,” he calls it – stands a cylindrical supporting column hands are placed on it and then the incantation can start. Eyes now alight, Leybgrad takes the lead and soon the walls are reverberating. “Futbol v Samare bolshe chem futbol!” – “Football in Samara is more than football!”England supporters will be able to assess that pronouncement for themselves this weekend when they visit Samara, a strange and compelling place that has throbbed with energy during the World Cup and regards itself as a crucible of Russian football culture.As recently as 1990 this was a closed city, Kuybyshev, located appealingly on the bank of the Volga but inaccessible to foreigners through its critical importance to the Soviet space and aircraft industries. That sense of mystery lingers in some areas but the city is now more open than ever and the effects have been dizzying. “It’s a thrill,” Leybgrad says of the chance to show scores of visitors around his museum, an extraordinary Aladdin’s cave with few obvious analogues anywhere. “If I wasn’t satisfied I’d just go off and hide myself by now, flying away somewhere like a hunting bird. I feel dead on my feet. But we’ve wanted to have this World Cup for 100 years finally our dream has come true.”He is not exaggerating. One of Leybgrad’s favourite tales recounts how, in the early years of Fifa and when the idea of a World Cup presented a blank canvas, Samara was one of several cities to express an interest in hosting. The idea was that some form of tournament would take place in 1918 the first world war and Russian revolution rendered that impossible, though, and in the intervening century its relevance to the global football scene has been, at best, moderate.Famous names have passed through. The museum is primarily a shrine to the local top-flight side Krylia Sovetov – “Wings of the Soviets” – and among its exhibits is a suitably giant pair of boots worn by the Czech striker Jan Koller, who spent the 2008-09 season at Krylia. A letter from Lev Yashin, dated 1969, asks friends from Krylia to source him spare Fiat parts after the opening of the AvtoVAZ plant in nearby Tolyatti. Nearby hangs a photograph of Viktor Karpov, a legendary player and coach who encouraged his team-mates to dance the Argentinian tango before games.The festivities have taken on a similarly international flavour over the past month. Along Samara’s river embankment, a joyous stretch of promenades and sandy beaches that has come into its own during a particularly scorching summer, Brazilian fans spent Wednesday taking on their Russian counterparts at five-a-side football and volleyball. Colombia’s fans won particular approval during their visit to face Senegal on 28 June and there was a certain amount of disappointment among locals watching England’s shootout win in the Na Dnye bar, that no repeat visit will be forthcoming.England’s support will receive red-carpet treatment nonetheless. “When you invite friends into your house you are trained to clean it and make it look as best you can,” says Elena Kuzina, the director of the city’s space museum. The city centre, almost entirely closed to traffic in order to insulate Fifa’s Fan Fest, is certainly a far cleaner and more walkable place than it was 12 months ago and most of the sights are conducive to a whistle-stop visit. It is hard to miss Kuzina’s establishment, which she estimates has seen a fourfold rise in visitor numbers, due to the extraordinary sight of the 68-metre Semyorka rocket attached to it the nearby Monument of Glory, erected in recognition of Samara’s aircraft-industry workers, is a breathtaking Soviet-era tribute to working-class heroism. Half a mile away is Stalin’s bunker, a well-preserved world war two air-raid-shelter complex, and if that is all too sobering then the famous Zhigulevskoye brewery, situated by the river, sells fill-your-own litres of beer for less than £1 straight from the taps at the back of the building.It should all make for a pleasant and unusual weekend break although events at Samara Arena, a gleaming out-of-town venue that is challenging to access, will doubtless colour many impressions. Krylia will move in there after the World Cup and the hope for Leybgrad and company is that the club will grow accordingly, further boosting the profile of a city whose adjustment to the USSR’s break-up was unsteady. Many of its 1.1 million inhabitants saw their roles change as the space and aviation industries’ importance declined and Samara had to change, focusing more on metallurgy, chemicals and plastics. “Lots of things have changed and we’ve become more self-confident,” Kuzina says of the World Cup’s impact on a city whose outer fringes project a very different image to the party unfolding in the centre.“Samara is one place that definitely won’t have a legacy problem after the World Cup,” said the businessman German Tkachenko, who was president of Krylia a decade ago. “Even back then our average attendance was 26,000‑28,000, which was really high for Russia, and I have no doubt that they will fill this new bigger stadium. I’m so proud of the city for getting this new stadium, for me it’s the best part of this World Cup.”Others are more equivocal. “The World Cup is being used for propaganda purposes,” Leybgrad says, his tone heavier when discussing its wider benefits. “Tourists can do everything, drink everything, but there is a worry that nobody knows what will happen here afterwards. On the other hand, football is like great music: when you hear it, you forget everything.”Additional reporting by Shaun Walker"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ca5946c7e4360964b92220401cdd2bb5d44f56d/0_34_1988_1193/master/1988.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cfc8b778bbab7bd282b11720f72f259","title":"englands penalty heroics sweden march on and quarter finals to savour world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss England’s first ever penalty shootout win at a World Cup, Sweden progressing, a Mrs Granqvist update, Paul Konchesky and which of our panellists dealt with tonight’s football the best"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c881cc67aba769ab3af8807a720b440f7571307f/0_15_4766_2859/master/4766.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1a56280095c9e4df168060f99b7872d","title":"world cup 2018 quarter finals buildup russia live","story":"Another member of that City team, Fabian Delph, is back with the England squad after flying home for the birth of his daughter, who arrived the morning after the win over Colombia.

This is pretty tidy, except that Danilo has been ruled out of the rest of the World Cup for Brazil.A statement published on Brazil’s official website read: “Right-back Danilo suffered a ligament injury in his left ankle after sprains in training this Thursday in Kazan. “In conversation with the technical committee, Danilo requested and will remain with the cast.”Hadn’t previously heard the audio to this. Genuine chills. Thank Christ that World Cup football is back today. Before the last couple of days, we’d only had one fallow day (last Friday). Whilst that rest day seemed do-able, reasonable even, considering the swell of drama and action we’ve had. But these last two days have been tough. I’ve been reduced to blankly staring at my wall chart, and have even tried other activities, such as ‘cooking’ and ‘phoning my mum’.What have you been up to? Do get in touch.

A lad on his phone was selfish and ignorant enough to share half his conversation with the rest of us, during which he agreed to an appointment on Saturday from 12-6pm, insisting that he finish \u0027in time for the England game at 7\u0027. Ha ha. No one told him. Not one of us. Ha ha.It’s getting to the stage now that if I open a video on WhatsApp or click on a YouTube link that is NOT related to ‘It’s coming home’, I’m genuinely shocked. Rip those two stars off immediately. Marcus’s piece also features the 1994 Swedish equivalent of ‘It’s coming home’. The amount of hair on show in the video is frankly staggering. Behind me in  Towers, Marcus Christenson has started animately talking very quickly (I assume) in Swedish to somebody on the phone. I have so far only managed to catch the words ‘football’ and ‘Three Lions’ and ‘It’s coming home’ so I think it must be work related. He wrote this very nice piece yesterday (in English) on Thomas Brolin, what it means to grow up in Sweden, enjoy their third-placed finish at the World Cup in 1994 and then move to England in time for the madness of Euro 96.Thanks Jonathan, and yep it most certainly is. But before we get too excited about Saturday, let’s deal with Friday specifically the early kick-off between France and Uruguay. Luckily Paul Doyle has done this handy guide on the history of the fixture …Anyway, as I wistfully consider the ageing process and rewatch the entirety of The Day Today from start to finish I’ll hand you over to Michael Butler.

I was shocked, and reminded of how difficult managing a disability can be.The thing is, I’m disabled too. But in a perverse sense I’m lucky, as I can hide my disability. I often wonder if I would struggle to manage my behaviour, too, if I received the same treatment as my colleague with a more visible disability.I have some experience of this. My disability is a rare type of anxiety disorder where I’m incapable of communicating in certain situations and with certain people. It was severe when I was a child, though now as an adult it manifests rarely.During an internship at a research institute as part of my master’s, that all changed. I was thrust into a new, unfamiliar situation and my symptoms returned. My disability switched from being hidden, to visible – and all of my colleagues became aware of it. I was terrified that they might discriminate against me, believing my disability would interfere with my work.Even though my disability in itself didn’t harm my performance, it started to have an impact when my supervisor began bullying me. Initially, he seemed to want to help, but rather than giving me the supportive working environment I needed, he believed he knew better than the medical recommendations. He seemed unable to distinguish between helping and controlling me, and would grow impatient when I was unable to communicate. When his approach didn’t work, he retaliated: he randomly refused supervision, played unhealthy mind games and accused me of petty things. He said he didn’t care about the perception distortions that my condition brings on, and that he wouldn’t read my master’s thesis, since I was destined to become a technician rather than a scientist. On my very last day, a student that I had met at a conference, who had seen my supervisor’s behaviour, approached me and asked, “How far can he go?”I ended up suffering from depression. When my supervisor became aware of this, his communication style became ambiguous and avoidant, full of denial. He blocked interactions, used intimidating behaviour, and bragged about the fact that he didn’t read my emails. As a visiting researcher, I didn’t have access to the associated university’s counselling services. In my view, there needs to be a more proactive approach to support – especially for people with disabilities. We are four to ten times more likely to be abused, and we are less likely to report it, believing our abuse to be deserved. It might also be helpful to provide supervision guidelines to students and researchers, to make pastoral responsibilities clearer. The timeframe for formal complaints could be extended, too, so that students can submit them after the supervisory relationship is over, to avoid fear of retaliation. And more soft skills training for professors is key, so that they can understand that helping people manage their disabilities isn’t about “curing” them. What struck me during my MA was the amount of power that was concentrated in my supervisor’s hands. In other organisations, there’s usually several layers of management above you, limiting iniduals’ power. But in academic research, there is no specific body looking out for researchers’ interests. It was only when I found a job in industry that I reported my supervisor’s behaviour. I had never had the confidence to escalate things to a formal level during my internship instead I waited for the “misunderstandings” to clarify. But this never happened. To get myself through the course, I trained myself to be impervious to his toxic behaviour. But most importantly I maintained close contact with my friends, who reminded me of who I used to be before I started working with my supervisor.

Others want low-cost living at home for as long as possible. But what are the benefits of each option, and is it still possible to have a full university experience if you’re living away from uni? “When you first arrive in London, especially from abroad, it’s great to be living in university halls,” says Victoria Smith Graterol Chirinos, 19, a journalism student at Goldsmiths, University of London. You’re immediately connected to life in the capital.“I came to London from Basel in Switzerland and I love the city. There’s so much going on, there is never a day with nothing to do. It’s easy to get into central London from the Goldsmiths campus in New Cross. I do that often and enjoy the vibe, but I always like to get home to a quieter, residential area,” she says. Students living in halls will generally have their own room in a shared flat, and it’s a good way to meet people. “The nice thing about living in halls is that there is always someone there to hang out with,” says Jaxson Mannes, 18, a first-year psychology student at Goldsmiths. He’s an ambassador for the university’s Surrey House halls of residence, where students live in flats, sharing a kitchen. Part of his job, which is paid for by the university, is to provide information and encourage a sense of community.“Most of my role is planning events and activities to engage students and make it fun for the whole of the year, not just welcome week. When there was a cold spell earlier in the year, I noticed students were holed up in their rooms, so I started a weekly music listening party in the Orangery, our common room, and I used some of my budget to provide free food,” he says.On the other hand, it’s much cheaper to live at home with your parents, says first-year politics student Niquella Simpson-West, 19. “I like living at home and I have a good relationship with my parents,” she says. “It didn’t seem worth paying rent when I could commute.“The drawback is the time and money it takes for travel to go to the library or events on days when you don’t have any lectures or seminars.”For those living nearer to the university, an advantage of New Cross and nearby areas like Brockley, Peckham and Camberwell, is that private rented accommodation is more affordable than in many other parts of London in zone 2. Some students, such as 24-year-old Danielle Jombla, who is studying management and entrepreneurship, arrange their own rentals before they arrive. She wondered if she would miss out by not being in halls, but found it easy to meet people. “At the start of the course we had the opportunity to take part in icebreakers in order to get to know one another. One of the challenges I had was that I can be quite shy, so I had to make a real effort. Whether you live on campus or not, you can make friends and enjoy life at university. It’s about being friendly and putting yourself out there to be sociable,” she says.No matter where you live, you can feel part of things, says Karyma Ellis, 24, a final-year music degree student. “I’ve tried all three options. For my first term, I lived at home in Islington. Then a place in halls came up for the rest of the year – and since then I have been in private rented accommodation,” she says.Living with her family meant saving money on rent, but Ellis was nervous at first about losing out on the wider scene. “I was adamant that I was not going to miss out on anything and I joined a Facebook group for Goldsmiths commuter students. We met on the first day and we kept it up, meeting a lot of new people along the way. In welcome week there were team events, and alongside the halls teams there were teams for students who weren’t in halls. I stayed all day and went to everything I could,” she adds.“The key thing, whether you are living around the corner or living an hour away, is to make an effort.”The university’s head of accommodation services, Rocchi Acierno, says: “Many students decide to live in university halls for the first year, while others prefer to stay at home with their families and commute or share rented flats and houses. The choice is very much down to the inidual.”  Although some may feel living in halls will give them the full student experience, he believes there is no reason why anyone deciding to keep costs down by living at home should miss out on the wider university life.“We recognise that a lot of students are living with their families or renting privately, so our campus support officers are on hand to help all students who need advice out of hours, not just those in our halls,” he adds. “Our student hall ambassadors are there for students to speak to, and they also arrange social events for residents. Even if you’re not in halls, there are social events going on for everyone at the students’ union or organised by the different clubs and societies.”Goldsmiths, University of London is based on a single-site campus in New Cross, south-east London.

Russia 2018 is already well under way: another impossibly exciting, complex, wild-looking Fifa World Cup. And in its shadow, here we are too.Welcome to another mob-handed, obsessively planned, lovingly curated effort to bring you the  and Observer’s World Cup coverage in every conceivable form, to your every conceivable screen. This is the best bit of covering sport. I’ve been going to tournaments for the  since 2008, and looking back I’m still amazed at the sheer amount of hard work and the sheer volume of content produced around these occasions. From minute-by-minute commentary sent directly to you from the vast pulsing brain of some insomniac footballing obsessive powered only by nicotine, chocolate and a haystack of empty energy drink cans. To on-the-scene reports and news from a band of reporters who write and travel and file and follow stories every day, returning to their families five weeks later hunched, unrecognisable figures unable to communicate on any subject beyond wifi quality, mixed zone ticket allocations and how to get to Salvador protea at 3am with a fair-to-decent chance of not being abducted. At the end of which comes the daily web presence and the pristine design and set of the paper itself. All of this arrives with you updated to the second, cobbled together from the corners of some sock-stinking press room, polished by endlessly patient whip-smart subs and made to look lovely by some sleep-deprived awkward genius of a layout designer. It’s no secret our industry is looking to find ways of continuing to do all this. The old way of selling bits of paper doesn’t seem to work. Advertising is a capricious business. Asking our readers to become subscribers, or to contribute to pay for something they value is, in our opinion, the best way forward. So if you like this stuff and think it’s worth helping it to continue, then why not make an additional contribution to the . It only takes a minute and can be as little as £1 if you’re particularly tight or shameless. Yes, sport can be seen as a glorious irrelevance, but it also says something about who we are. And hopefully our coverage makes you sound slightly less unintelligent than you are during a discussion of the reactive gegenpress in the local Wetherspoons. Perhaps it lights up your enjoyment via the frankly brilliant reporting of our football hacks, led of course (damn him) by annual award hoover Danny Taylor, and backed up by the likes of Dominic Fifield, Martha Kelner, Dave Hytner, Stuart James and, with the long range heavy artillery, the mind bogglingly good Marina Hyde. Perhaps you even enjoy reading the World Cup Fiver, following the multi award winning* daily World Cup blog, and listening to Max, Barry and star guests speak their brains over four increasingly hysterical weeks of World Cup Football Daily. Not that there’s anything wrong with that. Either way we will always be here on these occasions.

The tenant failed to call the fire service and the alarm was raised by staff at a nearby school. The tenant ran from the house, never to be seen again. Our period front door was destroyed, the bathroom flooded, carpets soaked and there was extensive smoke damage\u0026nbspthroughout.The landlord of the next-door property assured us it would all be covered by his insurance. We contacted our insurance firm – Legal \u0026amp General – to claim and cleaned up ourselves so we could move back quickly. Since then, Legal \u0026amp General has refused to try to reclaim our costs from the landlord’s insurer, though it appears negligence contributed to the fire.We’ve discovered that the tenant had accumulated rubbish in a kitchen where he used an unapproved electric bar heater and that there were more people in the property than it was licensed for.But in April, I found I could not get access to my buildings insurance online. It turned out Legal \u0026amp General had cancelled my policy in\u0026nbspJanuary.So, unknown to me, my house has been uninsured for three months. No cancellation notice was sent and the full payment taken from my card. It admitted it had found the payment, but it hadn’t been attached to our policy. It offered a paltry £25 compensation for the error. Thousands of insurance customers, most commonly motorists, are lumbered with a “fault” claim even when they are not to blame. This is usually when the insurer has decided that it would not be able to defend a claim in court and it would be cheaper to pay out than fight. The customer takes the hit in increased premiums, especially when the payout is relatively small, as in your case.Legal \u0026amp General insists: “We will always make every reasonable effort to pursue recovery and an investigation was made,” it says. “However, we need to prove negligence and this could not be established.”It apologises for the “confusion”, reinstated the policy and paid £80 compensation.

But George Ezra’s spin on the classic disguise is more practical – a floppy-brimmed, khaki sunhat from an outdoor-supplies company paired with camouflage-rimmed sunglasses he got at a petrol station – but stylish it is not. In fact, along with his white Nasa T-shirt, the combination makes him look like the Twitter avatar of a man who retweets Piers Morgan. “People look at me,” he admits as we sit in a cafe near his home in west London, “but just because I look awful.”It is 10.30am and today Ezra, 25, is on a whistle-stop radio tour taking in Magic, Absolute, and Radio 1 and 2. The disguise will get a good airing as we will be travelling on foot and by public transport. “If you don’t mind,” Ezra suggests, “I think I’m going to get the bus today.”Ordinarily, a multi-platinum-selling artist travelling with a journalist in this manner would be doing it to prove how humble they are, despite all the No 1 albums (Ezra has two, including Staying at Tamara’s, 2018’s biggest-selling new album) and singles (his latest, Shotgun is such a dead cert for the next day’s top spot that he has already organised a victory barbecue for his friends back in Hertfordshire). But in this instance, like the chin- strap dangling from Ezra’s sunhat, it just seems practicality is key.On the top deck of the No 94, Ezra reflects on Shotgun’s soon-to-be-confirmed rise to No 1. Its predecessor, January’s ebullient Paradise, was a huge hit, but last year his career came close to unravelling. Last June, following the release of 2014’s third-best-selling album, Wanted on Voyage, Ezra was ready to stage his return and released his comeback single Don’t Matter Now. It is hard in the streaming era to define what exactly constitutes a hit, but it is also hard to put a positive spin on two weeks in the Top 70, the high point of Don’t Matter Now’s chart run.This was a reversal of what had happened with Ezra’s first album Budapest, which propelled him to stardom despite originally being issued as a free download: Don’t Matter Now had bombed. “It got a lot of media support,” Ezra says. “People just didn’t want it.”There was a crisis meeting – “and only because I insisted on it” – at Ezra’s label, Columbia. “Can we all just be completely honest about what’s going on?” he asked the room. It was suggested that the album, pencilled in at the end of 2017, be pushed back to 2018. “I said: ‘Won’t we lose momentum?’ Someone stood up and went: ‘There is no fucking momentum.’” The album was pushed back.This episode forced Ezra to reassess his previously laissez-faire approach to success: he didn’t even know the BBC Sound of … poll existed until he was longlisted in 2013, and in one interview he said he didn’t mind whether his career lasted two years or 12.“I don’t want to sound like the inspirational quote on the wall of a secondary school staff room, but Don’t Matter Now failing was the best thing that could have happened to me. I realised how much I must have been taking it all for granted.”He had seen what failure looked like and, to be frank, he wasn’t keen. He even started thinking about alternative employment. “It’s one thing having one single that doesn’t work, but having two in a row is a sign of the end,” he adds. “When we were releasing Paradise, I said, out loud: ‘I’m going to give this everything I’ve got.’”Paradise was such a tightly written, cleverly structured pop song that it seemed like the sort of multi-songwriter banger that major-label artists pull out of a hat when they’re in a tight corner in fact, it was the first single Ezra had written by himself (most of his songs are co-written with Athlete’s Joel Pott). So it was doubly vindicating when it became his highest-charting single to date, peaking at No 2.We arrive at Bauer Radio HQ, home of Absolute and Magic, where Ezra performs a short set for competition winners. Afterwards, he mentions that sometimes he’ll give audiences what he refers to as “an evening with George Ezra”, where he goes into full raconteur mode. Sometimes it works, he says, and sometimes it doesn’t either way, he stands apart from acts you could mention in the same breath such as fellow British and Irish Modern Music Institute graduates Tom Odell and James Bay – because his chat is as engaging as his tunes.This willingness to show personality has extended to things such as a merchandise-plugging promo clip so strange that it landed Ezra a spot on Vic \u0026amp Bob’s Big Night Out. Then there’s his podcast, in which he talks to artists including Ed Sheeran and Elton John.“If you’ve already taken the piss out of yourself, nobody can do it for you,” Ezra reasons. “But it’s not something you can force, or re-create to order. The other day, I had someone from the label on the phone saying: ‘How do you feel about live-tweeting Love Island?’ I was like: ‘Er, I’ve got quite a bit on.’”Not that Ezra is averse to the idea of lightning striking twice. His debut album Wanted on Voyage was based largely on international travels the main narrative of Staying at Tamara’s is about him taking himself off to Barcelona, where his Airbnb turned out to be a den of bohemian creativity. Doesn’t it concern him that he finds it necessary to insert himself into situations in order for inspiration to strike? Does he have to invent situations for his structured-reality pop because he really doesn’t have anything to say?It is more a question of putting himself in places where even mundane ideas seem interesting, Ezra counters. But it seems possible that his need for prompts and the take-it-or-leave-it approach to ambition has roots in his comfortable and secure, semi-rural Hertfordshire upbringing. He never felt the need to escape. Or as he puts it: “I never had big dreams as a kid. I was so happy that I didn’t need them.”With Ezra back in disguise, we head through Soho to the BBC, and talk more about his childhood. The main drama seems to be the teenage growth spurt that prompted him to slouch (“All I wanted to do was not stand out”) which still affects his posture today. He doesn’t think he was negatively affected by the orce of his parents, both teachers, when he was 14: “For the first time, I saw them as humans with their own shit going on – it did me the world of good.” No teenage delinquency? “Well,” he says. “As a child, I used to run through fields of wheat …” So is there anything more to George Ezra than meets the eye? “I’m trying to figure that out myself,” he admits. “I’m not a boy and I’m not a man.”Ezra says he has questioned all this ever since entering an industry that fetishises the tortured genius. “This used to play on my mind when I was first coming out with music: can I just own the fact that I had a wicked upbringing? I wonder if the confusion a lot of people have in their teens is what I’m experiencing now. I’m trying to figure out who I am and I’m trying to work out what I stand for. It’s exhausting.”Between the ages of 21 and 23, Ezra experienced what he describes as “an acute feeling of worthlessness”. It didn’t occur to him during his first album campaign – though he has considered it plenty since – that during that entire period he had been hiding in dressing rooms and backstage areas, reluctant to face his own fans. “I was thinking: ‘I can stay in my little safe place in the dressing room, therefore I don’t have to confront anything, therefore it hasn’t happened’.” Then came the almighty political and cultural debacle that was 2016. “It felt like anything that could have gone wrong did go wrong – it felt like the wrong world to be in if you’re sensitive. Nobody in my life, friends or family or media outlets, had any answers.”Ezra also knew he had to write his second album, but that wasn’t really happening. He slid into habitual thought patterns that he describes as feeling “like a snake eating itself”. The structureless life of a pop star between albums was not helpful. “I’d set the alarm, wake up, go downstairs to write, nothing would come, then I’d just do pointless shit. I’d clean the house. Every single day. I’d make up things to do. Lists of things that didn’t need to exist.”Staying at Tamara’s in Barcelona turned out to facilitate the creative and mental readjustment he had been seeking, and the thought patterns that plagued him began to dissipate. He is wary of generating “My-anxiety-hell” headlines, partly because there have been a handful in the last few months, and he was surprised (“I was either ignorant or naive”) by how the media jumped on the way he discussed mental health. And partly because he knows that his experiences weren’t severe, in the grand scheme of things, and that his solution was straightforward. “But even when people experience less, it’s still something,” he reasons. So when mental health charity Mind asked him if he would consider being an ambassador, he said yes.After a brief on-air chat with Radio 1’s Greg James, during which Shotgun is turned into an ostensibly amusing football anthem, Ezra has his picture taken for the Official Charts Company’s website, suggesting his No 1 is almost certainly in the bag. When we speak again a few days later, Shotgun is at the top of the charts. Ezra calls as he is walking to the chemist for some hayfever pills. Yes, he confirms, he is wearing his awful hat and shades. After we parted ways at the BBC, he watched the England match on a train back to Hertford the night ended with an unexpected session in a basement, playing Dylan covers with his dad and his mates until 1am.As for Friday night’s celebratory barbecue – well, that was a shambles. “The look-at-me-I’m-No-1 angle didn’t go to plan,” he admits. “A friend raised his glass and said, ‘Congratulations to George for being No 1,’ but then another one went, ‘Hang on, haven’t you been No 1 before?’ And I was like, ‘No, that was my album.’ They went: ‘Isn’t that better than a single? That’s 12 songs, not one.’ And I said: ‘Well, kind of, but a single is harder,’ and then the moment had gone and I had to change the subject.”They ended up playing rounders, then lit a sky lantern – but Ezra vetoed its release: the hot weather had left the countryside dry and he didn’t want to be responsible for a fire. The food went down well, though. He’d even prepared a salad. And at the precise moment when he knew he was definitely No 1, he recalls a brief moment of clarity. “It only lasted for a second, then vanished, but everything made sense,” he says.“It felt surreal. And it felt funny. You have to chuckle, don’t you?”George Ezra’s UK tour starts in November"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26107b3db4b18129ba4f18918a013caa004632b5/373_170_1778_1067/master/1778.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8eb3725bdd1b156117b210bbb0d3e30f","title":"we believed we could remake ourselves any way we liked how the 1990s shaped metoo","story":"While promising liberation and endless possibility, the culture of the decade drove us relentlessly in pursuit of perfection. I have been at that door so many times. The one you walk through into his apartment, or let him through into yours, and something shifts. It’s as quick as the click when the optometrist slides a new lens into the eye-test machine: a clear, almost weightless little sliver of a thing, but with the power to make the world resolve into clarity – or blur out, leaving you nauseous and unbalanced.Once, it was the door to the celebrated journalist’s apartment that I stumbled through, aged 21. I’d taken a train to New York to meet him for career advice and, unexpectedly, he had suggested we meet at a bar, then bought me several martinis. But then again, I drank them. Whose fault was the sex that ensued? And then there was the door to an AirBnB I rented in Uruguay in 2014, with a pushy local journalist I had just met trailing behind me. As I fumbled with my keys, I remember thinking: how did I get here?Me too. Isn’t that frightening? That almost every woman today can say these words? Finally, we are having a conversation about the sexual harassment – and the sexual encounters – that have left us feeling damaged. And yet there’s a kind of uncertainty still hovering around the unfolding conversation – something still tucked into the shadows. Some people have said women are being inconsistent, re-remembering encounters they hadn’t had a problem with at the time. Others wonder why women – particularly young women – are feeling so fragile, acting as if they have been terribly wounded by something as apparently minor as a leer.Complaints about boorish behaviour or lame one-night stands, this critique goes, have the potential not only to delegitimise real accusations of rape, but #MeToo’s whole message. When a writer recently accused the novelist Junot Díaz of “forcibly kissing” her (which he denied) and other women came forward to say Díaz had acted aggressively towards them in public, a friend of mine in her 40s – a feminist who writes with empathy about women who kill their abusive partners – worried that Diaz was being pilloried for “assholery”, not legally actionable crimes. Just after saying that, though, this friend began to recount her own first kiss. The boy had shoved her hard up against a fence. She started to laugh, as if to pass it off as a wacky youthful memory, like a zit popping during a job interview. But it was clear something in her still wanted to cry.The problem is, it’s this ill-defined area between “assholery” and attempted rape that troubles many women. This is hard to talk about, and increasingly so, as we perceive the damage that just remembering can apparently wreak. When I asked if it was “the right time” to write about my experience with the New York journalist, another male writer said to me, “Hell, no!”, telling me that “careers are being ruined”. But I don’t want to ruin anybody’s career.We are having these conversations at last, but we are not talking much about the historical context. I think this is the key to understanding how women are feeling now. For me, born in 1983, the context was the 90s – a peculiar era, caught between the confidence that there had been fabulous progress in the relationship between the sexes, and the smouldering remnants of a past in which bold women were feared and ridiculed.In the 1990s, the pressure on young people to succeed was intense. Women’s bodies and their sexual choices became the focus of ever-harsher scrutiny, and the expectation was that they would be perfect.I remember leaving my childhood home for college in 2001. Among the items I packed were a pair of what everybody then was calling “fuck-me boots”: knee-high black leather boots with a four-inch heel. Like my textbooks, I felt the fuck-me boots were preparing me for adulthood – for a decisive step out of the self-doubt of my teens. It wasn’t that I associated adulthood with fucking. It was more that I was determined to become the kind of woman who was fuckable in just the right way. I still remember the look I gave myself in the mirror I’d pasted on the back of my dorm-room door the first night I put the boots on, to wear to a frat party, along with a slash of lipstick in berry pink. It was a look of wonder and hope: it felt like a magic mirror, and with those boots on I could stare myself into what I wanted to become.The hopes of the end of the millennium were the mirror in which I saw myself. But the young woman there was only a picture. In flesh and blood, by the time I became a woman, I had already been singed by those smouldering embers of the past. And thus, I entered adulthood as two people: the image my era wanted me to be, and the other woman, the hidden one, the one with a body.It’s 1993. I’m almost 10. In apartments across the US, Madonna’s new book, Sex, graces coffee tables, the cover depicting her in the throes of an orgasm. My family has just moved from the city to a house in the suburbs. My parents gave me – the child – the “master bedroom”. It had a wall-length closet covered in mirrored doors. I woke up every day staring at myself.It was a narcissistic decade, but it was a strange narcissism, premised on the idea we could remake ourselves any way we liked, virtually from scratch. People came home from vacations in Germany with pieces of the Berlin Wall the feeling was not that they’d got a memento of German reunification, but a piece of the ultimate wall, some figurative wall whose crumbling represented the tumbling-down of a whole world. My father, a former Reagan administration official, filled up our house with kitsch he found on trips to Moscow. Muddling around for the house keys, I’d touch medallions of Stalin and Lenin in the bowl in the hall.The message I got from these objects was that enmity, conflict, maybe even pain – all the kinds of things my parents told me they’d had to fear as kids in the early 60s, when their schoolteachers made them hide under their desks in case of a Soviet nuke – were all some kind of big joke. We could keep Stalin in our house as an amusement, like those 19th-century Europeans who displayed the shrunken heads of conquered Polynesian tribes.Unmanageable male lust was one of those things we hoped would become a kind of relic that we didn’t take all that seriously. Men in that decade’s pop culture tended to be harmless – think the goofs of Seinfeld and Friends. One of the bestselling American books of the early 90s, You Just Don’t Understand: Women and Men in Conversation, reassured readers that resolving miscommunications between the sexes was actually easy, if we just understood how to do it. Solutions were big then. A couples therapist named Harville Hendrix sold hundreds of thousands of copies of a guide called Getting the Love You Want, which unravelled “the mystery of romantic attraction” and answered “humanity’s yearning” in just 384 pages.I remember my early girlhood as surrounded by a shimmering halo of possibility. Explaining the long-term inconveniences of an oesophageal surgery I’d had as an infant, my pediatrician told me with a wink that the only thing I could never be was an astronaut: as if, without that little fault, I’d have definitely gone to Mars. My friends and I loved the cartoon The PowerPuff Girls: “Sugar, spice, and everything nice,” the narrator intoned. “These were the ingredients chosen to create the perfect little girl. But Prof Utonium accidentally added a can of whoopass to the concoction!” The PowerPuff Girls combined traditional female perfection (Mary Jane shoes, pigtails) with post-feminist female badassery (they whooped bad guys).The success of MTV’s Real World – not, it was clear, real – confirmed that reality didn’t really matter the only things that had to be real were our dreams. Oprah was the preacher of that decade. She told us we just didn’t have to believe in bad things any more. Fear, she said, was a useless emotion it was all in our minds. Failure and lasting heartbreak were the monsters of the human childhood, which just vanished as soon as we opened the closet door. Her frequent guest, the motivational author Iyanla Vanzant, told a live audience in New York: “You can use words to totally redefine reality. What I do when I hear myself say ‘can’t’ is, I cancel it out. Cancel the word. Cancel the thought. You shouldn’t have any ‘problem’. ‘Problem’ means you are powerless. ‘Problem’ means you are weak. Say ‘ine opportunity’.”It wasn’t clear how men would fit into the picture of young 90s women’s futures. What guy on Seinfeld or the Simpsons could keep up with an ambitious woman? The lead male character in American Pie, the classic 90s comedy, tried to fornicate with a pastry.In sex education classes, we spent endless time watching videos of sperm penetrating an egg, or labelling diagrams of the testes there was no sense of a real man connected to these sexual organs, but there was a firm message of fear. Our instructors terrified us with stories of how condoms could fail, exposing us to STIs that would destroy our potential we were taught about sex in the same classes as hard-drug awareness, implying it was a bit like cocaine, a quick thrill that could prove ruinous.Though we were supposed to be the first generation that didn’t need men in a material sense, my friends and I in high school were absolutely obsessed with guys. We talked about little else. We didn’t know what men were for, but I think we wondered whether they could turn out to be the secret key – a kind of final stage in our self-development, or a confirmation that we had become as awesome as we were supposed to be. When I think back to that time, I remember a scene from my favorite teen TV show, Dawson’s Creek. Pacey, a boy, tried to tell two of his female friends about a serial killer who was reportedly stalking the region. “He cuts out women’s hearts,” he warned. Joey, a girl, just laughed. Jen, the other girl, smiled beatifically and said: “He’s probably just looking for love.” A powerful enough woman, in other words, could be a literal alchemist, turning even the worst heart-eating murderer into a good guy.Female ambition was purportedly encouraged. But when it actually manifested in a real woman, it was often depicted as deadly, contradictory or grotesque. When Fergie, the Duchess of York, tried to recover from her orce by entering business, a nasty Independent article, written by two women, mocked her efforts: “Goodness, she would have a jolly good go at anything!” Donald Trump had a tower and a plane, but it was Imelda Marcos, the wife of Philippine dictator Ferdinand, with her vast collection of shoes, who became the decade’s symbol of greed. In her 1991 biography of Nancy Reagan, Kitty Kelley accused the president’s wife of secretly “ruling the White House with a Gucci-clad fist”. Diana was applauded for rejecting her ugly prince. But she was also painted as reckless for getting killed with her playboy lover in a car chase with paparazzi.Around the time the Bobbitts were in the news, I started to become very fearful. I wrote diary entries. Anxiety – over my grades, over the need to be perfect – was a theme. “I will get better and better at sledding,” I encouraged myself. I impressed on myself the need to be good, even at the things I did just for fun. “Goals: to work harder. Spend more time on homework and less time drifting away and ending up with my nose in a book.” After a report card came home, I mourned: “As the grownups say, I am not living up to my potential.” I was eight years old.Coexisting with the sense of limitless possibility was a strong counterstrain of dread. If life in the late 20th century could theoretically be perfect, then any wrong step was potentially catastrophic. On an Oprah episode called Stranger Danger, an “anti-abduction” specialist taught a group of very young children how to evade potential kidnappers by doing things such as jumping into rubbish bins or kicking out the brake lights of the car if a paedophile locked them in the boot. “Fantastic way to signal the police,” he’d say.The kids in the show, though, struggled to contain giggles. In that situation, who would remember to kick out the brake light? I remember learning stuff like this – the sinkholes to misfortune I might stumble across in the future, and how to tiptoe around them – and just laughing, too. It felt so much easier, and more powerful, to imagine danger just didn’t exist or could be risen above, as the girls in Dawson’s Creek did, than to acknowledge we could screw up our glittering destinies.At 16, I got my first boyfriend. But I couldn’t enjoy it. I was timid and terrified, unable to voice my feelings or concerns. I felt muzzled by contradictions: love could be everything love was a distraction. He wasn’t the right guy he might be the right guy and I would blow it. I had become detached from my real instincts, because love was an achievement, rated, in some vague way, by outside forces.When my boyfriend grew depressed and increasingly angry, I felt I had to figure out how his behaviour was actually due to my actions. As a young woman, the infinite power I’d been told I had turned out to have given me infinite responsibility – and that was a terrible burden. He was like a gear in the complicated but glorious machine I was assembling called my life, and if he went wonky, it must be my fault.I spent a lot of time sobbing in car parks. When I broke up with him, I brought him a fruit basket. I wanted so much for a bad thing to be good, to make a “ine opportunity”. As I got in my car to leave, he threw himself under the front wheels. The emotion I recall is numbness, a sense of profound dissociation. The more messed-up the evening got, the more I had to pretend it was almost funny, a “crazy” story I would later tell my girlfriends – proof of promising qualities I had been assured of in magazine personality quizzes, like adventurousness and a willingness to let life unfurl in all its wackiness.The writer Andrew Solomon has explored the lives of prodigies, gifted children burdened from a very young age by great expectations. The experience, he writes, is “isolating, mystifying, petrifying”. I think many millennial women, and not just the wealthiest ones, had youths a little like prodigies. We were invested with the hope that the suffering of generations of women who had gone before us hadn’t been in vain. Recently, a friend told me that her mother got into Harvard in the 1970s but chose not to go because of the explicit inequalities for women that remained there. “They had a male-only library. She wasn’t allowed to be in the marching band,” she said. My friend felt that her mother was in awe – even jealous – of our condition, apparently freed from that overt discrimination. My friend recalled that she grew up being told: “This is how good you get it. You get to live in this time when everything is possible.”My mother, the nerdy daughter of penniless Polish immigrants, loved literature and music. But, when she applied to college, her father insisted she study science, and she did so, because daddy was still king in the 60s. Defeated, she dropped out. She felt, I think, trailed by the shadow of opportunities denied. Her determination that I not screw up my special opportunity became, at times, overwhelming. When I came home with a B in geometry, I got chewed out as if I had written off the car. When I looked deep into my mother’s eyes, sometimes I thought I saw a plea: tell me you are going to make it.It sounds paradoxical, but all the power we were told we had led often not to courage, but to hesitation, rationalisation, even self-hatred and self-harm. It was portrayed as a liberation to have the chance to be everything all at once, brainy and gorgeous. But in practice, it was crushing: if we could be anything, we had to be ideal.The beauty rituals of the 90s focused on scraping, plucking and driving out. We knew we had to be godly, so we became like monks, obsessed with flaying ourselves and exorcising the evidence of sin within us in the form of stray hairs and blackheads, which we cruelly tried to rip off of our delicate faces with special tape. Our 90s models of beauty – Kate Moss, Posh Spice – were hollow-eyed, so blemishless and skinny that they seemed to be melting away. The beloved teen magazine Seventeen played the role of our advisor on romance, and it was a harsh tutor, reminding us incessantly of all the ways we could fail. One recurring feature was the quiz, dedicated to helping young women identify and root out their neuroticisms. “Quiz: Do You Play Mind Games?”, “Are You Overreacting?”, “Are You Paranoid?” Another feature was “550 Guys on First Moves and the Worst Thing a Girl Could Do”.We were rated on everything. I got graded at summer camp. In high school, we took the Myers-Briggs type-indicator test, which adjudicated our entire personalities and generated quantitative values for our traits we could even be rated on how much we liked to have fun. This was the insidiousness of the decade’s philosophy: in the guise of liberation, it swallowed up everything and directed it towards incessant self-perfection.Educators who work with prodigies know they often become paralysed because any action at all would be a betrayal of the ideal performance. Or they start to sabotage themselves. Many girls I knew began to cut themselves. Young-adult novels began to proliferate in which the teenage protagonists became grievously ill, bedridden, or died. In recalling her thoughts of suicide, the writer Porochista Khakpour described it as the only choice that had not yet proved itself imperfect. In an environment where being extraordinary is never quite enough, being dramatically, pointedly off the mark becomes a way to get attention. A friend of mine and I privately called the girls who cut themselves the “Arrogant Suicidals”. We assumed they were doing it to stand out.It makes me sick to recall that I presumed feeling suicidal could be just another performance. But it might have been, at times, because everything was. The longer everybody tried to be amazing, the harder we all had to look for marks of distinction in paradoxical places.We longed so much to step or fall off the narrow tightropes we walked. In the early days of the internet, a lot of kids my age took a quiz called the “Purity Test”. Among the hundreds of questions were ones such as:“Have you used a drug to lower someone’s inhibitions about sexual activity?”“Have you had sex with a woman who was asleep and she didn’t wake up?”“Have you ever accepted money for sex?”“Have you ever masturbated into a houseplant?”It wasn’t entirely clear whether it was good or bad to get a low score – to be “pure” – but I recall it was judicious to be pure and cool to be impure, and we kind of had to be both.The people who designed the purity test were high achievers: students at MIT. I suspect the test reflected fantasies of getting off the dizzying fast track. But it’s telling, and sad, that their fooling around also yielded a grade. In the end, “impurity” was just another proof of accomplishment. In the test’s logic, prostitution and rape were almost wickedly charming, marks of daredevil extraordinariness. Early on in the iconic 90s film American Beauty, Angela, the movie’s ingenue, fields creepy attention from an older, married man. She converts that problem into a ine opportunity.“If people I don’t even know look at me and want to fuck me, I really have a shot at being a model, which is great!” she says. “Because there’s nothing worse in life than being ordinary.”Years later, in 2014, on a reporting trip to Montevideo, I hosted a dinner for local artists and journalists. One of them gave me the eye across the table. We ended up at a bar. He walked me home to my AirBnB. We went upstairs. I recall these steps as feeling both discomfiting and inevitable, as if someone else was moving my feet. The whole time I walked, I thought brightly: I can always go back.But I couldn’t. My first step towards the AirBnB had arisen from a wish to be fancy-free – but then it became a rule. For if I’d had the power in that situation, then I’d have been able to make the best choice at any given time. To stop walking, to change my mind, was to admit that I had made a mistake, been stupid – a crippling admission.After I let him into my AirBnB, he dropped his pants and blocked the door with his body. Now this was real. This was bad. This was the point at which I was supposed to kick out the brake light of the car to signal the police. But all I could manage was to feebly voice what had become for me, by then, a go-to excuse for ending such encounters: that my vagina was broken. I said it had a “disorder”.Unfortunately, my excuse didn’t work. He just grinned and said: “Maybe mine will be the dick that will fix that for you.” Horrible – but wasn’t that kind of always the hope? That a man would come along and put the last piece into the not-yet-quite-perfect puzzle of our feminine lives?It felt awkward, even childish, to hit him or to scream. I also felt I owed him a long explanation for my inconsistency, even though I had not yet managed to explain it to myself. Suffocating under contradictions, I just lay back and resigned myself. I think so many of us resigned ourselves to situations that were wrong, not because we were powerless, but because we thought this was the way for us to experience our power. To shove the man, or to scream, felt like an admission to myself I had misjudged the situation in the first place, and I’d always been taught that to lose control of a situation was a mark on your character. A failure.I trekked to his office the next morning to return a sweater he’d left behind. He gave me a warm smile, which I returned with a queasy one. I didn’t know what to think of myself, and in that void, I didn’t want to seem inconsistent. I think he thought my solicitousness meant I’d had a good time. And why shouldn’t he have? How could he have known all the fears and concerns I had brought in with me to that AirBnB, when we, as a culture, go so terribly far to conceal them?But I’ve thought of Montevideo during the #MeToo conversation. There are many of these kinds of ambiguous yet heartbreaking encounters that women have not yet voiced. Some commentators have fretted about “evolving standards” – as if all of a sudden women just decided that things they used to be cool with aren’t so cool any more. There is surprise at some of the #MeToo stories – when strong women such as Amy Schumer reveal that they endured abuse, sometimes for years. But it all makes sense to me. We aren’t changing our standards. We are remembering things. Why should we be surprised that women are only now remembering, or understanding, what really happened to them, when, in the time that so many of us came of age, we told ourselves that everything we knew about life and human behaviour could be forgotten, that we had left the past behind?How many times have I recounted a truly scary or hurtful encounter with a man to my girlfriends as a jolly story? But, it turns out, it just isn’t funny or adventurous to see your boss masturbate on a houseplant. It’s traumatic. There are, perhaps, only so many times a woman can deny the impact of such experiences before she loses it. Every one of them dredges up the memories of the others, cumulatively, until one day a stranger whistles at you on the street, or you read an account of some random celebrity’s misdeeds, and you find yourself raving on Twitter like a person who has been halfway destroyed.Yes, some of these experiences are minor. But what’s behind them is not. Love as triumph, love as ruin. Sex as weightless, sex as incredibly freighted. Men as pointless, men as the whole point of life’s game. Women as witches, magicians women so fragile they cut themselves open in high-school bathrooms. Women as careful, women as carefree.In some of the #MeToo critiques, I perceive an anger that younger women weren’t the perfectly empowered people their elders had hoped they would be. The older generation had prepared the ground, after all, and fought their battles. To acknowledge how younger women have struggled would entail a painful admission that the battles of previous generations may not have been won as decisively as they had hoped. We were told, decades ago, that we were starring in a totally new story, and that we didn’t have to experience any of these painful conflicts. But that only made our ultimate experience of them more painful.Nine months after it began, I sense an ebbing of some energy around #MeToo – a tiredness perhaps an acknowledgement that the contradictions and painful realities it revealed are too big to solve fast. Frantically firing offending males may make it harder for women to tell their complex stories. But the suffering of men who have been publicly accused of sexual assault or misconduct must not shut us up now, either. I want more stories. I want more curiosity about the complexity of women’s lives – instead of a panicky retreat from the conversation.We would like to believe that clearer rules around “positive consent” will put an end to much of this difficulty. But I worry a little about “positive consent”. It still puts the onus on the woman to perfectly manage the situation – this time with non-verbal cues, communicating desire or retreat with a flicker of the eye. It wasn’t a better description of “consent” that I needed while growing up. I was taught endlessly what I should and shouldn’t consent to for my life not to go wrong. All that emphasis on all my power to make things turn out right ended up paralysing me.I lacked a perception of what I wanted. I think that’s one of the things that lurks in the shadows of #MeToo. How to enable young people to discover what they really want and need out of love and sex – this is what we should be talking about in sex-education classes. Forget about putting condoms on bananas. But as long as we venerate doing and solving – making things more efficient and perfect – it will be hard to glimpse what we really want out of sex or of love.Main illustration by Nate Kitch• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d75d81fe664e8271e73047b39660d91748c74c9/0_171_5121_3073/master/5121.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b364fa2933da2c3f832a421af85a17a","title":"study law to open up a world of opportunities","story":"Politician, lecturer, human rights campaigner – a law degree will set you on the path for a career at the top Not only does a law degree or postgraduate course open up a wide variety of careers within the legal sector – it can also set you up for a future career at the top, in anything from business to politics.International law, for example, is a fascinating and fast-moving area. Mariam Munang took her bar professional training course (BPTC) at the University of Law, and is currently based in New York as an associate legal officer at the United Nations. Munang says that her time at the University of Law – which has 10 centres across the UK – gave her the skills and confidence to get to her current position. “I chose to study there because of its strong emphasis on honing practical legal skills, such as drafting and advocacy,” she says. “I prepare for trial in much the same way as I prepared for mock trials at the University of Law. The BPTC gave me the space and opportunity to make errors, learn from them, and hone my own style.”Baroness Shami Chakrabarti is one of many lawyers who choose to use their skills in the political world. She received an honorary doctorate from the University of Law, where she is now a mentor to students. She’s a member of the House of Lords, a politician, a barrister and a former director of human rights group Liberty. “I am proud to be the shadow attorney general in a shadow cabinet of many lawyers and many more colleagues who champion human rights and the rule of law,” she says. “During my time at Liberty, we defeated proposals to lock people up for 42 days without charge, halted ID cards, and won important victories on issues like stop-and-search.”One of the proudest moments of her career, she says, came when the Human Rights Act was passed. “In a sense, there’s no such thing as human rights law, only a whole host of legal and policy areas that engage people’s human rights,” she says. “Human rights are a powerful shield against abuse of power.” Simon Firth, partner at Linklaters LLP and visiting professor, says teaching those at the start of their careers is one of the best aspects of his job. “I love explaining the principles of the subject I am covering,” he says. “The University of Law has a very practical approach to preparing students for legal practice. That means trainees are effective from the moment they start training contracts.” As graduation approaches, the university’s award-winning careers service offers students guidance on achieving ambitions – another step to set them up for success.Mayor of London Sadiq Khan graduated from the University of Law Guildford with Law Society finals, the predecessor to the LPC. “At the University of Law I really valued the support of my fellow students, my lecturers and my tutors,” he says. “They kept my motivation levels up through many long days and late nights of revision.”Khan, who grew up on a south London council estate, was a human rights lawyer before entering politics. In 2016, he won the largest personal mandate in British political history to become mayor of London. His legal background provided vital experience for the world of politics, he says. “I was a member of parliament for my home town in Tooting before becoming the mayor for all Londoners,” he says. “As a human rights lawyer, I defended people who were victims of discrimination and that made me more determined than ever to fight injustice wherever I see it.” Visit the University of Law for more information"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84d59aecd35883940bb1d270f282fc6905ab5401/0_124_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6b520094b8d24f188a23c43585122af","title":"the chequers summit the agenda and what could happen next","story":"Tensions are high as Theresa May gathers her cabinet for crunch Brexit talks at her country retreatThe Chequers summit has been billed as the prime minister’s most dramatic showdown with her senior team ... since the last one. May is expected to push for a version of Brexit that will require her red lines to bend significantly – swallowing European Union regulations in some sectors, for example – to allow for a deal that won’t crash the economy.Even more controversially, May appears likely to reintroduce key aspects of the new customs partnership – although this time the UK would set the tariffs on goods and technology would be used to maintain frictionless borders. Pro-Brexit ministers will want to see the details. May is under pressure to finally face down the hardliners in her cabinet, presenting them with some unpalatable truths. But some believe cabinet unity is more important to her, even at the expense of coming up with a deal Brussels can agree to, so more fudge could be on the cards. As the cabinet moves on to the cheese course at the end of their working dinner, the prime minister wants to have them all signed up to the Brexit white paper, to be published next week. Boris Johnson and David Davis may need a stiff glass of whisky.May’s principal aim is to finally get agreement on the knotty issue of customs, solving the problem of the Irish border. Her plans for a “third way” would involve the UK tracking goods as they come into the country and levying EU import taxes on them only if their final destination is inside the EU. That would allow the UK to set lower tariffs and strike its own trade deals – a key demand of the leavers. The other big area in which she needs consensus is regulatory alignment – so far we know that the UK’s regulations would closely mirror the EU’s, with parliament able to decide where to deviate. No 10 hopes that by widening the invite to the entire cabinet, she can open up the debate and shift the balance towards a softer Brexit. However, fault lines run deep and the Brexiters are furious about being “bounced” into accepting closer alignment. Discussions could go late into the night.There are deeply opposing views in the cabinet on how post-Brexit trade between the EU and UK should be handled. The key battleground will be over what compromises should be made for it to be as frictionless as possible. Documents released on Thursday caused alarm among leavers. They fear that May is planning to align the UK so closely with Brussels’ rules covering goods and agriculture that it would make a trade deal with the US – a key Brexiter promise – all but impossible. There is also concern about what will happen in key areas, including the role of the European court of justice, freedom of movement and services which are not currently on the table for discussion at Chequers. There might be a way of packaging the deal in a way that pro-Brexit ministers could accept – but they are under intense pressure from their backbench followers, who have made their disquiet known to the chief whip.Senior Brexiters will arrive at the summit with their hackles up. Johnson and Davis have lacked their usual joie de vivre at the recent rounds of summer drinks. A friend of the foreign secretary suggested he was “haunted” by the failure to deliver his vision of Brexit. But as one Westminster sage points out: “The best guide to their future behaviour is their past.” Johnson was said to have come close to quitting at the last Chequers summit, in February, but stayed put. Davis has now threatened to go on no less than five occasions, but each time has stepped back from the brink. Some suggest it would be a futile gesture anyway, if, as he claims, Brussels is going to reject the UK proposal anyway. Michael Gove, with one eye firmly on the future, would rather be seen as the “pragmatic Brexiter” than blowing his chances of the top job. In the end, government insiders suggest, each would rather stay in the game. Some loyalists suggest that if one or more leavers do quit, it would be no bad thing as May could win a vote of confidence, silencing her critics once and for all. Others believe that even if she survived for now, she would be fatally wounded. Early signs suggest that it’s unlikely. At the Brussels summit last week, May gave her fellow leaders a sneak preview of her plans and they appeared to say no. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, said afterwards that “huge, serious ergences” still existed between the two visions of Brexit. The priority in Brussels is to find a solution on the issue of the Irish border. Brussels has consistently resisted British attempts to cherry-pick on the single market, insisting instead that May faces a binary choice between a Canadian-style deal or a Norwegian one. The government remains hopeful, pointing out that the EU already has bespoke arrangements with countries including the Ukraine and Switzerland. May’s flying visit to Germany on Thursday to see Angela Merkel showed where the real power lies in Europe. Yet, after the meeting, Berlin was said to be unconvinced by May’s message."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8276033fe4ae1dc54dc7e37432a2e91001826988/202_0_3097_1859/master/3097.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aade8c90dfd4444022fcced21ae7f0fe","title":"huddersfield hull fc super league match report","story":"If the reigning Super League champions, Leeds, are scouring the globe for their new head coach, it appears they need not look too far from home for what appears to be the magic formula.This is now four wins in five league games since Simon Woolford arrived as Huddersfield coach from Australia. Woolford is the latest NRL assistant looking for his break as a head coach in this country: Leeds may fancy that route yet, too.Leeds will confirm the details surrounding Brian McDermott’s replacement on Friday – but they head to Castleford on Sunday in the competition’s bottom four after Huddersfield moved above them following this latest victory. But as well as the upturn in results, there is also plenty more for Woolford to be optimistic about.How encouraging it must be for the Australian to see locally produced talent such as Darnell McIntosh – who scored twice on his 21st birthday here – thrive, but the headlines perhaps firmly fell at the feet of their evergreen half-back. Danny Brough is now 35 but, following this latest display, still has plenty to offer Woolford’s new-look Giants, it seems.“Danny’s my type of player – he’s a competitor,” he said. “Sometimes that competitiveness has got him into strife but you never want to take that away from a player. He’s an important part of our team.”Brough was hugely instrumental in the play which put the Giants 19-6 ahead at half-time, with tries by Daniel Smith, Aaron Murphy and Jordan putting the hosts in control at the break.Hull will be five points adrift of the play-offs should Castleford beat Leeds on Sunday, and they were well-beaten here despite the second-half tries to Hakim Miloudi and Danny Houghton which were ultimately in vain. “From one to 17, there wasn’t anyone in a black and white shirt that outplayed their opponent,” their coach, Lee Radford said.With two wins from their last five games, inconsistency continues to hold Hull back from mounting a credible challenge. Indiscipline was also an issue here, epitomised by the penalty conceded by Miloudi while in possession which led to McIntosh’s first try shortly after half-time. Brough’s touchline goal opened up a four-score lead and, even at that early stage, it was clear there was no way back for Hull.The tries to Houghton and Miloudi threatened to make it briefly interesting, but McIntosh’s second soon after, the winger expertly rounding Miloudi, underlined Huddersfield’s dominance on the contest. Their top-eight destiny is now back in their own hands: with Woolford in charge, few would back against them getting over the line and avoiding the Qualifiers now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9db5a4520e49c23933926e6fe817a981c6614f09/0_145_4215_2530/master/4215.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fef17c4a2f50b296760a5712b492c18","title":"sebastian vettel british grand prix lewis hamilton f1","story":"Smiling, relaxed and visibly at ease from the moment he sits down, Sebastian Vettel’s demeanour betrays no hint of a driver engaged in a mighty struggle with Lewis Hamilton for the Formula One world championship.Their rivalry may well become the defining battle of this generation but it clearly does not weigh heavily with Vettel. Just how composed he is could not be better illustrated than when this intensely private man proves happy to talk about his life away from the wheel. Something that perhaps helps define why he has been so successful behind it.Vettel goes into Sunday’s British Grand Prix one point clear of Hamilton. Both have four world championships apiece. Both want to be the one to equal Juan Manuel Fangio’s tally with a fifth. Their battle, and how it plays out, will be the dominant theme at Silverstone.It is the second season in a row Vettel has been in a two-horse race with Hamilton and the Ferrari driver understands and revels in the excitement it has generated. “It is something you want, you want to be in close rivalry,” he says. “You want to be in a position so you can fight for victory, that is the ultimate satisfaction, of course it is more intense when it is closer.”Yet much as this is important to the 31-year-old, he is equally as concerned that behind the intensity, he remains, well, simply, himself. “Obviously F1 is a big part of my life but it is not the most important thing. It is not who I am, it is what I do. They are linked but it is important there is a lot of time where it doesn’t define who I am.”Clearly this distinction means something to Vettel, who has enjoyed huge success, with four titles for Red Bull between 2010 and 2013. “I don’t feel special because of what I do for a job. It is part of me, my identity but it would be the wrong answer if I asked myself: ‘Who are you?’ and I said: ‘I am an F1 driver.’ I am a lot of other things as well. It doesn’t define me as a person.”At which point he opens up further. He has two children and yes they have been to races but only in the grandstands and not in the paddock. He is focused on them seeing him as who he is rather than what he does. It is the tip of the iceberg in his desire not be changed by F1. “I am happy to do things that people think are boring but for me they are not, being at home, mowing the lawn. I cook, not so good, but from time to time. I do the school run, I go shopping, I take the metro and the bus.”The contrast with Hamilton’s jet-set lifestyle could not be more pronounced but for Vettel pursuing his quiet pleasures seems more important than anything. Visits to the cinema, galleries and museums are all accommodated when possible but he has a blunt appraisal of his fame.“I am sportsman, I am not celebrity. So when I go somewhere and somebody recognises me I think they are interested in sport and not in how I do my hair, or which shoes I am wearing or that bollocks.”He and Hamilton are very much contemporaries. Both made their debuts in 2007 and Vettel is only two years younger than Hamilton, but these past two years are the first time they have really gone head to head in equally matched cars. There is nothing to choose between them this season. The lead has changed hands between them five times in the past nine races and doubtless will do again before it is over.The pair have been open in their oft-repeated mutual respect for one another, and their relationship remains friendly. Their flashpoint in Baku last year when Vettel barged Hamilton has been put behind them. The German now says it was a “reaction” which he concedes was wrong, unnecessary, and which he would not repeat. “I wasn’t intending to hurt him, or end his race, or my race,” he says.Vettel has, however, also been accused of too much ambition, leading to errors. This season, his dash at Valtteri Bottas in both Baku and France proved costly as it did on the start in Singapore last year. Yet there is a verve to his driving that can be breathtaking. As it was when he took to the grass to pass Hamilton in Austria. A move similar to his extraordinary overtake on Fernando Alonso round the outside of Curva Grande at Monza in 2011. But he insists he is calm regardless of the situation.“People would be surprised. They have the image that drivers under the helmet are all ‘Arggh’. You have to be calm in the way you drive because it takes all your concentration. But of course I am excited at times and feel the adrenalin.”His battle with Hamilton has been fascinating as has been the apparent determination of both drivers to steer away from attempting to score cheap points from one another. It seems this civilised approach is just another facet of Vettel’s determination to keep his real persona intact amid the sound and fury of the sport.He compliments Hamilton, saying: “he has great talent, he has great skill in the car,” but interestingly declines to be drawn on Hamilton’s strengths or weaknesses, simply unwilling for anything to be misconstrued or interpreted in the wrong way.For Vettel, this seems perfectly natural, his consideration a fundamental part of maintaining his balance out of the car, ensuring the intensity, the emotion, the focus is there when required behind the wheel.“I think it’s just normal to be normal,” he says, still smiling, still relaxed as the pressure cooker of Silverstone beckons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45e4a8e2eaec8265de1ebd6f8e8efb40e617139c/6_642_2561_1536/master/2561.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6eb609b9b813211b78c026d871e9e502","title":"team sky tour de france rival education first chris froome jonathan vaughters","story":"Jonathan Vaughters, the manager of the Education First team of last year’s Tour de France runner-up, Rigoberto Urán, has voiced his concerns at the threats being directed towards Chris Froome.Armed police are patrolling team hotels and have been a presence at the Team Sky and Education First hotels in the past 48 hours. Extra security was introduced at the Tour following terrorist attacks in France, but Team Sky also called in security experts from BSkyB to advise on extra measures. “It is really concerning,” Vaughters said of his anxieties over crowd control. “The amount of vitriol and anger directed at Sky is pretty impressive. The barriers need to go further down the mountain climbs, but you can’t barrier 200 kilometres of open road.”Vaughters, a former teammate of Lance Armstrong, was a pivotal witness in the Usada investigation that exposed Armstrong’s systemic doping programme. Yet he is among the growing numbers within cycling who have attacked the lack of confidentiality in the Froome matter.“In this case, it was public, which is really unfortunate and whoever leaked it — because somebody inside the UCI leaked it — it’s just nasty, vindictive behaviour to do that,” he said. “It doesn’t actually allow the system to work in the way that it should in a case involving a restricted substance, as opposed to a banned substance.”Although under normal circumstances the athlete in such a case would be expected to undergo a controlled pharmacokinetic study, this was not insisted on by Wada in Froome’s case.But despite an onslaught of criticism of Wada’s procedures, Vaughters remains supportive of the anti-doping body. “I don’t think Wada is broken. The people involved in anti-doping are incredibly passionate about fairness to athletes.“I’ve been saying for years that cycling should be throwing more money into anti-doping. I think it’s €140,000 that each team contributes to the biological passport, but that’s like a minuscule amount of Team Sky’s budget. Each team should be spending more like five per cent of its total budget on anti-doping.”Vaughters insisted cycling has cleaned up its act, despite many believing that little has changed since the Festina affair of 1998.“That’s just not reality,” he said. “I can say that all day long, but nobody’s going to believe it. It’s not true and I think anyone inside the sport with any genuine knowledge is going to say that’s not true. Unfortunately many people look at us all sceptically.But Vaughters joined those who now think that all relevant details to the case should be made public, despite both Team Sky and Wada declining to do so. “It shouldn’t have been leaked in the first place, but it was, so live with it and now release all the information. Both sides should come to an agreement and release all the pertinent information.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f48c29e052a98724b1b35b99916ece9656fd97cb/0_35_5141_3084/master/5141.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b168a9fd9b72dd01675d86db3f9bec47","title":"tinder online dating apps photos","story":"Scouring photos for a conversation starter has become standard on Tinder, as a woman’s viral post about toilet paper provesThe perfect Tinder photo: yes, it has to get you on your good side and disguise that double chin, but is there more to it than just looking good?Hana Michels, a comedian and writer from LA, who shared a screengrab of her Tinder profile to Twitter this week, found that a lot of men whom she matched with weren’t interested in her at all but in her toilet paper holder. She explained that she had been chastised by no fewer than 23 men in a year for the direction in which her toilet paper was facing – a small detail in the background of the photo.This has provoked uproar across the internet as to which way a toilet paper roll should be loaded into its holder, with turf wars erupting between “unders” and “overs”.Yet for many online daters, what’s really going on is obvious, and has very little to do with a sudden surge of passion from single men about how toilet paper should be properly loaded.On apps like Tinder, you’re expected to start a conversation with very little to go on: just a name, a couple of photos, and an emoji-littered biography. As such, mise-en-scene trawling has become an essential way of opening a dialogue. Whether it’s a toilet paper holder, the pizza toppings somebody’s chosen or the fact they’ve forgotten to switch their washing machine off, it’s all fair game for a committed Tinder sleuth. After all, what better way to show how much you’ve got in common than by letting them know how much you too enjoyed Zadie Smith’s latest – the pixelated spine of which you can just about discern on their bedroom floor?It’s turned dating into a bad sci-fi film, with participants trying to enhance photos for hidden ice-breaker opportunities.A number of Tinder users I spoke with admitted to scouring the backdrop for conversational fodder. Ed, 25, said he wouldn’t take it as far as toilet paper but has in the past recognised a big top over somebody’s shoulder from a particular music festival and used that as an “in”. The same goes for Rich, 30, who readily admits to inspecting images for conversation starters. A number of female dating app users told me there was no end to the specifics that men, in particular, would pick up on, from referencing famous landmarks to pointing out “messy beds”.Indeed, the practice has gone so far that many people purposefully leave clues in their photos, aware that they’ll be used as conversation starters. Edie, 25, says she’ll try to make her pictures intriguing and is aware that “wearing interesting earrings” will always get people talking. And who can blame her? It might seem like psychological brinkmanship, but surely anything is better than the alternative – the most ubiquitous Tinder opening: “Hey”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/341fa6a8ac8d1184e587727bffd8de88b935be3c/722_336_3341_2004/master/3341.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5339d53a5229e0a76cf2b88545a1ef26","title":"8 of scotland best beaches coast highlands dumfries","story":"The ‘Scotland the Best’ author has been touring the country for 25 years in search of its finest places. Here’s his pick of beaches and seaside villagesMaking a feature of Scotland’s less-travelled coast is a responsibility and a challenge. Even its quieter corners are seeing a tourist boom. Much of the rural north-west, deserted in the romantic imagination, is to all intents “full”. Skye, where accommodation is booked months ahead and camper vans form tailbacks on single-track roads, may be reaching crisis point. Some say we should think of the isle as we do Venice – under threat from the rising tide of tourism. Parts of Edinburgh are becoming an ordeal to visit, and that’s before the festival crowds arrive.But no one wants to turn off the tap. Scotland has what tourists want in buckets: erse and magnificent landscape, history, first-class culture, friendly people and, now, much improved food and drink. Scotland gets tourism and turns out to be really good at it. All we have to do is work out how to manage all these lovely visitors so we don’t kill the capercaillie that laid the golden egg.Visit Scotland, the official tourist body, and Edinburgh city council, keeper of the main gateway to the country, are beginning to focus on how to spread this bounty to unsung parts of Scotland. In line with this strategy, I have picked beaches and coastal villages that are not only discreetly authentic but keen for more visitors. I’ve deliberately avoided those that appeal to the purist seeking a “secret” beach. My own deserted “Pete’s Beach” on the north coast, which I described 25 years ago in the first edition of Scotland the Best, now has a lay-by and, in my selfish view, an annoying zipwire business. All the places below can absorb and accommodate you. For the really secret beaches, there are plenty to find for yourself. This quietly refined village about 45 minutes’ drive from Edinburgh is a good centre for the beaches of East Lothian. Its beach is part of a long sandy stretch of coast. Beachcombers, barbecuers, bold swimmers and kids all have their favourites, such as Tyninghame, Yellowcraig and Seacliff (this last is less frequented, perhaps because you pay two quid to take your car down to it). In all weathers, and the often ethereal East Lothian light, these beaches are a great escape. Down the road in North Berwick, the hotels, restaurants and cafes are all much improved of late. Basically there’s no need to face the throng in the capital.Where to stay and eat The Open Arms hotel in nearby Dirleton has doubles from £90 B\u0026ampB. The Old Clubhouse in Gullane does grills, haggis and veggie dishes.The Road to the Isles from Fort William is the stepping-off point from the mainland – and of everyday life. Boats run to some of Scotland’s most enigmatic islands – Rum, Eigg, Muck – and the Knoydart peninsula (made ever more accessible by the vibrant community of Inverie and the Knoydart Foundation). Arisaig and Mallaig bookend golden beaches, beginning where Loch Morar leaks out to sea on one of the UK’s shortest rivers. Famous Camusdarach beach is just one of many.Where to stay Arisaig House, one of the Highlands’ most laid-back hotels, has doubles for £360 B\u0026ampB for two nights. Doune Stone Lodge is a remote hostelhotel on its own cove where seven nights in a double room with half-board (and packed lunch) costs £570pp. The Knoydart Foundation runs a bunkhouse (dorm beds £18) and a campsite (£7 for two), plus B\u0026ampB and cottage listings. From Spey Bay, where the river slips in to the sea, to Fraserburgh in the north-east, this is some of Scotland’s best coastal scenery, with villages in cliff and cove settings: no rush, no traffic, no noise except sea and birds. Notable are Portsoy, with a 17th-century harbour, a waterside pub and a boat festival Pennan, where much of Local Hero was filmed Gardenstown, with a walk along the water’s edge to coast-clinging Crovie, with great bird-watching cliffs at Troup Head and Cullen, on the main road with a wide beach, a new, cool cafe called Rockpool and a 5km walk to Sunnyside, one of Scotland’s most sublime beaches.Where to stay: Royal Oak Hotel in Cullen is two minutes from the beach, with eight rooms from £80 B\u0026ampB.At the end of the road across the Black Isle peninsula, Cromarty has a times-gone-by atmosphere without being at all twee. Kids run about freely there’s a pink beach and redundant oil platforms in the bay. Unusual delights include the East Church with its clear-glazed windows, Hugh (the geologist) Miller’s Cottage and a brilliant cheese shop. The South Sutor affords a bracing walk round the entrance to Cromarty Firth, with dolphins to spot.Where to stay and eat The Anderson in nearby Fortrose has doubles from £109 B\u0026ampB. Cromarty does have a cute tearoom, Couper’s Creek, and a well-regarded restaurant and pizzeria, Sutor Creek. Islay may not have Skye’s mountains or the small island delights of the Inner Hebrides but a two-hour ferry ride takes you into a thriving community well aware of its responsibilities as custodians of a precious Arcadia. Bowmore, on the Indaal sea loch, is one of several villages with a special relationship with land and sea: the quiet, the seafood, the migrating birds and the peat, a key ingredient in Islay’s world-famous malts. There are countless coves, crannies and wild beaches to discover.Where to stay The Harbour Inn in Bowmore has doubles from £145 B\u0026ampB. Glenegedale House B\u0026ampB, on the way to Port Ellen, has doubles from £90.West of Thurso on the North Coast 500 route are many miles of unspoiled and unsung beaches (apart from my one with the bloody zipwire). Those worth seeking out, in order from Thurso, are: Strathy and Armadale Farr and Torrisdale (the latter gets the mentions but Farr is easier to reach) Coldbackie and Balnakeil by Durness – just after the same-named craft village with its cafe The Whale Tale and an artisan chocolate destination Cocoa Mountain. Durness, a straggly but very Highland village, has a John Lennon Memorial Garden and the Smoo Cave. After Durness, going south, is amazing Assynt. Where to stay Mackay’s Rooms has a “petite” double from £129 B\u0026ampB.Long a weekend retreat across the water from Edinburgh, Elie is the cosiest corner in the East Neuk of Fife. Time moves slowly here, except perhaps at the Ship Inn, a destination pub with a beer garden and cricket pitch on the beach. It’s only half an hour from bustling St Andrews, where tourists replace students in the summer, with lots of cool shopping and places to eat. Placid Elie is defined by its crescent of beach and unruffled sea, and there are walks from here along the Fife Coastal Path to Kingsbarns beach (with its toastie hut) and the Cambo estate and walled garden, or along the Chain Walk from Earlsferry, the conjoined village where the 19th Hole is another pub food destination run by the folk who have the Ship Inn.Where to stay The Ship Inn has doubles from £130 B\u0026ampB. Rufflets is a smart hotel and restaurant near St Andrews, with doubles from £153 B\u0026ampB.Here on the hammerhead peninsula known as the Rhins of Galloway, way south-west of everything else, Portpatrick clusters round its crescent-shaped harbour. Twenty miles away, and often visible from the cliff, is the coast of County Down – Portpatrick used to be Scotland’s most important link with Ireland. Jealously protected by its legions of returning admirers, Portpatrick has a distinctly amiable air: with bars and restaurants along the waterfront, it makes a good centre for roaming the Rhins or starting out on the 212-mile Southern Upland Way. Or, more likely, just hanging out and shooting the southern breeze.Where to stay Knockinaam Lodge has a five-course taster menu dinner, B\u0026ampB from £360 for two. The Crown hotel has doubles from £95 B\u0026ampB.Pete Irvine is author of Scotland the Best, HarperCollins, £15.99"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/603d401272e02adf1a1a982cf6453e1250a75370/84_109_2905_1743/master/2905.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ee4939eb262288b9bcb932ffc146fd4","title":"the perfect listen for tennis obsessives podcasts of the week","story":"Rennae Stubbs and Caitlin Thompson interview tennis stars and famous fans, while Pitch examines how Islamic State are using music as a propaganda tool If Wimbledon has rekindled your tennis obsession, this podcast full of lively interviews with the personalities behind the game is a fine supplementary listen. Australian champion Rennae Stubbs and the editor of Racquet Magazine, Caitlin Thompson, are unstuffy, frank and witty hosts. In recent episodes, they’ve chatted to American Pie star Jason Biggs about his obsession with Andre Agassi, and have discussed old rivalries and how to stay match-tough with Chris Evert, who also dished out dating tips. Hannah VerdierThis narrative podcast about how music affects people is one to binge on. In the first episode of its second season, Alex Marshall looks at the Islamic State propaganda songs that are as chilling as they are catchy. The nasheeds are designed to appeal to every taste and they’ve even created slow jams to spread their message. “If you’re a member of intelligence, you should be listening to them, learning everything you can from them,” Marshall says of the songs that conflict with Isis’s ban on music. Hannah VerdierThe Cuban Lives podcast from Amnesty International is based on first-hand conversations with Cubans who ended up on the wrong side of state and consequently felt their only option was to leave to their country. To the world, it may appear as if the iron grip of the Cuban authorities over its people is beginning to relax, but these gritty tales of control and surveillance would indicate that this is just a cleverly constructed facade. The podcasts present a disturbing insight into the state’s systematic and unscrupulous control of the population at large, and the negative psychological and emotional impact on Cuban citizens. As Miguel Diaz-Canel, the sole presidential candidate put forward to replace Raul Castro steps into the ring, could this signal some hope to ordinary Cubans? Recommended by Dr Joanna CookI thought the birth of recorded music involved Thomas Edison recording Mary Had a Little Lamb on to a wax cylinder in the 1870s. I even thought I’d heard that historic recording. Wrong on both counts. The wax cylinder was destroyed and what is played as that recording is a recreation made in 1927. And the first ever recording was made in May 1860 by French printer and bookseller Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville using a bizarre artificial ear. Unhappily for De Martinville, the technology to play back the lampblack line drawn by a feather did not exist for another 149 years. Thanks to the amazing Centuries of Sound podcast, I have now heard that recording and many more besides. Centuries of Sound is hunting down recordings from every year since 1860 and, along with a fascinating and erudite blog, is piecing together the entire history of sound from lampblack to shellac then vinyl and onward.

Kim said he had never heard the song, it added, prompting the president to ask Pompeo to take the CD with him to Pyongyang on what is his third trip to North Korea since April.The CD is not the first bizarre White House offering to Pyongyang. During their summit, the US and North Korean delegations watched a four-minute video, made in the style of a Hollywood trailer, setting out the North’s stark choice: conflict with a powerful enemy or a peaceful and prosperous future as America’s (denuclearised) partner. The film, a copy of which was given to Kim, casts him and Trump as the architects of a new chapter in world history – “two men, two leaders, one destiny”.As concerns grow that North Korea is upgrading its nuclear capability, despite agreeing to work towards the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, Pompeo said he expected the North to “fill in some details” outlined in the leaders’ Singapore declaration.In an earlier tweet Pompeo said Trump believes Kim wants a “different, brighter future” for North Koreans. “I spoke with @POTUS while we were both in the air. The President told me he believes that Chairman Kim sees a different, brighter future for the people of North Korea. We both hope that’s true,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb4e6c8f1e2a6870f5d350ec7ce2d9ebfce4e6c3/0_86_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93c8489bc758f6318ac55398d8ace9fb 480w","title":"friday briefing may faces chequers mates","story":"Brexit camps as ided as ever before summit … Thai rescue er dies … Pompeo delivers rocket man CDBrexit camps as ided as ever before summit … Thai rescue er dies … Pompeo delivers rocket man CDGood morning everyone, Graham Russell here delivering your Friday news.It has been billed as the prime minister’s most dramatic showdown with her senior team ... since the last one. Yet a united vision for Brexit seems as far off as ever as Theresa May convenes a cabinet summit this morning at Chequers amid talk of resignations, selective leaks and splinter meetings.On Thursday night, May said it was time “for another step forward” and highlighted plans to strike international trade deals. But leaked ministerial papers suggested there were plans to “maintain a common rulebook” with the European Union on food and farming standards, something that would jeopardise any trade deal with the more free-wheeling US. Backbench uproar spurred Boris Johnson to host a separate meeting of pro-Brexit ministers. Then there is the issue of customs control at the Irish border. May’s plans for a “third way” would involve the UK tracking goods as they come into the country and levying EU import taxes on them only if their final destination is inside the EU. That would allow the UK to set lower tariffs and strike its own trade deals – a key demand of the leavers.Here’s a handy guide for what will happen, and what could happen. Proceedings begin at the PM’s official country pile shortly after 10am.Cave rescue death – A former Thai navy Seal has died during preparations for the possible rescue of 12 boys and their football coach trapped in a cave for 13 days. Saman Kunan died at about 1am from lack of air after he was returning from placing air tanks along the roughly 3.2km route to the boys. “We will go ahead and keep working,” said Rear Admiral Arpakorn Yookongkaew, the Thai navy Seal commander. “Our morale is still strong.” Maintaining air supplies inside the cave is now the priority as rescuers face the prospect of the boys remaining trapped until the monsoon season ends in October. Follow the latest updates on our liveblog here.Salisbury poisoning – Sajid Javid has accused Russia of using the UK as a “dumping ground” for poison and said Britain will consult its allies on a response. “It is unacceptable for our people to be either deliberate or accidental targets,” he told MPs. Police later confirmed Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley fell ill after picking up a contaminated item. In Salisbury, authorities warned people not to pick up unidentified objects but ruled out sweeping the city for nerve agents. The Kremlin has denied any involvement in the latest incident. Reporters Steven Morris and Caroline Bannock visited Salisbury to see how it is faring with a second blow to the city.Cult leader executed – Shoko Asahara, the cult leader who masterminded the 1995 Tokyo sarin gas attack that killed 13 people, has been hanged along with six of his followers. The Aum Supreme Truth cult, which combined Buddhist and Hindu meditation with apocalyptic teachings, once boasted more than 10,000 followers in Japan. More than 6,000 people fell ill after the attack, carried out in the capital’s subway system.Cornish cream – Tate St Ives has won the world’s most lucrative prize when it comes to museums, for a £20m extension one judge described as “a profound experience”. “As soon as I walked into Tate St Ives I had an amazingly strong feeling that they’re doing something innovative,” said Melanie Manchot. “The extension has not so much been an addition as a complete reimagining.” The 12-year project doubled the gallery’s size and involved digging into the hillside to maximise space on the site, originally an old gasworks.Pompeo rocket man - Global tensions are high ... you’re about to negotiate with a nuclear-obsessed tyrant ... what do you do? Take a CD with a song carrying a famous insult to said tyrant of course. Mike Pompeo has apparently picked this unusual approach with North Korea, going armed with an Elton John Rocket Man CD and a letter from Donald Trump.The quarter-finals get underway today with Luis Suárez set for another shot at redemption when Uruguay take on France in Nizhny Novgorod. In the second game of the day, Brazil meet Belgium with all eyes on Neymar, although it is the Brazil coach Tite whose gravitas and man-management have been revelatory at this tournament. The countdown to the first kick-off has already begun. Over in the England camp, John Stones has described Colombia as “the dirtiest team I’ve ever come up against”, accusing them of verbal and physical intimidation, and praised England for retaining their composure to prevail on penalties. And as the team prepare to fly to Samara for Saturday’s quarter-final showdown with Sweden, Gareth Southgate has said he will have to adopt “a racehorse trainer’s eye” to make sure none of his players mislead him about their fitness.Everyone fails, so who doesn’t want to hear that it’s not the end of the world? And while learning to handle past mistakes is a crucial skill, so is the art of responding generously to someone else’s. The image of Gareth Southgate consoling Mateus Uribe, the Colombian player who hit the crossbar, is fast becoming iconic, even to those who couldn’t care less about football.He of all people knows what it’s like to have failure writ so humiliatingly large, having missed a crucial penalty in Euro 96. It’s not just the impact on a career but the hot lava of social media condemnation, death threats and sheer intensity of hatred. In the hostile World Cup climate, there are genuine fears for the welfare of young players. Southgate demonstrated how failures should be greeted: not with boiling spite, but common decency. There’s something about his kindly and rather self-effacing manner that appeals after a summer of vicious political squabbling.

Southern right whales used to be a common sight in Wellington harbour, but 150 years of whaling from the 17th century brought them to the brink of extinction.Known as Tohora in New Zealand, the whales were targeted because of their propensity to swim close to the shore, their huge quantities of flesh and approachability.According to the Department of Conservation, the whales are now rare in New Zealand waters, with DOC urging the public to help with their conservation by reporting any sightings. “Your help is urgently sought to look out for tohora around New Zealand and to report sightings immediately,” a plea on its website reads.The whale currently making its home in Wellington harbour – less than a kilometre as the crow flies from parliament house – is quickly becoming a favourite with locals, who have described it as “iconic”, “beautiful” and “majestic” . During the breeding season in the southern hemisphere’s winter and spring southern right whales are usually found in the sub-Antarctic Auckland and Campbell Islands, so the appearance of the creature in the capital’s harbour is unusual. DOC has urged people to stay 50m clear of the whale, but some locals have taken paddle boards and row boats to get a closer look.Wellington’s council – which has postponed a harbour fireworks display on Saturday night in case it disturbs the visitor – said Wellingtonians had fallen in love with the whale, and did not want it harmed in any way.“We at Wellington city council are waiting on some advice from experts at the New Zealand Department of Conservation re whether the sound of exploding fireworks will be harmful to the whale if it’s in the vicinity of the fireworks display tomorrow night,” said media manager Richard MacLean. “This morning the whale was again seen breaching and frolicking in the harbour – and we’re getting lots of ‘save the whale’ sentiment from local people who’ve been captivated by its antics over the past few days. “We’ve had traffic coming to a standstill on the motorway and other harbourside roads ... the whale is making everyone very happy and work in many offices has been disrupted by whale-watching.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a42b8221cd6f08580888eb0022da69335736e1e1/154_505_5210_3125/master/5210.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45cb109cfdd0c78b14c013a3671d14f4","title":"syrian seeds could save us wheat from climate menace","story":"Ancient Syrian grass rescued from Aleppo is resistant to pests devastating American farms Inside a Kansas greenhouse, a buzzing horde of flies set about laying waste to 20,000 seedlings. But as researchers watched, there was one species of growth that remained untouched – an ancient Syrian grass known as Aegilops tauschii.Now those Syrian seeds, once stored in a vault outside of Aleppo, could end up saving US wheat from the menaces of climate change.From 2000 to 2015, average temperatures in the US midwest rose from 1 to 2 degrees fahrenheit above the 20th-century average. Periods of time between rainfalls are lengthening, according to a 2016 assessment by the Environmental Protection Agency. In other words, conditions in some areas of the midwest are starting to resemble conditions in the Middle East. One of the world’s most important seed banks used to be located about 25 miles west of Aleppo in the town of Tal Hadya, and was run by the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (Icarda). That UN-affiliated centre specialises in preserving and researching seeds in hot, dry areas – conditions now being faced by many of the Earth’s food-growing regions.It’s also the place of origin of today’s domesticated wheat, and the seeds that were stored there benefit from genes embedded with survival strategies evolved over thousands of years. Now diseases and pests such as the Hessian fly, long familiar to Middle and Near Eastern farmers, are moving north from the southern US and Mexico and surging across Kansas and surrounding states – Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado and Nebraska and in some instances up to Illinois and the Dakotas.Ming-Shun Chen, a professor of molecular entomology at KSU, says the flies’ larvae used to be killed off by the cold of winter. But that cold is coming later in the season, and the larvae survive to turn into flies. Their devouring of wheat seems drawn from science fiction: the flies don’t have teeth, so they inject a protein-based substance into the plant that transforms it into a kind of nutritious slurry they can suck up and digest. From November through April, Chen collaborated with the plant scientist Jesse Poland to run a sequence of experiments that unfolded in the university’s greenhouses with brutal Darwinian efficiency: they planted commercial US wheat seedlings from Kansas and surrounding states along with an assortment of wild wheat-related grasses obtained from the seed vault in Syria, as well as random other assorted plantings. The seedlings grew for two to three weeks, and then the flies were unleashed to attack. The results were clear: Syria’s Aegilops tauschii was the sole survivor.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theWheat has the most complex genome of any of the world’s major crops, one of the reasons efforts to genetically engineer wheat traits have thus far not succeeded. It also means it has multiple genetic “wild relatives”.Over time the domesticated wheat, dependent on agrichemical boosters, lost resistance to diseases and pests. So breeders are reaching deep into the history of wheat to bring back some of those lost characteristics.“Wild relatives are by definition hardier. They’ve survived on the margins of our pampering,” says Maywa Montenegro, a PhD in environmental science, policy and management at the University of California, Berkeley, who has spent years studying wild relatives of crops. “On a farm, the farmer does everything to favour his crops: he pulls out competitor plants, weeds, gives water. But the wild relatives haven’t been getting assistance for thousands of years. They’re dealing with drought and flooding and salt.” She said indigenous farmers have for millennia encouraged wild species to grow along the edges of their farms in order to encourage interbreeding between the wild and domesticated species to confer those strengths – a practice that has been long-neglected on massive industrial farms.The indomitable Aegilops tauschii grows wild in Syria in the hills surrounding Tal Hadya and Aleppo. Poland cites a litany of diseases to which the grass is resistant, with names like a lineup of underground rock bands: barley yellow dwarf, mosaic virus, wheat rust. It also shows resistance traits to more than half a dozen common insect pests, including the Hessian fly. The tauschii and thousands of other seed varieties once stored at Icarda’s Tal Hadya seed bank have a dramatic recent history, intertwined with the Syrian civil war. The area around Aleppo was a rebel stronghold until 2016. The rebel commander in Tal Hadya, according to one of the veteran scientists who used to work at the Icarda facility, was himself a farmer and understood the importance of the seed bank.The scientists and the rebels struck a deal: the rebels protected the seed bank and, equally important, ensured that the generator kept running to keep the stored seeds cool – in return for the scientists providing the rebels with food grown from the centre’s experimental fields. That lasted until spring 2016, when Assad’s military started bombarding Aleppo and the surrounding towns, including Tal Hadya. The remaining scientists loaded up the seeds in a truck and raced across the Lebanese frontier.Other seeds emanating from Syria are helping farmers contend with climatic changes elsewhere in the midwest. In Illinois and the Dakotas, Syrian seeds seem to perform strongly when faced with the combination of increasing temperatures with brief but intense rainfalls, which leads to the spread of virulent fungus. Efforts are under way at the University of North Dakota, Bismarck, to introduce Syrian seeds into the breeding stock.Poland says the latest round of Hessian fly experiments, completed in early April, affirmed KSU’s plan to incorporate the tough survivors of the fly onslaught into the breeding of commercial American wheat varieties. After undergoing formal certification and government approval, the Aegilops tauschii will be dispersed to US breeders to make their way into the besieged fields of the midwest.The US has been losing ersity at an alarming rate during more than three decades of consolidation in the seed industry, and the steadily expanding size of farms. Diversity in seed varieties has dropped in almost every region of the country, most dramatically in the lower midwest. Globally, the UN has declared that three-quarters of all the world’s crop varieties that were around in the early 1900s had become extinct by 2015. “You may be using wild crop relatives to boost industrial agriculture, while industrial agriculture itself is one of the greatest pressures on their existence,” says Montenegro. “They’re threatened from the usual pressures – pollution, land-cover changes – but also from turning erse fields into monoculture plantations.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3550941.1530779937!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland s hosepipe ban everything you need to know","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish Water has introduced a hosepipe ban across the country that will last until at least July 31st. Photograph: Gareth FullerPA WireIrish Water has introduced a hosepipe ban across the country from Friday morning.What does that mean? What is covered? How long will it last? And how will it be enforced?The month-long ban was introduced on Monday for the Greater Dublin region, and extended nationally today. It will last until at least July 31st.The ban prohibits people using their garden hose, with a few minor exceptions. People will not be allowed to use a hosepipe to water their garden or potted plants, wash their car or boat, or fill a paddling pool, pond, or water fountain.People can still water their garden and plants using a watering can, and fill a paddling pool with buckets of water filled from the tap. The hosepipe ban on filling ponds does not apply if there is fish in the garden pond. The ban is in place 247 for the next month.People can report their neighbours or anyone they see breaking the ban. A tip line to report excessive water use is available at 1850 278 278.The water utility said they have added additional staff to man the phone line over the next month. The phone line can also be used to ask staff general water conservation queries.A spokeswoman from Irish Water said staff would follow up on reports, and take actions where they found “excessive and continuous usage” of water.However a day after the ban was introduced in Dublin, and parts of Wicklow and Kildare, Irish Water had received fewer than ten reports of people breaking the conservation order.If Irish Water deem someone has committed an offence in breaching the conservation order, they can be fined €125, and prosecuted if they do not pay within 21 days.Legislation allowing Irish Water to introduce a hosepipe ban is covered under the Water Services Act 2007, which gives the utility the power in cases of “serious deficiency” of water supply.Irish Water have introduced the restrictions as demand for water is outstripping how much the utility can supply.The greater Dublin water schemes can produce 610 million litres of treated water a day. During the height of the hot weather last week 615m litres was being used, but this has dropped to 578m litres a day, following the hosepipe ban.The exceptionally high temperatures over the last week have also led to dropping water levels in lakes and rivers. On Wednesday Met Éireann said the vast majority of the country had entered a period of “absolute drought,” due to the sustained lack of rainfall.Water reserves are being stretched to the limit, which may have knock on effects for water supply later in the summer, and even into the autumn, Irish Water have said.Announcing the national hosepipe ban, Irish Water said average demand for water had increased by 15 per cent, which “cannot be sustained for any period of time.”At the moment the conservation order is in place for the month on July. A spokeswoman for Irish Water said they will “continue to monitor all water supplies and will provide updates if any extension is required.”“We have a collective community responsibility for the conservation of water, as they do in other countries when a hosepipe ban is in place,” the spokeswoman said.Irish Water have also called on people to take steps to conserve the amount of water they use generally.People are being asked to take showers instead of baths, and to take shorter showers. Turn off the tap when brushing your teeth, and only run the dishwasher and washing machine on full loads.If watering your plants with a watering can, Irish Water said people should do so in the early morning or evening, to limit evaporation.When it comes to flushing the toilet, Irish Water’s conservation advice is to “let the yellow mellow,” as flushing the toilet is one of the biggest uses of water in the household. People are being asked to “consider only flushing the toilet when you really need to,” the utility have said.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3555664.1530819892!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"anabolic steroids and adolescents culture of invulnerability","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAnabolic steroids are now primarily known for their performance-enhancing use in sport.The death of 18-year-old Luke O’Brien May is an unfortunate reminder of the risks of taking performance-enhancing drugs in the form of anabolic steroids.Anabolic androgenic steroids have two main modes of action in the body: androgenic effects which can be generally considered as similar to testosterone (masculinisation) and anabolic effects – those associated with protein building in skeletal muscle and bone.They are a separate group of hormonesdrugs to corticosteroids, a different type of steroid in more common use in medicine for the treatment of asthma and in the management of severe allergic reactions.While anabolic steroids are now primarily known for their performance-enhancing use in sport, stanozolol has a specific indication in the treatment of hereditary angiodema – a sudden and massive swelling of the tongue and airways. There is also renewed interest in stanozolol as a potential treatment for muscle wasting and weight loss associated with chronic disease.However, stanozolol is the drug associated with some famous doping incidents in sport. Canadian Ben Johnson’s victory in the 100m at the 1988 Olympics was reversed after he was found to have run with the benefit of the performance-enhancing drug in his system. Records of the doping programme in the former German Democratic Republic confirmed its widespread use in athletes.The inidual hazard to a person’s health as a result of taking stanozolol is dependent on their sex, the dose, and the duration of administration. Inidual susceptibility to androgen exposure is thought to be linked to genetic factors, age and lifestyle.The main side effects of stanozolol include fluid retention, liver damage-hepatitis, jaundice, and abnormal liver function tests occur at relatively low doses – and a risk of developing liver cancer.In females the use of anabolic steroids may result in a deepening voice, hirsutism, acne, enlargement of the clitoris, and menstrual abnormalities.Blood clotting factors are also interfered with, while anabolic steroids can have a negative effect on electrolyte balance and calcium excretion.Congestive heart failure may occur, while there is a significant increase in the levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol in some people taking performance-enhancing drugs.Stanozolol also causes nausea and vomiting.It and other anabolic steroids are readily available on the internet. There is a culture of invulnerability among some adolescents, which when combined with the online influence of “steroid gurus” can easily portray a false sense of security in those using the drugs.The situation is not helped by how little outward bodily alteration is associated with certain products: enlargement of the male breast, severe acne and hirsutism are not usually seen. Indeed the abuse may only be detectable on physical examination by a doctor or by testing urine for traces of the drug.Another major risk in purchasing anabolic steroids online is that they may be adulterated with other harmful substances which pose a separate risk to health."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3555722.1530831805!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"head of cervicalcheck inquiry criticises hse over delays","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar: said it is “not acceptable” Dr  Gabriel Scally is facing resistance from State bodies.

It was also revealed that the planned review of about 3,000 smear test slides had yet to start, despite Government pledges it would be completed by the end of May.Meanwhile, the Government has approved new legislation, the Patient Safety Bill, to introduce mandatory open disclosure in respect of serious patient safety incidents.

The Irish Government expects that Friday’s meeting, billed as decisive on the UK’s approach to leaving the EU, will see Ms May definitively signal a clear move towards a soft Brexit. However, sources in Dublin stress they will wait to see what happens in Chequers. Previous signals from London that Ms May was going to take on the hard Brexiteers in her Cabinet have only led to disappointment in Dublin. “Extreme caution on our side” was how one senior source described it.Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said a leaked proposal for regulatory alignment to be discussed at Chequers would turn Britain into a vassal state, as Downing Street denied that the plan would make a trade deal with the United States impossible.The Spectator reported on Thursday that a document circulated to ministers proposes that “the UK should maintain a common rulebook for all goods including agri-food” and would make “an up-front choice to commit by treaty to ongoing harmonisation with EU rules on goods”. The document says that the deal “would not allow the UK to accommodate a likely ask from the US in a future trade deal” as the UK would be unable to recognise the US’s “array of standards”.The prime minister’s official spokeswoman rejected as “categorically untrue” the suggestion that Britain would be unable to negotiate a trade deal with the US, whose president Donald Trump visits the country next week.On Thursday, Brexit secretary David Davis declined to deny reports that he had written to Ms May warning that her new customs proposal would be unacceptable to Brussels. The “facilitated customs arrangement” would see Britain leave the EU’s common external tariff arrangement. But all goods entering the UK would be tracked and charged the EU tariff if they are destined for Europe. Though officials in Dublin said they would wait for the outcome of today’s meeting, the Irish Government has been encouraged by meetings the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney held with a series of UK ministers in London on Wednesday. It was strongly signalled to Mr Coveney that Ms May realises there is no majority in Westminster for a no-deal Brexit, sources said. But Irish sources expressed concern that Ms May’s anticipated move would be unacceptable to Brussels, and interpreted the prime minister’s visit to Berlin on Thursday as an effort to ensure that the EU does not reject the British initiative out of hand.Meanwhile, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that a suggestion by Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz that Brexit negotiations could be extended after next March’s deadline would “create more uncertainty”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

They were discharged in May and are at a secure location.Novichok was identified as the compound used in the attack by experts at the science and Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down. Novichok is not a single toxin but a family of  so called fourth generation nerve agents developed by the Russians in the 1970s and 1980s. In some forms, it is reported to be between five and eight times more toxic than earlier nerve agents, such as VX. It can be stored as two less toxic chemical ingredients which, when mixed, react to produce the weaponised nerve agent. This makes it easier to transport and handle – an advantage for an assassin.Michelle Carlin, senior lecturer in forensic and analytical chemistry at Northumbria University, said that it can be used in the form of an ultra-fine powder as well as as a liquid or vapour. It kills after being ingested or absorbed through the skin.Is it the same batch that affected the Skripals?Dr Carlin said it would be unusual if the couple had been affected by nerve agent from the same source as that used against the Skripals four months ago.She said the new case was surprising and, while it is difficult to speculate over where the poison came from, it would be unexpected if it were from same source.It is difficult to speculate whether this is from the original source used in the Skripal case however, if it was from the same source, it is unusual that it has taken four months for someone to be affected by it, Dr Carlin said.Novichok in Salisbury: How could this happen four months after Skripal attack?What is the risk to the general public?Professor Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer for England, said the Skripal episode meant officials had a well-established response in place.She said: You do not need to seek advice from a health professional unless you are experiencing symptoms.She also urged not to pick up any unknown or already dangerous objects such as needles and syringes.What should I do if I visited these locations?You should clean clothing and items you had with you while you were there.Clothing that is dry-clean only should be put in two plastic bags (ie. a double layer), tied at the top and stored safely – PHE is reviewing the best way of cleaning these items and will publish information in due course.Items such as phones and handbags should be cleaned with baby wipes. Jewellery, watches and glasses should be washed with warm water and detergent and then rinsed in clean cold water.Should I destroy items of clothing?Public Health England says this is not necessary but if you want to do this put them in two plastic bags, tie them at the top and dispose of  it in an outdoor bin in the normal way.What effect does Novichok have on the body?Novichok, like all nerve agents, disrupts the chemical signals between the nerves and the muscles which control vital organs, said Dr Carlin.This can lead to breathing difficulties, loss of control of bodily functions, increased salivation, convulsions, paralysis.”Outward symptoms may include white eyes, convulsions, drooling and – in the worse cases – coma, respiratory failure and death.Nerve agents can act within minutes but they can also take hours to take effect. Much depends on the exact toxin, the dose and the delivery method. What is the treatment for those exposed to Novichok?Patients exposed to nerve agents are normally given the drug atropine, which reduces muscle spasms and the production of saliva. It needs to be given as soon after exposure as possible – ideally within minutes.It is likely that atropine was used to treat the Skripals, said Alastair Hay, emeritus professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds.Doctors may also use a drug called pralidoxime, an antidote to organophosphate pesticides and chemicals.Treatments for exposure to nerve agentsWhat are the long-term effects of exposure?Little is known about this, although exposure is thought to lead to long-term harm. One of the Russian scientists who helped develop Novichok, Andrei Zheleznyakov, was accidentally exposed and, according to a book about the history of chemical weapons, War of Nerves by Jonathan Tucker, he suffered permanent ill health including hepatitis, epilepsy, severe depression and an inability to concentrate. He died five years after exposure.The Moscow weapons lab that made the deadly Novichok nerve agentIs there a wider risk from Novichok and other chemical and biological weapons in the UK?The greatest risk comes from the fact that the taboo on the use of chemical weapons, which has held for much of the last 100 years, appears to be breaking down.Politician\u0027s must bend every sinew to reestablish this red line, said Hamish De Bretton-Gordon, a former commanding officer of the UK Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Regiment.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Please review our commenting policyAnne Frank\u0026#39s family tried to escape to US say researchersUK weather: Hottest day of the year as commuters set to swelter while train disruption continues Thailand cave rescue: Diver dies while delivering oxygen as time runs out to save trapped groupIsle of Bute: Teenage boy known to Alesha MacPhail\u0026#39s family charged in connection with 6-year-old\u0026#39s deathComment: In Amesbury, Russia has turned an assassination into an act of terror – and we\u0026#39ve allowed it to happen  Comment: The big question for the Brexit summit: why won’t the Government get a move on?Comment:  Artists and writers should champion freedom of thought -

At least 35 selective\u0026nbspschools - of which there are 163 in England - are considering a share of the expansion funding announced by the government\u0026nbspto help create thousands of new places.Analysis from campaign group Comprehensive Future calculates that an additional thousand pupils could attend grammar schools a year - if all proposals for expansion are approved.Campaigners have criticised that spending is going on academic selection during a school funding crisis - and they argue that expanding grammar places causes “serious problems” for nearby secondary schools.Billy Caldwell granted medical cannabis licence for treatment at home Brexit documentary suggests everything would be fine if Boris were PMScottish temperature record declared invalid because of parked vehicleMelissa Benn, chair of Comprehensive Future said: “If these, and further expansions, go ahead, we will see significant changes to our education landscape. Expanding selective school places imbalances local school communities and causes serious problems for nearby secondary schools.”She said surrounding schools will find their intake changes to create “de facto secondary moderns.Grammar schools have under a month to submit bids for the £50m fund - which schools minister Nick Gibb has said could fund up to 4,000 places\u0026nbspa year. Schools will be able to access cash from September.As part of the bids to government, existing grammar schools have to set out what action they will take to boost the number of disadvantaged pupils they admit following criticism of a lack of ersity.Comprehensive Future found consultations for expansions on the websites of 35 selective schools across England - from Kent, London and Essex, to Devon, Manchester, and the West Midlands.It is possible that other grammar schools are seeking funding but have not put their consultations - which are supposed to run for four weeks\u0026nbsp- online ahead of the August deadline.Liam Collins, headteacher of Uplands Community College in East Sussex, said he was “dismayed” to see a Kent grammar school is seeking to offer additional “out of area placements” which will affect his intake.Ian Widdows, founder of the National Association of Secondary Moderns, told The Independent that the expansion of grammar schools exacerbates the challenges that neighbouring secondary moderns face.He added: “Not only does this constitute a significant injection of precious capital funding into just grammar schools but it will also inevitably reduce the future funding levels for years to come at secondary moderns due to reduced student numbers. “All of this is happening at a time when school budgets are already stretched to breaking point and headteachers across the country are talking seriously of an ongoing school funding crisis.”UK news in picturesGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel receives Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May in Berlin.British police officers stand facing a residential property in Amesbury, England, Wednesday, July 4, 2018.

The setting is spectacular, at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, on the edge of the Swiss Alps. Palm trees line the promenade, there are snowcapped peaks above. You can sit and look at it all day, but when the sun goes down the town shuts down. The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Cale and Nick Cave (Emilien Itim)Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler. What could possibly go wrong?Great music documentaries to watch nowGlastonbury is taking a fallow year but if you’re still craving your Pilton fix, look no further.

He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Léon Francioli played Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback. By modern standards, this was virtually a live album.Nobs died in 2013, after a skiing accident, aged 76. The Jazz Festival is his enduring testament (he also gets a shout-out as “Funky Claude”\u0026nbspin “Smoke on the Water”). The Casino was rebuilt on the same spot, but sadly they didn’t recreate the Belle Époque splendour of the original structure. The modern replacement is a Seventies eyesore. Just think: if it hadn’t been for that idiot with the roman candles, that beautiful building would still be there. But, then again, we’d have never heard “Smoke on the Water”.Montreux Jazz Festival runs\u0026nbspuntil 14 July and Deep Purple play on 4 July (mjf.ch)Smoke on the waterEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in rapturesThree hours of Public Enemy: that’s what I got when I let my son have his choice of music in the car recently. Amid his vast collection of Pokemon trading cards is a set featuring the members of Queens of the Stone Age. And one of my favourite moments as a dad was his overjoyed reaction when I told him I’d got us tickets for Metallica. He’s a music-loving father’s dream.\u0026nbspBut what’s good for the goose has to be good for the gander. Or the other way around. So when Taylor Swift announced that her reputation stadium tour was coming to Wembley, it was a case of fair’s fair. It was my daughter’s turn, even if it meant this Metallica Dad agreeing to a descent into musical purgatory on a Friday night instead of catching up with Game of Thrones.\u0026nbsp“On no, you’ll love it, you’ll have such a good time. I’m so jealous!”That was the response of a shockingly large number of female friends and acquaintances, many of whom volunteered to accompany my seven-year-old daughter Rheya\u0026nbspwhen I expressed trepidation at the prospect of an evening in the company of 100,000 screaming Swifties.\u0026nbspThe ersity of those it came from took me aback: people I just couldn’t imagine would be fans were saying it.\u0026nbspThere were culture vultures and rock fans. Twenty-somethings, thirty-somethings, and forty-somethings. Some with no children, others with a hatful, whose daughters, like mine, they were taking. I sometimes found myself saying, “what, you too?”Taylor Swift seems to hold a good chunk of the female population in her thrall. And not a few men too. Quite an achievement for a onetime country singer.\u0026nbspIt seems to be Swift’s particular way with words that has drawn them in. Nashville is renowned for its story tellers. But Swift’s stories have resonated with a far wider constituency than is usual for singers coming from out of that milieu. \u0026nbspRheyaAt her Wembley show, she likened what she does to the opening up her diary. The chronicling of the ups and downs of her love life, her biting back at bad boyfriends, her reflection on experiences many of those who count themselves her fans will have had, speaks to them.\u0026nbspSelina Mills, a writer friend of mine, and one of those who had me saying “what you too?”, says she serves up “emotional truths” with that diary.\u0026nbspAnother friend, Karen Attwood, who runs Nine Media Training, says: “She’s as good with an acoustic guitar as she is with a big pop anthem and I just love her lyrics. She is having a conversation they’re gorgeous, often very funny and sarcastic.”\u0026nbspIt never hurts if you can make ’em smile. Swift does it for her fans in the same way that a cutting rhyme from rapper Chuck D does it for me.

Right now, it’s them against us. This shit is ugly to the core. When it comes to the poor, no lives matter!” Now that’s the sort of the conversation I want to have.\u0026nbspFeeling suitably purged and, yes, a little self-righteous, I felt able to spend an afternoon in the company of Taylor. But after the first half hour I almost felt like saying “look what you made me do”\u0026nbspto Rheya. And my editors, because I didn’t find listening to her latest missive any easier than her fans might find sampling Slayer.\u0026nbspIt’s not that I can’t recognise a good pop song. Everyone has their guilty pleasures. But reputation’s hooks seemed swamped in a sea of expensive production. Here a backing singer trills, there a rapper rhymes, as the vocals tail off into electronic distortion. Meanwhile\u0026nbspSwift reflects on the trials and tribulations not so much of being a teenager, but of being an uber-famous member of the 1 per cent, a bona fide mega star, with the requisite stable of hip hop style feuds.\u0026nbsp1989, her first “official”\u0026nbsppop record, I found more approachable, and memorable. I confess, I already had some familiarity with that album on account of indie troubadour Ryan Adams covering the whole thing. He somehow managed to put a wistful and melancholy sheen on an upbeat and feisty pop record, widely recognised as the highpoint of her career to date. Moving further back, Nashville becomes progressively more noticeable, and Swift’s stories more innocent and easier to hear.\u0026nbspBut what about the show designed to showcase it all? If not the hottest ticket in town, it was certainly the priciest, part of an effort, it has been argued, to neutralise the scalpers who would have profited handsomely through gouging fans had Swift left money on the table.\u0026nbspI have to admit: a part of me was intrigued. I’ve been going to gigs for more than 30 years now (it makes me shudder to have to say that) and I’ve seen almost everything. Metal, indie, jazz, rap, soul, punk and more besides. I’ve been to decaying fleapit clubs, massive arenas, festivals and, yes, even great big stadia.\u0026nbspBut what I’d never experienced before my evening with Swift was one those bona fide pop mega tours the sort of thing featuring a cast of thousands, that takes several planes, and a fleet of trucks to move the thing from to venue to venue, and turns over the GDP of a small country.It was a world apart from the stadium shows I’ve previously been to. The Stone Roses, for example, needed only their songs, together with the odd inflatable ball bouncing up and down in the crowd, to make for a thoroughly memorable occasion last summer, one worth the price of tickets that weren’t exactly cheap themselves.\u0026nbspA Swift show, by contrast, majors as much on spectacle as it does on music. There were, at Wembley, enough huge snakes to send an ophidiophobic fan running for a\u0026nbsptherapist. Apparently their presence stems from an insult the Kardashian married to Kanye West lobbed at her, and they’ve since become something of a trademark. One’s probably pending.\u0026nbspThere was fire, and fireworks, and films. There was the obligatory army of dancers. Everyone was given a light bracelet on their way in, which seemed to change colours at the command of someone armed with an iPad backstage. The effect was actually rather pretty, if not exactly environmentally friendly.\u0026nbspThere was even a sort of floating cage of lights to ferry Swift between the three (count ’em) stages and, at the end, a bloke whom I’m reliably informed was once in One Direction, came on to perform a duet. Neither me nor my daughter were quite sure who he was, although his presence seemed to delight the crowd. \u0026nbspAs for Swift herself? Well, I’ll give her this. She is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in raptures.\u0026nbsp“Thank you for joining us on the reputation stadium tour,” she said. It was a line she repeated several times. I could almost hear the business manager whispering in her ear: “Don’t say anything that could be considered controversial, but make sure you reference the brand at least once every 15 minutes or so. It’s good for T-shirt sales.”In the middle of this assault on the senses I was again left wondering whether Swift isn’t in danger of losing that connection she has forged. But then, about halfway through, with her occupying stage number two, she produced an acoustic guitar and just sang. She did the same with a piano later on. It worked too. Whatever Swift is, she is no manufactured talent, incapable of surviving without studio trickery, and solely reliant on others to play the instruments. It made me wonder if all the extra stuff was really necessary.\u0026nbspThe reputation\u0026nbspalbum may not have done the business 1989 did, and Swift may have strained her connection with some, but her still loyal fans lapped up everything she did.\u0026nbspCrucially, so did my daughter. All my criticisms started to pale before her sheer unabashed joy. It would have made any parent melt, and the zone of protection I thought I’d established by wearing my Metallica tour T-shirt, with a suitably gruesome design, was breached. In a world that seems to grow grimmer by the day, I couldn’t help but be uplifted at my child’s innocent delight. I even found myself enjoying myself, if vicariously.\u0026nbspAttwood says part of Swift’s appeal, as a parent, is that “among all the hyper sexualised pop stars she is a fantastic role model for my daughter”.\u0026nbspTaylor Swift brings Robbie Williams on stage to sing ‘Angels’ Taylor Swift launches UK ‘reputation’ tour in ManchesterTaylor Swift marks Pride Month with heartfelt speech in ChicagoIs Taylor Swift off-loading her Beverly Hills property portfolio?And I get that. Even though with all that branding it sometimes seems as if she’s as much CEO as she is musician, she is, to quote Janet Jackson, in control.I don’t think Taylor will be troubling my speakers in future, but this Metallica Dad was able to make an accommodation with her.There is a postscript that may amuse you. Since getting one of those Amazon Echo Dots, my chip-off-the-old-block son has been constantly playing what he tells me are Geometry Dash composers. They play electronic video game music that leaves me cold.My daughter, meanwhile, has developed an obsession with Metallica’s Master of Puppets, to the extent that sometimes she’s even had me saying “can’t we have something else on?”.\u0026nbspIt means I might have to enjoy our next live experience vicariously.

Georgia chose Sam (partner with Ellie) and New Jack (seemingly happy\u0026nbspwith\u0026nbspLaura), while Wes\u0026nbsppicked\u0026nbspDarylle\u0026nbspand, of course, Megan. The dates went swimmingly.Things finally got interesting when the producers announced the public vote. First, the three couples with the least votes – Ellie and Sam, Megan and Alex, Darylle and Adam – were singled out. Then, in a surprisingly brutal twist, the villa’s two singletons were asked to choose one person each to save. And while Wes\u0026nbsphad a golden opportunity to dump 2018’s hottest villain, the fool\u0026nbspdecided that a wonderful future with Megan awaited. Meanwhile, Georgia chose Sam, quite wisely.Love Island: best moments so farFrankie, Samira, Josh and Kazimir during the challenge265 Dani\u0027s drinks with EllieDani goes for drinks with Ellie outside of the villa, discussing Ellie\u0027s previous relationship with JackJack admits he loves Dani when he returns to the villa from Casa AmorMegan couples up with Alex and is shocked to see Wes return on his own, after he waited for her565 Georgia reacts to Josh returning with someone elseDani comforts Georgia after Josh chose to couple up with Kazimir665 Josh recouples with KazimirJosh returns to the villa with Kazimir765 Megan and DeanNew boy Dean also fancies Megan and takes his chance to kiss her865 Dani cries after seeing video of Jack reactingDani cries after she saw footage of Jack reacting to ex Ellie entering the villaBoth villa\u0027s competed against each other to win a party.

Some strong words to be had.Until then, catch up with everything that happened on tonight’s episode below as it happened. Please allow the live blog a minute to load.\u0026nbspHello and welcome to The Independent\u0027s Love Island live blog. Tonight\u0027s episode looks set to shake things up, a public vote seeing a\u0026nbspcouple evicted from the villa. But who? Here\u0027s to hoping Adam may finally be gone.\u0026nbspTonight\u0027s Love Island\u0026nbspshould provide some thrills: the public has voted a couple out, but who? Unfortunately, the chances are we will have to wait until Friday to find out. Here\u0027s hoping they don\u0027t end on a cliffhanger.\u0026nbspWe\u0027re slowly but surely approaching the start of tonight\u0027s episode. Without a World Cup game on, we\u0027re catching up on Wimbledon, which featured separate matches with Nadal and\u0026nbspDjokovic.Five minutes away- just five minutes. Get the kettle on.Keith Lemon there, introducing tonight\u0027s episode... And into the \u0027previously on\u0027... A recap of Wes trying to graft even harder than normal on MeganLater tonight. Drama with Wes, Laura, Georgia, and Megan to come. And someone\u0027s going home? But who? Will we even find out tonight?!I still don\u0027t think that\u0027s done, says new Alex. He knows something\u0027s going on. And so he\u0027s taken another new guy (who?) to talk about things. No advice though... just, venting... great help, mate.Wes brings the lads together - Adam, Josh, and Doctor Alex. At least we know who they all are! Meanwhile, Samira and Megan are chatting. Oh my God your heads gone, says Samira. Damn straight.I can\u0027t pick, says Megan. And now New Alex is approaching. Wes looks suspect. Their chat... what is this? Do they have more than a single brain cell between them? Subtlety out the window with this show.I\u0027m a completely honest girl, says Megan... Are we joking? This guy\u0027s a sucker. But he does get a smooch at the end. Can\u0027t imagine Wes is happy. Can we see Dani and Jack please? Bring some happiness back?And the first break. What did we accomplish? Ummm... not much. Megan\u0027s playing with these boys\u0027 hearts and they are lapping it up like puppy dogs. But let\u0027s be real here, Wes looks to have won Megan over. But, of course, who knows with her. She\u0027s a great villain!We\u0027re back. Montage over, and Megan\u0027s chatting with Samira again. Stop trying to corrupt Samira! She\u0027s too good for you!!Love Island continues weekdays and Sundays at 9pm on ITV2.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

And just as indigenous people in the Americas were displaced by European colonists, the same is true of their dogs.”In their paper, published in the journal Science, the researchers compared genetic information from dozens of ancient North American and Siberian dogs ning a period of 9,000 years.Their analysis showed the dogs persisted for a long time but ultimately vanished, which to Dr Laurent Frantz from Queen Mary University of London said\u0026nbspsuggests “something catastrophic must have happened”.Science news in picturesScientists have witnessed the birth of a planet for the first time ever. 224 New human organ discovered that was previously missed by scientistsLayers long thought to be dense, connective tissue are actually a series of fluid-filled compartments researchers have termed the “interstitium”. 324 Previously unknown society lived in Amazon rainforest before Europeans arrived, say archaeologistsWorking in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, a team led by archaeologists at the University of Exeter unearthed hundreds of villages hidden in the depths of the rainforest. 424 One in 10 people have traces of cocaine or heroin on fingerprints, study findsMore than one in 10 people were found to have traces of class A drugs on their fingers by scientists developing a new fingerprint-based drug test.524 Nasa releases stunning images of Jupiter\u0027s great red spotThe storm bigger than the Earth, has been swhirling for 350 years.

The scientists tracked a star about as big as our sun as it was pulled from its normal path and into that of a supermassive black hole before being eaten up. They then saw a high-speed flare get thrust out, escaping from the rim of the black hole. Scientists have seen black holes killing and swallowing stars. And the jets have been seen before.But a new study shows the first time that they have captured the hot flare that comes out just afterwards. And the flare and then swallowed star have not been linked together before1724 Dog-sized horned dinosaur fossil found shows east-west evolutionary ide in North AmericaA British scientist has uncovered the fossil of a dog-sized horned dinosaur that roamed eastern North America up to 100 million years ago. The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1824 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain. Specific parts of the brain do show sex differences, but inidual brains rarely have all “male” traits or all “female” traits. Some characteristics are more common in women, while some are more common in men, and some are common in both men and women, according to the study1924 Life on Earth appeared hundreds of millions of years earlier than previously thoughtLife may have come to earth 4.1 billion years ago, hundreds of millions of years earlier than we knew. The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.2124 Earth could be at risk of meteor impactsEarth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occur2324 Researchers discover \u0027lost world\u0027 of arctic dinosaursScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”2424 A team of filmmakers in the US have made the first ever scale model of the Solar System in a Nevada desertIllustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.Scientists have witnessed the birth of a planet for the first time ever. 224 New human organ discovered that was previously missed by scientistsLayers long thought to be dense, connective tissue are actually a series of fluid-filled compartments researchers have termed the “interstitium”. 324 Previously unknown society lived in Amazon rainforest before Europeans arrived, say archaeologistsWorking in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, a team led by archaeologists at the University of Exeter unearthed hundreds of villages hidden in the depths of the rainforest. 424 One in 10 people have traces of cocaine or heroin on fingerprints, study findsMore than one in 10 people were found to have traces of class A drugs on their fingers by scientists developing a new fingerprint-based drug test.524 Nasa releases stunning images of Jupiter\u0027s great red spotThe storm bigger than the Earth, has been swhirling for 350 years.

Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1824 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain. Specific parts of the brain do show sex differences, but inidual brains rarely have all “male” traits or all “female” traits. Some characteristics are more common in women, while some are more common in men, and some are common in both men and women, according to the study1924 Life on Earth appeared hundreds of millions of years earlier than previously thoughtLife may have come to earth 4.1 billion years ago, hundreds of millions of years earlier than we knew. The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.2124 Earth could be at risk of meteor impactsEarth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occur2324 Researchers discover \u0027lost world\u0027 of arctic dinosaursScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”2424 A team of filmmakers in the US have made the first ever scale model of the Solar System in a Nevada desertIllustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.“It is fascinating that a population of dogs that inhabited many parts of the Americas for thousands of years, and that was an integral part of so many Native American cultures, could have disappeared so rapidly,” said Dr Frantz, who was also a senior author of the study.Today, few modern dogs possess any genetic traces of the ancient breeds.The researchers suggested the dogs’ near-total disappearance from the region was likely a result of both disease and cultural changes brought over by Europeans.It is possible, for example, that European colonists discouraged the sale and breeding of the dogs kept by indigenous Americans.“It is known how indigenous peoples of the Americas suffered from the genocidal practices of European colonists after contact,” said Kelsey Witt, who led part of the genome work as a graduate student at the University of Illinois.\u0026nbsp“What we found is that the dogs of indigenous peoples experienced an even more devastating history and a near-total loss, possibly as a result of forced cultural changes and disease.”Bizarrely, one of the only traces of genetic information from “pre-contact” dogs can be found in a transmissible tumour that spreads between dogs known as CTVT.\u0026nbspIt’s quite incredible to think that possibly the only survivor of a lost dog lineage is a tumour that can spread between dogs as an infection,” added Maire Ní Leathlobhair, co-first author, from the University of Cambridge.\u0026nbsp“Although this cancer’s DNA has mutated over the years, it is still essentially the DNA of that original founder dog from many thousands of years ago.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

If not, it’s good to keep negotiating,”\u0026nbspthe EUobserver\u0026nbspreported.Asked whether he would countenance extend Article 50 talks, he said: “We’ll see.”Austria took up the rotating presidency of the\u0026nbspCouncil\u0026nbspthis week following a summit on Friday, and will hold the role\u0026nbspduring the crucial autumn period during which both the EU and UK have said they want to sign a deal.Extending Article 50 talks would require the UK to ask for an extension and all 27 EU member states to agree to one.

But a Brexit deal without our trading, enterprising and innovative businesses and their employees at its heart will miss the point and make a Global Britain harder to achieve.We all recognise the UK is leaving the EU next year. Time for putting in place a Brexit deal is short and we also urge the Cabinet to recognise that the time for debating is over and that a model must be found which supports your ambition for a future partnership with the EU Which allows for frictionless trade to continue, avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, secures the Union and which enables businesses to flourish.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The Central Bank of Venezuela, which did not immediately respond to request for comment, has not independently released inflation figures in at least a year.\u0026nbspVenezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, has passed blame for the roiled economy onto others, including opposition activists and officials in Washington. At a campaign rally in May, he blamed hyperinflation on criminal mafias.But economists point out that Mr Maduro runs the unorthodox policies they say have pushed the country into economic crisis. The socialist leader has repeatedly refused international aid to Venezuela.It\u0027s internal, Professor Hanke said. Government spending continues to accelerate and the sources of revenue start drying up.The government has defaulted on a majority of their outstanding bonds, which economists estimate add up to about $60 billion (£45 million). Foreign exchange reserves have fallen by about $2.5 billion ($1.9 million) in the last three months, according to analysis by Capital Economics.\u0026nbspAs state-run oil industry PDVSA falls apart, economists say a rise in global oil prices is adding to the pain. Brent crude oil is up more than 64 percent this year. And as President Donald Trump cracks down on Iran via zero-tolerance oil sanctions, the international benchmark has rallied more than 8 percent\u0026nbspthis week.Production at PDVSA\u0026nbsp- which accounts for 95 percent of export earnings in the country and a quarter of gross domestic product - was cut in half from January 2016 to January 2018, according to the US Energy Information Administration. And as the crisis deepens, operations are continuing to wane.Those conditions, Professor Hanke said, have all but killed investor sentiment.\u0026nbspThere\u0027s an expectation part of it, too, Professor Hanke added. Everyone who has a bolivar wants to get rid of it like a hot potato because they expect it\u0027s not going to be worth anything tomorrow.The International Monetary Fund estimated in January that Venezuela\u0027s inflation rate could rise as high as 13,000 percent for all of 2018. Professor Hanke was unsurprised by the discrepancy, saying no one can accurately forecast the course or the duration of a hyperinflation.In pictures: The crisis in VenezuelaA girl scavanges for food in the streets of CaracasA man scavenges for food next to girls in the streets of Caracas.

A recent university study found that about 90 percent of civilians were living in poverty last year and most of those surveyed had lost an average of 25 pounds in body weight.\u0026nbspThe hyperinflation is devastating the economy, said Andres Abadia, a senior economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He expects the economy to contract in 2018, for a fifth consecutive year, and sees no turnaround in the near-term.Mr Abadia said Venezuela is a disaster area and that as long as Mr Maduro is in power, the economy will continue to collapse. But Mr Maduro reaffirmed his\u0026nbsptight grip on power last month, easily winning\u0026nbspanother six-year term in what was widely condemned as a fraudulent election.\u0026nbspMr Maduro tripled wages earlier in June to 3 million bolivars per month, which Reuters reported at the time was equal to just more than a dollar at the black-market exchange rate.When asked if the wage increase might improve living conditions in Venezuela, Professor Hanke replied: No, it\u0027s a joke.

That, businesses say, could be economically disastrous.

A spokeswoman for Mrs May dismissed concerns the proposal would prevent Britain from striking trade deals with countries outside the EU.She said: It is categorically untrue to suggest that we will not be able to strike a trade deal with the US.The PM has always been clear that we will seek a comprehensive and ambitious trade deal with the US.Today\u0027s meeting will not be plain sailing. Mrs May\u0027s Brexit minister, David Davis, has sent her a letter describing the plan as unworkable, a source close to him said.Brexit latest: David Davis and Brexiteer ministers have held a private meeting ahead of ChequersThose wanting a clean break from the EU fear being kept in the EU\u0027s customs sphere, seeing it as a betrayal of Brexit that would curtail Britain\u0027s freedom to negotiate deals with non-EU countries.Tory MP Owen Paterson said: We would be out of Europe but still run by Europe.Business minister Greg Clark said he was confident ministers would reach an agreement on future customs plans, with the government focused on supporting jobs.Even if she finds agreement at home, Mrs May still faces the hard task of winning the support of the EU, which poured cold water on her previous suggestions for customs arrangements.Today Mrs May met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin and restated her wish to negotiate a deep trade and security partnership after Brexit, her spokesman said.Mrs Merkel again stressed it was the European Commission leading the Brexit negotiations, rather than member states. That may have dampened Mrs May\u0027s hope of winning support from Germany before the Chequers meeting.David Davis meets EU\u0027s chief negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels ahead of a crunch meeting of European Union leaders later this week                    AFPGetty Images1 of 10British Brexit minister David Davis (L) and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier meet at the European Commission in BrusselsWith the clock ticking towards a March departure date and passions running high, Mrs May needs to thrash out an agreement with Brussels urgently.Mrs May was forced to ditch her preferred option for a customs partnership, which would have seen Britain collecting tariffs on goods entering the country on the EU\u0027s behalf, under pressure from Brexit campaigners in her government.They had backed a streamlined customs arrangement now known as max fac, which would see trusted traders allowed to cross borders freely with the aid of automated technology.The facilitated customs arrangement is described by her aides as a way to use the best bits of both options.Mrs May\u0027s plan suggests there will be a type of customs union for physical goods, something that should please manufacturers. But based on the detail offered so far, there is little on how Britain\u0027s much larger services sector would trade with the EU.Several ministers suggested they would read over the plan later on Thursday, ready for a meeting which is expected to run late into the evening.

Will Prince Harry and Meghan Markle attend Prince Louis\u0026rsquo christening?And next week, like his older brother Prince George, Prince Louis will be baptised in the same Chapel, which is famously remembered for the wedding of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in 1840, and is a popular choice for royal christenings.Before George, the last royal to be christened in the Royal Chapel had been Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson\u0026rsquos daughter Princess Beatrice, in December 1988.The event will be the first official outing as a family of five for the Cambridge\u0026rsquos, and Prince Louis\u0026rsquo first public appearance since he was welcomed into the world.The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, will conduct the ceremony, and Prince Louis will wear a replica of the famous Honiton lace christening gown - the original was made in 1841 for the christening of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert\u0026rsquos first child Princess Victoria.The event will be Prince Louis\u0027 first public appearance since he was born in AprilLike his older brother Prince George, Prince Louis will be baptised in the Royal ChapelPrince Louis will wear a replica of the famous Honiton lace christening gownThe ceremony will feature some special water from the River Jordan in the Middle East, which is usually flown to the UK for royal children.It is likely the special water was used for Meghan\u0026rsquos baptism earlier this year, and some was flown in for Princess Charlotte\u0026rsquos baptism in 2015.There will be an intimate guest list, with members of both the Royal Family and the Middleton family in attendance.The Queen is expected to attend her great-grandson\u0026rsquos christening despite recent health worries.Last week, the Queen pulled out of a ceremony at St Paul\u0026rsquos Cathedral to mark the 200th anniversary of the Order of St Michael and St George, as she was feeling \u0026ldquounder the weather, according to Buckingham Palace.Prince Louis and Meghan will both have been baptised at St James\u0027 Palace after next week"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/183x122/984516_1.jpg","title":"Meghan Markle Prince Harry less tactile hand holding royal engagement professional","story":"The Royal couple were previously pictured holding hands at nearly every Royal engagement, with the former actress affectionately holding her husband\u0027s arm and patting his back at Prince Charles\u0026rsquos birthday celebration at Buckingham Palace in May.However the couple have since been seen avoiding hand-holding and public displays of affection at official engagements, and experts believe it may come down to a question of professionalism.Commenting on the shift in dynamic, etiquette expert William Hanson told the Mail: \u0026ldquoPrince Harry has probably felt less of a need to hold Meghan\u0027s hand as she seems to be much more confident and secure in her new role, and so needs less emotional and physical support from her now-husband.\u0026ldquoPublic displays of affection, such a hand holding, may be accepted in private situations and in social spheres, but when out in public Harry and Meghan are on official business and so it is not considered professional behaviour.

However, isolated showers are possible in Northern Ireland and south east England.Saturday to Monday - Dry and very warm with sunshine in most areas. However, cloudier in the far north and north west with a little patchy rain and drizzle at times and a cooler feel.The World Meteorological Organisation definition of a heatwave is when the daily maximum temperature of more than five consecutive days exceeds the average maximum temperature by 5C, the normal period being 1961-1990.They are most common in summer when high pressure develops across an area.High-pressure systems are slow moving and can persist over an area for a prolonged period of time such as days or weeks.They can occur in the UK due to the location of the jet stream, which is usually to the north of the UK in the summer.This can allow high pressure to develop over the UK resulting in persistent dry and settled weather.The scorching summer of 1976 was the hottest summer since records began.It led to a severe drought owing to the exceptionally dry conditions, although it is thought that 1995 was drier.In the summer of 1976, Heathrow had 16 consecutive days over 30C from June 23 to July 8, and for 15 consecutive days from June 23 to July 7 temperatures reached 32.2C somewhere in England.But the single hottest temperature of 38.5C was set on August 10, 2003.When the mercury shoots up there are several obvious precautions to take.It is advised to make sure you drink a lot of water to make sure you stay hydrated during the hot spell.Keeping a bottle of sunscreen with you to soak up those UV rays is also highly advisable as is ensuring you have a hat to prevent sunstroke."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-9.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"720\" width=\"960","title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"So if youre after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further.Sign up to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun 10 - Receive the 10 biggest and best stories of the day, as selected by our editors, sent straight to your inbox so you’re always in the know.Money - The best deals and advice for you and your family.Fabulous - All the hottest trends in fashion and beauty, celeb news and juicy real-life stories.Football - The best columnists, unmissable highlights from your favourite players and clubs and more.TV\u0026ampShowbiz - Get all the latest celebrity and TV news directly into your inbox.Even better, the newsletters learn what you like, so over time you’ll see more of what you want and less of what you don’t.

Not Piers, who went on to issue a further challenge: “On Thursday night, you can watch England destroy Belgium, then watch me destroy Love Island straight after.”So I did. No further comment is needed on the first bit of Piers’ equation. But, hell on TV earth, I can’t ignore the second.A “one-off special” called Good Evening Britain which attempted to cash in on the breakfast magic and must have seemed like a great idea until England v Belgium became a loser-takes-all non-event, the wardrobe department shoved Susanna Reid into a Spanish Flamenco dancer’s outfit and someone lost control of the guest list.’Cos all of the pre-publicity for this one assured me there’d be just three present: Danny Dyer, the Labour Party leader and a slightly spooked Pamela Anderson, who set the first alarm ringing by claiming: “When they told me Jeremy Corbyn’s going to be here I thought this was going to be a serious political ­programme.”Why the hell a dissembling old fool like Corbyn would make anyone think that is a bit of a mystery, but ­serious was the last word you’d use to describe Good Evening Britain.They weren’t alone either. The joint was jumping, in fact, with David Ginola, Amir Khan, Ed Balls, Tory MP James Cleverly, Harry Redknapp, BGT comic Daliso Chaponda and live feeds from a reporter in Russia and Andi Peters at Emmerdale’s Woolpack pub.As GEB quickly demonstrated, of course, the reason chat shows don’t invite nine guests to appear is that you instantly have nine chaotic voices clamouring for attention and often talking at cross-purposes.All it then takes is one guest to throw a spanner in the works and the whole vibe collapses, as it duly did when Piers and Susanna started asking Pammie about her French footballer boyfriend, Adil Rami, who she claimed was “doing really well”.Susanna: “He’s not played yet.” I haven’t been watching, I’ve been looking after my father who’s just had a stroke.” When someone drops a bombshell like that, clearly, you need to steer the conversation away pretty sharpish which, in fairness, Piers did by asking Amir Khan: “Do you have a sex ban before fights?”Only with his wife, I’d imagine, Piers, but thanks for asking. It set the perfectly awkward tone for the entire evening. For GEB to be classed as a true TV disaster, though, it still needed three other things to happen.The first were technical glitches, which duly arrived when the satellite link to a bunch of drunk England fans went down. The second was Andi Peters referring to Emmerdale as “Coronation Street”. Check.The third and most important, however, was for one of the guests to get a bit sweary and lairy. Enter Danny Dyer who ensured GEB will enter TV folklore, when he launched into Brexit, asking: “What’s happened to that t**t David Cameron? He’s in Nice with his trotters up. He should be held to account for it . . . t**t.”The far more pertinent bit of his ­contribution, though, was the moment he addressed the host: “Just stop talking, Piers. Just talkin’ talkin’, ramblin’ on.”Breakfast TV would be a hopelessly dull, molly-coddling chore again without Piers’ ego and all his boastful predictions, which just for the record, ended with the following score, on Thursday.Good Evening Britain — 2.91million viewers. Love Island — 3.2million. Boom.Martin Keown: “When you play in midfield you’ve got to have legs.”Guy Mowbray: “We haven’t seen anything of Di Maria in Argentina’s first three games. Although he only played in two of them.”Alan Shearer: “Portugal were very much like Portugal.”And Lee Dixon: “We’ve had five balls that have gone flat. Three times that’s happened.”(Compiled by Graham Wray).WHATEVER our differences elsewhere, I hope there’s one thing on which we’re all agreed.The greatest quiz show in television history is Bullseye.An opinion confirmed when I tapped those magic eight letters into my Sky Planner’s search engine last week, and its back catalogue unfurled before me, including episode one of series one, which, for a TV critic, is like finding the source of the Nile.I don’t expect you to watch every episode, obviously, but if you have time for one, make it episode eight of series two. It’s as funny, heart-warming and brilliantly formatted as you remember. But the most remarkable thing is, hardly any of it would now be considered fit for broadcast.For not only is Jocky Wilson smoking a fag as he attempts the 301 or more challenge, Jim Bowen, can’t help drawing attention to a facial scar on a contestant’s face.“You’ve obviously had an accident, tell us how.” “I was 11 years old, it was a petrol can blew up on a building site.” “Lovely to be able to talk about that, smashing.”Broadsheet newspaper columnists, right-on comedians and other handbag-clasping s of the nation’s morals will, of course, say: “Well thank goodness we’ve moved on since then.” Which is precisely the reason none of them will ever create a show as beautiful as Bullseye or say anything remotely as funny as the bellowing climax to the prize board, on show eight.Bully’s special prize?“What every woman dreams of. A full-length Scandinavian mink coat.”RANDOM TV irritations: Jeremy Corbyn’s insanely annoying habit of giving a triumphant little sniff every time he thinks he’s made a good point.BBC presenters turning Aneurin Bevan into the L Ron Hubbard of their NHS cult. News ­reporters describing everything that’s happened quite a lot as being: “On an industrial scale.”Over-familiar BBC continuity announcers suddenly greeting me with a: “Hi, I’m Russell.” (Don’t care.) And a bite massage therapist from Hollywood called Doctor Dot failing to provide the necessary health and safety warning before she told This Morning’s Eamonn Holmes: “Ruth’s going to be biting you tonight.”’Cos she’d have bitten off more than she could chew if she did.The Chase USA, Brooke Burns: “Alphabetically, what day of the week comes first?” Andy: “Tuesday.”The Chase Australia, Andrew O’Keefe: “In which decade of the 19th Century was the Crimean War fought?”Simon: “The 1950s.”Andrew O’Keefe: “TV series Twin Peaks is set in which fictional town?”Dan: “Transylvania.”“No, Twin Peaks.” NHS cultists gathered last week to applaud, grovel, sing, dance and grin like madmen in its honour.I exaggerate a bit, obviously. The singing and dancing doesn’t begin until tomorrow night on ITV.It was still an unsettling experience though, watching BBC2’s NHS At 70: Live, from The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, in Birmingham, hosted by Anita Rani a level eight cultist from The One Show, Nick Robinson and Helen Skelton, who was in the maternity unit warning that we may “hear screaming”.As well as the massed ranks of staff, there were also NHS bigwigs and former patients who were encouraged to stand, clap and thank nurses, doctors, ambulancemen, chemists, the woman on reception, everyone.The nasty suspicion is, of course, that all this BBC worship, which makes Kim Jong-un’s birthday celebrations look really half-ar*ed, carries a political edge and is designed to shut down every single argument apart from the ones that say:A)The NHS needs more money. Or B) the NHS needs a s***load more money.As righteous as it might make them all feel, however, deep down they know it makes for wretchedly dull television.Hence the presence, on this one, of Britain’s Got Talent winner Lost Voice Guy, who not even the resuscitation unit could help with gags like: “Laughter is the best medicine. So instead of going to hospital when you crack your head open you will be prescribed tickets to go and see Russell Brand . . .”AAAAAAAAARRGH!The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “In 2017 which Hollywood star was made a dame at the age of 100?”Will: “Joan Collins.” Oof.King Kylian Mbappe taking the World Cup by the scruff of the neck with France’s thrilling 4-3 victory over Argentina.The Sky Planner’s damningly accurate verdict on Bear’s Mission With Warwick Davis: “Contains scenes of moderate peril.”Love Island narrator Iain Stirling breaking into a water fight discussion to announce: “God I’m lonely.” And the magnificent Laura going all Malcolm Tucker on Wes after he admitted he wanted to “crack on with Megan”.“Do me a favour then, f*** off.” Truly, hell hath no fury like a Scottish woman scorned.GOOD Morning Britain, Wednesday,  rent-a-gob Afua “problematic” Hirsch says: “I am English, but why do I feel uncomfortable ­answering that question?”Because if you ever stopped playing the professional victim and admitted this great liberal democracy had afforded you all the most ­extraordinary privileges in life, including an ­expensive private education, you’d swiftly have no point, purpose, job or income, obviously.ON Monday’s This Morning, the arrival of “Britain’s Sexiest Cow”, a Jersey milker called Char, prompted the obvious Schofield question: “What was the competition?”Two Friesians, an English Longhorn and Naomi Campbell, I’d imagine.THIS week’s winner is Simon Cowell and a Hawaiian feather god from the Royal Academy’s forthcoming Oceania exhibition, which you’ve probably booked already.Emailed in by Spud, of London.Picture research: Amy Reading.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But they do.Remarkably, one in 20 British nurseries is banning superhero costumes because they believe these colourful outfits are making our children aggressive.This attempted taming of tots doesn’t stop there though.Four in five nurseries won’t allow any weapons — whether they are plastic pirate ­cutlasses or harmless pop guns.This is totally wrong.When I was with my mates on the school yard or messing about on building sites I ­pretended to be Superman or ­a soldier, replaying what I had seen in John Wayne war films.These games teach you vital lessons that you will carry on into later life, like I did with the military.There is kinship, holding your own and negotiating with the kid who is getting a bit rowdy.I learned right and wrong, how to ­interact with others and when I was ­stepping out of line.But it didn’t make me think: “I want to join the Army and kill everyone.” ­Everyone plays those games, and some become accountants.I certainly allowed my daughter to play “fighting” and there is no evidence such activities make people more violent.When kids get out their toy swords or bows there is laughter and joy.This is about the normal competitive urge. Whether it’s sport, watching The X Factor or wishing to be top in your class, there is a desire to win.It is wrong to pretend ­otherwise, because when these kids enter the real world of work they will face a very ­competitive atmosphere.If you don’t fight to get to the top, you will go under.We can’t all be soft and cuddly. ­Societies need people with different talents and attitudes.There is a clear antipathy towards the armed services as a career in these ­nursery bans.Britain is struggling to find new recruits at the moment, and the last thing we need is children growing up believing this is a bad choice.Being a soldier, sailor or part of the RAF are valid ­professions. We need these real-life superheroes.My daughter considered ­joining the Armed Forces. She looked into the idea of a ­military scholarship when she was 18.I was all for that, but in the end she decided upon ­something else.There is an idea that these games are just for boys, but girls want to be involved as well.Warfare is part of our genetic make up.It has been like this since the time of hunter-gatherers who had to defend their food sources — first their hunting grounds then later, when we became farmers, our lands.The reason we have been so successful as a species is the ability to defend ­ourselves.Back in medieval times kids would play with wooden swords and it was once ­obligatory for all males aged over 14 to practise the longbow on Sundays.We all go “ahhh” when we see puppies or kittens tussling and rolling about with their siblings, but what they are doing is learning to defend themselves.The idea that stopping any gameplay which involves ­fighting is going to change hundreds of thousands of years of human development is ­nonsensical.The complaint that toy weapons fuel a chaotic atmosphere in our nurseries is nothing more than a sign of laziness among the employers and employees.They are taking the easy route by simply banning lively games. This is more about making life easier for the staff than it is about helping our kids. They just want the ­children sitting there passively, possibly watching television or playing on a tablet.That is not what young ­children are about. They have a huge amount of energy to burn, and it is wrong to corral them into increasingly sedate life-styles.We have enough problems with obesity without demanding the next generation sit quietly all day long.The truth is that children will use up calories when they run around pretending to be in Star Wars or The Incredibles.The staff shouldn’t be bringing their own political ideas into the playground. They shouldn’t be making the children conform to what they think. Instead they should be focusing on ­fostering the imaginations of children by allowing them to explore these ideas.Steve Jobs, who helped to bring the iPhone and the iPad to the world, was inspired by Star Trek, and there were quite a few people getting zapped on that.By allowing children to play cops and robbers or pirates or cowboys or superheroes they are developing storytelling skills which will be vital in their ­education.Do we want them to come to read ­William Shakespeare with no prior ­knowledge of what conflict is?Any writer will tell you great storytelling needs drama and to have drama you need conflict.Going back as far as Greek literature there was greed, envy and jealousy underpinning the narrative. These nurseries fail to recognise the quality of the gameplay generated by young minds.They should be harnessing the roleplay and getting involved. The staff could ask why one person is always the baddie and what the kids enjoy about being the goodie.Superhero movies always contain a ­positive moral tale that children can learn from. There is good, there is evil, there is a recognition that someone has acted wrongly and they explore ways to improve our behaviour.When kids play cops and robbers, it is the police who win.The baddie always gets their comeuppance and the cops are the smarter ones.It’s not about arming our children with guns, it’s about arming them with the tools they need to be more creative.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She was with a tall crew-mate. They were both drinking vodka straight out of the bottle and talking quite loudly.I left them there to go and watch Englands World Cup match at Le Grotte, a bar near the quayside. It is the one all the crews favour. I did not see Rebecca there, though it was quite crowded.I invited her and her colleague to join me and a member of my crew to the Jacuzzi on our sundeck. She said something about a great result for England, but wasnt making a lot of sense otherwise.She was still drinking vodka but could only manage three sips or so. I had to help her down from the sundeck when she left around midnight.Her colleague stayed behind. I got her off the boat OK, and helped her onto her own gangway. I could not go on with her because it was private.Rebecca was very unsteady on her feet. The last I saw of her was when she entered the doors to the ship. It is very sad.Earlier reports that she had left the boat to visit the local bar were incorrect, according to a crew member who said she watched the game aboard the Polonia.The Maltese-registered vessel had arrived at the Italian port last week and was undergoing a changeover ahead of a new arrival.Crew members raised the alarm in the morning when she failed to turn up for breakfast and found her lifeless in her cabin.Colonel Pier Enrico Burri, of the Imperia Carabinieri, yesterday told The Sun Online: The cause of death is still unknown but it seems as though she may have stumbled or slipped inside her cabin and hit her head or neck hard, breaking her vertebrae.She seems to have died between 12pm and 1am and her body was found about 8am. An Italian member of crew rang to alert us.The body was on the floor. The cabin was single, she slept there alone and very small as they are on boats. Her suitcases were on the floor as though she were rearranging things.She may have hit her head on the door of the cabin or while getting her suitcase down. These cabins are very constrained.He added: There was no blood and no traces of violence or other people. It seems as if no one else was on board when she died.The autopsy has to be done still but it looks like an accident.And Matteo Andracco, the lawyer representing the boats owners, said the boats chief engineer heard her alarm go off about 6.30am.After a few minutes when she didnt turn it off he went in and saw she was not moving, so they called an ambulance. In her room there were two levels, a lower level with the bed and an upper level with a small bathroom.It seems likely she fell down the five or six steps between the levels. So far nobody is under investigation. Police believe it was just an unlucky accident.Neighbours of Rebeccas, in Londons trendy Notting Hill, paid tribute to her, saying she was a genuinely nice person who always said hello.One, called Chris, said: She never caused any trouble here. She kept herself to herself, but always said hello to me and my kids.He added: Its genuinely shocking to hear, she was so young. Its always the nice ones it happens to.

longest hotspell britain 42 years","story":"Today is our 11th day of high temperatures hovering around 28C, although showers will briefly roll in across the South today.And we are on course to beat the summer of 1976 when 16 consecutive days of scorching hot weather led to the worst drought in 150 years.Meteorologist Emma Slater told The Times: The long-range trend is for above average temperatures staying until the end of July.Temperature records are being broken worldwide during the current heatwave sweeping from North America across Europe and Asia.A world record highest sustained temperature was recorded in Quriyat, Oman, at the end of June — where locals had to cope with a minimum of 42.6C over 24hrs.Meanwhile, 47C was recorded in Ottowa, Canada this week, while residents in Ahvaz, Iran hit a record 54C.In the UK, record temperatures were recorded in Belfast (29.5C) and Glasgow (31.9C) — where the weatherproof roof of the citys Science Centre melted in the heat.Heavy rain and showers today will only briefly intrude on the summer scorcher.Up to 20mm is expected to fall in the south east — but the stormy weather is set to clear for Super Saturday as England take on Sweden in the World Cup quarter finals.It will also be the first weekend of Wimbledon and the London Pride march — with pub industry insiders predicting an extra eight million pints will be sold as Brits flock to beer gardens.A hosepipe ban was activated in Northern Ireland on June 29 and restrictions in England, Wales and Scotland are expected to follow.Anyone caught using a hosepipe could end up in court and be given a £1,000 fine.However, it seems homeowners are ignoring the pleas from water firms as sales of sprinklers at Wickes have rocketed by 600 per cent, the Daily Star reports.Sales of the Hozelock part which attaches to garden hoses have also gone up by 135 per cent.A Wickes spokesman said: “To see demand for sprinklers increase so significantly in the last four weeks suggests customers are opting to use a sprinkler while simultaneously enjoying all that summer has to offer.”Overall temperatures will be around 82F (28C) for the 11th consecutive day today.This is expected to trigger some torrential downpours and thunderstorms — a jarring end to several days of a 30C-plus heatwave.Parts of the south west including Dorset have already had a washout — and more southeasterly areas will see the rainfall today.But the showers will clear quickly as the we approach the weekend when sunny skies and high temperatures will take hold once again.Met Office forecaster Nicola Maxey said: “These downpours are actually part of the heatwave.“All signs suggest that it is going to carry on until the end of the month and possibly beyond.”Some patchy cloud will be the only spoiler on an otherwise sunny 30C day on Friday in the south — with an even warmer picture in store for a day of sport on Saturday.The highest temperature is expected to be recorded in the London area on Saturday with 31C or 32C forecast.Elsewhere it will stay largely dry and warm on Friday and Saturday across the UK.Light drizzle is expected to affect northwestern parts at times over the weekend but it will mainly be a sunny picture across the country.Met Office forecaster Becky Mitchell told The Sun Online: Today many places will still be warm and sunny, but with a slightly fresher feel in the north west.There is a risk of rain with some heavy and thundery showers in southern England this afternoon and into the evening, while it remains largely dry elsewhere.Into the weekend, an area of high pressure will move in bringing dry weather with sunshine for most places.There could be some cloudy patches in northern and northwestern areas but otherwise it will be a clear.On Saturday the highest temperature could be 31C or higher in the London area."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000418359725.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"uk heatwave river teme photos dries up","story":"The River Teme has

jewellery at home and was just wearing a pair of stud earrings, her engagement ring and wedding ring.But the former Suits actress still looked glamorous in a yellow dress which was designed by Lady Gagas stylist, Brandon Maxwell.She had her hair in a bun for the event which was hosted by Commonwealth Secretary-General Baroness Scotland.Prior the event, royal fans had been speculating that the pair had stopped holding hands in public after Harry appeared to rebuff her attempts last week.Before their wedding in Windsor, Berks, the couple were always openly affectionate in public, possibly more so than other royal couple.But last week Meghan moved her hand in her husband’s direction at the Young Leaders Reception at Buckingham Palace - but he quickly clasped his hands away from her.It soon emerged that Harry, 33, was following traditional etiquette.Body language expert Robin Kermode previously told the MailOnline: “The Queen rarely holds hands with her husband in public and this seems to have set an unwritten precedent for the other royals.”Harrys brother Prince William typically avoids holding hands with the Duchess of Cambridge during official visits.But it seems they are not following traditional etiquette as they were seen holding hands at the Your Commonwealth Youth Challenge reception on Thursday afternoon.It marks the culmination of the Commonwealth Secretariats youth leadership workshop.The workshop brings together the newly-elected Commonwealth Youth Council Executive and leaders of the Commonwealth youth networks.It aims to encourage them to think about the future, and their role in shaping it.The royal couple will meet those who have taken part to hear about their ideas, including individuals from Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga ahead of

calories a day on holiday","story":"Healthy eating goes out the window for most when they are away from their own kitchen, and fridge, a survey found.Almost two thirds admitted to gaining weight on a trip away from home.And another one in three who are regularly on-the-go confessed to increasing their calorie intake to 3,000 calories or more a day.Three quarters confessed to overeating and dinner time is the meal they are most likely to overindulge at, with the research also finding women are more likely to gorge themselves than men.The study of 2,000 adults also found eating on-the-go and a lack of home-cooked meals are the main causes for over indulging while on holiday or business.Furthermore it emerged more than half wished they could eat more domestic comfort meals while staying at hotels.Raul Ortiz, VP of global brand marketing for Staybridge Suites and Candlewood Suites at IHG, which carried out the study, said: “Our research clearly shows Brits miss home-cooked, fresh meal choices while travelling.Our guests are often away from home for days or weeks at a time and we want to give them the option to cook for themselves as if they were in the comfort of their own home.British Chef and television food presenter, Matt Tebbutt, has teamed up with Staybridge Suites® to create ‘Tastes of Home’ - easy, home-cooked recipes which guests can cook while staying at the hotel.Matt Tebbutt said: “As someone who is constantly on the road, I know how easy it is to overindulge when you’re eating out every day and night.“That’s why I’m thrilled to partner with Staybridge Suites to bring their guests quick, easy and tasty recipes that they can enjoy from the comfort of their suite.“I’ve created variations on some of the nation’s favourites, including a healthier Fish and Chips, a unique twist on a traditional Spaghetti Bolognese, and a mouth-watering Ditalini pasta dish with poached chicken and a tarragon dressing. I can’t wait for guests to give them a try.”The study also found the fear of not having home comforts leads to some travellers bringing their own food items along on the trip.Being a nation of tea lovers, a quarter keep their own stash of teabags in their luggage to ensure their brews are exactly how they like them.One in nine ensure they have packets of crisps on hand and one in 10 keep cereals tucked away.Roast dinner with Yorkshire pudding, fish and chips and spaghetti bolognaise were revealed as the top three dishes missed most when living away from home.Over half have felt guilty about their eating habits away from home, with one in 10 feeling so guilt-ridden they will even lie to their partner about their diet.And four in 10 said eating out with others impacts their ability to make healthy choices.Ortiz added: “While staying at Staybridge Suites, guests have access to a spacious, fully equipped kitchen with all the utensils they need, and thanks to Matt’s recipes, they can now enjoy a new take on a ‘Taste of Home’ even when they’re on the road.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The number of miles clocked up by vans on the roads – 50.5billion - is up almost 70 per cent on 1997.Car use also rose to a new record level despite sky-high petrol prices given the chaos on the railways and councils cutting bus services.A 30 per cent rise would take total miles in 2040 to 425.1billion.Motoring campaigners urged the Government to invest in the road network – or see Brits locked in ever longer traffic jams.Jack Cousens, head of roads policy for the AA, stormed: “The huge rise in van traffic shows a change in consumer habits with the steady rise of online shopping – as well as more people turning to self-employment.“But car use also shows no sign of slowing down any time soon, so more investment is needed to tackle the problem.“Potholes on the roads are a national disgrace and a key contributor to congestion levels. The Government most get a grip.”Howard Cox, co-founder of FairFuel UK said: “A growing population, internet delivery and poor public transport means more people are driving.“Time to scrap HS2 and put the vanity cash where it’s needed - into roads and public transport to benefit the whole of the UK.”The 327billion miles clocked up on Britain’s roads included record levels on the motorways – nearly 70 billion miles.

and could quit if they fail.The whole Cabinet is staging a 12-hour meeting at Chequers, the PMs country home, to decide on the UKs negotiating stance.Ministers are having their phones taken off them so they cant leak any details or appeal for support from aides and allies.Downing Street chiefs hope the PM can emerge late tonight with a fully formed Brexit plan - avoiding the constant sniping which has marked the process so farMrs May has angered Brexit backers by proposing a plan which would tie us closely to Brussels rules in a bid to keep trade flowing freely.Half a dozen Eurosceptic ministers held a separate meeting last night to hammer out their own stance.They will tell the PM she must keep Britain free to set our own rules on goods - or risk losing out on a bumper trade deal with the US.Mrs May is braced for senior figures such as Boris Johnson and David Davis to walk out if she cant talk them round.Number 10 has reportedly drawn up plans for an emergency reshuffle so the big beasts can be rapidly replaced if they do resign.But in a boost for the PM, its claimed Boris met David Cameron last night - and the former Prime Minister convinced him he has to back Mrs May.The PM also won round Trade Secretary Liam Fox, a passionate Brexiteer, by holding one-on-one talks with him in Downing Street after his meeting with the other pro-Leave ministers.The other Brexiteers who are still on the fence include Michael Gove, Penny Mordaunt, Esther McVey and Andrea Leadsom.Mrs Mays de facto deputy David Lidington was sent out to bat for her this morning to persuade wavering ministers they should pledge support.The New Customs Partnership which would see Britain collect tariffs on behalf of the EU was rejected outright by Brexiteers in the Cabinet.And trade experts warned that the technology needed to make Max Fac - a solution which replaces border controls with electronic monitoring - work wont be ready in time for Brexit.The third way is designed to bring a compromise on customs between the two systems.Britain would scrap the blanket tariffs applied by the EU on most goods coming in from outside Europe, and instead set its own import duties.That is essential in letting the UK strike new trade deals with the rest of the world, with goods coming in tariff-free from countries such as the US.But to enable big companies to continue using supply chains which span the whole of Europe, Britain will continue to apply EU tariffs on around 4 per cent of products - classified as unfinished goods.And European tariffs will also be put on goods which pass through Britains ports on their way to the EU, but never enter the domestic economy.Another measure which would tie the UK closely to the EU is Mrs Mays proposal for full regulatory alignment for goods.That means Britain would copy European regulations on what products can be sold in shops.Its intended to ensure goods can still be imported and exported freely, while avoiding curbs on the services sector which makes up most of our economy.But it could prove controversial because it may hinder trade deals with countries who have different standards for their goods.He told the BBCs Today programme: What the PM is wanting to do today is to have a package of proposals that delivers on the referendum vote.We need to do that in a way that minimises the disruption to British jobs, British trade and investment in our country.But ex-minister David Jones warned: This is going to be less than the full Brexit that weve had repeated promises of from the Prime Minister.Nicky Morgan, the former Education Secretary turned pro-EU rebel, said any Cabinet ministers who cant get behind the PM should quit rather than sniping at her internally.She added: What we cannot see is a position that is briefed out tomorrow morning and over the next 48 hours Cabinet ministers begin to undermine and query it.Arriving at the summit today, Chief Whip Julian Smith - who is central to ensuring Mrs Mays plans can make it through the Commons - said he was ready and raring to do.And Liz Truss, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, revealed she was preparing for the marathon meeting by eating a breakfast of cold pizza.Mr Smiths deputy Chris Pincher last night asked Tory MPs to show public support for the Prime Minister by tweeting out a message of unity ahead of the Chequers talks.But Labour have mocked the summit -

Tea party is likely to give way to pyjama party as warring Tory ministers drag talks at Chequers late into the night. It\u0027ll be anything but a happy occasion. Tories are already at war in public and it\u0027s the biggest Tory showdown of her premiership. The issues are tricky to grasp - but the result will be felt in the pockets of millions of hard-working mums, dads, students and workers. And it could all prompt a string of resignations - or even a leadership battle. Here\u0027s a quick explanation of what\u0027s going to happen.  Chequers is the stuffy 16th Century stately home in Buckinghamshire that is the retreat of the Prime Minister of the day. It was used as a rural bolthole by wartime leader Winston Churchill, who made morale-boosting broadcasts to the nation from its rooms. Prime Ministers down the years have hosted foreign leaders in its luxury.  Margaret Thatcher entertained American president Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, while Tony Blair welcomed US president Bill Clinton.   The Cabinet is being summoned to Chequers from 9.30am on Friday 6 July. Ministers have reportedly been told to surrender their phones to prevent leaks. They have also reportedly been warned the meeting could drag on for more than 12 hours until 10pm. Who\u0027s going?  The entire Cabinet of more than 20 ministers is expected to be at the summit. This is more than Theresa May\u0027s 11-strong inner circle, the Brexit \u0027war Cabinet\u0027, that met at Chequers last time. Importantly, the full Cabinet is thought to have more of a \u0027soft Brexit\u0027 majority than the inner circle. This could change the result. What\u0027s this all about?  There\u0027s lots of detail (see below!) but it all comes down to this.  Do we want Hard Brexit or Soft Brexit?  Tories are painfully, irreversibly split on whether to cut ties with the EU or hold them close. With big decisions needed by October, Theresa May is going to have to come off the fence and - at least a bit - choose one side or the other. What is actually getting discussed?  Ministers are being asked to sign off a \u0027White Paper\u0027 on Brexit. White Papers are a document, traditionally printed on (you guessed it) white paper, that represent the view of the government. The White Paper will set out more detail of what kind of relationship Britain wants with the EU after we leave properly on 31 December 2020. Once it\u0027s signed off, Theresa May is planning a tour of European capitals to sell the idea to leaders before EU bureaucrats begin their summer holiday. Why is customs so important?  The EU has a \u0027customs union\u0027. This means the 28 states trade EU goods for free - and set an equal tariff on non-EU goods. For example, US car imports to the EU are taxed at 10%. Being in this customs union helps the UK, because the EU is our biggest trading partner and it prevents lorry checks at the border. Theresa May wants the UK to leave it because otherwise, Britain will have to follow EU rules and cannot strike trade deals around the world. But not only has this created a headache of how to keep the border open between Northern Ireland (UK) and the Republic (EU). It\u0027s also opened up a huge row with Brussels, because it\u0027ll have to solve the key riddle about Brexit - hard, or soft. So the Prime Minister has been drawing up a ready-made plan for future customs which will be at the heart of the White Paper. What are our options?      At first, Britain was looking at two options.   Customs partnership: Liked by Remainers, branded idiotic by Brexiteers.  Britain would stick close to EU tariffs on imports and collect them on behalf of the EU. If the UK tariff is lower than the EU one, firms would be able to reclaim the difference.   Maximum Facilitation - \u0027Max Fac\u0027: Liked by Brexiteers, but could cost firms \u0026pound20bn a year.  Would keep the UK separate from Brussels rules. High-tech tracking devices would try to cut bureaucracy. E.g. Trusted” firms could pay tariffs at regular intervals, not every time they cross a border.   Now ministers are set to consider this \u0027third way\u0027:   Facilitated Customs Arrangement: A compromise. The UK would leave blanket EU tariffs, allowing us to set our own import duties. But if goods are unfinished or destined to end up in the EU, Britain would still collect EU tariffs on Brussels\u0027 behalf. And crucially, the UK would keep many of the same rules - regulatory alignment - as the EU on standards of goods.  Who\u0027s not happy about it?  David Davis, for a start. In an 11th-hour letter to Theresa May, the Brexit Secretary reportedly warned the EU will simply reject the plan. And Brexiteer Tories are furious - after fears emerged the \u0027FCA\u0027 will make it much harder to secure a US trade deal. Under the plan, Britain would closely mirror EU standards on goods. The problem is, the US uses very different rules so would be disadvantaged. Seven Brexiteer Cabinet ministers held quickly-leaked crisis talks the night before the summit in a bid to water down Theresa May\u0027s positiong. Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg told the : “If this is correct this is not Brexit. The common rulebook means that we are essentially a vassal state.  Late, and quite possibly dramatically. If ministers still refuse to sign up to the plan, they could resign. If that happens, expect late-night TV statements in the Buckinghamshire countryside or interviews squished around Saturday\u0027s World Cup clash. This could in turn trigger a Tory leadership battle if 48 MPs declare they have no confidence in Theresa May. Downing Street is braced for resignations. A source told the Politico website No10 has already drawn up an emergency reshuffle plan - adding anyone who quits will have to take a taxi the 40 miles back to London. However, it might be that they all reach agreement - and keep schtum about what they\u0027re not happy with. After all, David Davis has repeatedly threatened to resign, and by now it seems as if he\u0027s crying wolf. And previous showdowns have repeatedly ended in fudge where no one is happy, but no one is upset enough to quit either. What happens next?

Tory Leave-backers held dramatic crisis talks last night just hours before the Prime Minister summoned ministers to agree a \u0027softer\u0027 Brexit plan at a marathon 12-hour clash.  Top Tories were arriving at her 16th Century country retreat this morning in their sleek ministerial cars - and could be leaving after dark in a taxi. A No10 source warned the Prime Minister had already drawn up an emergency reshuffle plan if she\u0027s hit with mass resignations by Brexiteers - and those who quit must take a taxi the 40 miles back to London. The source told the Politico website: A select number of ego-driven, leadership-dominated Cabinet ministers need to support the PM in the best interests of the UK.  Or their spots will be taken by a talented new generation of MPs who will sweep them away. Young Remain voters held aloft a banner declaring your Brexit deal screws our future this morning outside the PM\u0027s Buckinghamshire bolthole. But furious Brexiteer Tories fear the 120-page plan will not be \u0027hard Brexit\u0027 enough. They erupted into fury after it emerged the White Paper, which promises alignment with EU rules on goods, could make a trade deal with the US much harder.  Theresa May\u0027s deputy David Lidington today denied a trade deal with the US would be impossible - and said the claims were pretty selective leaks of gobbets from Cabinet papers.  But he did not deny they were accurate - saying only they were misquoted.  Instead he said: It’s like one of these theatre reviews that says this was not a brilliant performance and it goes up outside as \u0027brilliant\u0027. Mr Lidington said he was “confident the Cabinet will have a “concrete position that everyone will be able to sign up to” when the summit ends at 10pm. But seven top-level Brexiteers including Boris Johnson and Michael Gove were spotted meeting last night in what is expected to be a bid to harden up the plans. Boris Johnson also met former Prime Minister David Cameron, The Times reported - though exactly what they said is disputed. Theresa May has put off key decisions about whether to choose \u0027hard\u0027 or \u0027soft\u0027 Brexit, far or close links with the EU, for months due to Tory splits.

Now she must make hard choices with just weeks of negotiation time left before the EU\u0027s October deadline. The key split is over how customs rules should work after Brexit. Mrs May had put forward two options - but both were rejected. Now she has put forward a third way, known as a Facilitated Customs Arrangement, that would let Britain set its own tariffs on goods in exchange for closely following EU standards. Brexiteer ex-minister David Jones said Theresa May\u0027s deal looked not very good at all.  He warned the red lines of leaving the customs union, single market and jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice would be breached by what is being proposed today. But Remain-backing former Cabinet minister Nicky Morgan said ministers who don\u0027t fall in line should resign. If somebody said \u0027I just cannot live with this, this is not what I want\u0027 then yes, I think that they would have to think about their position, she told the BBC. Tory Mayor of the West Midlands Andy Street urged ministers who refuse to get behind Theresa May’s Brexit strategy to “get off the bus”. Mrs May added: This is about agreeing an approach that delivers decisively on the verdict of the British people – an approach that is in the best interests of the UK and the EU, and crucially, one that commands the support of the public and Parliament. Labour issued a mocking \u0027Cabinet survival kit\u0027 with a can to kick down the road - and a packet of fudge for if Theresa May continues to fudge her options.  Shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman said: Tory infighting over Brexit has got so serious Labour has been left with little choice but to try and offer ministers a helping hand before this latest peace summit. “But there is a serious point to this. Every single day the Government wastes arguing with itself puts jobs and the economy at risk and increases the chances of the UK crashing out without a deal. No deal would be the worst possible outcome for our country. The EU has a \u0027customs union\u0027. This means the 28 states trade EU goods for free - and set an equal tariff on non-EU goods. For example, US car imports to the EU are taxed at 10%. Being in this customs union helps the UK, because the EU is our biggest trading partner and it prevents lorry checks at the border.

The Cabinet must fall in behind her at their Chequers Summit on Friday, giving her an unambiguous mandate to negotiate and agree the best, most realistic, Brexit deal she can with Brussels. And I say this as Chairman of Best for Britain, a leading campaign group calling for an end to Brexit, that has sought to challenge and oppose the Government at every turn. Why? Because our country is a victim of prolonged uncertainty. In recent weeks we have heard how investment in our automotive industry has halved how 14,000 jobs at Airbus could be lost and how we are going to have to fund a growing NHS budget despite shrinking public finances. Investment, workers, skilled and unskilled, are melting away as uncertainty stretches into years if not decades.  At the moment the Prime Minister and her warring team are hiding behind their own disputes over the terms of Brexit to avoid engaging in the real negotiation with Brussels. The reckless personal ambition driving these factions is surely close to treason. Its time to bring these Oxford Union debating games to an end. The British people deserve to be finally told what the vote to Leave will mean in real terms: How will we live up to our historic commitments to both sides in Northern Ireland to allow open and unrestricted trade Which sectors will or won’t enjoy frictionless trade and for how long how will we safeguard our public services in trade deal negotiations what are the government’s concrete proposals to protect our access to clinical trials and to vital medicines and treatments, on which people’s lives depend What is the their plan to maintain cross-border supply chains in our important manufacturing sectors such as the car industry or pharmaceuticals what is the deal for services that comprise a much bigger share of our economy but seem overlooked in the discussions how do we solve the complex issue of freedom of movement "},{"url":null,"title":"cctv shows married city worker","story":"NewsCCTV shows married City worker, 28, dragging teen victim down alley to rape herWARNING - DISTRESSING CONTENT: Sanjay Naker led the young woman from a bar in London Bridge before assaulting and raping her in a sickening 30-minute attack\u0026nbspShareByLucy Clarke-BillingsGrainne Cuffe16:57, 5 JUL 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHorrific CCTV captured the moment a sexual predator dragged an intoxicated teenager to a secluded area to rape her. Top financial consultant Sanjay Naker preyed on his victim after she was asked to leave a bar in London Bridge for being too drunk. The married 28-year-old had been outside the bar at about 4am and started talking to the 18-year-old. On the CCTV, Naker appeared to show concern for her welfare by picking her up when she fell and offering her his jacket. At one point, he gave her a piggback. But then the PricewaterhouseCoopers worker tried to kiss the victim before she pushed him away.  CCTV shows him pulling her in the opposite direction to where she was walking and eventually succeeded, dragging her to a secluded corner on The Queens Walk. He then raped her and sexually assaulted her.  Security staff working nearby went to investigate after seeing the suspicious behaviour on CCTV. They found the teenager unconscious on the ground with her underwear pulled down and called the ambulance. Naker said he had met the victim in a club nearby, gave them his details and left the scene.  The victim was taken to hospital to recover, and later to Haven rape crisis centre where the sexual offences were confirmed. Sanjay Naker, of Wood Green, London, was jailed for eight years today after being found guilty at Inner London Crown Court of three counts of oral rape, one count of attempted rape and one count of sexual assault.

They also have a habit of sticking. One embarrassing incident in primary school can get you saddled with a cringe-worthy alias for the rest of your life. Even royalty aren\u0027t immune from dodgy nicknames. Just ask the Queen , who has been known to respond to Gary . Now it\u0027s Prince Harry\u0027s turn. The Duke of Sussex has apparently been given a nickname by Meghan\u0027s friend, writer and mental health campaigner Bryony Gordon - and he\u0027s having to put up with it.  So how bad can it be? To be fair, it could be a lot, LOT worse. And given that Prince Charles is believed to call Meghan Tungsten , we think Harry\u0027s actually got off quite lightly.   Bryony revealed on Loose Women that she had her own nickname for the Prince - Hazza. Harry\u0027s apparently not a fan, but according to Bryony, he does the gentlemanly thing and grins and bears it.

The Duchess of Sussex stunned in a mustard yellow dress as the attended the Your Commonwealth Youth Challenge reception at Marlborough House in central London this evening. Meghan, 36, chose a chic number designed by Lady Gaga\u0027s US stylist Brandon Maxwell. The couple smiled warmly as they held hands in front of the crowd.  The newlyweds shared their thoughts on the future of the Commonwealth and how young people can shape the future in the next 20 years or so.

The delegates in the programme, which began in 2013, have been thinking about the future and how to improve world peace. And Harry rallied young people to fight against injustice, inequality and environmental damage in his speach. He said: Amongst all of you are innovators, entrepreneurs, and educators – ready to tackle climate change, social injustice and inequality. Together you will take on these big challenges – and be champions for your communities, for your families, your countries, and our Commonwealth. Meghan and I are incredibly excited to meet so many of you representing the future of the Commonwealth. Later this year we will embark on a tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga. This will be a wonderful opportunity for us to meet and hear from more young people about their ideas for creating a better future.

Julie Shann, 55, says that she was told she had terminal lung cancer with “very little” time left to live.  But the diagnosis turned out to be incorrect.  As Julie began planning for her own funeral, she sold her family heirlooms and precious antiques to pay for the costs, reports the Hull Daily Mail .  A month later and experts in Hull Royal Infirmary told her she had never had the devastating disease, and her doctor was not qualified to give her the diagnosis.  For a month I was made to think that I was dying and had to plan my own funeral - it was absolutely heartbreaking said Julie. I tried to stay strong for my children who were supporting me but also grieving, and gave them a brave face, but behind closed doors I cried and cried. I cried myself to sleep at night and every time I went to bed, I didn\u0027t know if I would be waking up again the next morning. It was so horrible to think that every day could have been my last day. Julie said she had been giving the devastating diagnosis when she visited her GP in January 2015, just two months after suffering a stroke. She says she then began to sell off her possessions, believing she was going to die, including her grandmother\u0027s wedding ring and eternity ring, as well as treasured antiques and gold jewellery that would ordinarily be passed down to her children. I had to sell off nearly all my prized possessions to pay for my funeral as I didn\u0027t have the money for it and didn\u0027t want to leave my family with the burden,” she said. “I had to sell my nana\u0027s wedding ring and eternity ring, all my gold and antiques that I had, all of which were meant to be passed down to my kids.” "},{"url":null,"title":"shocking pictures reveal inside kfc","story":"NewsShocking pictures reveal inside KFC branch that was slammed for \u0027joke\u0027 conditionsThe fast-food outlet in Digby, Exeter, has been accused of having a \u0027shocking\u0027 rat and maggot problem - but it says it has cleaned up its act\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByRichard Amofa20:46, 5 JUL 2018Updated20:58, 5 JUL 2018NewsThe refuse area in Digby\u0027s KFC branch (Image: devonlive WS)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA KFC branch has been branded a \u0027joke\u0027 after a set of shocking pictures showed apparently unclean conditions. The fast-food outlet in Digby, Exeter, has been accused of having a \u0027shocking\u0027 rat and maggot by a former employee. The pictures show inside the restaurant including a rubbish-strewn area, greasy appliances and burnt rice. But KFC has defended the branch saying significant changes have been made - and that it now has a five-star hygiene rating. Greg Cook, 31, who used to work at the restaurant, told Devon Live : “There’s a big maggot and rat problem at that store. “When I used to turn up at 6am for my shift, you would always see them running back to their little dens.  It was a regular issue and customers had even pointed it out to the management. “But if you look at the state of the place and how rubbish is left out all the time, then you can understand why. “The defrosting cabinets are supposed to be cleaned two times a day, but this doesn’t happen, and it got so bad that the place got filled with maggots.” Mr Cook says the stress of working at the KFC outlet took its toll, and he eventually left two months ago in order to move closer to his pregnant girlfriend in Dawlish. He says the stress got so bad a few years ago that he was signed off for a month and was given medication.  And he revealed he was even spat at by one disgruntled customer, who had been told that the restaurant was running low on popcorn chicken . He said: “My hair was falling out, it got that bad. “Things got really bad during the chicken shortage earlier this year as well. “I was even spat at when I told a customer that we were short on popcorn chicken. It was horrible. “All in all, though, the whole place is a joke. The standards are poor and its time people knew what they were putting in their mouths.”  Another previous employee, who can’t be named, backed up Mr Cook\u0027s claims. She told DevonLive: “I once worked there and a guy came out the toilet and didn\u0027t wash his hands and I didn\u0027t say anything. “I saw him scratch his front bits and then batter chicken. “It\u0027s not nice having to serve food when you know what happens behind the scenes.” A KFC spokesperson told Devon Live that changes have recently been made to the management at the store.

Little Hall\u0026eacute Rodgers, who turns three later this month, loves to causs mischief scrawling black eyeliner over the furniture and ordering her parents about. Decorating the sofa and walls in nappy cream and nibbling on blocks of cheese, her parents believe she is one of the most mischievous toddlers in the country. She has mum Chantelle Rodgers, 26, and dad Clive, 27, wrapped around her little finger in their home in Falmouth, Cornwall.  Chantelle, who is a receptionist and has two other young kids with Clive, said: Anyone who knows us will tell you she is the boss of the family, especially when it comes to her dad. She rules him. The temper on her is crazy but my god is it hilarious. She is a proper diva. I call her my sassy, side-eye little miss. She is obsessed with dairy. She goes through 18-24 yoghurts every few days. And if she doesn’t get those yogurts she sulks. Every day I go into the fridge and find Hall\u0026eacute-sized bite marks in our block of cheese. I’ve tried wrapping it in tin foil and hiding it as soon as I buy it but she always finds it. I even tried grating it all and hiding it in a bowl but the next time I went into the kitchen there were just little bits of cheese over the floor and an empty bowl in the fridge. When you confront her she says ‘no, not Hall\u0026eacute’.  Chantelle and Clive say they are always repairing damage the cheeky youngster has caused around the home. One night she managed to make it all the way downstairs and smother the sofa in Sudocrem without making a sound. I still haven’t got all the marks out. On another occasion she got hold of my eyeliner and when Clive and I came upstairs the carpets, the walls, the bedding, everything was covered. When she’s not causing utter chaos, she is trying to give me a heart attack. She can be a bit of a nightmare and with three under five I definitely have my hands full, the mum-to-three added. But the parents admit Hall\u0026eacute is the life and soul of their young family and can brighten the darkest of days in minutes.  Chantelle continued: She is pure entertainment and she makes us all laugh so much, especially her little sister. You can be having the worst day and spending two minutes with Hall\u0026eacute will brighten it. And as well as her mischievous side, Hall\u0026eacute is quite the mother hen. She’s always bossing us about. If someone is walking around upstairs and they’re stomping a bit Hall\u0026eacute will shout up ‘stop banging’ and if they don’t she’ll shout again ‘I told you to stop banging’. She is a funny little thing. She loves getting everyone dressed in the morning and if she comes into the living room and her dad and I have left a couple of cups lying around she’ll go ‘ooh it’s messy in here’. Then she comes in and offers to do the washing up. She’s also always trying to clean up after herself when she makes a mess, bless her.

Passengers have told how people have fainted on trains as they travel home in 28C to 30C heat. Some have hit out at rail firms by comparing the conditions on packed trains to a sauna with no air conditioning and barely any room to move.  But just how hot is it on trains during the heatwave and what are the dangers to your health? An experiment by Essex Live has found that temperatures inside can get much hotter than those outside.   Reporter Hannah Kane took an evening rush hour journey with Greater Anglia from London to Chelmsford to find out exactly how hot it gets. Using a thermometer that measures the temperature indoors, the reporter hopped on the 6pm London Liverpool Street to Clacton train at Stratford, and found that the temperature steadily increased.  5.59pm – Arrive at Stratford  It’s 5.59pm on a busy Wednesday and platform 10 at Stratford is packed with commuters. The 6pm train to Clacton is about to arrive and there are hordes of people standing eagerly on the yellow line, fighting for the best place to stand when the doors open. It’s currently 26.9C outside, so while it’s hot, it’s comfortable as there’s a slight breeze.  6pm – Packed train arrives   My train has arrived at 6pm on the dot and there’s already a surge towards the doors. Looking on the train, I can see it’s already standing room only. I just about make it onto the carriage, pressed up against the door. I can feel the air-conditioning is on, but the thermometer is measuring 27.1C at 6.03pm. It’s only around 30 minutes to Chelmsford, but already I’m feeling the heat.  What’s the carriage like?  There is only room to stand with your feet together and hands by your side. Disgruntled passengers are tightly packed into the seating area and in the walkway. It’s completely silent except for the odd sigh.  6.15pm – Halfway there   The air has become more humid as passengers, including myself, are getting restless. I look down at the thermometer and am not surprised to see it’s risen to 27.9C.  6.16pm – How hot?!   One minute later and it’s risen to 28.4C. Everyone is getting agitated and checking their watches as the train edges closer to Chelmsford.  6.18pm – Hotter inside   The temperature now measures a shocking 29C. I checked the outside temperature and was disheartened to see it was some four degrees cooler, at 25C.  6.21pm – Arrive at Chelmsford   A ripple of relief ran through the train carriage as we pulled into Chelmsford. The temperature had risen to 29.9C. The train doors opened and a flood of people burst out onto the platform. The fresh air was extremely welcome to everyone and seemed to lift the mood considerably.  6.23pm – Getting off the train   It took two minutes to get off the train due to the amount of people crammed onto the carriage. As soon as people began to leave, the temperature decreased to 29.8C.  6.24pm – The end of my journey  I arrived in Chelmsford hot and tired but very happy to get off the train. The temperature rapidly began to cool down once I was off the train and safely on the platform. What is Greater Anglia doing to keep customers cool?  Keeping windows and doors of trains without air conditioning open in the depots to keep a through-flow of air. Fixing air conditioning faults as soons as they\u0027re reported. People can report faults on Twitter by giving details of service they\u0027re on and the carriage number, which is inside the carriage, above the doors. Handing out free bottled water at stations, fitting water fountains at stations, including Chelmsford.   A Greater Anglia spokesperson said: We want to make our customers\u0027 journeys on our trains as comfortable as possible, so we\u0027re doing what we can to keep people cool including airing trains in depots and switching on air conditioning where it\u0027s available. During a heatwave, crowded trains can sometimes still get hot, especially if there isn\u0027t air conditioning. We\u0027re looking forward to our new trains arriving from next year, as they will all have brand new built-in air conditioning. We advise customers to carry water with them during the hot weather - and if you have a refillable bottle you can fill it up at one of our water fountains.

Yvonne Radcliff, 74, had to turn around and go home after heading for a day out to Birmingham\u0027s new \u0026pound7 million Legoland Discovery Centre. She had set off from her home in Hall Green in the city to the new attraction which opened on Thursday. But the Lego-loving pensioner had her plans for a day out shattered when a staff member told her that no adults could enter without a child.  Yvonne told Birmingham Live: “I couldn’t believe it.  Adults make Lego, it’s wonderful. Yet I wasn’t allowed in because I didn’t have a kid with me. You couldn’t make it up really.  “I think Lego is fascinating. I’ve watched documentaries on TV and saw it was opening in town. “I told my daughter I fancied a day out to see it, so I got on the train to Snow Hill and walked the rest of the way there. “Once I got there, I walked in and a girl stopped me and said I wasn’t allowed in. She said it’s the rules - I must be accompanied by a child. She added: “I was shocked and appalled to tell you the truth. It’s nonsense really. “A family was in front of me so I said can I walk in with them as they had children, she just said ‘No, you’re a stranger’.  “You’d thought they’d take pity on a pensioner - and the kids aren’t off school yet. “I just had to walk away and go back home.”  The Legoland Discovery Centre website states that “adults must be accompanied by children to enter Legoland Discovery Centre”.  The new venue is, however, staging an adult-only evening for Lego fans on July 11 between 5pm and 7pm. In a detailed statement, a spokesman for Legoland said: “LEGOLAND Discovery Centre’s are not theme parks but small, indoor attractions specifically conceived and designed from a child’s perspective to provide safe and fun environments for families with children aged 3-10 to enjoy together.

People are opting to strike a pose in this way for one very obvious reason. It\u0027s incredibly flattering It\u0027s no secret that heels are the most flattering form of footwear as they elongate the legs and make them appear slimmer. So Instagram pros are opting to create the illusion of wearing heels to appear more photogenic in places where shoes just aren\u0027t practical.  It\u0027s especially favoured by stars posing in bikinis on the beach with bare feet.

A head and a number of bloodied body parts and limbs were found near the scene after at least three illegal hunters were devoured by the predators. Staff at the Sibuya Game Reserve, in Eastern Province, South Africa, called in a helicopter to search the area for more poachers. A vet then had to tranquilise the six lions so police could go inside and recover the remains of the mauled poachers. Owner Nick Fox, 60, said: “We found enough body parts and three pairs of empty shoes which suggest to us that the lions ate at least three of them but it is thick bush and there could be more. “They came heavily armed with hunting rifles and axes which we have recovered and enough food to last them for several days so we suspect they were after all of our rhinos here.  “They were clearly intent on killing rhinos and cutting off their horns. “But the lions are our watchers and s and they picked the wrong pride and became a meal. “Whilst we are saddened at any loss of life the poachers came here to kill our animals and this sends out a very clear message to any other poachers that you will not always be the winner. The remains of the bodies were found as darkness fell on Tuesday. Staff had to wait until Wednesday morning until the area could be declared safe to go in and recover what was left A police spokeswoman confirmed the grim discovery was made in the lion camp.  Captain Mali Govender said: “We do not know identities but firearms have been taken by the police and will be sent to the ballistics laboratory to see if they have been used in poaching before. The game reserve is one of the most popular in the Eastern Cape with British tourists and is home to the Big Five of elephant, rhino, buffalo, lion and leopard and is set in 30 square miles. In 2016 the reserve lost three rhinos when poachers got into the park and shot them dead for their horns. Nine rhinos - all of which were shot with a high-calibre hunting rifle - have been killed by poachers on Eastern Cape reserves already this year. It is hoped the gang eaten by lions are responsible for the deaths. The most high profile animal killing in recent times came when American dentist Walter Palmer shot Cecil - a famous lion in Zimbabwe. Palmer killed the black-maned male after the lion was lured from the protected Hwange National Park paying a reported \u0026pound35,000 to hunt the wild beast. The father-of-two then disappeared when he became the target of furious protesters over the execution.

But almost a century ago, we were in the same city, on the same side – fighting a famine. Soviet Russia was convulsed by a civil war and this heartland west of the Ural mountains was gripped by floods and the worst drought in living memory. The average May rainfall for Samara was 38.8mm, but only 0.3 fell. In the paralysing summer heat and subsequent deep frosts of 1921, millions faced starvation and Britons took part in a massive operation to save the children. The crusade was led by Swedish-born Arctic explorer Dr Fridtjof Nansen, whose appeal for funds was published in the Daily Mirror in December that year. His cable from Moscow told of the horror: “Twenty to thirty million are in famine conditions, of whom at least ten million are threatened with death. Whole populations in Central Russia are threatened with extermination. Vast districts becoming empty deserts. Urgent need immediate help. Cannot be exaggerated.” Samara was among the hardest-hit, its plight worsened by the civil war and Lenin’s decree to requisition food from peasant farms to feed his Red Army Troops advancing “war communism”.  Trade union leader Tom Mann, who travelled down the Volga from Samara in July 1921, said: “The scene was such as I have never seen in any degree.” Food from the Swedish Red Cross was already reaching the zones of devastation, but on his return he appealed for help from British workers. Save The Children asked Daily Mirror photographer George Mewes to go to Russia to record scenes of the famine there to raise awareness here. English journalist Sir Philip Gibbs visited the area and reported: “In Samara and hundreds of other places children are left by parents who cannot feed them. In the Samara district there are 28,000 abandoned children, as starved as birds who fall from the nest to the frozen ground.”  Thousands responded to the Mirror’s full-page appeal for “a shilling a week” to Save the Children, which would feed, clothe and get help to the famine region. Three-halfpence could rescue a child from hunger. First World War leader David Lloyd George spoke of “the most terrible devastation that has afflicted the world for centuries” and begged: “This is so appalling that it ought to sweep away every prejudice out of one’s mind and only appeal to one emotion: pity and human sympathy.” The “prejudice” he had in mind was anti-Soviet sentiment. Samara was in the cockpit of the war between Lenin’s Bolshevik revolutionaries – “The Reds” – and “the Whites” led by Admiral Kolchak.  The city was seized by the Bolsheviks in the 1917 October Revolution, but taken back by a “democratic counter-revolution” before finally falling to the Red Army in 1918. There was bitter fighting,  exacerbated by Lenin’s policy of taking grain and animals to sustain the war effort.  Amid growing starvation, some peasants turned to cannibalism, with a trade in human flesh. An aid worker reported : “Families were killing and devouring fathers, grandfathers and children.” Under the headline “Mother turns cannibal”, the Mirror reported on January 16,1922: “Famine is so acute in the Pugatjewsk district of Samara that a woman at the village of Mokscha was found eating the corpse of her daughter.”   Modern estimates put the human cost of the famine at more than five million lives – so the British reporters and  politicians were not exaggerating.  Sweden’s role in the international relief effort was finally recognised in 2016 with a memorial by the river Volga. Britain’s contribution is less well-documented and largely forgotten but there is no doubt that it helped to “save the children”. And the Save The Children charity, founded in the UK in 1919, received a huge boost to its popularity, confirming its importance over almost a century of work for those most in need. Samara, today a city of 1.2 million people and a conurbation almost three times that, sits on the river Volga more than 600 miles east of Moscow and almost 800 miles north of Volgograd – wartime Stalingrad – where England pummelled Panama 6-1 earlier in the World Cup tournament. Its history began officially in 1586, when a fortress was built to protect Russia’s eastern boundary.  Legend says that Alexius, patron saint of Samara, had visited the site two  centuries earlier, and predicted that a great town would be built there.  That prophecy came true hundreds of years later, when the Soviet government was forced to relocate there from besieged Moscow in the Second World War.

They are Lewis Toshney, William Edjenguele, Stewart Murdoch, Fraser Fyvie, Deniz Mehmet, Billy King, Paul McMullan, Tam Scobbie, James Keatings and Sam Stanton. How many of them play a meaningful role in the push for promotion this coming season, however, is certainly up for debate.In the past two campaigns under McKinnon and Laszlo, United haven’t been a million miles away from getting themselves up through the play-offs.Add in a bit of continuity through their playing squad and around it surely can only help the club get back to where they feel they belong.A list of those 86 transfers, who have arrived, departed or done both: Harry Souttar, Darko Bodul, Eiji Kawashima, Chris Erskine, Michal Szromnik, Callum Morris, John Rankin, Paul Paton, Florent Sinama-Pongolle, Henri Anier, Edward Ofere, Guy Demel, Ryan Dow, Gavin Gunning, Toshney, Frank van der Struijk, Nick van der Velden, Willo Flood, Cammy Bell, Edjenguele, Murdoch, Tope Obadeyi, Alex Nicholls, Tony Andreu, Thomas Mikkelsen, Cammy Smith, Wato Kuate, Paul Dixon, Coll Donaldson, Simon Murray, Sean Dillon, Charlie Telfer, Luis Zwick, Blair Spittal, Brad Smith, Ali Coote, Grant Gillespie, Fyvie, Emil Lyng, Patrick N’Koyi, Paul Quinn, King, Scobbie, McMullan, Keatings, Craig Slater, Scott McDonald, Jordie Briels, Harry Lewis, Stanton, Brandon Mason, Anthony Ralston, Bilel Mohsni, Clark, Booth, Wardrop, Aird, Curran, Frans, Siegrist, Rakovan and Rabitsch.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b3de03f72292-848x564.jpg ","title":"lucky locals give to dundees needy by donating 15 bags of clothes","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMembers of a Dundee community group clubbed together to collect hundreds of items of clothing for a local good cause.About 15 black bags, full of kids’ clothes, were handed over by the Emmock Woods Residents’ Group to Togs for Tots at The Circle on Staffa Place.The clothes had been collected to give to the group, which provides school uniforms and other kids’ clothes to families in deprived areas.Angee Grant, chairwoman of the residents’ group, said: “We’re quite lucky up here – we’ve got nice houses and good jobs so we wanted to give a wee bit back to the community.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"marcus haber sparks speculation his days at dundee are over as he jets off but not with dark blues squad","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStriker Marcus Haber’s time at Dundee appears to be at an end with the player in talks over a move to South Africa.The player himself sparked speculation over his future after posting pictures of himself on social media.While the Dark Blues first-team squad were heading for a training camp in Portugal’s Algarve yesterday, the Canadian was posting pictures of himself embarking on aThe Tele can confirm that trip is to talk over a switch to the ABSA Premiership, though to which Johannesburg club it’s still unclear.Haber’s first posts showed him at Glasgow airport about to board a flight for London.Later in the day he posted again complaining a flight from Heathrow to Johannesburg had been delayed.So far there has been no word of which South African club he may be heading out to join.Since new gaffer Neil McCann took over last year, the 29-year-old has been very much a fringe player.\u0026mdash Dundee Football Club (@dundeefconline) July 4, 2018He only made 13 appearances last term, the final one coming in the 4-1 home defeat at the hands of Ross County in February.He did have back problems that required surgery but even before then it was clear he was no longer first-choice striker.Haber has not been involved in either of the pre-season friendlies to date and is behind Sofien Moussa, new signing Jean Mendy and even kid Matty Henvey in the pecking order.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b39f01324c04-e1530527591774-817x564.jpg ","title":"new boy elton looks to rocket dundee up the premiership table and says the skys the limit","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew boy Elton Ngwatala insists the sky’s the limit for Dundee as they look to make an assault on the Premiership top-half next season.The French midfielder, signed from Kidderminster Harriers earlier in the summer, made his second appearance in dark blue in last night\u0026#8217s 1-0 win at Cowdenbeath.This followed his debut on Friday night in a 1-1 friendly draw with Brechin City at Glebe Park.Fellow summer arrival, Senegalese striker Jean Alassane Mendy, got the visitors’ only goal just before the hour-mark as Kharl Madianga, Jack Hamilton, Nathan Ralph and trialist Brian Nana-Sinkam also got their first run-outs for Dundee.And 25-year-old Ngwatala believes there is no stopping him and his new team-mates from scaling the heights in the top flight next term – with a top-six finish a known aim of manager Neil McCann.“Friday night was my first game and it felt good to play with the new lads,” he said.“They are all new team-mates for me but, with 45 minutes in the tank, now I can improve.“Hopefully, within the next couple of weeks it will be perfect.“I think there is no limit next season. We have to take each game one by one and do the best we can to get the win.”Ngwatala admits the appeal to take his game to the next level was a huge factor in his move north of the border after playing in England’s sixth tier for the past three campaigns.As well as playing in front of terrific atmospheres at Dens Park, he is looking forward to testing himself on live television and under the spotlight of big crowds at Parkhead and Ibrox.He went on: “Dundee play in the Premiership so, for me, it was a big step up from playing in the Conference North in England.“It was important for me to move to Scotland and it feels like the right time to make this step.“I want to play at the highest level and going up against Celtic and Rangers is a big deal.“I have to test myself at the highest level.”Ngwatala also heaped praise on boss Neil and the rest of the staff at the club for welcoming him to the fold.The midfield man feels he has settled into the club with ease, though when asked if he has picked up on the local lingo yet, he said: “No, nothing yet!“The training has been nice to be fair, everybody has made me feel very welcome to the club, so it’s good,” he added.“The sessions have been good with the manager.”The Frenchman’s focus now is to show supporters more of what they can expect from him in the new campaign.He added: “I like to get on the ball, create things, make things happen.“Connecting and playing with my team-mates in short spaces is important but sometimes I do like a long shot!”Ngwatala’s new gaffer Neil was delighted his new boys got some valuable minutes under their belts despite drawing in Angus, saying: “I’m not really looking too much into the performances.“It was more just fitness and we had a number of new faces who joined us for the first time on Friday and it’s going to take a wee bit of time to get that understanding.“Overall, I was quite happy with the two 45 minutes.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b3c949e69a6e-466x564.jpg ","title":"revamped dundee united impress in victory at glebe park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew-look Dundee United looked good as they strolled to victory in the sunshine at Brechin on Tuesday night.Playing what could be the only public friendly of their build-up to the new campaign, the Tangerines started with eight of their nine summer signings.And all impressed as Csaba Laszlo’s men knocked the ball around well and breached the home defence on two occasions.Encouragingly for the several hundred fans who chose to escape England’s World Cup win over Colombia and made the journey to Glebe Park, there was a cohesion about United’s play that probably no one had a right to expect so early in the rebuilding process that’s been undertaken since the disappointment of missing out on promotion at the end of last season.What was apparent within a few minutes of kick-off was Laszlo has added strength and energy to his squad.From a defence that was well marshalled by Frederic Frans to a front line led ably by Craig Curran, the team looked sharp and powerful.Frans looks exactly the kind of dominant defender that was needed to replace Bilel Mohsni, who’d done so well during his short stay towards the end of last term.And out wide Callum Booth showed his Premiership quality at left-back, while Sam Wardrop on the right did enough to suggest he will be an able replacement for his former Celtic youth team-mate Anthony Ralston.In the middle of the park Austrian Christoph Rabitsch added bite, while ahead of him Curran and Nicky Clark showed good understanding for their first outing up front together.Elsewhere, wide man Fraser Aird was first to show what he can bring to the team when he picked up the ball 40 yards from goal and jinked his way past several challenges before netting with a low shot.That opener came with just seven minutes or so on the clock but already United were knocking the ball around in the manner their gaffer likes.It wasn’t just about the new boys, however, and the few familiar faces in the line-up gave a good account of themselves.Sam Stanton was his usual industrial self in midfield and used the ball well. Likewise, young Scott Allardice slotted in comfortably alongside Frans in central defence.Originally a midfielder, he’s now impressed a few times in that deeper role and would certainly be worth another look there when the Betfred Cup group matches kick-off in under a fortnight.Returning to the new faces, a clue who will be handed the goalkeeper’s jersey when the competitive action starts was perhaps given when Swiss Benjamin Siegrist was preferred to Slovakian Matej Rakovan in goal.Siegrist was almost caught out when he was slow to field a pass back in the first half but, generally, looked sound.Rakovan did come on for the second half and did nothing wrong but right now it appears he has work to do to be in the side when Arbroath are faced in that first Betfred tie on Saturday week.While the game did fizzle out a bit in the second half, another boost for United was the appearance of James Keatings for the final 15 minutes or so.The attacker’s first season at Tannadice was ruined by injuries but, if he can stay fit, he’s a player who can play a significant part in what lies ahead.It was his shot with ten minutes left that struck the bar and went in off home defender Euan Spark for the second.Keatings then struck the post with a clever curling effort from 16 yards out.Had that gone in, the score would have provided a fairer reflection of United’s good work.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/10/59dc8f56e5322-e1530277496193.jpg ","title":"volunteer drivers needed for dundee charity delivering food to impoverished folk","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new charity aimed at alleviating food poverty among families in Dundee is urgently seeking volunteers to carry out its summer programme.Dundee Bairns delivers breakfasts and lunches to impoverished families in the city during the school holidays.It is looking for delivery drivers and attendants to assist with deliveries during its Summer Fun and Food Programme which begins on Monday July 2 and ends on Friday August 11.The charity provides vans so drivers do not need their own car.

inspirational people with strong connections to the Highlands have been honoured by an award-winning social enterprise near Beauly.The Shieling Project, an off-grid learning centre, has named its new environmentally-friendly accommodation pods after the six who include a renowned piper, a writer and the founder of a community and heritage association in Glasgow,More than 100 people attended the official opening of the new low-impact buildings and other events at the project\u0027s base in Glen Strathfarrar over two days.One bothy has been dedicated to Strathfarrar-born Pipe Major Willie Ross who lived in the house now used as staff accommodation at the Shieling.It was opened by piper Brighde Chaimbeul.Others have been named after ecologist Frank Fraser-Darling, writer Iain R Thomson, singer Margaret Bennett, poet M\u0026agraveiri Mh\u0026ograver nan \u0026Ograveran and Colin MacLeod, the founder of the GalGael Trust based in Govan.Managing director Sam Harrison said the new pods will offer school pupils residential outdoor living and the heritage of the shieling \u0026ndash the summer pastures and huts where young people used to graze cattle \u0026ndash as a way to explore contemporary issues of sustainability and local culture.\"The new low-impact buildings, which are similar to the highly popular Nordic summer huts, will provide comfortable accommodation for schools, but also allow the ongoing development of summer camps for young people, families and adults,\" he said.The six-bed bothies were co-designed with local schools including Teanassie Primary and produced by Ullapool company Northwoods Construction.\"These new buildings will be a real inspiration to our visitors,\" Mr Harrison said.\"The bothies connect the past from the bothan airigh (shieling bothy) through to the corrugated tin houses and huts seen still all over the Highlands to a future of well designed simple and sustainable living spaces.\"The project has received a \u0026pound75,000 grant from Scottish and Southern Energy towards infrastructure work.Additional financial support has come from Highlands and Islands Enterprise, Highland Leader programme and Social Investment Scotland.The project also hosted an open day and an end of term show by the Summerlings Outdoor Nursery which opened last year to provide young children with the chance to spend most of their time outdoors exploring, playing and learning.Since starting in 2015, the Shieling has built 15 structures and raised funding of \u0026pound330,000 while its revenue income trebled last year.It has provided more than 18,000 hours of education and hosted visits by 1700 pupils and teachers from more than 40 schools throughout the north of Scotland.Friday 6 Jul 2018 9:35

raising an estimated \u0026pound100,000 in memory of Nairn schoolboy Hamish Hey, his family have revealed a colourful plan of how the community will benefit.An adventure play park, children\u0027s play area, crazy golf course, multiple artworks and a year-round geothermal water park are among the plans for the Nairn Links area.Hamish (8) lost his battle with rare childhood cancer in February last year.To honour his memory and his shining positive attitude his family decided to launch Team Hamish \u0026ndash a charitable group with the aim of raising as much money as possible to be spent on creating an accessible community area that everyone can enjoy.The plans were revealed to the people of Nairn at a special information evening on June 20 and for the next few weeks the public have a chance to comment on them, make suggestions and raise any concerns.Susan Hey, Hamish\u0027s mother says she has been overwhelmed by the positive response from the people of Nairn.\"It is an ambitious project but the reaction from the public has blown us away,\" she said.\"We have had nothing but positivity and people saying \u0027let\u0027s make this happen now\u0027.\"Although they are incredibly proud of how much the community has raised so far they plan to start applying for large grants to see the project completed quickly and to a high standard.Mrs Hey added: \"Everything needs to be made inclusive, the paths need to be upgraded and shelters would create all weather areas for people to enjoy the beautiful scenery.\"After the consultation period Team Hamish will meet again with Nairn

remains over funding formula","story":"\u0026nbspIMMINENT repairs to an Inverness road which has been dubbed the worst in the city have been welcomed \u0026ndash as a councillor renewed calls for changes to a funding formula which he claims leaves busy urban routes at a serious disadvantage.Milton Crescent in Hilton is to be completely resurfaced at a cost of \u0026pound100,000 and the work is due to start on Monday.Other roads across the city \u0026ndash including Midmills Road in the Crown area and Caledonian Road and Montague Row in Dalneigh are also set to have their potholes filled in.But Ness-side councillor Ron MacWilliam has called for a rethink on the way damaged roads are prioritised.At present, funds are allocated according to a formula which gives more weighting to length of road than traffic volumes.As a result, Mr MacWilliam said roads in Inverness were having less money spent on them than rural roads in the far north of Sutherland. He also said more needed to be done if city drivers were going to notice any significant difference.\"The fact the council is now looking to repair roads within the city is a start, but there are a lot of routes \u0026ndash particularly in areas such as Hilton and Lochardil \u0026ndash which are still very bad,\" he told the Courier.\"The roads budget is woefully inadequate. The roads office has a fantastic team but they are fighting a losing battle.\"With regards to the funding formula, Mr MacWilliam said he was continuing to press the matter but he faced strong opposition from the much larger number of Highland councillors who represent rural wards.However, residents in Milton Crescent are just happy that work there is finally going ahead.Edward Dyce (76) relies on his vehicle to get around and said: \"I have had a lot of problems with my car because of the road surface. It\u0027 getting worse because of the amount of traffic.\"A lot of people use the road and the potholes have become a real problem. I think it\u0027 one of the worst roads in the area at the moment.\"Neighbour Sarah Macpherson said: \"It\u0027 become one of the worst roads in Inverness, however I\u0026rsquom glad it\u0027 going to be fixed.\"Local councillor Ian Brown said the road was in \"a terrible state\" and welcomed news it was to be resurfaced.\"It really is awful,\" he said. \"I was there at the weekend and I couldn\u0026rsquot believe how bad it was.\"Roads funding was ring-fenced as part of this year\u0027 cost-cutting budget, but council chiefs have acknowledged that any repairs carried out are likely to be a drop in the ocean compared to what is needed, with a figure of \u0026pound20 million previously quoted as the amount needed simply to maintain routes as they are.Elsewhere, councillors have argued that a \u0026pound1 a night \"tourist tax\" on visitors could be used to specifically address infrastructure problems, including roads.Friday 6 Jul 2018 9:35

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

Sheryl is a Lochgilphead woman \u0026#8211 middle-aged, celibate without choice and with plummeting self-confidence and a loathing for her body shape. Belly dancing appears to let Sheryl, and Kerrie, rediscover a love of their own body.\u0026#8216You’re using parts of your body, probably out of commission for a while, like the pelvis and it makes a part of the body, you’re maybe not keen on, sexy.\u0026#8217The female characters in the book get up to what loud ladies in a small town would enjoy gossip and drama.\u0026#8216There is an element of bitchiness about it, which I exaggerated in the book. Or maybe it was just me that was bitching.\u0026#8217But two books later in the series, Kerrie is changing direction. Her new book, Rebel Without A Clue, is a sci-fi dystopian novel about a male alien from a female-dominated planet landing in Glasgow.\u0026#8216There’s actually not a lot of sex in my books,\u0026#8217 says Kerrie. \u0026#8216Except maybe nobody having any.\u0026#8217The story starts out as a reversal of The Handmaid’s Tale, with women of this planet no longer needing men to reproduce and evolves, through a plot described as \u0026#8216mad\u0026#8217, into an outsiders perspective of Glasgow.\u0026#8216The male alien Legless goes down to earth and goes around fertilising all these women, and doesn’t understand this world where he’s in charge.\u0026#8216Most of the time I was the only woman living in a culture different from my own. I began to see stories in outsiders.\u0026#8217Being an Australian in Scotland \u0026#8211 and on top of that marrying into a Bangladeshi family \u0026#8211 would give that outlook, of everything being familiar but just off a little. The language is the same, with the accents different. The rural community is the same, only with less terrifying monsters to deal with in Argyll. This is the outlook Legless finds himself in as a dominated man in a world of dominant men.Such an off-the-wall plot with no clear message makes the book an ink blot test \u0026#8211 you take what you’re looking for from it. Maybe you even see something else with another look.Kerrie explained: \u0026#8216Originally I wanted it to be all humour. I suppose I’m driven about power and control and it’s really fascinating when you start to think about it because people dominate in quite small ways.\u0026#8217So maybe the point was to gain the women’s perspective for men to relate to?Kerrie is currently working on her fifth book, the sequel to her dystopian sci-fi named Rebel Without A Bra, and she will keep belly dancing around Lochgilphead.\u0026#8216At the beginning you just write, and you just open up your mind and stuff comes out and you’ll find that all this stuff comes out that you didn’t realise you were thinking about.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"its gonna be a close shave gavin","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/06/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIt\u0026#8217s been eight months in the making, but it\u0026#8217s getting hairy now.The razors, however, will soon sort that out for Gavin Allan.He has been growing his flowing locks and bushy beard since October last year, but Gavin will be shorn for charity on Saturday June 30.Gavin\u0026#8217s head and beard shave is being carried out in aid of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) research and the Doddie Weir Foundation.Former Scottish rugby international lock forward Doddie Weir revealed in June 2017 he was suffering from MND, a degenerative condition affecting the nerves in the brain and spinal cord that tell your muscles what to do.

All four girls contributed valuable points, with Jemma excelling in the 75 metres sprint recording a time of 12.65 seconds. Jorja was the top Mid Argyll girl in the long jump reaching 3.03 metres and also had a respectable 10.55 metres throw with the 500g turbo javelin.The girls B team finished ahead of the A team in 28th overall, mainly due to an excellent 14.25 metres javelin throw by Sophie Balkeen.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve.

And one glance around a packed Troon Town Hall said everything about the young woman Vanessa Riddle had become. Her impact was deep, her reach was far. “Vanessa would wonder why everyone was here for her,” said dad Chris. “That’s just the kind of person she was.” Friends, family, school pals and members of the community all touched by Vanessa’s courage joined for the special service.  Her battle with neuroblastoma had been one that ensured she will never be forgotten by all lucky enough to know her. Speaking to more than 400 people at her memorial service, Chris said: “She lit up our world. “And in her short life, she packed in so much happiness. “Vanessa was a thrillseeker with a soft side – great with old and young alike. “She had the Midas touch.” And he added: “No words can describe how utterly proud we are to have been your father, mother and sister.  “This is not the end for you, you have now moved on to something new.” The emotional speech came as the Town Hall paid tribute to Vanessa, of Loans, who lost her brave battle just days short of her 18th birthday. Some of Vanessa’s closest childhood friends took their feet to recount memories of happy times of the girl with a smile for everyone. And Vanessa’s infamous parking skills and ability to make everyone laugh were just two of the themes to strike a chord. Graham Hobson, deputy head at Marr College, was another to speak warmly of an immensely popular pupil. Chris said afterwards: “I thought the speeches were great, especially Vanessa’s friends, who at only 18 spoke so eloquently and passionately about Vanessa - they belied their age doing this.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded.

closed, listening to the soothing sounds of tranquil music, gently guided by their teacher as they breathe deeply, exhaling all worries away and their minds drift off\u0026hellip\nNow, I know you must be wondering, what on earth are they teaching at Peebles High School? What about prelims, exams, studying, grades?\nBut what do all these pressures bring to the fragile mind of a young person, and how do they process the stress to ensure their mental wellbeing?\nIn steps Suzi Gibson, who has been running mindful meditation sessions with Peebles High pupils as part of Health Week for the past five years.\nAnd so a group of pupils dropped their pencils, calculators and chemistry tools and walked through the doors of a more unique classroom setting, kicking off their school shoes and leaving their cares behind them as the lay in the comfort of Space 108 in Peebles.\nCan mindfulness meditation really help pupils concentrate amid the distractions of 21st century living?\nI decided to experience for myself the sessions offered freely to the pupils by Suzi, who guided sessions at the high school before opening her studio at Greenside, Peebles, in January 2016.\nAdmittedly I had always been a bit sceptical about meditation. I mean seriously, how can sitting on a floor in the lotus position, inhaling the pleasant oil aroma while the ambient sounds of dolphins singing and ocean waves crash, bring me peace of mind?\nI\u0026rsquom a wife, mother, writer, and like most people, my life is busy and my head is bursting with thoughts from which there\u0026rsquos no escape.\nBut I entered the beautiful airy studio with an open-mind and intrigued about the experiences of the pupils.\nOn this particular afternoon, I feel like I\u0026rsquove got the weight of the world on my shoulders. Thoughts are racing through my head like a train out of control. But immediately I feel a sense of calmness speaking to Suzi, as she explains the techniques she is using and gently guides me through the smooth ride to a quiet mind\u0026hellipand I am, going, going, gone\u0026hellip\nI am in a state of deep peace and the mind is calm, so much so, when I hear Suzi\u0026rsquos soft instruction to open my eyes \u0026ndash I don\u0026rsquot want to. I love it here.\nSo now I can see why meditation could potentially tackle a myriad of problems suffered by young students, including mental health. This is a growing problem in the Scottish Borders, with evidence suggesting almost 2,000 children and young people in the region will experience mental ill health at some point in their lives.\nThe sessions are offered to groups of pupils from S1 to S3, who arrive at the studio giggling with excitement and anticipation for their new experience.\nSuzi explained: \"There are some nerves and awareness of peers, especially if there is a mix of ages. The great thing is, once they close their eyes, it becomes completely about their own experience. Fidgeting and chatting stops, there is a sense of calm, and some sleep which is great because they perhaps need it.\"\nEach group is given an insight into the benefits of meditation, as well as exploring how stress becomes unhealthy, warning signs, and how to build resilience through practical techniques that can help reduce anxiety.\nThe meditation guru shared skills with the pupils which, if put into practice daily, can be life-changing.\nSuzi said: \"They are all very relaxed and quite amazed at the experience. I hope they leave with the knowledge that they have the ability to create calmness within themselves using some of the techniques they have learned, leading to greater concentration, focus, creativity and well rested teens.\"\nThe visible difference in the pupils during the session at Space 108 has astounded school staff. \"Some of the teachers and staff who have attended over the years can\u0026rsquot quite believe the quiet and calm that begins to settle in the room. I\u0026rsquove had a few parents afterwards tell me how much their kids enjoyed it,\" said Suzi.\n\"There is a lot of anxiety and tension in our kids today, sometimes a feeling of being relaxed is a little alien to them, then they experience it. That\u0026rsquos the important bit, they have an experience of relaxation and calm, not an intellectual understanding that it is good for them, but an actual experience.\"\nResearch has proven that mindfulness and meditation is very beneficial to a person\u0026rsquos mental health, and many schools are incorporating it into their classrooms, teaching philosophies, and disciplinary programs.\nIn fact, some schools are choosing to replace detention with meditation with it even being used as behavioural therapy in classrooms.\nWhether this trend will catch on remains to be seen, as there are many parents who still prefer traditional discipline, with youngsters being given their marching orders to the principal\u0026rsquos office for unruly behaviour.\nBut one thing is certain, the pupils of Peebles High School reaped the benefits of their mindful meditation sessions with Suzi during Health Week last month.\nPrincipal teacher of pastoral care Kirsteen Robertson, said: \"The studio is beautiful, the students immediately notice how soothing the space is, the lovely smell and lighting. The sessions give our students strategies to relax, think calmly, reducing stress and anxiety and improve sleep.

Businesses are also urged to consider their usage and how they can use water more efficiently.\nScottish Water are encouraging residents to do the following: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps in the home whenever possible, and using washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.\nPeter Farrer, Scottish Water\u0026rsquos chief operating officer, said: \u0026ldquoWater usage levels during the current hot summer weather, particularly during peak times such as morning and early evening, mean we are working around the clock to get water around the system quickly enough.\n\u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos public water supply is the lifeblood of the country, for household and business customers.

The Government hopes this may be offset by growth in markets around the globe.\n\u0026ndash Will decisions be reached?\nMrs May has so far managed to hold together the mix of Brexiteers and former Remainers in her Cabinet, but descending from the fence on one side or the other of the debate is likely to strain that fragile truce.\nA further slice of Brexit fudge is a possibility, but the Prime Minister has said the Government has \u0026ldquoa great opportunity \u0026ndash and a duty to reach decisions in order to \u0026ldquoset an ambitious course to enhance our prosperity and security outside the European Union.\nThen Prime Minister Harold Wilson at Chequers with his son Robin, daughter-in-law Joy and wife Mary, pictured in 1974 (PA)\n\u0026ndash Could there be resignations?\nTensions are undoubtedly running high. Mr Davis has teetered close to the brink of resignation before and may do so again given his reservations about the plan, while all eyes will be on Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, the Brexiteers\u0026rsquo biggest beast, to see how he responds.\nOn the other hand, Chancellor Philip Hammond and Business Secretary Greg Clark would resist any Brexit deal which would hit jobs and the economy.\n\u0026ndash What next?\nA White Paper setting out the Government\u0026rsquos blueprint for Brexit will be published next week. Mrs May wants talks with Brussels to \u0026ldquointensify and accelerate once it is produced.\nEU leaders, who have been frustrated that it has taken the UK Government so long to set out its plan, have called for \u0026ldquorealistic and workable proposals.\nDecisions on a deal are expected to be taken at October\u0026rsquos EU summit \u0026ndash although there is also the possibility of an emergency meeting in November if agreement cannot be reached.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date()a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0]a.async=1a.src=gm.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\u0027script\u0027,\u0027//www.google-analytics/analytics.js\u0027,\u0027ga\u0027)ga(\u0027create\u0027, \u0027UA-72310761-1\u0027, \u0027auto\u0027, {\u0027name\u0027: \u0027pacontentapi\u0027})ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027referrer\u0027, location.origin)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension1\u0027, \u0027By David Hughes and David Wilcock, Press Association Political Staff\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension2\u0027, \u002721217230-9681-46a6-9993-8219aae0b381\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension3\u0027, \u0027paservice:news,paservice:news:uk\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension6\u0027, \u0027story\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension7\u0027, \u0027composite\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension8\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension9\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.send\u0027, \u0027pageview\u0027, { \u0027location\u0027: location.href, \u0027page\u0027: (location.pathname + location.search + location.hash), \u0027title\u0027: \u0027All you need to know about Cabinet\\u2019s Brexit showdown at Chequers\u0027})\n"},{"url":null,"title":"farming letter hard pressed farmers","story":"It\u0026#8217s seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my ward with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish government.In ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last ten years, capital investment has stayed the same, and agricultural workers are earning £1560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show that farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210m.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment, while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact that farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have show complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing.Councillor Alastair Redman,Islay.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter council should become more business friendly","story":"On June 6 I attended the Mid Argyll Kintyre and the Islands area committee meeting in Bowmore.At the meeting my fellow councillors and I listened to members of the public from both Islay and Jura talking about numerous concerns, including the need for pavements and footpaths at some of the newly built housing housing schemes on Islay, speeding through our villages, dog fouling, and bus links to Keills Primary School.The following day I joined my fellow Conservative and Unionist councillors at the Environment Development and Infrastructure Committee.I spoke about the need to see our council become more business-friendly, welcoming and promoting competition, supporting economic growth and getting off the backs of the growing numbers of local entrepreneurs.I also pointed out the importance of promoting our growing film industry with blockbusters such as Jurassic World being filmed right here in Argyll.This industry offers huge opportunities for our local economy and should not be ignored.Later that day I travelled to Tarbert to visit and speak to local residents and businesses.It was great to see so many Islay and Jura whiskies in Tarbert\u0026#8217s Whisky West Coast retailer.It is enjoying a boost in trade due largely to the huge growth in our island\u0026#8217s whisky industry.As your councillor I have and will continue to do all that I can to promote economic growth in my ward and across Argyll.Councillor Alastair Redman,Islay.Alastair Redman was happy to find Islay and Jura whiskies in Tarbert\u0026#8217s Whisky West Coast shop.

window as children relax, enjoy the outdoors and get stuck into their favourite hobbies.Asthma UK is launching a campaign urging parents of children with asthma to make sure they take their usual preventer medicine and keep up a routine over the school break.The medicine builds up over time so will help to protect their child from an asthma attack during the summer holiday and once they return to school.Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially life-threatening asthma attack in the UK and three people die from an asthma attack every day.In September, children are nearly three times more likely to be admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack than in August, partly due to seasonal triggers such as cold and flu viruses.If a child hasn’t kept up their preventer medicine routine over the school holidays, they will be at greater risk of reacting to these triggers.The good news is that by taking a few simple steps, parents can help their child to avoid asthma attacks and enjoy the summer as much as anyone else:Keep up your child’s usual preventer medicine routine, usually a brown inhaler.Make sure your child has an up-to-date written asthma action plan, which you can download from Asthma UK’s website, and share this with anyone who will be looking after them as using one means they’re less likely to end up in hospital for their asthma.Track your child’s asthma symptoms using a diary or a symptom calendar.Prepare for going back to school by arranging for your child to have an asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse to check your child’s medicines and make sure your child has spare, in-date reliever inhalers to take into school.Parents whose children have asthma can access support through our nurse helpline.Last year we helped nearly 1,000 parents who called on behalf of their child with asthma.For information and support on how to manage your child’s asthma during the summer or to download a written asthma action plan visit

reasonable person to suffer fear or alarm, by shouting, throwing a shopping trolley and breaking a window at an address in Campbeltown on June 10.During his trial, two witnesses gave evidence.The first witness, whose house is on the opposite side of the street to where the offences were alleged to have taken place, said she heard a commotion on the date in question and looked out of her window to see what was happening.She said she saw Deavy outside the other house, shouting, but she could not see if there was anyone else present.She came away from the window but 15 minutes later, when she heard \u0026#8216a smash\u0026#8217, she returned to see if anyone was hurt and saw Deavy leaving the property\u0026#8217s garden, \u0026#8216still angry\u0026#8217, she said.She said he threw a trolley that was in the garden to the side.Deavy\u0026#8217s defence solicitor, Mr Buchanan, asked the witness if what she had heard had just been an argument between two people, and if the two were \u0026#8216giving as good as they got\u0026#8217.The witness said that although she heard two voices, she could not hear what they were saying.The second witness, whose window was smashed, said Deavy had been taken to her property in a state of intoxication.Although he was usually welcome, she asked him to leave because he was drunk.When he did not, she decided to leave the property and go for a walk around the block and when she returned, Deavy was gone.When he returned later, the witness pretended she was not in.She said Deavy was chapping the door but she had closed the curtains.At some point she heard a bang and thought that Deavy may have fallen into the wheelie bins outside, but when she went to check she saw that the shopping trolley was over on its side, near to where it had been before.She said: \u0026#8216I sat in silence so he would think I was still away out.\u0026#8217Later, the woman went shopping and when she returned home, she found her window smashed so she called the police.She said that she would not have phoned the police about the earlier events if the window had not been smashed.Mr Buchanan said there was \u0026#8216no evidence at all\u0026#8217 of swearing or violence, and that there was nothing to suggest his knocking on her door was untoward.He said it had been \u0026#8216a drunk man, knocking at the door of a property at which he was welcome.\u0026#8217Procurator fiscal depute Eoin McGinty said it \u0026#8216could not have been any clearer that he was not welcome\u0026#8217 and cited the witness walking around the block and closing her curtains to avoid Deavy.Finding the charge against Deavy not proven, Sheriff Hughes said he thought the accused probably broke the window but there was insufficient evidence to prove it beyond reasonable doubt.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"campbeltowns european drum major champion","story":"Last Saturday, Campbeltown drum major Liam Renton, 25, won his second European title: 2018

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

Across the primary stages, children are committed to and proud of being part of their school community  - The committed staff team, led by the headteacher, work well together in their goal to secure positive outcomes for children. Wellbeing is central to the whole school community and staff provide a nurturing learning environment where children receive effective support.

They were:  - Increasing the opportunities for children to be more active and independent in their learning  - Continuing to improve attainment, ensuring that the pace and challenge of learning meets the needs of all children  - Continuing to develop the opportunities for leadership at all levels to support the school improvement. Increasing the scope for all members of the school community, including parents, partners and children, to be involved in discussions about aspects of the life and work of the school.

The latter was chosen as the darts team\u0026rsquos captain, Michael Burgess, was treated there for leukaemia.  \u0026ldquoI wanted to give something back as they really looked after us, he said.  The walk was the pub\u0026rsquos fourth and final charity event of the year and followed a bowls competition, eight-hour darts marathon and darts competition.

In April, a thief stole the pub\u0026rsquos collection bottle containing about \u0026pound400 but local taxi owner John Cullen stepped in to hold a bonus ball fundraiser when he heard about the break-in.  Over 32 years, the pub\u0026rsquos darts team has raised more than \u0026pound100,000 for different charities.

She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.  The family have also received support from the charity \u0026lsquoFinding Your Feet\u0026rsquo, which helps families affected by amputation or limb difference.

Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.

They were sitting lined up in their cars looking to see what was going on.  \u0026ldquoI have sat outside with my breakfast some mornings and have had to lift my bowl of cereal and walk back in the house.  Mrs Morris said that although there were some trees along the boundary, they shed their leaves in the autumn, leaving the area bare.  She claimed that she and her husband had called on the housing association for permission to fill in the gaps in the fence to allow more privacy but claimed they had been told they couldn\u0026rsquot as another resident liked it that way.  \u0026ldquoWe wanted to get these slats which are only 94p. We would pay for them and fill in the spaces, she added.  She said they also called for a fence to be installed to stop people using an area past their flats as a shortcut to Tesco, claiming they were dumping rubbish including cans and bottles en route.  Neighbour Fiona Wilson said that motorists ate and slept in their vehicles and let their dogs out of cars.  \u0026ldquoWe are entitled to some sort of privacy, she added.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot go out \u0026ndash everybody\u0026rsquos looking at us.  \u0026ldquoMy bedroom is also to the front.

Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959839.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"phonebox-removed-from-centre-of-haddington","story":"  The phonebox, outside the police station on Court Street, was removed by BT last Tuesday.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.

The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.

Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.

He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.

The competition \u0026ndash dubbed the Olympics of Tech \u0026ndash seeks out the most innovative and potentially world-changing software solutions and comes with a first prize of $100,000.  Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.  The Abertay team are focusing on making the simulator better before they head to Washington.

A post from the youth project said: \u0026ldquoOver the past three years, young people have been looking at youth provision in North Berwick and have been shocked to learn just how much has been lost and never replaced.  \u0026ldquoThe team have been working hard to receive advice from East Lothian Council on what can be put in place to ensure a safe environment for all, as well as actions which can be taken to discourage anti-social behaviour. The young people would like to re-build the shelter with wider community involvement.  But Kathryn and Douglas Paul, who live at Glasclune Gardens, would prefer to see the shelter demolished.  Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.

Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.

It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

About 14,000 primary and high school pupils in East Lothian have been visited at their schools as part of the trophies tour in the run-up to the Scottish Open, which takes place from next Thursday (July 12), and the Ladies\u0026rsquo Scottish Open which begins on Thursday, July 26.  Mr Martin said: \u0026ldquoThe trophies tour finale at Sanderson\u0026rsquos Wynd was an amazing day and these children not only got to see the trophies up close but also got to grill a brilliant professional athlete in Beth Allen. It was also fantastic to give them the opportunity to swing a golf club for the first time.  \u0026ldquoI hope that the trophy tour has inspired children across East Lothian to come down to Gullane in July and continue to get involved in golf.

The whole Cabinet will be at the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos official country retreat in Buckinghamshire on Friday. The venue offers more privacy than Downing Street, where reporters and photographers can linger outside the black door to No 10.  Ministers will be kept at the mansion until they have reached agreement \u0026ndash dinner will be served and they could talk late into the night.  \u0026ndash What do they need to decide?  The Government has to set out what it wants its future relationship with the European Union after Brexit to look like. This includes issues relating to customs and trade which have triggered furious rows within the Tory ranks.  \u0026ndash What\u0026rsquos on the table?  Papers circulated to ministers are reported to recommend that the UK should maintain a \u0026ldquocommon rulebook with the EU for all goods, including agricultural and food products. This deal \u0026ldquowould not allow the UK to accommodate a likely ask from the US in a future trade deal as the UK would be unable to recognise the US\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoarray of standards. But Downing Street insisted it was \u0026ldquocategorically untrue that such a package would prevent a deal entirely.  \u0026ndash How has this been received?  Within Eurosceptic circles it has provoked open hostility. Brexit Secretary David Davis is understood to have reservations not only about the plan, but whether Brussels would even consider it. Tory MP Lucy Allan said simply: \u0026ldquoThis is not Brexit.  \u0026ndash What about services, a key part of the UK economy?  The price for divergence from EU rules and regulations on services is likely to be reduced access for UK-based firms to European markets. The Government hopes this may be offset by growth in markets around the globe.  \u0026ndash Will decisions be reached?  Mrs May has so far managed to hold together the mix of Brexiteers and former Remainers in her Cabinet, but descending from the fence on one side or the other of the debate is likely to strain that fragile truce.  A further slice of Brexit fudge is a possibility, but the Prime Minister has said the Government has \u0026ldquoa great opportunity \u0026ndash and a duty to reach decisions in order to \u0026ldquoset an ambitious course to enhance our prosperity and security outside the European Union.  \u0026ndash Could there be resignations?  Tensions are undoubtedly running high. Mr Davis has teetered close to the brink of resignation before and may do so again given his reservations about the plan, while all eyes will be on Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, the Brexiteers\u0026rsquo biggest beast, to see how he responds.  On the other hand, Chancellor Philip Hammond and Business Secretary Greg Clark would resist any Brexit deal which would hit jobs and the economy.  \u0026ndash What next?  A White Paper setting out the Government\u0026rsquos blueprint for Brexit will be published next week. Mrs May wants talks with Brussels to \u0026ldquointensify and accelerate once it is produced.  EU leaders, who have been frustrated that it has taken the UK Government so long to set out its plan, have called for \u0026ldquorealistic and workable proposals.  Decisions on a deal are expected to be taken at October\u0026rsquos EU summit \u0026ndash although there is also the possibility of an emergency meeting in November if agreement cannot be reached."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7870497.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"alan-longmuir-les-mckeown-remembers-his-bay-city-roller-legend-pal","story":"  The tartan-clad Edinburgh band was massive in the 1970s, thanks to timeless hits such as Bye Bye Baby and Shang-A-Lang and were swarmed everywhere they went by adoring fans.  The mania surrounding the band was so huge, they were put on par with The Beatles as their most successful period was labelled Rollermania, thanks to the hoards of screaming young girls who followed them around.  For years, the band claimed they were swindled out of millions in royalties with some of the members taking action against their old label Arista Records in the US courts.  They split in 1978, with bitter battles over money between band members and managers dragging on for decades, but set in motion a new wave of Rollermania with a return to the concert circuit.  Late in 2015, three of the classic five \u0026ndash Alan, singer Les McKeown and guitarist Stuart \u0026lsquoWoody\u0026rsquo Wood \u0026ndash reunited for a series of shows nearly three decades on from their initial break-up. Hours before taking to the stage at T in the Park at Strathallan Castle estate, Perthshire, in July 2016 \u0026ndash and amid rumours of a dispute between members \u0026ndash Woody announced on social media the gig was to be his last. \u0026ldquoDisappointed is an understatement but outwith my control, he wrote.  However, it\u0026rsquos 2018 and they\u0026rsquore back again \u0026ndash this time as Les McKeown\u0026rsquos Bay City Rollers, with Si Mulvey, Phil Hendriks, Scott McGowan and Dan Guest set to grace the stage at the inaugural Edinburgh music festival ScotFest.  They\u0026rsquore also taking the to the global stage with appearances in Japan and Australia \u0026ndash but you\u0026rsquod better not get them mixed up with the Bay City Rollers.  Talking about their ScotFest appearance, plans to come back to Glasgow and about dedicating their ScotFest performance to Alan, Les\u0026rsquo attitude towards this interview \u0026ndash in hindsight \u0026ndash is no frills and refreshingly to-the-point.  Making reference to \u0026ldquothe Bay City Rollers being back, Les quickly corrects: \u0026ldquoThose Bay City Rollers are gone. This is the new Bay City Rollers, the Les McKeown Bay City Rollers.  So, how did the guys get involved with ScotFest? \u0026ldquoThe organisers put in an inquiry and we responded.  What can fans expect from the reformed Bay City Rollers?  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore not reformed, Aftab. And they can expect all the big hits. It\u0026rsquoll be a good day.  Looking to know more about the group coming to Glasgow\u0026rsquos King\u0026rsquos Theatre next April, Les opens up. Glasgow does have that effect on folk, after all.  \u0026ldquoI last played at the Hydro in 2016 and in the Barrowland Ballroom the year before that. I haven\u0026rsquot been to Glasgow in a while, but I\u0026rsquom looking forward to playing the King\u0026rsquos. It\u0026rsquos a classic venue, beautiful theatre. People can just sit back and enjoy the show.  The most poignant moment comes when discussing pal Alan.  There was a great outpouring of support from the across the world of music after the bass guitarist was rushed to hospital on June 7.  He had been described as \u0026ldquoextremely unwell after a virus attacked his organs.  The 69-year-old was on holiday in Mexico with wife Eileen when he fell ill. He was taken to Galenia Hospital in the coastal city of Cancun.  Back in Scotland, Alan lost his fight and passed away after a short stay in hospital on Monday.  Les had planned to travel to Scotland to see Alan the day before ScotFest to visit him in hospital and \u0026ldquocheck in on him and cheer him up because he was \u0026ldquoa really good mate.  However, he quelled fans\u0026rsquo concerns by assuring them the show will go on in Edinburgh. \u0026ldquoAlan always said nothing would stop him from going up on stage, so I\u0026rsquoll make sure I\u0026rsquom on stage dedicating it to him, he says.  \u0026ldquoWe plan on projecting pictures of Alan and the guys having fun and joking around at our shows to show people a good image of Alan.  Keen to focus on the group\u0026rsquos theatre tours, he says: \u0026ldquoWe always do three at the start of the year \u0026ndash January, February March and then three at the end, September, October, November.  \u0026ldquoIn December, we\u0026rsquoll be doing Ireland. They go crazy for us over there.  And it seems I may have found an unlikely fan in Les. Not only did I look him up on social media, but it turns out he did the same on me prior to our call. \u0026ldquoYou\u0026rsquore doing good work.

Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  We were inundated with hundreds of votes from across Scotland, the UK and as far afield as the Netherlands, Sweden and the US, and our quest got folk talking and reminiscing in offices, pubs and on social media, revisiting and celebrating the music that has been the soundtrack to their lives.  So, here we have it: Scotland\u0026rsquos top 10 favourite albums.  10 \u0026ndash Raintown, Deacon Blue, 1987    The band\u0026rsquos debut is packed to the rafters with sheer quality and from beginning to end simply never lets up. Dundonian singer-songwriter Ricky Ross showcased his talent, intent and also a keen political and social awareness across 13 songs, among them Scotland\u0026rsquos other national anthem, Dignity.  9 \u0026ndash High Land, Hard Rain, Aztec Camera, 1983    Could Roddy Frame really only have been 18 when he recorded Oblivious, Walk Out to Winter and We Could Send Letters? East Kilbride\u0026rsquos boy wonder emerges fully formed on this astonishing debut album from 1983, having soaked up the pop, soul and punk influences of his prodigious musical youth and reimagined them as perfectly-crafted jangle-pop. The sound of young Scotland has rarely sounded this fresh.  8 \u0026ndash Strange Kind of Love, Love and Money, 1988    Though Love and Money\u0026rsquos particular brand of literate, glossy soul-pop looked to America for inspiration, lyrics about \u0026ldquoraining on Jocelyn Square were resolutely, affectionately Glaswegian. In another place, another time, Love and Money could have been the biggest band in the world.  7 \u0026ndash If You\u0026rsquore Feeling Sinister, Belle and Sebastian, 1996    Second albums are supposed to be difficult but Belle and Sebastian arguably never surpassed the stunning collection of songs that comprised their sophomore effort, giving a masterclass in how to mix melody, melancholy, nostalgia and humour.  6 \u0026ndash Bandwagonesque, Teenage Fanclub, 1991    The album that thrust Teenage Fanclub into the indie big league. From opening track The Concept to the closing echoes of Is This Music?, it is jam-packed with all the qualities fans have come to love about Bellshill\u0026rsquos finest four-piece: Byrds-influenced, melody-rich songs delivered in an endearing, gently shambolic fashion.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  5 \u0026ndash Heaven Or Las Vegas, The Cocteau Twins, 1990    Elizabeth Fraser\u0026rsquos otherworldly voice set over Robin Guthrie\u0026rsquos ethereal soundtrack is one of Scotland\u0026rsquos greatest musical pleasures and treasures, and this most accessible of Cocteau\u0026rsquos albums is simply awash with blissed-out grandeur. Could they really have been from Grangemouth? Oh yes.  4 \u0026ndash A Walk Across the Rooftops, The Blue Nile, 1984    Sounding nothing like anything else that came out of Scotland, the UK or indeed anywhere else in 1984, this debut fused spare synth precision with exuberant vocal sincerity to stunning effect. Tinseltown in the Rain, that bittersweet slice of cinematic perfection, remains the ultimate ode to Glasgow.  3 \u0026ndash The Midnight Organ Fight, Frightened Rabbit, 2008    Since Scott Hutchison\u0026rsquos untimely death in May, listening to the music he and his bandmates created has been a particularly sad and difficult task. But this album is simply too good to stop listening to. Revisiting is painful but cathartic, and like all of the \u0026nbspHutchison\u0026rsquos work, it makes you feel like it\u0026rsquos okay to be sad.\u0026nbsp  2 \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, The Trashcan Sinatras, 1993    From post-Smiths jangleism on their debut the Ayrshire gang blossomed to reveal an emotionally rich and enduring marriage of musicality and lyrical nous never before seen within spitting distance of Irvine or anywhere else, crowned by flawless performances by one of Scottish pop\u0026rsquos most devastating singers, Eddi Reader\u0026rsquos younger brother Frank.  1 \u0026ndash Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989    Only seven songs in length, Hats is a masterpiece of love, loss and redemption writ large over a lush, soulful and at times overwhelmingly beautiful soundscape, inseparable from the city of its birth, Glasgow. For almost 30 years it has offered endless inspiration and comfort. \u0026ldquoWhen all the rainy pavements lead to you, sings a heartbroken Paul Buchanan on From a Late Night Train. The rainy pavements of Glasgow will always lead to Hats.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  Here\u0027s what you said about Hats:  Christine Gardner, Rotterdam: Head and shoulders above the rest. A magnificent album that I continue to listen to regularly after almost 30 years. It is quite simply a masterpiece. It continues to draw you in, delight your senses, touch your emotions and somehow mirror your own very personal experiences. And yet it is also essentially Scottish \u0026ndash maybe something to do with our collective psyche, despite all our individual differences.  Martin McCarthy: Hats has so many layers, from dreamy songs like Over the Hillside and Let\u0026rsquos Go Out Tonight to more upbeat songs like Headlights on the Parade and \u0026ldquoThe Downtown Lights.  Saturday Night is just a sublime song, I love the pitch perfect bass, the stunning keyboards and Paul Buchanan\u0027s emotional voice. This was played at our wedding to a full dancefloor and will always be so special. The songs on Hats convey love, beauty, pain and loss, and can push me to tears of utter joy and euphoria.  Alex Watkins: It\u0026rsquos the album I always return to just something about the memories and emotions it always conjures up.  Kevin Jackson: Hats is the best album ever recorded anywhere by anyone. It touches you in a way that others must stand back in awe and adoration of. It is a thing of perfection. When some of the finest innovative talents of our time see it as one of the greatest albums ever, it is because it has no peers.  Peter Morgan: I\u0027m going to plump for Hats, that lush, aching, bruised and battered homage to love and loss.  John Reader: I listen to a lot of music, including lots of new stuff but always have Hats on at some point every week. Still hooks me in with its lush simplicity. I remember saying to someone more than 25 years ago that of all the music around at that time I reckoned I\u0027d be listening to Hats for the rest of my life. Not wrong so far.  Colin Lunn: I love A Walk Across the Rooftops, the best first album by any group, not only in Scotland but worldwide. However, Hats was probably a better, more perfect album although it didn\u0026rsquot have the same influence. Tough, tough choice but I\u0026rsquoll go for Hats by a very, very fine margin.  Here\u0026rsquos what you had to say about some of the other music on the list:  Kyle Wallace: I\u0027ve Seen Everything by the Trashcan Sinatras is part of the soundtrack to my life. Listened to it through my dad\u0027s death and the college years. So many great songs associated with great memories.  John Richards: This was a very difficult choice. Scottish groups (I\u0027m Welsh) have a disproportionately large place in my music collection \u0026ndash particularly those who came to prominence in the 1980s. My top 20 regularly features the work of the Blue Nile, Danny Wilson, Aztec Camera, Deacon Blue and Love \u0026amp Money. However, it\u0027s got to be an album from the year I turned 19, when I went to university and the myriad possibilities that life had to offer opened up before me. The song (and album) that soundtracked that life-changing period is still my favourite Scottish album: Strange Kind of Love by Love \u0026amp Money.  Stuart Duncan: My vote is for The Midnight Organ Fight by Frightened Rabbit. An album that, as your writer said, \u0026ldquomakes it feel it\u0026rsquos OK to be sad. The lyrics hit home more than any album I\u0026rsquove ever listened to. Scott Hutchison gave me a feeling that everything was going to be OK, that I would get through things. I\u0026rsquod say he helped changed me as a person. It still hasn\u0026rsquot stuck in that he\u0026rsquos no longer here [Hutchsion took his own life in May] but my vote would be the same regardless of the circumstances.  Danny Tennyson: My favourite album by a Scottish band \u0026ndash or any other band for that matter \u0026ndash has to High Land Hard Rain, by Aztec Camera. The fact that Roddy was probably only 15 or 16 when he wrote most of the tracks for the album makes it all the more remarkable. He continues to be a genius to this day.  Shane Brown, Illinois: Why is it that I live in the centre boring part of America (the states you fly over to get somewhere else interesting), and should by location and birthright be a huge fan of Slipknot, but instead find myself with a vast collection of Scottish indiepop? From the Cocteaus to the Fannies, Belle \u0026amp Sebastian to Teen Canteen, Scottish indiepop has been the soundtrack to my life. How and why the music of your land speaks to me, I\u0027ll never know, but no album speaks to my soul more than Cake by the Trashcan Sinatras \u0026ndash a record I find as comforting as a cup of coffee on a cold winter morning. I really, really love it to this day, and why those lads aren\u0027t universally revered as musical genius is beyond me to this day. I\u0027ve travelled hundreds of miles to see them live and I\u0027ll continue to do so as long as they grace us with the occasional American tour.  John Jauchler, Connecticut: Lots of good stuff on your list, but my vote goes to the Trashcan Sinatras\u0026rsquo I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything. Outstanding musicians and really nice guys as well. Their music has made a difference in my life.

Mr Salmond lost Gordon last year after the biggest swing to the Tories anywhere in the UK.  To the dismay of many former colleagues, he has since worked as a TV presenter on the Alex Salmond Show on the Kremlin-backed RT channel.  The 63-year-old was asked about his intentions at a recent meeting of the SNP\u0027s Aberdeenshire East branch,\u0026nbspthe Daily Record reported.  Asked if he was would stand again for Gordon in the event of a snap election this year, the paper reported that he said he had set his sights \u0026ldquofurther north, referring to neighbouring Banff \u0026amp Buchan.  An SNP source also told the Herald\u0026nbspMr Salmond made the \u0026ldquofurther north remark, but admitted Mr Salmond loves to tease an audience.  However Ms Salmond has now rejected both the words attributed to him and the thrust of the story.  He told the Herald: \"Story is wrong. I said no such thing.\"  Pressed on whether the thrust of the story was accurate, if not\u0026nbspthe quote, he said: \"Story is just wrong - not just words but sense as well.\"  Mr Salmond, who lives in Banff \u0026amp Buchan, hinted at a return to politics the night he lost Gordon to Tory Colin Clark, saying: \u0026ldquoYou\u0026rsquove not seen the last of my bonnets and me.  Mr Salmond lost after a massive tactical vote by LibDem supporters, who backed the Tories in protest over a second independence referendum.  However the result in Banff \u0026amp Buchan was far more polarised, with previous SNP supporters appearing to switch directly to the Tories, giving Mr Clark a majority of 3,693.  Mr Salmond\u0027s residual personal vote in the constituency could tempt some back to the SNP.  The SNP is officially on a campaign footing because of the extraordinary feuding in Theresa May\u0026rsquos cabinet over Brexit, and her fragility as PM.  But the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act means there would only be an election if Tory MPs voted for it, and there is no appetite among them for walking into a potential defeat.  SNP deputy leader Keith Brown has been tasked with starting to organise candidate selections over the summer to help get the party ready for any vote or referendum.  A Scottish Conservative spokesman said: \u0026ldquoAlex Salmond was given his jotters by the people of Gordon in spectacular style last year.  \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquod get a similar response from voters in Banff \u0026amp Buchan.

As part of the groundswell Wheatley Group earlier linked up with Edinburgh social enterprise Social Bite, which started as a sandwich bar and won the high-profile support of Prince Harry and George Clooney, to provide flats in Glasgow and across central Scotland for homeless people through the charity Housing First.  The EIB loan, described as being \"by far the largest of its type made in Scotland\", is linked to a commitment by Wheatley to invest \u0026pound400m over the next three years in affordable housing.    Above: Jonathan Taylor,\u0026nbsp Amy Rigby, Nicola Sturgeon, Kyle Wilson  This also includes refurbishing existing homes to meet new Scottish and EU energy-efficiency standards, helping tenants cut energy bills, and housing and integrating refugees into communities.  The deal was announced in Glasgow by EIB vice president Jonathan Taylor at a community event attended by Nicola Sturgeon and tenants, staff and apprentices from across Wheatley, along with local politicians, business, community and social housing leaders.  It takes the amount of funding raised by Wheatley in the past four years to \u0026pound800m and comes in the week the group was confirmed \u0026ndash for the second year running \u0026ndash as the UK\u0026rsquos largest builder of social-rented homes.  Wheatley is forging ahead with an ambitious building programme, from 2015 through to 2025, of 7,500 affordable new homes across the country in communities including Balloch, Dumbarton, Glasgow, West Lothian, Edinburgh and North Berwick.  Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish Government is committed to reaching its target of 50,000 new affordable homes in three years time \"ensuring people have access to quality housing is a fundamental part of building a fair and equal society\".  She said the deal is \"also another reminder of how Scotland benefits from the EU and its institutions\".  Martin Armstrong, Wheatley chief executive, said the loan enables expansion \"but it is about so much more than simply bricks and mortar\".  \"Wheatley\u0026rsquos mission is to make lives, not just homes, better.\"  The group comprises six registered social landlords: Glasgow Housing Association, Dunedin Canmore, Cube Housing Association, Loretto Housing, West Lothian Housing Partnership and Barony Housing Association.  Alastair MacNish, Wheatley chairman, said: \u0026ldquoIt will help us to consolidate our position as the UK\u0026rsquos largest builder of social-rented homes, which we hold close as a badge of honour at a time when the availability and supply of affordable housing is such an acute priority.  Mr Taylor, speaking at the funding announcement at the Reidvale Neighbourhood Centre in Gallowgate, Glasgow, where GHA, is building 143 homes, said: \"New investment in social housing is crucial to increase the number of affordable homes and cut heating bills in existing properties.  \"This week\u0026rsquos visit to Glasgow provides a valuable opportunity to see how upgrading existing properties and construction of new social housing will improve lives, create skilled jobs, benefit local suppliers and cut heating bills in homes for hundreds of families.  The new \u0026pound185m EIB loan, along with future investments, will enable Wheatley to maintain a building programme of around 650 homes a year from 2021 to early 2025."},{"url":null,"title":"students-from-royal-conservatoire-of-scotland-are-amongst-most-employable-in-uk","story":"  New figures show the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland is the best in the country for graduate employability - and fourth in the UK.  More than 99 per cent of graduates from the conservatoire are in employment or further education six months after graduating.  Robert Gordon University, in Aberdeen, has the second highest employability in Scotland with 97.6 per cent of students securing a job or further study.  Professor Jeffrey Sharkey, principal of the conservatoire, said graduates made a lasting impact across the globe in their specialist fields.  He said: \"The conservatoire is the only place in Europe where you can study all of the performing arts on the one campus and our innovative, multi-disciplinary curriculum equips students with the skills, knowledge and experience to enable them to flourish in the professional world.  \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos national conservatoire is already recognised as one of the most distinctive institutions of its kind in the world and this latest endorsement further cements our status as a national and international centre of excellence for the performing arts.  David Lott, deputy director of Universities Scotland, said the overall figures showed Scottish universities were leading the way in the UK.  He said: \"Of all students who graduated last year, some 95.3 per cent were in employment or further study which is higher than the UK average and a real testament to the time and energy our institutions are investing in employability and ensuring that graduates are ready for the world of work.  \"Taken together with recent data revealing that graduates from Scottish universities earn more on average than graduates from elsewhere in the UK, these results demonstrate that our graduates can look forward to very successful careers after their studies.\""},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-facing-cabinet-backlash-over-last-ditch-brexit-plan","story":"  The Prime Minister was criticised by leading Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg and former ministers who said she had abandoned her own red line on quitting the EU single market.  One MP called it a \u0026ldquobotch and a \u0026ldquocomplete mess that broke Tory manifesto promises.  The ferocious backlash piles pressure on pro-Brexit cabinet ministers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove to reject Mrs May\u0026rsquos soft Brexit idea at a crunch meeting at Chequers today.  The pair tonight conferred with Brexit Secretary David Davis and other Eurosceptic ministers, including Esther Mcvey and Andrew Leadsom, in Mr Johnson\u0026rsquos office.  It followed reports that Mr Davis was also unhappy about the plan, telling Mrs May the EU would reject it because it would rely on the UK policing EU import tariffs.  Despite backing a single market in goods, the 100-page paper says the UK should diverge from EU rules on services, something Brussels has already dismissed as cherry picking.  After months of kicking the can down the road to avoid walk-outs from her divided cabinet, today\u0027s\u0026nbspmeeting is supposed to settle the UK\u0026rsquos preferred Brexit plan for customs and trade.  A White Paper next week should then form the basis of negotiations with the 27 other EU nations before the October deadline for a EU-UK deal.  Speaking after meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on Thursday, Mrs May said she had gathered her cabinet \u0026ldquoto decide on a substantive way forward.  Mrs Merkel said Brexit talks were now entering a \u0026ldquocrucial phase.  The UK\u0026rsquos ability to strike trade deals is seen as a cornerstone of Brexit by its supporters.  However papers given to the Cabinet for the crunch meeting at Chequers about the UK\u0026rsquos Brexit blueprint propose a \u0026ldquoharmonisation of UK and EU rules that could scupper this.  They said the UK should make an \u0026ldquoupfront choice to align its rules with the rest of Europe on goods and agriculture, something which would antagonise the US in particular.  Donald Trump\u0026rsquos commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, has already said he wants a post-Brexit UK to open itself up to US goods such as GM crops and chlorinated chicken, which are banned under EU standards, as part of broader transatlantic trading arrangements.  But the Chequers paper says \u0026ldquothe UK should maintain a common rulebook for all goods including agri-food, acknowledging this \u0026ldquowould not allow the UK to accommodate a likely ask from the US in a future trade deal as the UK could not recognise US standards.  Mr Rees-Mogg, chair of a 60-strong group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs, said ending the UK\u0026rsquos regulatory alignment with Europe was a \u0026ldquored line and Mrs May should tear up the plan.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is not Brexit. This common rulebook means that we are essentially a vassal state. This would be directly contrary to the Prime Minister\u0027s own assurances.\"  Former Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said the plan was a botch, a complete mess and a \u0026ldquocomplete breach of Mrs May\u0026rsquos manifesto commitments to leave the single market, the customs union and the European Court of Justice.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe could not eliminate tariffs to reduce prices for consumers and businesses, or strike free trade deals. This would deny the economy the full benefits of Brexit... and be completely at odds with what 17.4m voted for. We would be out of Europe but still run by Europe.  Former Brexit minister David Jones added: \u0026ldquoQuite simply, this is not what people voted for in 2016. This is not Brexit.  Scottish Brexit Secretary Michael Russell said the Tories had become \u0026ldquothe lemming party.  Scottish Secretary David Mundell repeatedly refused to rule out resignations when Mrs May\u0026rsquos deeply divided cabinet assembles at her country retreat today.  He said: \u0026ldquoI think there will be robust discussions. Of course people have strong views in relation to leaving the EU. But at the end of the day it\u0027s about reaching an agreement.  \"I\u0027m confident that we can, and everybody should rally round that.  He said he would ensure any deal protected \u0026ldquothe integrity of the United Kingdom.  After a meeting with UK ministers in London on Thursday, Mr Russell published a list of demands - mostly the status quo - the SNP government wants to see in the UK blueprint.  Sebastian Kurtz, the Austrian Chancellor, said he would support delaying Brexit beyond March 2019 to allow more time for talks to ensure the Irish border issue was resolved.  He said: \u0026ldquoOur goal is to reach agreement [on the border]. If that\u0026rsquos not possible we need to avoid a hard Brexit. If not, it\u0026rsquos good to keep negotiating.  Asked if that meant extending the two-year Article 50 process, he said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll see?  Meanwhile Germany Industry UK, which represents 100 companies including BMW, Lufthansa and ThyssenKrupp said it needed \u0026ldquocertainty and clarity about the way forward sooner rather than later over Brexit or German investment in the UK would suffer.  Jaguar Land Rover, Britain\u0026rsquos biggest vehicle manufacturer employing 40,000 people, this week said a bad Brexit would force it to rethink an \u0026pound80bn investment in the UK.  Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said the government was playing \u0026ldquoRussian roulette with tens of thousands of jobs by a government that \u0026ldquoplaces its survival, indulging narrow, extremist views, above the well-being of the people of this country.  Jaguar boss Dr Ralf Speth said the firm and its suppliers faced an \u0026ldquounpredictable future if frictionless trade with the EU and unrestricted access to the single market ended with Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"questions-asked-of-russia-after-novichok-couple-handled-contaminated-item","story":"  It comes after police say a couple who are critically ill may have been exposed to Novichok from handling a contaminated item.  Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley are currently fighting for their lives in hospital after being poisoned by the toxic chemical substance in Amesbury, Wiltshire, at the weekend.  It follows the highly publicised attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury in March.  Home Secretary Sajid Javid has demanded that the Kremlin provide an explanation for the two episodes, which investigators believe may be linked.  In a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Javid said: \"The eyes of the world are currently on Russia, not least because of the World Cup.  \"It is now time that the Russian state comes forward and explains exactly what has gone on.\"  Making clear that the UK will \"stand up to the actions that threaten our security\", he added: \"It is completely unacceptable for our people to be either deliberate or accidental targets, or for our streets, our parks, our towns, to be dumping grounds for poison.\"  Mr Javid told MPs that he \"cannot rule out\" the possibility that the Novichok found in Amesbury was from the same batch used in the Salisbury attack.  However the Russian Embassy has hit back, accusing the Government of trying to \"muddy the waters\" and \"frighten its own citizens\".  Officers were called to a home in Muggleton Road on Saturday morning when 44-year-old Dawn Sturgess collapsed.  They were called back later that day when Charlie Rowley, 45, also fell ill.  Because the highest concentration of Novichok was found on the couple\u0027s hands, police believe the item they handled could be a container or reciprocal -- such as a vial or syringe -- used to transport the nerve agent for the initial attack on the Skripals and discarded in a public place.  Novichok remains highly toxic for a considerable period of time, so even the tiniest trace remaining in a container picked up by the victims could account for their severe illness.  It was initially believed that the two patients had possibly been using drugs from a contaminated batch, police said.  But after further tests, authorities declared a major incident and on Wednesday night counter-terror police assumed responsibility for the investigation after the Government\u0027s Porton Down laboratory concluded that the pair had been exposed to Novichok.  In a press conference, Chief Constable Kier Pritchard of Wiltshire Police defended his force\u0027s initial response, saying that he \"fully supports\" the decisions taken by officers who thought the couple had initially fallen ill after taking illegal drugs.  Amid questions about the post-Salisbury clean-up operation, Home Secretary Javid said the risk to the public remained low.  He added: \"We have taken a very robust approach to decontamination and there is no evidence that either the man or the woman in hospital visited any of the places that were visited by the Skripals.  \"Our strong working assumption is that the couple came into contact with the nerve agent in a different location to the sites which have been part of the original clean-up operation.\"  Earlier yesterday, Security Minister Ben Wallace said the Amesbury couple were not directly targeted.  Mr Wallace told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: \"The working assumption would be that these are victims of either the consequence of the previous attack, or something else, but not that they were directly targeted.\"  Linking the incident to the attack on the Skripals, Mr Wallace said: \"I think what we said at the time was that this was a brazen and reckless attack in the heart of a very peaceful part of the United Kingdom, and that is part of the anger I feel about the Russian state is that they chose to use clearly a very, very toxic, highly dangerous weapon.\"  Prime Minister Theresa May declared that Salisbury is \"very much open for business\" after residents raised fears that the new case will hamper the local economy.  The Met said that around 100 detectives from the Counter Terrorism Network are working alongside colleagues from Wiltshire police.  Six sites visited by Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess before they fell ill have been cordoned off. Police have extended this to include all of Muggleton Road and outside the supported living where Ms Sturgess lived.  Debbie Stark, deputy director for Public Health England in the South West, said that anyone who may have been in any of the cordoned-off areas after 10pm last Friday should take some precautionary measures about washing clothing and cleaning jewellery.  The episode in Salisbury - the first use of a nerve agent in Europe since the Second World War - sparked international outrage.  Mr Skripal and his daughter have since left hospital.  A Russian Embassy spokesman said: \"All allegations of Russia\u0027s involvement in the incidents in Salisbury and Amesbury are merely speculative and are not based on objective data of the investigation.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8030619.jpg?type=article-full","title":"snp-childrens-minister-maree-todd-criticised-for-2lbs-of-sugar-recipe","story":"  Maree Todd, the minister for children and young people, posted her tablet recipe on Twitter despite government plans to restrict the marketing of junk food in shops.

It also said there was no appeal body for the watchdog\u0026rsquos decisions, and claimed that its role in reducing alcohol-related harm was \u0026ldquoneither clear nor explicit.

The charity\u0026rsquos chief executive, Richard Piper, said: \u0026ldquoWith roughly one person in the UK dying as a result of alcohol every hour, alcohol is no ordinary commodity, and we as a society have the right to set boundaries on the ways in which it is promoted.  \u0026ldquoThe current regulatory set-up doesn\u0026rsquot work.

Portman Group chief executive John Timothy said: \u0026ldquoOur Codes of Practice set high standards for alcohol producers. The Codes provide a framework for the independent complaints panel to consider complaints and are regularly reviewed through open and public consultation.  \u0026ldquoOur rules apply equally to all alcoholic products and producers and we offer a free and confidential advisory service to prevent irresponsible marketing appearing in the first place.  \u0026ldquoThe reality of regulation on a statutory footing would be a slower and less efficient system than the current self-regulatory approach and an additional burden on the UK taxpayer."},{"url":null,"title":"in-pictures-harrys-call-on-youth-leadership-as-meghan-shines-at-garden-party","story":"  Harry made the impassioned plea as he hosted a garden party to bring an end to the Commonwealth Secretariat\u0026rsquos week-long Youth Leadership workshop.

Scottish Conservative Mr Clark said: “The Oil \u0026amp Gas Technology Centre in Aberdeen is a major promoter of STEM subjects.“Does the Minister agree that it is essential to prioritise the take-up of STEM subjects if we are to have the engineers and technicians that we need for the future?”Sam Gyimah MP said the English school system had welcomed 17% more entrants to STEM A-levels since 2010, adding:“However, there is clearly a lot more to do, which is why we are focused on doing a lot through careers and through the university system.”                                                                                                        The UK Government is investing an additional £406 million in skills, including maths and digital, including an advanced maths premium, and an £84 million programme to improve the teaching of computing.After the session, Mr Clark said Scotland is behind England in science, maths and reading.He added: “There is also a shortage of STEM teachers in Scotland and it risks undermining children’s opportunities, including at Inverurie Academy in my constituency.“We have to catch up with England and re-establish the world-class education system we once had.                                                                                                        “That’s why it’s disappointing the SNP have deprioritised its education Bill.\"                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"encouraging prospects for beef and sheep markets","story":"\t\tThe transformation in the weather since mid-May and the consequent quick growth of grass has given Aberdeen and Northern Marts\u0026#8217 sales of breeding stock a massive boost in recent weeks.\t\t\t\tThe average price of heifers with calves at foot at the latest sale at Thainstone Centre was £150 up on the first seasonal sale at the beginning of May and £350 higher than last year, ANM head of livestock, John Angus reports.                                                    “It is encouraging that we have had more buyers round the ring at the May breeding stock sales and good quality heifers with calves at foot have been making £2,400 to £3,000 a unit,” said Mr Angus.                                                    “We had very little grass growth at the time of the first sale but the situation had completely changed by the time of the next sale three weeks later.”        Mr Angus said the strong trade indicated that confidence was returning to the beef industry and it was good to see herds replacing breeding stock on the back of buoyant prices for store cattle and a measure of stability in the prime cattle market.Highlights included a record price of 13,000gns for a Simmental bull at the spring bull sale at Thainstone and a heifer and calves selling for up to £5,200.“The prospects for the beef market for the second half of the year are looking good, but there are real concerns about the rising cost of fodder and straw due to the diversion of distillery co-products into the energy market and the switch to ryegrass on some farms to feed anaerobic digesters,” he said. “We could do with some rain to make sure silage crops bulk up although some farmers have been cutting grass early for silage out of fear of grass burning up.”Although some older farmers were tending to cut back breeding cow numbers to make life easier for themselves, there were fewer suckler herd dispersals this spring and very few cows and calves have been coming on the market.                                                                                                        Prime and cull cattle manager, Tim McDonald, expects the steady trade for prime cattle to continue and perhaps strengthen in the next few weeks and reports a particularly strong trade for fleshy cull cows. He is looking to England’s involvement in the World Cup in Russia, coupled with the forecast of good weather, to stimulate barbecue parties south of the border and boost the burger market.“The cull cow market has shown a big lift since April when farmers were too busy trying to catch up with drilling and the late spring. Demand for good, fleshy cows for the processing market is particularly strong and we have seen prices hit a top of £1,830,” said Mr McDonald.He also suggests it would be worthwhile for dairy farmers to consider feeding cull dairy cows to put on more flesh rather than marketing them in lean condition at the end of lactation.“The auction system is leading the way in cull cow prices and dairy farmers have the opportunity of making more money from well-fleshed cull dairy cows to supplement their income from milk,” he said.                                                                                                        The first real marker of the new season will be the show and sale of store cattle at Thainstone Centre on Friday, July 13, and as always some of the top suckled calves and stores from the summer shows will be on offer at the annual Spectacular show and sale on August 24.Turning to the sheep market, the phenomenal market for old season lamb continued right through the spring and ANM’s weekly sale at Thainstone Centre was still attracting up to 2,000 head right to the end of May.Prices peaked on April 5 when 4,782 head averaged 284.3p/kg (£126.21/head) with record numbers the following week attracting a massive entry of 7,952 to average 250.5p (£109.72/head).“The strongly rising market saw the auction ring come into its own as prices increased week after week,” said deputy livestock manager, Colin Slessor. “The level of prices achieved would never have been attained without the auction system leading the way and resulting in the strongest spring market for sheep we have seen for many years.“Those hoggs will have been bought in the trough of last autumn’s store trade when prices were down £5/head on the year. Finishers have enjoyed the double benefit of a lower purchase price and a high sale price which will have boosted margins and should augur well for this year’s autumn store lamb sales.”                                                                                                        Trade is being driven by a combination of strong demand, both on the home market and for the export market to Europe, and reduced imports from New Zealand.This season’s prime lamb market has started off on a high with some lambs hitting £130 - £140/head, and the cull ewe trade also rising sharply, peaking at £200 with pure Texels and Suffolks realising £170 - £190/head.The prospects remain encouraging and numbers will start building up from July onwards. Again, the auction system will be a vital element in ensuring producers achieve the best price available on the market.Despite weather problems during lambing, many farms are reporting a good lambing and good lamb numbers. The fantastic weather through May has transformed the performance of lambs as grass growth has taken off and lambs are set to reach the market early and in good order.The availability of grass has also triggered the market for ewes with lambs at foot with prices up around £10/head. Mule hoggs with single lambs have been making up to £140/head.“The strong prime market will hopefully impact positively on store markets which were in the doldrums last autumn,” says Mr Slessor.“The store lamb trade has been buoyant and prices have increased significantly, with finishers achieving good margins on last year’s lambs. Lamb producers in the Highlands and Islands certainly need a lift in price to give them a much needed boost following last year’s disappointing autumn trade.”With more ewe lambs being culled this year, rather than retained for breeding, trade and demand for gimmers is also likely to be stronger.Aberdeen and Northern Marts’ auction staff look forward to meeting customers at the forthcoming summer shows. The mart will have stands at the New Deer, Caithness, Turriff, Black Isle and Keith shows where auctioneers and field staff will be present to discuss the prospects for the autumn trade.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin.

Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general.

That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor.

All we are now waiting for is confirmation that it’s fully legal and then we can get on with implementing it. Our lawyers have told us that because we are a commercial operation and currently receive no subsidy whatsoever, we have to be 100 per cent sure that this scheme complies otherwise our whole business is at risk. We are not sure why it is taking so long to get simple confirmation.“Although not one penny of the proposed subsidy comes to us, it goes directly to the passenger, we would be forced to pay it all back if it doesn’t comply, that could ruin us and we can’t take that risk. All we are asking for is for the Scottish Government to check that it’s legal with the EU and UK and then we can get on with it. We have written to the new Minister Michael Matheson MSP and invited him to visit the island and meet our staff so we can share our concerns with him directly and hopefully he will visit soon so we can get this unlocked.“We have also today asked for a meeting with our local MSP Liam McArthur to see if he can do anything to get things moving forward on our behalf. This is extremely frustrating but as a family run, fully commercial Orcadian business, employing 70 people and with exciting expansion plans, we cannot put at risk our business until we are certain the Scottish Government’s proposal fully comply.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This follows a wave of criticism towards bus services in the county, which saw members of the public brand Stagecoach \u0026#8220a disgrace.\u0026#8221The hearing was called to consider failings in relation to the provision of contracted school services and local bus services, many of which were caused by vehicle breakdowns. The traffic commissioner was concerned about the standard of vehicle roadworthiness and presentation.In particular she heard evidence from the Stagecoach Managing Director in Scotland, Mr Robert Andrew, who took the opportunity to apologise in public to OIC officials for the company’s failures. The inquiry also saw representatives from the council give evidence.After hearing this evidence, as well as making a visit to the bus operator’s Kirkwall depot, Miss Aitken also made an order to reduce the number of vehicles authorised on licence held by Highland Country Buses Ltd — the subsidiary of Stagecoach which serves the Highlands and Islands. Of the 210 vehicles which had been licensed, 30 will  now be unlicensed until Miss Aitken is satisfied with the compliance of the company to its licenses and contracts.In response to this, Stagecoach North Scotland managing director, David Liston, said: \u0026#8220We understand the importance of reliable and high-quality bus services to local communities in the Highlands and Islands.\u0026#8220Since these issues arose, we have taken steps to ensure that there are robust maintenance and operational processes in place across our business in the north of Scotland, and we are continuing to focus in particular on fleet reliability and presentation.\u0026#8220We understand the frustrations local people have at times expressed and we would like to reassure our customers that we are working hard to deliver better bus services. In her decision, the Traffic Commissioner has asked that we make a contribution totalling £20,500 to the schools in Orkney, and we are happy to do so.\u0026#8220We are currently arranging for this sum to be paid to Orkney Islands Council for onward payment to the schools.\u0026#8221The Traffic commissioner has clarified that this payment of  £20,500 is not compensatory in nature and does not affect any contractual obligations between the Council and Stagecoach. It is, rather, an ex gratia payment. The Traffic Commissioner decided on this course of action rather than ordering a payment to be made to Scottish Government.This sum is to be split between schools in the county:Orkney Islands Council has responded positively to this decision by the traffic commissioner.\u0026#8220We welcome the outcome of the public inquiry called by the Traffic Commissioner held in Kirkwall on June 5, particularly the decision to distribute the payment locally to our schools,\u0026#8221 a council spokeswoman said.\u0026#8220We’ll continue to work closely with the Traffic Commissioner and Stagecoach on service improvements.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

wildflowers.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiative is being led by Scottish Natural Heritage to tackle alien species.Lynn McKelvey, Cromarty Firth Fishery Board project officer, said: \"Here at Garrie Island, in the River Conon, we have fantastic wet alder woodland, which is designated as being important at both a UK and European level.\"However, the woodland habitat has been under threat from invasive species, particularly Himalayan balsam, which spreads so quickly growing in dense stands, meaning no native wildflowers can grow.\"Head teacher Tania Mackie said: \"Outdoor learning is fundamental to the curriculum at Ben Wyvis Primary School, as is working with local partners.\"We are delighted to be working with Cromarty Firth Fishery Board and the SISI project.\"Not only are the children being supported by experts, but the pupils of Ben Wyvis Primary are also learning about their local environment.\"Learning in context is a valuable experience for all our young people and as a school we are encouraging our young people to step beyond the classroom, whilst developing the young workforce\".Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham praised volunteers for the vital role they

Pam\u0026rsquos paintings are absolutely fantastic and we hope this event is a great success.\"Since the age of 63, Pam\u0026nbsphas painted hundreds of pictures, been a member of art groups and exhibited locally.Until recently she also\u0026nbspknitted clothes for infants in the special baby unit at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness and was a puzzle enthusiast, winning the Ross-shire Journal crossword at the age of 99.She celebrated her 100th birthday surrounded by friends and family at the Church of Scotland Hall in the village last year after a neighbour of 36 years\u0026rsquo standing, Joyce Fraser, decided to organise something special to mark the milestone event.Mrs Foster was also joined by friends from the local WRI and art group, along with\u0026nbspstaff and residents of the care home she was about to move to. Mrs Foster\u0026rsquos nieces and nephews from as far afield as the Canary Islands, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Sussex headed north for the event.Her birthday cake, baked by a relative, was shaped as an artist\u0026rsquos palette to represent one of her great passions in life.Mrs Foster was born in Surrey and spent her childhood with her three siblings in Kent, where her father had a grocery business.She started her working life in an office at a department store and then worked as a secretary mainly with legal firms, in England and Edinburgh.Mrs Foster said she and her husband Tony had been \"gradually moving up the country\" before settling in their cottage in Muir of Ord. Her husband passed away in January 2012.Asked the secret of her long life, she said: \"I\u0026rsquove been asked this before and I always say \u0026lsquopure living\u0026rsquo, but of course it\u0026rsquos not!

A number of new schools have been built, which is brilliant for the pupils and communities that benefit.\"Despite receiving more funding than nearly all other local authorities, Highland Council still has the worst school estate in Scotland.\"The funding recognises the rurality of Highland Council, but most schools have been built in more densely populated areas like Inverness. It is of particular sadness that this funding has not gone further so that more school buildings could benefit.\"But Highland Council leader Margaret Davidson has defended the local authority\u0026rsquos track record, pointing out that it has 204 schools to maintain \u0026ndash more than any other area in the country. She added that Scottish Schools for the Future funding was welcome but added that current levels of funding from Holyrood are \"simply not enough to adequately invest in our schools\".She urged the Scottish Government to provide funding levels which recognise the unique challenges facing the Highlands, \"and in particular the very large number of schools, many of which are smaller schools, requiring urgent investment\".And she called for it to consider capacity pressures when allocating funding.\"If Kate Forbes wants to help Highland schools, then she should support our asks from government.\"Friday 6 Jul 2018 9:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4763516.1530642722!/image/image.jpg","title":"professor john elliott what scots and catalans can learn from history","story":"\t\tRelations between Catalonia and Madrid soured in the 1800s as the Romantic Movement took off and inspired a new kind of nationalism, writes John Elliott.\t\t\t\tAs the current generation of Scots and Catalans face up to unusually agonising decisions about the future they want for themselves and their children, it is perhaps salutary to take a step back and consider how and why this dilemma has arisen.            This is what I have tried to do in my book, Scots and Catalans. Union and Disunion, a comparative  history of two peoples without states of their own, whose attempts to define, reassess and perhaps transform their relationship to the larger polities to which they belong has been drawing headlines across the world.             The book begins with the Middle Ages and ends in December 2017 after the flight to Belgium of the Catalan President, Carles Puigdemont, following the failure of a unilateral bid to break away from the Spanish state and establish Catalonia as an independent republic.Many years ago I wrote a study of the origins of the Catalan rebellion of 1640 against the royal government in Madrid – a rebellion that inspired the creation of a Catalan republic which lasted for a week. As I contemplated the unfolding of today’s Catalan separatist movement and the simultaneous rise of Scottish separatism, I thought it might be illuminating to attempt a sustained comparison of the historical experience of the two countries and of the ways in which a sense of national identity has manifested itself over the centuries.READ MORE: Kenny MacAskill: Stop treating Catalonia as a proxy for ScotlandNaturally there are important differences between the two national histories, but differences can be as revealing as similarities in reaching historical conclusions. One obvious difference is that Scotland was for centuries an independent kingdom, whereas Catalonia was never a truly independent state. It was a principality that formed part of a federation, the Crown of Aragon, which was united with the Crown of Castile as a result of the marriage of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile in 1469. This dynastic union created the country that came to be known as ‘Spain’. Dynastic union between Scotland and England came more than a century later, when James VI of Scotland’s inheritance of the English throne in 1603 created ‘Great Britain’.  The immediate effect of these unions was similar, in the sense that, although both Scotland and Catalonia preserved their traditional forms of government, they were now linked to a far more powerful neighbour. This produced inevitable tensions, and at the start of the 18th century attempts were made to resolve them, although in very different ways. The 1707 Anglo-Scottish Union created a British parliamentary monarchy, in which the Scots surrendered their Edinburgh parliament in exchange for access to England’s expanding commercial and colonial empire.             In 1716, following the surrender of Barcelona two years earlier to the forces of Philip V, who was the monarch of the newly enthroned Bourbon dynasty, Catalonia, like the rest of the Crown of Aragon, was stripped of its traditional laws and liberties, and was merged into what became an authoritarian monarchical Spain.Scotland and Catalonia both benefited economically from the constitutional changes of the early 18th century, although the expansion of Britain’s overseas empire gave the Scots many more opportunities than those enjoyed by the Catalans. The British empire of the 18th and 19th centuries was a joint Anglo-Scottish creation, whereas the Catalans remained on the margins of Spain’s long-established American empire. Instead, they turned their energies to economic development, and became the pioneers of Spanish industrialisation, based on a rapidly growing textile industry. READ MORE: Brian Wilson: Catalonia is evidence of the benefits of a UnionScotland, too, was being transformed by the growth of its industries in the same period, but, unlike Catalonia, it never became the main power-house of the wider, national, economy. The long-term effect of these differences is still to be seen. In Spain, economic and political development were out of kilter in the 19th and early 20th centuries. While Madrid was the country’s political capital, its economic capital was Barcelona. In Britain, London was both.            In the 19th century, Catalonia’s relationship with the government in Madrid soured. This was partly the result of Spain’s chronic political instability in the decades following the Napoleonic invasion and the Peninsular War. But it can also be explained by a pan-European phenomenon, the emergence of a new-style nationalism inspired by the Romantic Movement. The researches of historians, literary scholars and folklorists into the origins of their societies generated a sense of the nation as an organic community with its own distinctive characteristics. Such explorations of the Catalan past helped produce another significant difference between Scotland and Catalonia. It was language that became the point of reference for national identity in Catalonia, in a way that Gaelic would never be for that of Scotland. The Catalans clung to their language when the repressive regime of General Franco sought to replace it with Castilian, the predominant language of Spain. After Franco’s death in 1975, a reaction was inevitable. The autonomous Catalan regime created by the 1978 Constitution of the newly democratic Spain was determined, through its control of the educational system, to ‘Catalanise’ Catalan society in the face of the encroachment of Castilian through the national media. The resulting linguistic question has played a large part in creating the current impasse between Catalonia and the Spanish government.It is one of the ironies of this stand-off that the 30 years between 1978 and the financial collapse of 2008 have been the most prosperous and successful in Catalonia’s colourful history. But the economic crisis gave radical Catalan nationalists a chance to depict Catalonia as the victim of a malign Spanish state, and the inflexibility of a Spanish government determined to treat the secessionist movement as a constitutional question that should properly be left to the courts handed the separatists a propaganda victory that they have exploited to the full. Referendums, whether authorised or unauthorised, as in the Catalan case, are at best blunt instruments for determining the will of the people. In forcing binary choices they can be deeply divisive, and Catalonia is now a bitterly divided society, in which intimidation is being exercised by secessionists who claim to speak for all its inhabitants. A highly creative people with a long and distinguished history, the Catalans deserve better than this.

So it is a shame that Mr Yousaf continues to play the same tired old games, even after the commendable efforts of councillors and MSPs of all parties and none has secured at least some action towards correcting this patently unfair situation.\nThe transport minister is right in congratulating the island councils for their tenacity in pursuing this issue. It\u0026#8217s just a shame it was the actions – or inactions – of his SNP government which forced them to be so tenacious.\nAnd what is now abundantly clear is that, in spite of the SNP\u0026#8217s protests, the money was always available to address this issue. The SNP managed to magic up an extra £170 million yesterday which, apparently, they didn\u0026#8217t have when the budget was first presented. So the question many in the Northern Isles should be asking Mr Yousaf is why didn\u0026#8217t the SNP include fair funding in their draft budget in the first place?\nWhen SNP ministers were trying to dismiss fair funding, I was regularly questioning them in the Scottish Parliament on their commitment. I was meeting with representatives from the island councils – in Lerwick, in Kirkwall and in Edinburgh.\nI put forward the amendment which, accepted by the entire Scottish Parliament (including Mr Yousaf and the SNP), recognised the lifeline nature of our internal ferries. And I wrote to Mr Yousaf and to his boss, Nicola Sturgeon, on the issue.\nSo I suppose it is flattering that, of all the opposition MSPs who voted against the SNP Budget, Mr Yousaf has chosen to single me out in this way for his faux outrage. I would suggest it\u0026#8217s an indication of the effectiveness of my consistent and vocal opposition to the SNP\u0026#8217s attempt to sweep its own fair funding pledge under the carpet.\nAnd in relation to the vote itself, Mr Yousaf seems intent on misleading Shetlanders. The truth is that MSPs do not vote on individual parts of the budget, but rather on the budget as a whole.\nSo, even with the late U-turn on additional ferry funding, this budget remains, overall, a disappointing budget for people and businesses in Shetland. It will mean that many of my constituents – in fact, anyone earning over £26,000 per year – will pay more tax.\nIt will hit the incomes of local people and businesses, something numerous business organisations have warned will harm Scotland\u0026#8217s already sluggish economic growth. And it leaves our local councils across the region still having to make tough spending decisions. So it is for those local and regional MSPs who supported the SNP\u0026#8217s budget to defend their decision. I simply wasn\u0026#8217t prepared to back a budget which will leave too many local people out of pocket.\nAnd an inconvenient fact Mr Yousaf, too busy patting himself on the back for belatedly delivering something even the SNP in Orkney accept was always an SNP commitment, choses to ignore is that this is only a deal for this year and not a long term solution. So the real risk is that we will have to go through this process all over again for next year\u0026#8217s budget.\nI hope next year, the SNP will deliver a long term settlement on fair funding, not another one off. That a long-term solution will be found that will meet the needs of the local communities so reliant on these lifeline links. And that Mr Yousaf, Derek Mackay and the SNP will avoid the political theatrics that have dominated this year\u0026#8217s budget process.\n Edinburgh.\n If all politicians behaved in this manner it is likely that every budget in every parliament would fail, even though every single clause had enthusiastic and popular local backing no one was willing to support the package as a whole.\n Clearly these are not the section of his constituents Mr Halcro \u0026#8211 Johnston is interested in.\n The tartan Tories are living up to their name for sure and their blind supporters still try to defend them.\nMr Halcrow objects to political parties playing games?\n\nWhich party does Christopher \u0026#8216up-skirting\u0026#8217 Chope belong to again?\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s most extreme weather.\n\"We decided to put our meteorological skills together and chase the storms ourselves.\"\nThe group of Reading University graduates rented a car and travelled 7000 miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nFriday 6 Jul 2018 9:39
