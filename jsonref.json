The couple also attended the royal wedding earlier this year and if they are throwing a party they could invite guests such as Simon Cowell           A spooky witch sits on top of Robbie Williams and Ayda Field\u0027s gate with a sign reading (caution) underneath. A small white scorpion also creeps along the gate           Other homes in West London had put spooky tape across windows which read \u0027keep out\u0027, as well as cute miniature pumpkins If the fanfare surrounding Ross\u0027 home was anything to go by, then this yea\u0027s party is set to be an event to be remembered. In the past, the great and the good have attended his famous Halloween parties, with the likes of Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne, Rita Ora, Claudia Schiffer and Alan Carr all dressing up in scary costumes. Previous themes included a haunted castle  complete with dungeon and another year, he had a Labyrinth theme.  However, this year fashion designer  Julien Macdonald could be in the running for the most spooktacular decorations.Julien Macdonald put his techniques to the test as he decorated the outside of his house. The 47-year-old fashion designer focused on skeletons for his house of horrors.          The home of Petra Ecclestone in Chelsea, London which has been decorated with a not so friendly looking ghost          The exterior of the home of fashion designer Julien Macdonald who focused on a prehistoric look for Halloween          Across the country children too part in trick or treating donning various spooky ensembles   Residents in High Street Kensignton had also dressed up their homes with skulls and ghosts (left) and with huge spiders draping across the front of the houses (right)Outside the home skeletons can be seen scaling the outside of the building by climbing up a rope, while others can be seen sat together laughing on a bench.The exterior of his home looks positively prehistoric as skeletal dinosaurs roam the front of the house. If he is throwing a party, it\u0027s likely to be a glamorous affair, as Julien is friends with a host of glamorous models, including Winnie Harlow, Abbey Clancy, as well as Hailey Baldwin. Man, 19, in an inflatable dinosaur costume is arrested for...The View politicizes Halloween with Joy Behar as the \u0027Mid...GMA and Today Halloween: NBC steals the show in annual...Share this article    A skeleton donning a grey cape hanging from the tree outside this home in London was seen next to another bare skeleton          This house in West London was home to a HUGE spider with beady red eyes, the spider sat guarding the front of the propertyThis is while Celebrities such as Robbie Williams have polished off the pumpkins to transform their marvelous mansions into a spectacularly spooky abode. If you walk past the home of Robbie Williams and Ayda Field  in West London then you will be treated to a gate full of webs, fake spiders and stacks of pumpkins. No doubt Simon Cowell and Louis Tomlinson will be at the top of their party guest list and maybe the rest of Take That and the Loose Women panel will pop round for a brew, or maybe even some punch.           Other homes in the area had also followed a theme, this pumpkin sat on the steps of a house which had employed a Harry Potter Halloween theme          The owner of this home must be a Harry Potter fan as the pumpkins have \u0027Harry Potter\u0027 carved into them as well as a scarecrow wearing a Gryffindor scarf          Residents of Gloucester Road in Chelsea have gone all out this year as they even decorate street signs with cobwebsThis is while British model Petra Eccleston  has decorated the outside of her Chelsea home with even bigger webs, huge furry false spiders, pumpkins and every a scary ghost outside of her gate.It\u0027s not just celebrities in West London who seem to have gone all out this Halloween, many houses in the area seem to be covered head to toe in Halloween decorations, many of that rivaling their celebrity counter parts. The effort put in by non-celebrities comes as no surprise as a recent study suggested that Halloween is now favoured over Christmas in the UK.          This home completed the Halloween theme with a skeleton in overalls being pinned to the wall by a web          This home tried to go for a chic look by decorating the exterior of the house in orange, black and grey balls, as well as spiders climbing up the walls   Home owners made sure the entrance to their abodes were complete, on the left they focused on spiders, dead pifs and witches, while on the right spooky carved pumpkins lined the steps Researchers polled the nation about their spook-tacular celebrations tonight and discovered nearly half (44 per cent) of 16-21-year-olds say they actually prefer the ungodly terrors of Halloween to the biggest religious festival of the year, Christmas.According to the youngsters polled by beverage company Fanta, All Hallow’s Eve is better for partying with friends (51 per cent), while 49 percent said they loved getting dressed up in ghastly outfits. Other reasons given by young Brits included the fact they are given more freedom to have fun than at Christmas (24 per cent), while a further 9 per cent admitted they prefer Halloween as they don’t have to spend so much time with family.           Welcome to the house or horrors: this home welcomed guests and onlookers with a creepy clown holding scissors          This home will be sure to scare people as the Grim Reaper greets guests holding the head of what looks to be a dead doll bride          The homes on this street in West London sported cobwebs strewn across the windows with large spiders climbing across themHalloween is believed to originate from the traditional Celtic harvest festival of Samhain which started out being called called All-Hallows Eve. The night became Halloween when it was adopted by the early Christian Church. Halloween’s popularity has grown at a frightening rate since Trick or Treating travelled over from the US, with retail stores up and down the country selling costumes and decorations for months in advance for the scare fest.Over 70 per cent of the 1,000 16-21-year-olds surveyed  will get dressed up tonight - with 74 per cent of girls and 64 per cent of boys getting ready to scare.           The house had cordoned off their gate with spooky glow in the dark Halloween tape, as well as cobwebs and pumpkins  The owners of the homes on the left took a more Autumnal look to their Halloween decorations, while on the right the owners decided to veil their home in black, completed with skeletons           This house is enough to give anyone that spooks and is home to scary carved pumpkins and cobwebs which cover the gates of the house"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/31/12/1BABCB2F00000578-0-image-m-56_1540990450975.jpg","title":"Kate faces tragic fate ancestors WW1 time","story":"    The Duchess of Cambridge was greeted by school children and museum goers as she visited the Imperial War Museum in London   She was attending the museum to to read letters relating to the three brothers of her great-grandmother (left), one of the letters she was shown was signed \u0027Lionel\u0027 at the end (right)          Kate can be seen riffling through different letters at the museum based in the Lambeth area of London   Before reading through the letters inside the museum (left) also chatted with Deputy lord lieutenant Rosi (right)Having been raised on the heartbreaking history of her forebears, the duchess was very keen to see these new documents for herself.Here was a story reminiscent of the Hollywood blockbuster Saving Private Ryan – about a man who has lost four brothers in the Second World War. Although based on a true story, Steven Spielberg’s multi-Oscar-winning film was fiction. This was a tale of true, unvarnished tragedy – one which now goes to the heart of the modern Royal Family.The duchess had never seen photographs of her three great great uncles – Francis, Maurice and Lionel Lupton – until yesterday afternoon. She was particularly struck by the family resemblance in young Maurice. The boys’ mother Harriet had died in 1892.          Some of the mementos which were shown to Kate included a photo of a man called Maurice The tragedy that haunts Kate\u0027s family: How three young...Why was Kate Middleton not wearing a sash at the state...Share this articleThe letters from the men were placed next to their photographs, which have been stored at the museum           Just days ahead of the century of the Armistice the duchess attended the Imperial War Museum on WednesdayNor had she seen family heirlooms like the standard issue postcard from Lionel on July 16, 1916, telling his family: ‘I am quite well.’ Just hours later, he was killed by enemy shell fire.‘It’s all so sad,’ said the duchess, her words tailing off.Here, too, was the telegram from a certain Richard Noel Middleton, married to the brothers’ elder sister, Olive. He was serving on the same part of the Western Front as the eldest Lupton, Francis, when his brother-in-law went missing in 1917. Richard went out searching for him and, in all the mayhem, actually found his body.  The duchess was shown various letters such as this one (left) which started \u0027Dear Father\u0027, she seemed to enjoy rifling through the postcards and letters           One of the letters shown to the duchess had a postal stamp marked Chapel Town, Leeds (right hand corner)          This telegram was also shown to the duchess. The telegram said there was \u0027bad news\u0027 and that \u0027Francis body\u0027 had been found \u0027near Taylors\u0027He then had the grim task of confirming the news in a telegram to the family in February 1917: ‘Bad news. Francis body found. Killed instantaneously bomb.’The stark brevity of it stunned the duchess. ‘Hardly any words. It’s so bland,’ she sighed. ‘How sad.’Richard and Olive, who were married in 1914, later produced a son, Peter Middleton, who went on to serve as a fighter pilot in the Second World War. His son, Michael Middleton, is the duchess’s father.          The the duchess explored the museum and seemed intrigued at the letters and photos which were presented before herThe news of Francis’s death, confirmed in that telegram from Richard Middleton, was followed by a special letter on black-bordered paper with a very familiar letterhead.‘You might recognise the address, Ma’am,’ observed the IWM’s director, Diane Lees, lightening the mood.The duchess nodded. Here was a letter from Buckingham Palace, signed by the Keeper of the Privy Purse, to Francis Lupton Senior in April 1917. ‘The King realises that this is the third beloved son you have given in your Country’s cause,’ reads the typewritten letter. ‘His Majesty trusts that you may be granted strength and comfort in the further sorrow which you have been called upon to bear.’    Whilst at the museum Diane Lees (right) the director explained the poppy sculpture \u0027Weeping Window\u0027 as she arrived at the museum ‘I’m sure so many families had these letters and sad stories,’ the duchess reflected. In fact, as the IWM’s head of documents, Anthony Richards, pointed out later, the poor Luptons were actually extremely unfortunate. ‘To lose all three sons was fairly unusual,’ he explained.It may be more than 100 years since the brothers were killed yet there remains a timeless poignancy to this message of commiseration from George V to a bereft father in Yorkshire who would turn out to be the great great great grandparent of the future George VII.The family had been granted the flimsy consolation of knowing that the bodies of all three of their sons were found, identified and buried in marked graves – unlike the hundreds of thousands merely engraved on memorials to the missing. All three graves are lovingly tended to this day by the gardeners of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.    Kate looked fresh faced as she marvelled at the poppy sculpture situated on the outside of the museum Despite the sombre nature of the visit, the duchess and her hosts were keen to touch on some of the lighter moments contained in the letters. In one of them, Maurice wrote about a soldier adopting a magpie as a pet. In another, he wrote home requesting a consignment of vegetable seeds.‘A very Middleton thing,’ the duchess noted brightly. ‘My grandmother loved gardening. I’ve got a lot to live up to.’ Results have been mixed in the Kensington Palace vegetable patch, by all accounts. ‘You shouldn’t see my cauliflowers,’ the duchess added.She also read a letter from Maurice to his father, making light of life in the trenches – even though his trench occupied such a boggy bit of ground that ‘there is generally only about 18” actually dug and the rest is built up with sandbags or sods, to make a little place you can crawl into for protection from a shell or bullet’.      Francis Lupton (left) was killed in 1917, Lieut Lionel Lupton in 1916 and Captain Maurice Lupton in 1915Major Francis Lupton  (left)The eldest brother, he served with the 8th Battalion West Yorkshire Regiment and was killed by a bomb on February 19, 1917, aged 31.He had been married for less than three years and had a young daughter, Ruth. By the time he went to France in January 1917 with the Leeds Rifles to serve with the all-territorial 62nd (2nd West Riding) Infantry Division, his two brothers had already been killed.He was posted as missing after only six weeks. It was thought he might have been taken prisoner, but two months later his body was found. It was thought he was blown up on patrol.Captain Maurice Lupton  (right)The family’s first casualty of the war, Maurice was killed by a sniper on June 19, 1915, aged 28 – only two months after going to the front line.He joined the Leeds Rifles, became a captain in the 7th battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment, the Prince of Wales’ regiment, and was shipped to the support trenches in Belgium as part of the all-territorial 49th (1st West Riding) Infantry Division.He arrived on April 19, 1915. He was one of 2,050 members of the Leeds Rifles to be killed on active service in France and Flanders during the war.Lieut Lionel Lupton  (centre)The youngest of the brothers to lose their lives, he was killed by a German shell at the Battle of the Somme aged only 24 on July 16, 1916.He served with 28th Brigade Royal Field Artillery and had spent a significant amount of time in the front line trenches in France, surviving the Battle of Loos in 1915.He was then wounded on December 1, sent to a hospital in London to recuperate and travelled home for Christmas, where his family was mourning the death of his brother Maurice, before returning to the Western Front. He was mentioned twice in despatches.                                                             "},{"url":null,"title":"NBC employees appalled learn Megyn Kelly apologized Luann Lesseps blackface remarks","story":"    Do you know, where you\u0027re going to?: Megyn Kelly texted Luann de Lesseps to apologize for referencing her Diana Ross costume (above) in the panel about blackface that led to her dismissal from Today reports US Weekly          Disbelief: That report has left NBC staff \u0027livid,\u0027 with a source telling DailyMail.com that a number of people are angry she never personally apologized to her colleagues (l to r: Carson Daly, Savannah Guthrie, Craig Melvin and Al Roker in August)De Lesseps found herself in hot water when she used bronzer to darken her features while dressing as Diana Ross.She later apologized for that act when she was bombarded with criticism on social media and said she \u0027would not dream\u0027 of doing blackface.\u0027 Despite de Lesseps\u0027 herself admitting that she was wrong to darken her features, Kelly still elected to defend her on Today last Tuesday during a discussion about Halloween costumes.It was those remarks that precipitated her swift fall from grace. \u0027But what is racist?

The Palau ban relates to sunscreens containing chemicals including oxybenzone, octocrylene and parabens, which covers most major brands.Palau has long been a pioneer in marine protection, introducing the world\u0027s first shark sanctuary in 2009, in a move that has been widely imitated.It has also banned commercial fishing from its waters and last year introduced the \u0027Palau Pledge\u0027 requiring international visitors to sign a promise stamped into their passport that they will respect the environment.Craig Downs, executive director at the Haereticus Environmental Laboratory in Hawaii, said other nations would be watching Palau\u0027s move closely.\u0027It\u0027s the first country to ban these chemicals from tourism.

He said it would campaign for Brexit ‘outside the Westminster Bubble’. How far outside the SW1 postcode his Leave.EU donations were originally sourced – Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin and his oligarch allies loom large in this story – is now the business of the National Crime Agency.Banks denies any wrongdoing. Indeed he has always been bullish towards those who have accused him of being a Russian ‘straw man’. His critics are sore Remainer losers, he insists his Twitter feed is headed with the injunction ‘Get Over It.’ Sceptical MPs have been treated by him with public contempt and he is appealing the Electoral Commission’s decision earlier this year to fine the Leave.EU campaign for overspending.In truth the watchdog has enforcement powers akin to those of a toothless chihuahua – a view shared not least by its former chief executive who resigned last month.Arron Banks is now a Tory: Millionaire who bankrolled Ukip...Share this articleBut having found ‘reasonable grounds to suspect’ the tycoon was not the legal ‘true source’ of the £8million loans he made to Better For The Country – the company which ran the Leave.EU campaign – and that he could have committed multiple other suspected criminal offences, the commission has passed the case on to the National Crime Agency.Far from being toothless the NCA, founded to fight serious and organised crime, is the investigatory equivalent of a great white shark. And there is much for its agents to explore, little of which is mundane.Banks’s known Brexit money trail stretches from diamond mines in southern Africa via companies in the offshore tax havens of the Isle of Man and Gibraltar, to the coffers of Leave.EU.          Mr Banks and former UKIP leader Nigel Farage at a party together in 2014But the NCA will no doubt explore further, delving behind the opaque network of his offshore companies. This will include allegations of Russian-orchestrated business ‘sweeteners’ which involved Banks being offered a cut of gold mines in Siberia, Armenia and Guinea. These inducements were reportedly made to him at the start of the Brexit campaign.Such questions would not be asked if Banks – who claims a fortune of £100million – was indisputably a member of the global super-rich.He is undoubtedly wealthy. But for the last 12 months his ability to give away such a large sum of cash to the Brexit campaign has come under scrutiny. He has said his fortune was built on a raft of business successes. Critics – and yes many of them are pro-Remain campaigners – argue that the figures simply don’t stack up.His four diamond mines in South Africa and Lesotho – a region where he has spent considerable time since 2014 – are said to be ailing if not moribund, for example. His insurance companies have owed millions his bank on the Isle of Man was performing ‘poorly’ his stake in a law firm was far smaller than advertised.One investigation calculated the money he had supposedly donated to the Brexit campaign constituted half of his lifetime’s total earnings, which did not make sense.Official action has been slow in coming, if not apathetic.          Mr Banks  with his Russian wife Katya (centre) and his mother-in-lawThe Mail understands that in early 2016 the then home secretary Theresa May declined a request by one of the security services to investigate Banks. The topic was simply too explosive in the run up to the referendum.The Mail has also seen a letter which Ben Gummer MP, at that time minister for the cabinet office, wrote to the Labour MP Ben Bradshaw in February 2017. It was in response to Mr Bradshaw’s expressed fears of external interference in the referendum campaign.‘I can assure you there is no evidence or reasonable grounds for suspicion concerning foreign interference in UK elections or the EU referendum,’ wrote Mr Gummer.‘I am confident that there is negligible risk of a foreign government or agency being able to influence the operational delivery of electoral events in the UK.’Until 2017, stories about Russian influence on Mr Banks extended no further than the fact he was married to Ekaterina Paderina, with whom he has had three children. Miss Paderina, his second wife, originates from the Urals.But there were whispers behind the scenes at Westminster. In early 2017 Banks demanded an apology from a Tory MP who, he claimed, told key figures in the team of President Trump – with whom Banks is close – that he had ‘improper relations’ with the Kremlin.      When questioned about ties with Russian officials Wigmore claimed his initial contact was at the Ukip conference at Doncaster racecourse in 2015 when, as a diplomat accredited to the small central American state of Belize, he discussed the banana industry with someone from the Russian embassy.Wigmore said it was he who instigated the conversation which led to him and Banks dining at the ambassador’s residence.They thought it would be ‘nice’ for Banks’s Russian wife.Asked whether Leave.EU was funded by Russia, Wigmore replied ‘nyet’ - Russian for ‘no’.Banks told the committee that while he had met the gold magnate he had no business interests in Russia – ‘too risky’. He had however given a telephone number for President Trump’s transition team to the Russian ambassador .It was the ‘only thing’ of significance that came out of the meetings – ‘because the Russians wanted to get hold of the transition team’. The grilling ended abruptly when Banks and Wigmore simply walked out. ‘We’ve got places to be, I’m afraid,’ Banks told the MPs.‘I really have to insist. I was told a certain time and we’ve got a lunch appointment that I don’t want to be late for.’ The committee was not impressed.Damian Collins, the its Tory chairman, said last night: ‘Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore have misled the committee on the number of meetings that took place with the Russian embassy and walked out of the committee’s evidence session to avoid scrutiny of the content of the discussions with the Russian embassy.’ He added: ‘From the emails that we have seen, it is evident that Arron Banks had many meetings with Russian officials, including the Russian Ambassador, Alexander Yakovenko, between 2015 and 2017.‘The meetings involved discussions about business deals involving Alrosa, the Russian diamond monopoly, the purchase of gold mines, funded by Sberbank, the Russian-state bank, and the transferring of confidential documents to Russian officials. \u0027Mr Banks seemed to want to hide the extent of his contacts with Russia... Mr Wigmore is a self-confessed liar and, as a result, little significance can be attached to anything that he says. \u0027It is unclear whether Mr Banks profited from business deals arising from meetings arranged by Russian officials.‘We understand that the National Crime Agency is investigating these matters. We believe that they should be given full access to any relevant information that will aid their inquiry.’Last month in a committee room at the House of Commons before a cross party audience including former home secretary Amber Rudd and Stephen Kinnock MP, the Atlantic Council think-tank launched a report titled ‘Democracy in the Crosshairs: How Political Money Laundering Threatened the Democratic Process’.Arron Banks figured heavily in the paper which stated: ‘When weaponised by hostile states with billions of dollars in offshore centres and large, efficient intelligence services, money laundering poses a grave threat to democratic integrity.‘This includes: the use of opaque offshore centres to obscure funds’ origins, the use of fabricated business transactions to transfer funds or covertly enrich iniduals and... the co-opting of “straw men” who count as permissible donors.Neil Barnett, one of the report’s authors, said last night: ‘The NCA’s initiation of a criminal investigation into Arron Banks and his various companies and groups is long overdue. ‘It has been apparent since 2016 that Banks has nowhere near the necessary wealth to donate about £8million. When invited to explain the origin of the funds he has offered various conflicting stories, before settling on “my bank account”. \u0027The law forbids donations from impermissible donors, and only an investigation with legal powers can uncover the truth. Everyone who values democratic integrity should be pleased today.’During his ill-judged select committee appearance, Banks declared: ‘I like to think I’m an evil genius with a white cat that controls the whole of western democracy but clearly that’s nonsense.’ Typical Banks. But the new allegations won’t be so easily dismissed. This week against a background of heightened tension with the Kremlin, the largest Nato exercise since the Cold War has been taking place in Norway.The frontline of the new hostilities is no longer the preserve of soldiers and tanks, however. Eight million pounds is a small price to pay for a military superpower for the break-up of the EU, a rival alliance. The question is, who’s paying? Arron Banks insists it is him alone.    "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/01/21/51E2AB7800000578-0-image-m-4_1541107947841.jpg","title":"Prince Charles flunkeys iron SHOELACES squeeze toothpaste brush","story":"    The Prince of Wales pictured at a state dinner reception on day two of his tour of west Africa.

Eliot, Dylan Thomas and W.H. AudenRegarded as one of the greatest and most innovative poets in the English language, Gerard Manley Hopkins\u0027s revolutionary work had an influence on T.S. Eliot, Dylan Thomas and W.H. Auden — despite being completely unknown to the wider public in his lifetime.Now a priceless archive of his work and hand-written notes and letters has been saved for the nation. Kept by his friend, the then much more celebrated poet Robert Bridges, one document in the trove suggests he did not rate Hopkins\u0027s work as first class at the time.The collection also includes Hopkins\u0027s so-called \u0027A\u0027 manuscript of 74 of his poems, many of them written in Hopkins\u0027s own hand. Tragically, he died young — of typhoid, in Dublin, aged just 44 in 1889 — whereas his friend Bridges lived on well into the 20th century, becoming Poet Laureate.The literary gold mine has been acquired by the nation through the Acceptance in Lieu Scheme (AIL), which allows people to hand over artworks to cover inheritance tax. This also frequently prevents such items from being sold and ending up abroad or in private hands.Michael Ellis, a minister for Arts, Heritage and Tourism said: \u0027As one of a distinguished group of British poets, we are fortunate to acquire this rich archive of Robert Bridges for the benefit of the nation.

The archive was previously well catalogued by Bridges\u0027s son, Edward, and the Bodleian Library, where some of the collection has been cared for since 1969.Silver cigarette case given to Oscar Wilde by his male lover...Lest we forget: Royal British Legion unveils 20ft-high poppy...Share this articleRichard Ovenden, on behalf of the Bodleian, said: \u0027We are hugely grateful to the Bridges family and to the AIL scheme for entrusting this outstanding material to the Bodleian.\u0027Hopkins\u0027s most famous poems, such as The Windhover, demonstrate what he called \u0027inscape\u0027, which is the uniqueness of every physical thing.The archive also contains all Bridges\u0027s major manuscripts. It was acquired from the executors of Bridges\u0027s grandson, Thomas Edward Bridges, 2nd Baron Bridges. A retired diplomat, from Shaftesbury, Dorset, he died aged 89 in May 2017.   By A.N Wilson          The collection includes Hopkins\u0027s so-called \u0027A\u0027 manuscript of 74 of his poems, many of them written in Hopkins\u0027s own handHas any poet in the English language ever so exuberantly celebrated the beauty of Nature in all its variety as Gerard Manley Hopkins?\u0027Glory be to God for dappled things,\u0027 he cries in one poem, marvelling at the multi-coloured palette of the natural world. \u0027Look at the stars! Look, look up at the skies!\u0027 he instructs us in another, echoing an impulse none of us can resist when out on a clear night.Hopkins was always looking, always observant. No one who has read his poem The Windhover will ever forget its evocation of a bird of prey in flight, hovering over the landscape just as all of us have seen. It is one of the most amazing word pictures in any language.Hopkins was, moreover, perhaps the most English of our poets. He wrote in one of his letters: \u0027If the English race had done nothing else, yet if they left the world the notion of a gentleman, they would have done a great service to mankind.\u0027He is one of the finest writers this country has ever produced, a creative force who ranks alongside his predecessors in the 19th century, Wordsworth, Shelley and Keats.Yet the paradox is he was completely unknown in his lifetime. Indeed, he would never have been known at all, had not one of his friends — a figure totally forgotten to us now, though famous in his own lifetime — chosen to publish these wonderful poems after Hopkins\u0027s tragically early death.And this friend, Robert Bridges, did not even value Hopkins\u0027s poetry very highly himself!It is Hopkins\u0027s brilliance — along with his intense relationship with Bridges — that makes today\u0027s announcement about the archive of Bridges\u0027 letters and papers being left to the country so exciting.                             He is one of the finest writers this country has ever produced, a creative force                        Hopkins today is so important that his poems are taught to every student of English literature and find their way into all the anthologies.Yet in his lifetime he was simply a priest whose poetry had never been printed or published.In contrast, Bridges was one of the few poets to be made a peer. He was awarded the Order of Merit. His collected poems sold in their tens of thousands and when Bridges died, in 1930, he was the Poet Laureate.Today he is out of print and more or less unheard-of. Has the history of literature ever known such a reversal in fortunes as the story of these two friends?The Bridges archive has been left in the care of the Bodleian Library in Oxford, and is full of documents that give us an unvarnished insight into Hopkins\u0027s life.

Once, only The Importance of Being Earnest was regularly performed, but now his other three comedies are frequently staged. In university English departments, his writing is solemnly analysed for its prescient sexual dissidence. The Picture of Dorian Gray, in its own day regarded by some as poisonous (WH Smith refused to stock it), is an A-level set text. Rupert Everett’s recent incarnation of him in the biopic The Happy Prince, which he also wrote and directed, is yet another confirmation of his status. At the opening of his compendious new biography of Wilde, Matthew Sturgis, dazzled by his author’s continuing celebrity, declares: “Among British writers he stands with Shakespeare and Jane Austen.”Not exactly. Wilde’s literary status is complicated, and is entangled with the story of his life. His trial and imprisonment for “gross indecency” in 1895 have made him a secular martyr, publicly humiliated and savagely punished for the sin of his homosexuality. (He died, destitute in Paris, aged 46.) His life is part of his work. Thus it was in his own day, when his conversation at society gatherings was a kind of performance art. So it is impossible to think about Wilde’s work without biography, and there is room for a new one. Richard Ellmann, author of magisterial lives of WB Yeats and James Joyce, died before he could revise thoroughly his life of Wilde, published in 1987. Though better written than competing works, it is necessarily unsatisfactory. Sturgis’s account is fuller and in some ways more reliable.Wilde fans will have to be patient through the long chapters about his privileged Irish upbringing and academic prowess. His father was a liberal-minded Dublin surgeon his literary mother presided over “conversaziones” where clever talk was all. At Trinity College Dublin he excelled at Greek before moving to Magdalen College, Oxford, where his academic success continued and he won the Newdigate prize for poetry. Sturgis is readier than most to admire his poetry. At Oxford, Wilde attended Ruskin’s lectures and rapidly learned to revere early Italian Renaissance art, inspiration to the pre-Raphaelites. Soon, instructed by Ruskin, he was off to tour Italy.His next inspiration was Walter Pater, aesthete supreme. Aestheticism became his creed. What is remarkable is how, after leaving Oxford for London, Wilde managed to make himself known for his professions of this creed, for his flamboyance and for his brilliance at parties. And for his extraordinary clothes. When, in 1881, he was mocked in the new Gilbert and Sullivan opera Patience through the character of Bunthorne, he knew he was going places. Its producer, Richard D’Oyly Carte, duly offered him a contract to lecture in the US.Lecturing gave him a way of turning personality into income. He crisscrossed America for almost a year, speaking on the English Renaissance and decorative arts, bringing his high camp performance to the most unlikely venues in the mid-west and Rockies. On tour, he indulged new sartorial fancies: tight-fitting velvet coats with “large flowered sleeves and little ruffs of cambric coming up from under the collar” black velvet evening suits with lace. On a later lecture tour of Britain he caused a stir with a pleated red-bronze coat fashioned “to suggest the form of a violincello”.Soon after his return from the US he became engaged to Constance Lloyd, daughter of an Irish barrister. During the early years of their marriage, her modest inheritance kept him afloat. Soon, the couple had two sons. (Sturgis follows others in believing that, at this stage, all Wilde’s sexual experiences were heterosexual.) Constance’s thoughts and feelings remain a mystery in this book. Sturgis is confident that, even later when she was to meet some of the young men with whom her husband was having sex, Constance remained “entirely ignorant about Oscar’s homosexual relations”. Readers will wonder about this, but in vain. Here, her character is simply absent.The success of Lady Windermere’s Fan made Wilde financially buoyant. He sealed a relationship with Lord Alfred Douglas, an Oxford undergraduate he knew slightly, by paying off blackmailers on his behalf. (It remains unclear exactly what they were blackmailing him about.) Soon the relationship was consummated and Douglas (“Bosie”) was introducing Wilde to a thrilling London demi-monde of candidly promiscuous and readily available young men. Sturgis emphasises the delirious recklessness of this new life.Before long, Douglas’s father, the Marquess of Queensberry, was harrying Wilde, turning up at restaurants and theatres to demand that he end his relationship with his son. Shortly after The Importance of Being Earnest was first staged in February 1895, Wilde found a scrawled note delivered to his club accusing him of being a “Somdomite” (sic). He decided to take legal action, thinking this would rid him of Queensberry’s persecution (Douglas seems to have hoped that his irritating father might get sent to a lunatic asylum). Foolishly, Wilde imagined that the accusations against him would be founded on the supposed immorality of some of his writing. It was a shock to discover that private investigators had compiled a long list of Wilde’s liaisons, along with evidence from servants and rent boys.Sturgis’s account of the hearing at the Old Bailey is as gripping as it is grim, with Wilde entertainingly witty when interrogated on his writings, but increasingly rattled when pressed on his relationship with a teenage servant. With testimonies looming from male prostitutes, he took his counsel’s advice to drop the case. Queensberry’s vengefulness was not to be deflected. Soon, his solicitor was demanding a prosecution. Constance urged her husband to flee abroad, but Sturgis believes he was too stunned to take the escape route that most in the establishment would have preferred. He was arrested and, the next day, committal proceedings began against him and Alfred Taylor, in whose rented rooms many of his sexual encounters had taken place.The last phases of Wilde’s life story are still painful to read: his conviction and sentencing to two years’ imprisonment with hard labour the collapse of his health in Reading prison the composition of De Profundis, his self-condemnatory “letter” to Bosie. He never saw his sons again: Constance took them to live with her brother in Switzerland, changing her and their name to Holland. Ailing from a spine injury after a fall, she died in 1898. On his release, Wilde travelled to Dieppe and later to Italy, where he was reunited with Douglas. He ended up in Paris, supported by Robert Ross, who had been his first male lover, and who emerges as the only hero of the story.• Oscar: A Life is published by Head of Zeus.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:Halloween approaches and tiojo has been doing some appropriate reading:I’ve just put down Andrew Michael Hurley’s second novel based in the countryside of the Bowland Fells and the Fylde, Devil’s Day. It follows on well from his first, The Loney. The countryside, which I know well enough, inspires him. But he sees things in it not many of us would. What to us are rolling moors, green valleys, sparkling streams, picturesque farmsteads, signify something else to Mr Hurley. He sees another world. Spiritual, demonic, folkloric, who knows. An unsettling mixture of real and imagined geography gives us the horror version of Le Grande Meaulnes. His novels are psychogeography in action. The moors will look different next time I walk across them.On the same theme, Veufveuve has enjoyed Mary Shelley’s Transformation:A slim collection of short stories (comprising the title story, The Mortal Immortal, and The Evil Eye). All three stories are in some way supernatural or uncanny and the writing, though obviously touched by the gothic and thus sometimes a little overblown, is often very good – she knew what she was doing. All three stories, like Frankenstein, explore what it means to be human and how we might live. For me, by the far the most effective was The Mortal Immortal (I probably don’t need to explain the subject matter), bringing home its great existential crisis very powerfully.A different kind of monster has entertained Kevin Dawson in Craig Brown’s Ma’am Darling: 99 Glimpses of Princess Margaret:That rare thing, a genuinely unputdownablelaugh out loud book. Difficult to tell who was the less appealing, Princess Margaret herself or the people who (as Brown notes) happily accepted invites to events at which she would be present, knowing how awful it (and she) would be. They attended seemingly only so they could then skip off home to describe how awful the event was. Increased my respect for George Harrison, though (who, on being told he couldn’t eat before she left a “do” simply went up to her and asked her to leave).This Thing of Darkness by Harry Thompson has impressed 17Luftballons:It’s about the captain of the Beagle and Darwin. Echoes of Patrick O’Brian’s naval novels but it’s the detail and description that really bring it to life, so vivid and well-described I almost feel like I’m watching a film, or that I’ve visited all these places I’ve never seen. The characters are fascinatingly nuanced and human. And their debates over theology versus their scientific discoveries are really bringing home to me the significance and impact of evolutionary theory at the time. Nice and long, too - I don’t want it to end any time soon!A forensic and very readable analysis of The Iliad and the different strands that informed its creation. Utterly fascinating and totally recommended for armchair Homer fans and general readers alike.Here’s a teaser from casaleiro:About 10 days ago the  carried an interview with a Spanish writer who recommended A High Wind in Jamaica by Richard Hughes. Never heard of it! So down the town I went and found a copy in a charity shop. It was a fabulous discovery, and I am currently following it by re-reading William Golding’s Lord of the Flies. What the two have in common is their view of childhood as a wild and potentially violent state of being. I guess most readers are familiar with Golding. Concerning the older novel by Hughes (1929), I will say nothing, I simply urge people to read it, preferably without knowing anything about it beforehand.I’m intrigued. Talking of suspense, franhunny has been reading Agatha Christie’s Mrs McGinty’s Dead:While I usually loathe Poirot because of his smugness, it was not as bad as in other Poirot novels so I could live with it as a quirk.Which made the book quite enjoyable. Oh, I knew the murderer after the second murder, but I did not know why yet and how the two murders were connected.A classic whodunnit, with the classic “all suspects into the same room” finale where Mr Poirot explains his thoughts.A few hours well spent.(I’m glad it felt like a good investment of time, because we’re going to be looking at Agatha Christie on the reading group next month.)Finally, Tropic of Capricorn by Henry Miller has done the trick for judgeDAmNationIII:I’m about halfway through rereading and my God is it the tonic I need at the moment. I remember being relatively unimpressed with it the first time around (at least compared to the Rosy Crucifixion trilogy and Black Spring, which I read first), and although there are parts that go on a bit, the rest of it just feels like it’s screaming directly into my soul.That sounds pretty good to me.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Fuel poverty campaigners said the figures were a reminder of the “huge anxiety” many people faced this winter, worrying whether they could afford to turn the heating on.Households are usually expected to be in credit by this time of year, ahead of the higher electricity and gas consumption to come in the colder months. But research by the consumer website uSwitch found a 10th of them, 2.93 million, were in debt to their supplier, up from 2.62 million in October 2017. They owed an average of £134 each.Consumers have been hit by two years of price hikes as wholesale costs have gone up, with some of the big six suppliers putting up tariffs twice this year.Rik Smith, an energy expert at uSwitch, said: “With winter just around the corner, it’s important that households use this time to tackle rising bills. After so many price rises this year a lot of people may have received a price rise notification over the summer but not switched to a cheaper deal.”Fuel poverty groups said the government, regulators and the industry must do more to help the poorest this winter.“Millions of people are approaching this winter with dread and will face unmanageable situations. Those who are repaying large or growing energy debts often don’t turn the heating on at all, despite knowing it could badly damage their or their families’ health,” said Peter Smith, the director of policy and research at National Energy Action.About half of those in arrears said they would either pay it off in a lump sum or by increasing their direct debit payments. The rest either hoped the debt would “go down naturally over time”, or planned to agree a repayment plan with their supplier or fit a prepayment meter, or did not know.uSwitch arrived at the figures by extrapolating the results of an Opinium poll of 2,000 adults to the UK’s 27 million households. Official forecasts expect fuel poverty to worsen this year because of tariffs going up.The industry body Energy UK said: “If customers are struggling, the most important thing is to get in touch with their energy supplier as soon as possible so they can provide help and support.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a02903fbb68e166dd02bab69cd8de31cb0847852/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fa087df30f2a6ca80029aa520e9cf51","title":"democracy loser us midterms poor ethnic minorities","story":"When Angelina Cruz, the head of the teachers’ union in Racine, Wisconsin, goes canvassing, she doesn’t just knock on doors. If she sees someone in the street she approaches them and starts a conversation.“D’you know you can vote today,” she asked a young black man who walked by last Saturday.“I can’t,” he said. “I’m a felon.” (A felon is someone who has committed a “serious crime”.)“On papers or off papers,” she asked. (In Wisconsin your voting rights are only restored after prison, parole and probation have all been served, and you are “off papers”.)“On papers,” he said.“Well, ask your friends to vote,” said Cruz.“Most of them are on papers too,” he yelled back.On Tuesday there will be elections in the US for the entire lower chamber (the House of Representatives), a third of the upper chamber (the Senate) and several governors and state legislatures. The results will be consequential. But the process will not be democratic. Millions of people will be excluded, potentially hundreds of thousands of votes suppressed and many voting districts brazenly configured to favour one party or the other not all citizens are eligible, not all those who are eligible are permitted to vote, and not all votes will carry the same weight.When it comes to felons, Wisconsin is far from the worst offender. One in 10 voters in Florida has been disenfranchised because they are a felon, and it is one of 10 states where felons may lose the right to vote permanently.But on other fronts Wisconsin illustrates the point all too well. Gerrymandering, where politicians draw electoral boundaries to favour their own side, is openly employed here, effectively allowing them to choose the voters they need to keep them in power. The result is a series of preordained outcomes that make seats less competitive, candidates less responsive, politicians more extreme (since to keep their seat they only have to keep their base happy) and the entire process less credible.But while the fraud is illusory the disproportionate number of disenfranchised black and poor voters is not. In Georgia 53,000 voter applications, most from African Americans, are currently being held up by the secretary of state, Brian Kemp, some for such petty reasons as a missing hyphen. Kemp is running for governor in a tight race against a black opponent. In a recently leaked video recording he expresses concern at his chances, “especially if everybody uses and exercises their right to vote”. Nicala Aiello, a poll worker in Racine, says she saw about 11 people turned away from the polling station she works at in 2016, the first election in which a new, more stringent voter-ID law was in place.The voter ID requirements often demand money some people don’t have and are more onerous for the young and the poor who move a lot or may not have a driving licence. Last month the supreme court upheld a North Dakota law that demanded ID with a “current residential street address”. This is burdensome for Native Americans living on reservations who use post-office boxes to get their mail, and where street names and numbers are either nonexistent or inconsistent.And as the electorate continues to get more erse these efforts to stop some people voting will only get more perverse.The stakes are high. Four of the states with the highest proportion of felons removed from the voter rolls – Florida, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona – all have very close state-wide races this year. The current North Dakota senator is in a tight race that she won by just 3,000 votes in 2012.Meanwhile, Aiello believes if what she saw in Racine were replicated across Wisconson, it could have significantly affected the result there. Neil Albrecht, the most senior election official in Milwaukee, the state’s largest city, agrees. “It is very probable enough people were prevented from voting to have changed the outcome of the presidential election in Wisconsin,” he told the Mother Jones website last year.Gerrymandering and voter suppression could be reversed quite straightforwardly. But some of this unfairness is baked into the polity. In the Senate each state has two seats even though California has 68 times the population of Wyoming, they each get the same representation in the upper house. Moreover the presidency does not go to whoever wins the most votes, but whoever wins in the “electoral college” – a body also weighted towards less populous states.As a result Republicans have only won the popular vote for the presidency once since 1988. In a more consensual political culture this would matter less. But when politics is so polarised, the fact that a president who was not favoured by most Americans is ramming through a deeply isive agenda helps explains why so much opposition has spilled out on to the streets. No country’s electoral system is perfect. But America’s political class has wilfully decided to make the inherent flaws in its system worse, while adding new ones.The broken politics that have resulted are not just the product of a profound ideological fissure but a profoundly unfair and broken process that is particularly rigged against those who are poor and dark. Whoever wins on Tuesday, democracy will have already lost."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30dc46f7c9b1e9c0bfe28c150b4358c0495b4e7b/0_0_941_572/master/941.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d98da7066f5a98dbd1bad2d3522f892a","title":"what to watch read and hear and who to follow on instagram before heading to canada","story":"Gearing up for a trip to Canada?

The brave can recreate Jack and Ennis’s nude clifftop leap into icy water at Sheep River Falls (where the scene was shot), while cowboy-connoisseurs should visit during Calgary Stampede’s boot-stompin’ mania. Leonardo Di Caprio’s The Revenant, sci-fi thriller Inception and Sky’s Tim Roth-starring police drama Tin Star all shot scenes in the region too.Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Edgar Wright, 2010Wright’s comic-strip caper follows a kidult gamer living out superhero fantasies by fighting his cerise-haired sweetheart’s exes around Toronto.VisitStroll around Toronto for long enough and you’ll stumble across a Scott Pilgrim location, whether it’s Casa Loma (Toronto’s only castle), graffiti-splatted e Sneaky Dee’s or one of the copious Second Cup coffee-shops.Maudie, Aisling Walsh, 2016The tragic life of outsider artist Maud Lewis was unflinchingly portrayed by Sally Hawkins in this heartrending biopic, in which Maudie grapples with painful disability (rheumatoid arthritis), family ostracism and an abusive relationship with fish-pedlar husband Everett (Ethan Hawke).VisitLewis created her folksy paintings in the tiny one-room clapboard-house she shared with her husband in Nova Scotia. A replica of this shack can be found in fishing village Digby (famed for its scallops), close to the rugged lighthouse-and-spruce-fir-forested Bay of Fundy coastline that inspired her work.Juno, Jason Reitman, 2007This classic teen flick stars Ellen Page as Juno, a whip-smart tomboy who suddenly finds herself pregnant. The coming-of-age film follows Juno as she comes to terms with her decision to place the child with adoptive parents, while continuing to deal with school, her relationship with her own mother, and her friendship with the unborn baby’s father, Paulie Bleeker, played by Michael Cera.VisitJuno was filmed in “Hollywood North”, AKA Vancouver (just like in Reitman’s movie, you’ll find plaid shirts aplenty here). Twilight, The X-Files, Deadpool and, yes, 50 Shades were all shot here too. Fans of Vancouver has a walking tour taking in key celluloid sights.I Confess, Alfred Hitchcock, 1953This thriller about a priest (Montgomery Clift) accused of murder – who cannot prove his innocence unless he betrays what he’s been told in a confession – teems with Hitchcockian suspense and film-noir flourishes, ably assisted by Quebec City’s cobblestone streets and church spires.VisitThe dramatic turrets of Château Frontenac – the world’s most photographed hotel – that dominate many I Confess scenes tower over Quebec City.

Here’s where to catch the best events – and get in on the actionMarathon running: Fogo Island Race Weekend – Fogo Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, 15 September 2018Fogo Island — Newfoundland’s largest offshore island — is one of the most unusual marathon locations on the planet. The race weekend features a 10km runwalk, a half marathon, and a full marathon that takes participants through Fogo’s beautiful, untamed wilderness. If you’re not running yourself, you can cheer on the returning marathoners in the picturesque village of Tilting, or go for a scenic hike through the island’s 200km of paths and trails. It’s worth the ferry ride alone to stay and dine at the architecturally stunning Fogo Island Inn. Fun fact: members of the Flat Earth Society consider the island one of the four corners of the planet.Canadian Football: 106th Grey Cup – Edmonton, Alberta, 25 November 2018The biggest night of the Canadian Football season will take place this year in Edmonton, Alberta, with the 106th Grey Cup game. A five-day, fan-friendly festival precedes the big game, a Canadian tradition dating back to 1909. This Grey Cup game is outdoors, so if you can snag a ticket, be sure to bundle up ... and don’t forget your face-paint. Canadian football, with its unique quirks, is particularly popular in Western Canada where fans never sit on their hands, no matter how cold it gets. For your own taste of three-down fun, The Edmonton Sports and Social Club has an indoor Flag Football League that begins on 23 September and runs for five weeks. Perfect for all beginners, flag football is a great non-contact introduction to Canadian Football and friendly Edmontonians.World Junior Hockey Championships – Vancouver, British Columbia, 26 December 2018-5 January 2019The World Junior Hockey Tournament has become a favourite year-end tradition in Canada, as the best young hockey players on the planet take part in a two-week tournament that culminates in a must-watch gold medal game. This year, Vancouver, BC, plays host at Rogers Arena, where traditional rivals Team Canada and Team USA remain the heavy favourites, with the young Swedes of Tre Kronor a close third. If that inspires you to lace up your own skates, check out the Robson Square Ice Rink, a beautifully lit, domed outdoor rink in the heart of Vancouver. An evening skate is popular with locals, and many of Van City’s best nocturnal snack options, including some top-notch food trucks, are close by. Skates can be hired for as little as Can$4 (£2.40).Curling: the Tim Hortons Brier – Brandon, Manitoba, 2-10 March 2019You can cut the tension with a broom at the Tim Hortons Brier where the country’s best male curlers have competed to represent Canada at the World Curling Championships since 1927. This year’s tournament takes place in friendly Brandon, Manitoba. The 2006 Olympic gold medallist Brad Gushue of Newfoundland and Labrador was skipper of last year’s championship team and the eventual winner of the World Curling title. If you want to take a crack at some rock-hurling yourself, head down the highway to the historic Granite Curling Club in Winnipeg. Known as the “St Andrews of curling” for its contribution to the sport in Canada, this historic club has produced its fair share of Canadian curling royalty, including Victor Alvin “Vic” Peters.Snowboarding and freestyle skiing: Jamboree 2019 – Quebec City, Quebec, March 2019The 2019 International Ski Federation Snowboard and Freestyle Ski World Cups will be awarded at Jamboree, Quebec City’s annual extreme winter sports festival. Big Air, Slope Style and Half-Pipe are just a few of the categories up for grabs by competitors from across the globe. Not surprisingly, there’s no shortage of outdoor concerts and parties, which are also held at nearby Stoneham, Quebec. For your own snowboarding adventures, either stay put at Stoneham, which has 135 hectares (333 acres) of skiable terrain, or drive to nearby Mont-Sainte-Anne. Ideal for black diamond experts and beginners alike, Mont-Sainte-Anne features 71 trails covering 44 miles (71km) on three different sides of the mountain.RBC Canadian Open – Ancaster, Ontario, 3-9 June 2019The Canadian Open is the premier Professional Golfers’ Association tour event in Canada, and is one of the oldest golf tournaments in North America (it dates back to 1904). The 2019 Open will be played at the historic Hamilton Golf and Country Club, in Ancaster, Ontario. Thanks to recent changes to the PGA calendar, the Canadian Open has been moved to early June, a change that is likely to attract more top-ranked golfers, some of whom had previously been unable to come north due to scheduling. If all that polite clapping at the Open has you itching to hit the links yourself, you’ll want to head north to the Muskoka Bay Club. Ranked as one of the best in Ontario, this Doug Carrick-designed course incorporates the rugged beauty of the region into the course layout and provides a distinctly Canadian golfing experience.Global Relay Canadian Road Championships – Victoria, British Columbia, June 2019Victoria, BC, will once again host the Global Relay Canadian Road Championships in June 2019. The race, which features top cyclists from across Canada, takes competitors through Canada’s “Garden City” and into nearby Metchosin, on the southern tip of Vancouver Island. For a cycling experience that’s completely different, head north to the Yukon – the land of the midnight sun. Whitehorse’s 24 Hours of Light Festival, also held in June, is the only 24-hour mountain biking race in the world where lights are illegal riders rely on natural illumination instead. Located in the heart of the Grey Mountain trail network, this exciting course is approximately 12.5km long with 277m of elevation. In keeping with the laid-back nature of Canada’s North, the event is only as competitive as you want it to be.Gold Cup and Saucer Race – Charlottetown, PEI, August 2019Old Home Week – an annual celebration of all things agricultural and more related to Canada’s tiniest province – includes the largest street parade east of Montreal, and a one-of-a-kind harness-racing competition. This late-night horse race – where the horses don’t gallop, but move at a trot, and pull a two-wheeled cart called a sulky – begins with the playing of the Island Hymn, followed by the Call to Post at exactly two minutes to midnight. And then, they’re off! If you’re not too exhausted from the previous night’s equestrian fun, there are a number of unique horseback riding opportunities for visitors along PEI’s red beaches and throughout its bucolic countryside. Try Brudenell Riding Stables, located 40 minutes outside Charlottetown on the island’s east coast.Helly Hansen Chester Race Week – Chester, Nova Scotia, August 2019The largest race of its kind in North America, The Helly Hansen Chester Race Week is an exciting, four-day, keelboat regatta that was first officially documented in 1856. Every August, more than 1,200 sailors set off from scenic Mahone Bay to compete in one of 15 fleets racing simultaneously on five different racecourses along the picturesque South Shore of Nova Scotia. Spectators can watch the races from the docks or inside the historic Chester Yacht Club. Once the boats are tied up, the party begins, with live music at the yacht club. For your own Nova Scotia sailing adventure, contact Star Charters in the nearby (and equally quaint) town of Lunenberg. Taking in a Nova Scotia sunset on the Eastern Star, their 48-foot tall ship, is an experience not to be forgotten.2019 Canadian Sprint Canoe Kayak Championships – Regina, Saskatchewan, 27 August-1 September 2019Located in the heart of the sunny Saskatchewan capital, Lake Wascana will welcome thousands to the 2019 Canadian Sprint Canoe Kayak Championships. Competitors of all ages, including Olympic and Paralympic athletes, will compete for national titles across a variety of distances over five days. After a week of paddle-sport mania, it’s time to head north to Lac La Ronge, located in the boreal forest of central Saskatchewan, for some much needed tranquillity. Paddlers can explore one of more than 50 spectacular routes by canoe or kayak in this world-renowned wilderness, part of the Churchill River system."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2115111a1601e6d85ed650cb2e96fa1a16abf8d1/0_188_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a547514562b2889589e376fa20cfad81","title":"gdt european wildlife photographer of the year 2018 in pictures","story":"A hunting wolverine, rainbow lake and delicate ice trees are among the winning images selected by the Society of German Nature Photographers.

As she brings her star appeal to a retelling of The Nutcracker, we look at her roles, from kick-ass assassins through downtrodden wives to Queen Elizabeth herself A frankly horrific film, a bizarre sentimental fantasy which – sad to say – brings out the very worst of Mirren’s haughtyimperious mannerisms. She plays one of the actors hired by the associates of a bereaved and grief-crazed businessman (Will Smith) to interrogate him in the persona of “Death”. Yikes.Mirren plays the lovable lush’s nanny – a truly terrible role, in this truly terrible remake of the Dudley Moore comedy. In the original, the lovable lush had a butler played by John Gielgud now he has a nanny, played by Mirren.Mirren goes into self-parody mode as the Austrian Jewish woman battling to recover her family’s artworks, stolen by the Nazis.Mirren has a walk-on in this cult Italian pulp thriller.Oh dear. Mirren plays sexy singing policewoman Alice Rage, the swansong for a visibly ill Peter Sellers, reprising his regrettable “yellowface” turn as evil Chinese genius Fu Manchu.A very silly performance from Mirren in an unscary movie, playing Sarah Winchester, the tormented widow of the inventor of the rifle.A laboured satire on privatised medicine, with Mirren as the head nurse, Stella, and James Spader as a doctor troubled by qualms of conscience about coma patients kept alive to keep the insurance payments rolling in.Mirren has the hauteur on autopilot as the Michelin-starred restaurant boss facing off with Om Puri’s Indian establishment.Hal Hartley’s bland and whimsical film about a supposed “monster” living in Iceland features a forgettable Mirren as a hardbitten TV news executive.Kevin Williamson’s high school satire has Mirren as the hated meanie teacher, Mrs Tingle, who is kidnapped by her pupils. A misfire, although Mirren does her best.A worthy and slightly lifeless adaptation of the Michael Morpurgo children’s novel. Mirren and David Threlfall play the parents of the boy who grows up to be the lonely “Birdman”.Mirren plays the “Gertrude” role in this screen adaptation of the Amleth legend from Saxo Grammaticus’s history of Denmark, which inspired Shakespeare’s Hamlet. Not altogether successful, but a serious role.A huge role for Harrison Ford, playing the obsessive back-to-nature idealist who moves his family to the Central American jungle – but terrible for Mirren, stuck playing his uncomplaining wife.Mirren is on mythic form as Mother Ginger in this tale from ETA Hoffmann.This wacky sub-Dan-Brown conspiracy action adventure has Helen Mirren playing Nicolas Cage’s mum. She phones it in, a bit.Another sentimental heartwarmer. Mirren is the wife of Donald Sutherland’s dementia-struck retiree, on their final journey in their Winnebago.Mirren turns in a respectable impersonation of screechy, reactionary Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper in this McCarthy-era tale.A rather reverential biopic about Alfred Hitchcock, with Mirren going through the motions as his wife Alma Reville.Mirren has little to do, or to emote as cosmonaut Tanya Kirbuk – in charge of the Russian spaceship in a US-Soviet joint mission to Jupiter – in this sequel to Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.Directed by Michael Powell, set in Australia, this was Mirren’s big breakthrough. She played the sexy model-muse of James Mason’s artist, carrying off nudity with cheerful insouciance.A gentle British comedy in which Mirren plays a wacky horticultural expert working with inmates of a local prison. It was bizarrely seared into the memories of UK critics when the London press screening, held at the 20th Century Fox building on 11 September 2001, had its final credits interrupted by the projectionist, who flashed up the live TV feed of the burning World Trade Center on the big screen to reviewers’ astonishment.A worthy real-life drama about a Canadian surgeon and communist (Donald Sutherland) who volunteered as a medic in Mao’s army in China. Mirren, yet again, is stuck playing the wife.Schmaltzy heartwarmer in which party-animal Kate Hudson has to raise her late sister’s kids. An undemanding role for Mirren, who plays her demanding boss.Paul Abbott’s TV conspiracy thriller was transferred to the big screen, and to the US, and the part of the newspaper editor, Bill Nighy in Abbott’s original TV conspiracy thriller, is taken on by Mirren for the US big screen. She gives it the same sort of toughness as her classic TV character, police detective Jane Tennison.This based-on-a-true-story movie is low-octane straight-to-video stuff. Mirren is the raunchy-glam wife of Joe Pesci’s Nevada brothel owner, who has an affair with a younger man.A great Mirren cameo as a splendidly dyspeptic great-aunt in this children’s fantasy-adventure.For Mirren fans, notable as the film where she met her future husband, Taylor Hackford. It is another of her “Russian” roles (born Helen Mironoff, she is in fact the granddaughter of an exiled Russian diplomat). Here she plays a Soviet bureaucrat and former lover of a Russian dancer, played by Mikhail Baryshnikov, who is trying to defect.Mirren brings her signature hauteur to the role of a retired Mossad agent and Nazi hunter.A reasonable attempt at updating the Graham Greene classic to 1960s mods v rockers. Mirren is good as the blowsy but good-natured teashop manager who makes it her business to bring Pinkie to justice.A gentle heartwarmer with Mirren as a teacher at a Scottish Catholic school. She is a little upstaged by her wryly unbelieving colleague (Tom Conti), who is in love with her, as well as apparently the vessel for actual miracles.Nice turn from Mirren in the lucrative action franchise playing Jason Statham’s mum.Interesting, possibly underrated straight-to-video release with Mirren as the wife of a kidnapped businessman played by Robert Redford.Whoa! A freaky classic from director Lee Daniels, with one of the great weird star pairings. Mirren plays Rose, a contract killer, living with her lover – who is also her stepson, played by Cuba Gooding Jr. A wacky Mirren outing.A better role for Mirren: it is a relief to see her not as an artist’s pouting muse, but an artist herself. She is Lydia, a painter on the Greek island of Simi in 1908, and the mysterious expatriate Pascali (Ben Kingsley) is yearningly in love with her.An EM Forster adaptation, and as subject to the chocolate-boxy picturesque approach as any others from this era. But it’s a decent assertive role for Mirren as a well-to-do widowed Englishwoman who falls in love in Italy, with tragicomic consequences.Mirren brings a forceful performance as Prospera – the feminised version of Prospero. Perhaps gender-bending Shakespeare is the way to give her the roles she deserves.A good Mirren, and an intriguing cousin to her earlier movie Cal. She plays the mother of a (fictionalised) IRA hunger striker in Troubles-era Northern Ireland, who befriends other mothers in the same situation.It’s so bad, it’s … well, bad. But Mirren is probably the only person to emerge with her reputation intact from this spectacular “art-porn” kitsch epic of ancient Rome. She is reunited with Malcolm McDowell (Caligula), playing his wife, Caesonia.Mirren plays Hermia in this theatrically conceived movie adaptation with RSC players.A slightly farcical film, but a meaty role for Mirren as Sofia, the long-suffering wife of Leo Tolstoy (Christopher Plummer).This classy, if theatrically hidebound film has Mirren in central-European mode, forcefully playing a cantankerous maid in 60s Hungary to Martina Gedeck’s aspiring novelist.Mirren plays the sinister wife of the no-less-creepy Christopher Walken. They befriend, with malign intentions, a hapless young couple (Rupert Everett and Natasha Richardson), on holiday in Venice. Mirren delivers enigmatic menace. Commissioned as a BBC TV drama, this comes from Mirren’s Prime Suspect era. She plays a depressed housewife who suspects that her boorish husband is a notorious serial killer. The film fizzles, but it’s a great turn from Mirren.A hyper-experimental, no-budget turn by the London-based Spanish director Celestino Coronado. A charismatic Mirren plays both Gertrude and a very cynical Ophelia. It is a shame that the movies could never entirely represent Mirren’s excellent classical theatre work.In Ken Russell’s biopic of Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, Mirren plays “Gosh” Boyle, a fictional character based on the artist’s lover. She has an uproarious scene in which she declaims artistic theories while walking down a staircase wearing just a necklace.An intelligent, gentle role for Mirren as Queen Charlotte, aghast at King George III’s crumbling sanity but prevented from intimate access to him by her scheming son, the future Regent.Jack Nicholson is Jerry, an obsessive cop on a mission to find a little girl’s killer, with an equally excellent cameo from Helen Mirren as the psychiatrist who is supposed to be helping him assess the culprit’s psychological makeup, but may actually be assessing Jerry’s own fitness for work.Mirren gives a tough, earnest performance in this underrated drama-thriller. She’s a hardbitten stripper in a scuzzy London nightclub, who falls in love with an American technician from the club.She’s back! Reprising her kick-ass assassin in Red, Mirren’s character is still game for a laugh and a killshot.A funny and much-liked turn from Mirren in this silver-years action comedy, in which she plays Victoria, an ex-MI5 assassin who is pretty tasty with a weapon.Mirren is well cast as the mysterious enchantress Morgana Le Fay from the Arthurian legend – entertainingly bizarre, vampy and campy opposite Nicol Williamson’s Merlin. Here, she met her future boyfriend, the young unknown Liam Neeson.This experimental feature by artist and film-maker Don Levy showcases Mirren in her first cinema role – an outrageous cameo of cartoon sexiness and sexism, which startled everyone who saw it. Her sketch is of a scantily clad woman advertising washing up gloves. The pure fun she gets from this performance is palpable.Mirren often plays the errant or subversive “wife”, but her role in this Peter Greenaway film – as the spouse of Michael Gambon’s boorish and aggressive criminal, her face a mask of detestation and ennui – is arguably its most stylised, operatically abstracted form.This country-house period mystery-drama, directed by Robert Altman and scripted by Julian Fellowes, spawned TV’s Downton Abbey. Mirren has a below-stairs role as head housekeeper Mrs Wilson, a woman with an awful secret and a proud sense of her own place in this stratified world. Mirren’s accent, so often unlocatable in terms of class, is not roughened up.In Lindsay Anderson’s film, Mirren plays the sexually voracious Patricia, who seduces Malcolm McDowell in the back of a van, then dumps him for a duke. There is such exuberant joy in Mirren’s early, predatory-sexy roles.This is a very male film – ageing, maudlin blokes in pubs exuding melancholy with the fug of cigarette smoke – but Mirren almost pinches the entire thing. David Hemmings, Bob Hoskins and Tom Courtenay play old mates on a journey with the ashes of their departed friend (Michael Caine). Mirren plays Caine’s widow beautifully, caring for their disabled daughter while the menfolk are down the pub.“We’re going to need considerably bigger buns!” This remark, now hardly less legendary than the line from Jaws that it is spoofing, comes from Mirren’s character, Chris, the glamorous friend of Julie Walters’s Annie, whose husband has just died of cancer. Annie, Chris and their WI mates do a naughty-but-nice nude calendar to raise money. Mirren’s deadpan drollery is very enjoyable.Mirren is a professional soldier in this excellent thriller. A careworn, khaki-clad colonel, she must make tough decisions about the deployment of a drone to kill terrorists. It is close, perhaps, to her classic TV character, police detective Jane Tennison as a procedural figure dealing with office politics and actual politics. A muscular, bold performance.Mirren is Victoria, girlfriend of Bob Hoskins’s insecure cockney mobster, who is trying to underpin his new property empire in Thatcher’s Britain. She is smoothly knowing where he is nervy, terrified where he is macho and protective – as intimate as any married couple. Classic early Mirren.One of Mirren’s most loved performances, an Oscar-winning turn that was her own coronation as a blue-chip national treasure. It is a creatively modified impersonation of the Queen at the time of Princess Diana’s death in 1997: taller, less posh, more rhetorically demonstrative and simply more actorly than the real thing – but inspired casting nonetheless.This tragedy of star-crossed and not-so-innocent lovers in Troubles-era Northern Ireland brings out Mirren’s acting identity – her sexuality, her nonconformism, her tendency to imperiousness – in the most effective balance. She plays Marcella, a Catholic married to a Protestant police officer murdered by the IRA John Lynch plays Cal, a younger Catholic man employed as a driver by the Republicans and implicated in the killing.

But the billion-dollar franchise redefined the role of women in movies“I don’t have the strength to stay away from you any more,” says Edward Cullen to Bella Swan in the first Twilight movie. “You’re like my own personal brand of heroin.”Thus began the unforeseen addiction of millions of human teenagers to the five-film vampire saga, which took $3.3bn (£2.56bn) worldwide, became a cultural phenomenon, and altered the future of female-led cinema for ever.Ten years ago this month, when Twilight premiered, no one was sure whether the success of Stephenie Meyer’s young adult novels would transfer to the screen. The saturnine lead actors – lip-biting human Kristen Stewart and neck-biting vampire Robert Pattinson – were almost unknown. Director Catherine Hardwicke had a 44-day shoot and a scrimp-and-see $37m budget compared with the going rate of $200m for such CGI-fantasy-action movies.At first glance, the story seemed ridiculous: Dracula for ditzes. Stroppy 17-year-old Bella arrives in the town of Forks in the Pacific Northwest to stay with her orced father. At school she meets the pale, distinguished, distant Edward, who is poleaxed by bloodlust for her. (There’s a hilarious scene in which Bella sniffs her own armpit in the school lab, because her science partner Edward seems so repelled. Of course, he’s just trying to control his vampiric hunger.) Edward keeps saving Bella with his supernatural powers and they fall in love, but he must hold back in case cuddles turn to canapés. Plus, their love match is opposed by local werewolves, vampires and parents. What can possibly go wrong?But the two young leads had almost nuclear chemistry, and young women identified with Bella’s determination to choose her own fate – as well as her realistic Seattle-grunge clothing choices. To his credit, this paper’s reviewer Peter Bradshaw ponied up four stars and asked the question: “Which of us, in our impressionable teenage years, has not displaced an irrational horror of sex into a freaky emo crush on a moody vampire with sky-high cheekbones and a taste for human blood?”On Twilight’s opening weekend in the United States, it turned out that the emo-crush was bordering on mass hysteria. The film made $69m by Sunday. The fans, known as Twi-hards, were on a roll. A five-film franchise was launched – Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse, Breaking Dawn I and II – and the rest is haemoglobin-soaked history.“The part that shocked Hollywood was that the film’s stunning success was fuelled by ‘girl power,’” says Melissa Silverstein of Women and Hollywood. “The general consensus in Hollywood is that films and books made for men and boys are seen as ‘universal’, and things that are made for women and girls are somehow seen as ‘other.’ Women are seen as a ‘niche’ audience. This ‘nichification’ of women has been one of the most enduring problems facing the much-maligned chick flick.”The sensation of Twilight in 2008 caused Hollywood studios to perk up and pay attention to a new ticket-buying demographic – young women (and, let’s be honest, their vampire-struck mums). For years, the superhero and adventure franchises had faithfully served the 12- to 25-year-old male audience, without taking the economic power of the handbag into account.The race to satiate the imaginations of teenage girls was on. In 2012, Jennifer Lawrence premiered in the first of four box-office-busting Hunger Games movies in 2014, Shailene Woodley appeared in the first of three dystopian Divergent films. Meanwhile, at the younger end of the market, Disney’s Brave in 2013 and Frozen that same year gave the traditional princess narrative a good kicking.But The Hunger Games and Divergent were all directed by men. It was not until Patty Jenkins took on Wonder Woman that a female-directed film outsold Twilight. Only now, after 20 male-directed blockbusters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, will the 21st, Captain Marvel, be directed by a woman. At the Comic Con preview in New York last month, which pre-Twilight was home only to fanboys and rare fangirls, Hardwicke spoke about her film’s long-term effect: “Twilight changed the perception, the idea that a movie about a girl wouldn’t be popular, wouldn’t make a lot of money. It blew it out of the water. A novel written by a woman, a movie directed by a female. We broke records. People can use that for ammo – when another female director goes to a meeting, they are gonna say, ‘Well, I don’t think you can do this,’ and they can respond with, ‘Well, Catherine did it, Twilight did it.’ You use it as a building block to the next thing and the next thing.”The studio, Summit Entertainment, then asked Chris Weitz to step in. He was director of The Golden Compass, a franchise that failed to take off. No matter. New Moon and the rest of the often-shoddy Twilight films were directed by men: David Slade and Bill Condon. Hardwicke went on to make Red Riding Hood and has just finished an English-language remake of Miss Bala.Hardwicke and her casting director also deserve credit for spotting the nascent star-power in Stewart and Pattinson, who have used their fame to greenlight many an art-house movie, regularly appearing on the red carpet at Cannes. Pattinson made Cosmopolis with David Cronenberg and Good Time with the Safdie brothers Stewart made Clouds of Sils Maria and Personal Shopper with Olivier Assayas.Stewart had previously played Jodie Foster’s daughter in Panic Room and appeared in Into the Wild, while Pattinson’s main credit was playing Cedric Diggory in the Harry Potter franchise. Hardwicke ran chemistry tests between Stewart and four potential co-stars. “It was like blind-date central,” she said. Then they clicked.At certain points, Pattinson and Stewart were lovers on screen and off, which perhaps added to the veracity. Certainly, young women were happy to wait through three-and-a-half films before the relationship was consummated in a bed-breaking honeymoon scene after a glitzy wedding in Breaking Dawn I. For many fans, the films were not about abstinence, but everlasting foreplay.Looked at through the lens of the #MeToo generation, there is something to be said for a boy who is not pressuring a teenage girl to have sex. (Although it’s worth remembering that although Edward looks 17, he is, in fact, 109 in vampire years. Let’s not go there.)But many feminists just said no to Twilight and claimed the vampire was merely a metaphor for the dangers of pre-marital sexual intercourse. Silverstein also points out that “women were angered by Edward’s overprotection and Bella’s acquiescence. Where is her independent streak with Edward that she displays so fervently with her father and friends? Let’s also not forget that Edward watches (some sites have used the word stalk) Bella sleep in her bedroom.”In Bitch magazine, Professor Christine Seifert labelled the saga “abstinence porn” and added: “Twilight actually convinces us that self-denial is hot. Fan reaction suggests that in the beginning, Edward and Bella’s chaste but sexually charged relationship was steamy precisely because it was unconsummated.”Of course, the later films became all about who would be the best and most self-sacrificial protector of Bella – Edward or the werewolf Jacob Black played by the increasingly muscled Taylor Lautner. Publicity fanned the flames of Team Edward v Team Jacob, while Bella was buffeted between the two.But Bella always had a streak of determination, and the strange power of being able to close her mind to Edward’s thought-reading. In Breaking Dawn I, she courageously handles the gruesome problems of giving birth to a hybrid human-vampire baby, but by Breaking Dawn II, she takes on vampire shape herself, and arm-wrestles the rest of the Cullen coven into submission, just after she has chased a mountain lion and sunk her teeth into its jugular. In the end, Bella is active and empowered, a leader in battle, and the Twi-hards loved it.Hardwicke quietly slipped some of her own politics into the first film, too, particularly when it came to casting a few actors or colour, who were not in the books, which depicted all vampires with pale, white, glittering skin. (The werewolves of the Quileute Tribe were mostly Native American.) Hardwicke tried to encourage Meyer to cast Alice Cullen as Japanese, to no avail, but she did persuade the author that there could be some ersity among the school pupils and that Kenyan-American actor Edi Gathegi would play the vampire Laurent.Writing this feature brought back fond and ridiculous memories of watching the whole saga unfold as a critic, and taking my daughter, who was 10 when the first film debuted, and my son, then 13, through screaming, palpitating fans in Leicester Square to later premieres. I remember once being so deep in a sea of hormonal R-Patz-aroused girls that I got lost and had to aim for Mark Kermode’s quiff bobbing above the crowd to reach the cinema entrance. (Kermode always understood the popular Twilight phenomenon, while others sneered.)This week, I speed-watched all five Twilight films on Netflix one evening. My son came by and noted that he had read all the books, and that the vampire wars were a precursor to his fondness for Game of Thrones, so there was a male demographic in the audience, somewhere. My daughter sent me the parodic “Edward and Bella – a bad lip reading of Twilight”, which I thoroughly recommend. It has 39 million views on YouTube.A second viewing of the films reveals that R-Patz and K-Stew are as electric as ever in this, the world’s longest staring-and-kissing sequence. But some of the other elements are totally weird.There’s Michael Sheen just chewing the scenery as Aro the mind-reading Volturi vampire – or is it Tony Blair? There’s the disturbing business of Jacob the werewolf “imprinting” on Renesmee the vampire-human baby and planning to become her lover when she is fully grown. There’s the sippy cup of blood with a straw when Bella gets those pregnancy cravings. There’s the eternal youth and immortality bestowed by vampirism, so why do all the actors look like they have been Botoxed and lathered in clown paint? Worse still, there’s a hidden anti-vegan message when Edward explains to Bella that his family are “vegetarian vampires” and only drink the blood of animals. “It’s like a human on tofu – keeps you strong but never satisfied.” Finally, it’s worth remembering that Fifty Shades of Grey began as Twilight fan fiction.Yet, overall, I think Twilight’s legacy is a positive one, for young readers, for Twi-hard cinephiles, for the future of female-led and directed blockbusters. I’ll leave the last word to K-Stew in Interview magazine: “Anybody who wants to talk shit about Twilight, I completely get it. But there’s something there that I’m endlessly, and to this day, fucking proud of. My memory of it felt – still feels – really good.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f96da28e4d7f85868c59e9ba87d1fcf8ab6f412b/0_213_2706_1625/master/2706.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d571e7405e7959373881df842ea33b4","title":"indoor neon lit mushroom farms are new yorks hottest new food trend","story":"As well as looking pretty, inventor Smallhold claims its far more sustainable than traditional farmingDiners at the Bunker, a Vietnamese restaurant in Brooklyn, may not realise that the mushrooms in their bánh mì were grown in a blue-tinted, spaceship-looking “mini farm” underneath their seats. But it’s just one of a growing number of plug-in fungi farms mushrooming in New York City.Smallhold, the company that created the idea, grows around 100 pounds of various mushroom types a week, then distributes them three-quarters grown to climate-controlled, do-it-yourself mini “farms” around the city. The mushrooms finish growing within the automated units, while a remote technician adjusts humidity, airflow and temperature, offering chefs on-the-spot, fresh and self-replenishing batches of a food item that has a short shelf-life.They currently sell nine mushroom varieties, including oyster, lion’s mane, shiitake and pioppino.Smallhold has been distributing their farms through partner restaurants and markets, including Manhattan’s Mission Chinese restaurant, Kimchee Market in Greenpoint and a Whole Foods store in Bridgewater, New Jersey.Smallhold farms also happen to look very pretty, with weird mushroom formations glowing under nightclub-style lighting. Danny Bowien, the chef and owner of Mission Chinese Food, told Vogue in an interview that many of his customers think the units in his restaurant are art. The launch of the first unit in the Whole Foods store saw a similar reaction. Confused shoppers crowded four-deep around the mushrooms. The organic material the mushrooms grow in is also sustainable, made from recycled materials such as sawdust, coffee grounds and wheat berries.The pair acknowledge they may soon face competition, but for now they appear to be something of a status symbol.

He was forced off after Fulham’s Timothy Fosu-Mensah fell on him.Guardiola retained only John Stones from the 1-0 win at Tottenham and professed himself pleased with City’s performance.“Everybody was good. Brahim made two goals Aro Muric gave us good security Phil Foden plays a good level every time. We made an excellent performance without the ball in terms of how aggressive we were. Fulham have the quality to play even though they are not in a good moment in terms of results.“We played like the game deserved. We made the space and created enough chances. I’m so satisfied.”Díaz could leave City next summer on a free transfer. “We want him but it doesn’t depend on us, it is the agent, him, family, they decide,” Guardiola said. “My opinion is not changed because of two goals. The opinion is so high. To compete with Leroy Sané, Raheem Sterling, Bernardo Silva, Sergio Agüero, Gabriel Jesus – it is not easy to find space in the team. He knew that in the beginning and we are delighted with him. He decides. It’s simple.”Slavisa Jokanovic made three changes – Tom Cairney, Luciano Vietto and André-Frank Zambo Anguissa came in – with the Fulham manager desperate for a win after losing the past four games.De Bruyne took only moments to show his class with a shot and followed that with a cross-shot Sergio Rico was grateful to gather.Fulham were wide open and sloppiness appeared to be City’s only enemy. It was too easy. Sané fed Foden and his fierce shot was beaten away and De Bruyne’s follow-up was deflected for a corner.City’s lead arrived when the ball broke following a corner. It bounced off Vincent Kompany’s left knee and Díaz’s hunger allowed him to beat Fosu-Mensah to the ball and hit home.Next, Danilo skated along the right and was allowed to career into a shooting position. Only Rico’s left post kept out the right-back’s blazing shot.City had Fulham were they love to have all opponents: pinned in and around the area facing constant waves of attack. At this juncture De Bruyne, Danilo, Díaz, and Fabian Delph were a blur of interchanging passing.When Foden laid off a simple ball to Sané rather than shoot it was a telling illustration of smart decision-making by the 18-year-old midfielder.City, though, did ease off. Passes went astray and the pace sagged. This had Guardiola hanging his head and, for all their dominance, City were only a goal up.They did, though, commence the second half with intent but Aleksandar Mitrovic gave City a scare when he breached the penalty box – a near collector’s item – before Foden broke down the left. After swapping passes with Oleksandr Zinchenko he put in Jesus but a player with only one goal in his past 11 appearances showed why, proving unable to at least pose Rico a question.The match was played at an under-capacity Etihad Stadium with a flat atmosphere. City had caught the mood and a passage of prolonged Fulham pressure showed they retained hope.Díaz still sparkled. One moment he was back helping to defend, the next performing a soft-shoe shuffle to create space for a shot. It was the Spaniard who doubled City’s lead. An injection of what had been missing – speed – from Sané led to Foden touching on to Jesus and, after his attempt came off Rico’s left post, Díaz smashed home.Sané was now back on song: driving at Fulham and causing them headaches. Foden produced a dinked pass that put in Sané and it began to feel a long way back for Fulham.With 13 minutes left Riyad Mahrez replaced Díaz. The forward received an ovation plus a hug from Guardiola, who brought on the 18-year-old French midfielder Claudio Gomes for his debut."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d94ec67eae244fde404f0a7ce345c04f10057ec8/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=851b68780c7ea21ef33dceeebfe88d78","title":"arsenal unai emery joe montemurro wsl eni aluko","story":"Unai Emery’s mix of grit and total football has rejuvenated Arsenal but his start to the season does not match that overseen by Joe Montemurro with the women’s teamHaving lived in London for a long time I have a lot of friends who are Arsenal fans and, like many of them, I was critical of the club during the final years of Arsène Wenger’s reign as manager. Everything seemed to have gone stale and there was a desperate need for change, which finally arrived in the shape of Unai Emery. Watching on, it’s been interesting to see the immediate, positive impact he has had.The Carabao Cup win against Blackpool on Wednesday made it 13 games unbeaten for Arsenal. Emery has had a big impact and it’s clear the team are performing in a more deliberate manner now. They are also showing more grit while at times displaying the total football that we saw at their peak under Wenger. The best example of that has been the third goal in the 3-1 win over Leicester, scored by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and which came at the end of a beautiful, free-flowing team move from defence to attack.One of the criticisms of Emery when he succeeded Wenger was that he was a great coach but not a good man-manager. That stemmed from his perceived inability to deal with the big personalities at Paris Saint-Germain. But he has shown that he is not afraid to take on big names in the dressing room, as seen by his substitutions of Mesut Özil and Aubameyang at Crystal Palace. Both players were underperforming and Emery made it clear to them, as well as the rest of the squad, that he will not accept mediocre performances, no matter the reputations involved. That mentality may be part of the reason Arsenal are getting good results.There is also a great ruthlessness about Arsenal now, with much of that stemming from the partnership Alexandre Lacazette has formed with Aubameyang. Under Wenger, Lacazette looked like he was affected by Aubameyang’s arrival, whereas now he is thriving alongside the former Borussia Dortmund striker. They are very much a duo, on and off the pitch, and that too is credit to the environment Emery has allowed to blossom.Saying all that, these remain early days in the new man’s reign and they have faced very few tests, with defeats coming in the two that have come their way: against Manchester City and Chelsea. That is what makes Saturday’s game against Liverpool so important. It is another game against a top‑six rival and if Arsenal are serious about competing for a Champions League place, and possibly the title, they need to make a statement against Jürgen Klopp’s side.While Arsenal’s men are striving for the top, their women are already there. Joe Montemurro’s side lead the Super League after a blistering start, winning six out of six and scoring an incredible 31 goals. They look unstoppable.Juventus played Arsenal in pre-season and there were a few raised eyebrows after we lost 5-0. But, honestly, we couldn’t get near them, with no one impressing more than Vivianne Miedema. She scored a hat-trick, putting away every chance that came her way, and has continued that form in the WSL.Miedema is the ision’s top scorer with 11, and having last season looked like someone who was not on the same page as her teammates, as well as not always looking fully fit, she is thriving and hitting the high levels she reached for the Netherlands at Euro 2017.She is not the only one impressing for Arsenal. Jordan Nobbs looks unstoppable after some injury problems over the past season, while at the back Leah Williamson continues to be a steady influence and is deservedly getting regular England call-ups.Montemurro has the balance just right and after he signed a new contract I’ll be shocked if he does not guide Arsenal to qualification for the Champions League at the very least this season. They face stern competition from Manchester City and Chelsea but they look as strong, if not stronger, than both of those.Staying in north London, I was fascinated by the debate Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville had about Spurs on Monday Night Football. It centred on whether the club are showing enough ambition to win the Premier League and I very much came down on Carragher’s side, which is that they are not.As I wrote in my first column, Tottenham are a club competing for trophies but never actually winning any and it’s hard to see that changing while they continue to deny Mauricio Pochettino the financial support he needs to compete with the likes of Manchester City and Liverpool.Spurs have a net spend figure of £29m since Pochettino arrived four and a half years ago, compared with £518m for City and £183m for Liverpool. They did not sign a single player during the summer transfer window and, overall, that is simply not good enough for a club of their size and potential.I understand there are financial restraints resulting from the costs involved in building a new stadium but Tottenham, and Daniel Levy in particular, have to make a decision: plan for the future or take advantage of the club possessing arguably the best manager and group of players in their history by living in the here and now.What’s for sure is that it’s not going to get any easier for Tottenham to win the title and if they are not careful they could find themselves trying to do so without Pochettino. The good news is that the core of the squad are on long-term deals including Dele Alli, who just signed a new contract, but players of his calibre will want to win trophies.Pochettino has been linked with the vacancy at Real Madrid and most people could not blame him if he decides sooner rather than later that the time has come to make a change. Arguably, he has a better chance of winning major titles in Madrid than he does at Spurs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82b5b03d96cd713d367f8500210952c35a02ceb5/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f3723f71bab84582b309d9921113bb5","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Liverpool to reveal how good Arsenal really are, Lukaku to be on the bench again and Hart has a point to prove at West HamAfter the Unai Emery era opened with defeats by Manchester City and Chelsea, it was hard not to wonder if Arsenal were going to endure another uncertain season. Yet a kind run of fixtures has allowed confidence to grow and Arsenal’s players are gaining a strong understanding of Emery’s demands. They are unbeaten in all competitions since losing to Chelsea on 18 August and find themselves four points off the top of the table, with optimism flowing thanks to the goals of Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Lucas Torreira’s snappy contributions in midfield. But just how good are they? More excitable supporters will say Emery is constructing a title challenge, whereas the more discerning will accept a top-four finish should be the target for this evolving side. Either way, Saturday’s visit from Liverpool should offer a clearer indication of Arsenal’s level. For all the positives, Emery is yet to solve the problem of his side’s slow starts and the Spaniard’s unconvincing defence will surely be pushed to the limit by Liverpool’s front three of Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mané and Mohamed Salah. JS• Eni Aluko: Hats off to Arsenal’s manager – Emery but Montemurro tooIt did not feel like a coincidence that Manchester United were able to produce one of their better performances this season after leaving Romelu Lukaku on the bench against Everton. The point is not that Lukaku has no positives: his goalscoring record for club and country speaks for itself and he has destroyed plenty of Premier League defences. But the goals have dried up and that has shifted the spotlight on to other aspects of his game, leading to accusations that the Belgian’s movement is too obvious and his touch too inconsistent. Even José Mourinho, a Lukaku loyalist, decided it was time for a change against Everton. Mourinho has always liked his teams to have a target man but United had more fluidity with the speedy and slippery Marcus Rashford in a central role. While Rashford might not be as reliable a goalscorer as Lukaku, he has a better relationship with the increasingly impressive Anthony Martial and deserves another chance. JS• Paul Wilson: Rise of Brooks shows big clubs that less really can be moreLeicester City travel to Cardiff for their first match since the death of their owner, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, and four others following a helicopter crash outside their the King Power Stadium last Saturday. A minute’s silence will be observed before what is likely to be a strange game for Leicester’s players, most of whom seem to have forged an extremely close bond with the Thai businessman, whose benevolence and vision led to the wildly implausible scenario of them winning the Premier League two years ago. While Leicester’s players will hope to mark their friend’s passing with a good performance, the result will be of little or no consequence for them as they work through the grieving process. It will be a difficult afternoon for Cardiff too. BG• Playing on for Vichai: Puel remembers Leicester’s loved ownerSaturday night matches are a new wheeze for the Premier League this season but floodlit games at Molineux have been stirring passions since the 1950s, when Wolves, innovative on and off the pitch, staged famous victories against Spartak Moscow and a South African XI before declaring themselves de facto world champions by beating Honved Budapest, who had several of the ‘Magical Magyars’ that twice led England on a merry dance. So Saturday’s match against Tottenham follows a glorious tradition. Not that Nuno Espírito Santo will be thinking about that – instead he’ll be hoping to see improvement on more recent history, specifically in the finishing of a side who have undermined otherwise good displays by finding the net with only nine of their 145 shots in the Premier League so far. Last week at Brighton Nuno changed his starting lineup for the first time this season, replacing Diogo Jota with Adama Traoré, who did not seize his chance. Traoré and the player on the opposite side, Helder Costa, have bulked up since last season but not yet shown a sharper edge. This weekend the manager must be tempted to make even more changes in the advanced positions, with Ivan Cavaleiro a prime candidate to come in. PD• David Conn: In shadow of Spurs’ new stadium residents fear for futureJust over a year ago, Crystal Palace pulled off the most unlikely of shocks against Chelsea at Selhurst Park. Still reeling from consecutive gubbings at the hands of both Manchester clubs and without a league point or even a goal after seven league games, Roy Hodgson’s men rallied to beat the league champions and belatedly kick-start their season. The catalyst for their victory was, needless to say, Wilfried Zaha, who had returned from injury to make his first appearance since the opening day. Taking on Chelsea at Stamford Bridge is a different proposition. While their reliance on Zaha remains, they will arrive in far better shape than last season, buoyed following last weekend’s combative draw – in a game they should probably have won – with Arsenal. Considering they have scored five Premier League goals on the road compared to just two at home this season, they have every right to fancy their chances of putting Chelsea to the sword. BG• Scott Dann: ‘My son saw the marks and asked if I’d been bitten by a shark’It is almost a year since Pep Guardiola took grievous exception to an inhibited display by Nathan Redmond at Manchester City. “He commented on my qualities as a young English player and how he wanted me to attack his team more during the game in a similar way to last season,” Redmond subsequently explained. Since Pep’s talk Redmond has scored one goal in 34 matches for Southampton, for whom no one else is netting regularly. Mark Hughes’ side have failed to score at all in their last three matches and the prospects of them doing so at the Etihad on Sunday are bleak. If the impotent visitors are to come away with even a point against hosts for whom Kevin De Bruyne could start, then they will need Guardiola to be annoyed by a different Englishman this time – Southampton’s impressive goalkeeper Alex McCarthy. PD• Sterling verbally agrees new five-year Manchester City contractGroans formed the soundtrack for most of Joe Hart’s unhappy year at West Ham. The goalkeeper was so jittery last season that even his good work ended up receiving sarcastic cheers from West Ham’s fans, though the biggest price Hart paid for his poor form was failing to make England’s World Cup squad. His snub by Gareth Southgate hurt more than any terrace mockery and he is bound to have a point to prove against his former side, with Burnley’s return to the London Stadium set to revive memories of the crowd trouble that marred this fixture last season. Hart wore West Ham’s colours on that torrid March afternoon and he was at fault for Burnley’s second goal, presenting Chris Wood with a tap-in as chaos reigned in the stands. That error was not an isolated aberration and he would end up losing the No 1 spot to Adrian. Yet Hart has shown signs of regaining his former powers since leaving for Burnley and will relish the chance to silence his critics. JS• Football Weekly Extra: Real Madrid in crisis, and the Spurs rollercoasterStill looking for their first win of what has been been a disastrous season thus far, Newcastle look unlikely to get it when they host a Watford side that have rediscovered their mojo after a brief speed-wobble. Roberto Pereyra has been in fine form for the Hornets and has already equalled his goal tally of last season, scoring five (including a couple of absolute crackers) from seven shots on target. The Argentinian winger’s scintillating form is likely to have provided Newcastle right-back DeAndre Yedlin with plenty of unappetising food for thought and it will be intriguing to see how Rafael Benítez attempts to contain him. Having robustly defended his manager’s negative tactics earlier this season, Newcastle winger Matt Ritchie is likely to find himself on defensive duties of a different kind as he and Yedlin double up in an attempt to put a stop to Pereyra’s gallop. BG• Lascelles tells Newcastle fans: drop the protests and get behind usBrighton travel to Goodison Park on the back of three straight wins in which they have kept clean sheets. But Chris Hughton would rather they showed more attacking ability and did not have to rely so much on the excellence of Mat Ryan, Shane Duffy and Lewis Dunk. Unfortunately for Hughton, injury will deprive him of Pascal Gross and Davy Pröpper again this weekend. So if Brighton are to create, they will need the talented Solly March to improve his decision making. That is not a complaint that could be directed at André Gomes, the canny schemer who has enhanced Everton’s midfield in his two appearances to date. With the Portuguese pulling strings behind Gylfi Sigurdsson, Bernard and Richarlison, Brighton’s defenders should be in for another busy afternoon. PD• Book extract: David Squires on … becoming a football cartoonistAfter exceeding expectations last season, it seems Huddersfield’s lack of quality has caught up with them. David Wagner’s excellent management carried them over the line in their first year in the Premier League, but reality is starting to bite. The explanation is not so much second-season syndrome, more that they were always out of their depth and have run out of ways of answering the difficult questions teams face at this level. Wagner must be wondering where to start because while the league’s bottom side defended appallingly in last weekend’s hammering by Watford, their struggles are compounded by their toothless attack. Huddersfield have managed four goals in 10 games. Even Fulham, who have been shipping goals for fun, will fancy their chances of earning a clean sheet in Yorkshire. Time for Laurent Depoitre and Steve Mounié to stop firing blanks – or for Aaron Mooy to find the back of the net for the first time since December 2017.

The £2,500 cost included installation and a demonstration, and the salesman advised the remote would also control our Xbox and Sky box. The delivery team turned up three hours late, spent three hours trying to install the set, then said they couldn’t figure it out and left. After many calls, some of which lasted up to two hours, Currys agreed to send a new team. They didn’t have a clue how to install it either, and damaged our Xbox. Eventually, someone with expertise in Sony products was sent, but he, too, left without being able to get it working. At this point, I’d had enough and asked Currys to take the TV back. For the fourth time I had to take time off work and wait in for them to collect it. In the end, we were offered £75 compensation, which is a disgrace given we’ve wasted about 30 hours on the phone and waiting in for teams.

We have also offered an additional gesture of goodwill.”That turned out to be the same £75 you had previously refused. After pressure, that was nudged up to £100 as a “final offer”, although it would pay for repairs to the Xbox if it was shown it caused the damage.If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

But who knew reggae is such a hit?It starts with an elegiac sweep of strings, softly playing in a minor key, before chirruping into birdsong, and then back to ambient strings. This continues for 12 hours.To the untrained ear, this may sound like one of the sleep playlists that have gained popularity in recent years, but the human ear is not the intended audience for this music – it is for dogs. For embedded within this relaxing (or maddening) muzak are canine-friendly frequencies to help reduce stress or separation anxiety.Far from being a novelty, dog-oriented music is fast becoming a successful new genre, with the production company RelaxMyDog at the forefront of the trend. Founded in 2011 by entrepreneur Amman Ahmed and producer Ricardo Henriquez, the service reaches an audience of 10 million users a month: 600 years’ worth of their content was streamed in September alone.With such an enthusiastic response to their music, and sister company RelaxMyCat founded in 2012, there is loyal fanbase: “We get messages from owners saying that their dog or cat used to listen to the music and now their pet has died they want it to be played at their funeral,” says Ahmed. “Our content becomes an ingrained part of the lives of these animals.”Ahmed is coy when explaining the somewhat vague musical formula behind their success, though. It comprises, he says, of “a range of frequencies that the dogs can hear, combined with music that is designed to be relaxing to humans, since if the human is relaxed, that energy can be projected on to the dog also”. Rather than engaging in scientific research to influence their compositions, “the best research comes from actual users”, he says, who provide regular feedback through their YouTube channel’s 600,000 subscribers.One such piece of feedback was that dogs were responding well to reggae music, which has led to a new series of dog reggae. This finding is backed up by a 2017 study conducted by the Scottish SPCA and the University of Glasgow. The research found that while classical music had an initial calming effect on the dogs, after a few days they became bored. Instead, reggae and soft rock came out as the best genres for reducing stress, barking and heart rates. The SPCA’s head of research, Gilly Mendes Ferreira, speculates this is because “those genres have a rhythm that is similar to the dogs’ own heart rate. When a puppy is feeling stressed it will snuggle into its mother and use her heartbeat as relaxation, so this music mimics that.”Taking the research one step further, the SPCA last year collaborated with the producer John McLaughlin, best known for his work with Westlife, Blue, and 5ive, to create Paws, Play, Relax, a charitable record designed for dogs. “A lot of people I’m sure thought this project was barking mad but it made total sense to me,” McLaughlin says. “Dogs need to be entertained just like humans, and everybody likes a bit of reggae, don’t they?” McLaughlin even wrote lyrics from the perspective of dogs, resulting in love ballad lines such as: “I was barely holding on  But I knew you were the only one  From the moment I saw you.”McLaughlin is proud of the results: “We had a listening party where a bunch of my friends’ dogs came round to the house and it definitely works. Some of those dogs can be very enthusiastic and this record did the trick in calming them down.”On 3 November, Classic FM will be broadcasting a one-off show for pets, featuring themed numbers such as John Barry’s Crazy Dog. Despite the evidence of dogs’ preference for Bob Marley over Mahler, the show’s host (and owner of three dogs) Bill Turnbull says, “I leave the radio tuned to Classic FM for my dogs when I go out, and they seem to enjoy it. They’ve certainly never complained.”Petflix entails dog-themed visuals, like walks through a forest, with a purple filter to engage the dogs further, paired of course with their favourite music. Having only launched in October, its success remains to be seen, but for now Ahmed is focusing on a more familiar, seasonal goal: “We’re releasing a Christmas album and I want it to reach No 1.”"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing today in focus","story":"Today in Focus is a new daily podcast that brings you closer to  journalism.

However, these average figures have a tendency to mask extreme weather and climate events. So in our latest report we have focussed on those measures which record weather extremes.”The new report shows that warm spells – when the maximum temperature is above the 90th percentile for the time of year – are becoming much more prolonged. From 1961 to 1990, the average longest warm spell each year was 5.3 days. From 2008 to 2017 this more than doubled to 13.2 days. This year, which is not included in these statistics, was even longer at 17 days.The south-east has seen an especially striking increase over the same period, up from an average of 6.1 days to 18.3 days.Tropical nights – when minimum nighttime temperatures remain above 20C – are being measured for the first time. They were almost unheard of until a couple of decades ago. Even the famous hot summer of 1976 never saw any of these nights, which are particularly gruelling for the elderly and infirm because they provide no respite from the heat. Since 1995 they have started to be recorded in London, Kent, the Isle of Wight and even occasionally in Wales and the north-east. McCarthy said tropical nights were still very rare but he expected them to occur more frequently in the future. “With projections in climate suggesting warmer temperatures, it is useful to have this metric in place so that future changes can be monitored.”McCarthy said he was most surprised that extremes of hot and cold were changing at different speeds. While the temperature on the hottest day of the year has risen roughly in line with the average annual rate of warming since 1961, the coldest day has warmed at twice that rate. In the 30 years until 1990, the bitterest winter night in the UK averaged -8.5C. From 2008 to 2017 it was -6.8C.Parents who walk their children to school in the depths of winter may also have noticed there is less ice on the path than during their own childhoods. This is confirmed by the metric of “icing days”, which shows that the average number of days each year with freezing temperatures has fallen from 4.8 to 3.2. In the south-east last year there was not a single day averaging below 0C.The longest dry spell has become shorter, falling from 20.5 days with less than 1mm of rain to 18 days, though this year has brought such severe droughts that many farmers have had poor harvests. Many have already had to feed their winter food stocks to their animals and face increased costs as a result. In August the government was forced to relax rules on how much groundwater farmers were allowed to use after agriculture bodies warned continued dry weather could lead to food shortages and increased prices.Last month the UN’s top climate body warned that unless global temperature rises are held to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the world is likely to face catastrophic impacts from climate change, with flooding, droughts and extreme heat all more prevalent. Governments will meet in Poland in December for the latest round of negotiations over how to implement and strengthen the recommendations of the 2015 Paris agreement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43c3aa7bee543325da2c8b5863495844ee58a306/362_37_6239_3743/master/6239.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bcc6ecec49bc98be95c5f8fcad4c0295","title":"grimsby named unhealthiest high street in uk by rsph study","story":"Lincolnshire town tops list that punishes locations which have bookmakers and fast food outletsGrimsby, the centre of the UK fish-processing industry and which has marketed itself as Europe’s Food Town, now has another, less welcome, appellation.The seaport on the Humber estuary, whose name is derived, according to legend, from its ninth-century Danish founder, Grim, has been judged to have the “unhealthiest” high street in the UK.Once reported to produce more pizzas for the food industry than anywhere in Europe, including Italy, it has topped the league table compiled by the charity Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH).Edinburgh was judged to have the “healthiest” high street in the UK.In its report, Health on the High Street: Running on empty, the RSPH used a “Richter scale of health” to measure the healthiness of shops and businesses.Those deemed unhealthy included payday lenders, bookmakers, tanning salons and fast food outlets. Those deemed healthy included pubs and bars, libraries and museums, pharmacies, dentists, opticians and leisure centres.The league table excluded London’s high streets, which were ranked separately, with West Green RoadSeven Sisters in Haringey coming out as the worst, and Muswell Hill, also in Haringey, having the healthiest.Grimbarians, as townsfolk are called, suffered a perfect storm last year, the local paper reported, emerging in a study by accountants PwC as one of the worst-hit areas in the country for shop closures.There were 16 major stores closed, with only six new ones opening. Among the casualties was local award-winning butchers, John Pettit \u0026amp Sons, after 125 years of high street trading, and whose sausage recipe was judged best in the UK four years running.The RSPH report said average life expectancy for people living with the top 10 healthiest high streets is two-and-a-half years longer than those in the 10 unhealthiest.Shirley Cramer, the RSPH chief executive, said: “We come to the high street with our money and time, and convert it into a leisurely hour with a friend, a bag full of shopping or a social experience. We come away with increased cultural capital, reassurance from a healthcare professional, or the feeling of wellbeing that comes from a yoga class.“Yet this transaction is not always good for our health. When our time and money are converted into a loss at the bookmakers, a tan from a sunbed, a high-cost loan or a bucket of fried chicken, the high street is enabling and supporting poor health behaviours.”Among RSPH recommendations are a review of taxes to ensure online businesses are not put at an unfair advantage over the high street and for Facebook and Google to provide discounted advertising to local independent health-promoting businesses.It also calls on councils to review rents, for business rates relief for businesses trying to improve public health, and for local authorities to have powers to restrict the opening of new betting shops and other unhealthy outlets where there are already clusters.Jane Hyldon-King, North East Lincolnshire council’s cabinet member for health and wellbeing, said: “It’s no secret that Great Grimsby is home to some of the most deprived communities in the country. It’s not something we’re proud of, but it’s unfortunate that when a new set of official statistics is released, you can bet Grimsby is near the bottom of the pile.”However, she questioned why empty shops, a UK-wide problem, was taken as a negative factor, and queried if the report had only examined one street.The local indoor market had been commended in the government’s High Street Awards this year, and the central library was just “a few paces” from the high street, as was “our fantastic museum”. The council was “working hard to bring businesses and people to our town centre, but it’s not an overnight fix”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc9026f178a7164bd95eba67ddade8a648e8538a/137_186_5142_3087/master/5142.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d582574aacfdef45f58ad44faefdd79","title":"owen farrell england dig deep november international south africa","story":"The opening autumn fixture against South Africa at Twickenham on Saturday will, if nothing else, reveal the extent of English rugby’s strength in depth. Eddie Jones has picked thousands of sides in his time but with more than 400 high‑profile caps unavailable up front alone, he cannot recall ever digging deeper for victory at the top level.In addition to England’s obvious shortage of hard-bitten Test experience up front and on the bench, it is also among the most significant team-sheets of Jones’s tenure in other areas. The ditching of George Ford and the deployment of Owen Farrell at No 10, another new midfield combination, a tantalising back three and the dawn of the co-captain era are all acknowledgements something fresh is needed to steer the good ship England away from jagged rocks.It still may not be enough against a South Africa pack containing 293 caps. England’s forwards, including the 93 caps of Dylan Hartley at hooker, can muster just 165. All Jones can do is forget the absent Vunipolas, Chris Robshaw, Joe Launchbury, Courtney Lawes and Joe Marler, among others, and cross his fingers. “I wouldn’t say it is my most difficult selection but it’s the deepest we’ve had to dig,” the England coach said. “You don’t just replace 400 caps overnight. It’s probably the most inexperienced pack England have had for a long time.”Actually the Lions-depleted side fielded in Argentina last year just edges it but these are increasingly testing days for Twickenham’s autograph hunters. Compared with England’s last outing in Cape Town in June there are seven changes, plus Farrell’s positional switch from 12. It is only the third time Farrell has been tossed the England No 10 jersey since the 2015 Rugby World Cup, allowing Worcester’s Ben Te’o, who has played 28 competitive minutes since May, to form a revised midfield pairing with the classy Henry Slade.Despite Teo’s lack of recent rugby, the temptation to rush back Manu Tuilagi has, for now, been resisted but the presence of both in the 23 finally gives England some strike power down the 12 channel. Slade, for one, reckons it will make a sizable difference. “I think it gives us a really good balance in midfield, whereas in the summer I was probably the bloke doing the main carrying off first phase, which isn’t really my game. Now we’ve got some big lads to do that, it will allow me to concentrate on getting the ball to our outside backs, who are really dangerous. I think we’ve now got a good mix of strengths across the backline.”Farrell has also clearly been itching to run the show from fly-half. Ford and Danny Cipriani remain gifted options but with the World Cup clock ticking, Jones now wants his most competitive warrior to set the tone. “I wanted to see the difference it makes playing Owen at 10 with bigger centres,” Jones said. “Tactically we’ll be a little bit different it gives us a different way of being able to play. Owen’s a bit of a spiritual leader in our side so being close to the action will help in that regard. He’s from good stock and he’s an aggressive competitor. We need that against South Africa, definitely.”Defensively, too, it ensures the Boks can no longer make a regular beeline for the 10 channel as they did in June. With a new defence coach in John Mitchell and altitude not a factor in suburban London, England also believe they have the fitness, if not the caps, to be relentlessly competitive for the full 80 minutes.What the England pack lack in stardust they certainly make up for in work rate, although how much energy Alec Hepburn and Kyle Sinckler will have left should the visitors start turning the set-piece screw remains to be seen. If big units like Duane Vermeulen and Malcolm Marx come repeatedly smashing over the gainline at pace, it will be a long and painful afternoon.All the cunning tactical gameplans in the world will also count for little if England’s new-look back-row cannot soak up the onrushing physicality. Tom Curry, relentlessly brave on the summer tour, will have to be so again while Jones’s preferred options at No 6 and No 8, Brad Shields and Mark Wilson, both face defining afternoons.Neither have started a Twickenham Test before, while Hepburn is also making his first start. On the bench sit the uncapped Ben Moon and Zach Mercer, alongside Bath’s Charlie Ewels, who has just six caps. Jones has not always been full of praise about the standard of the Premiership relative to Test rugby and Saturday will be a good litmus test.Chris Ashton, though, will have to wait a little longer for his Test recall – “His opportunity won’t be far away,” Jones said – with the reliable Jack Nowell having been chosen for this assignment. Will it all be enough? Between now and 8 July, when his side gather for the final push towards next year’s World Cup, the head coach will be as interested as anyone to see how many fringe candidates prosper and how many fall by the wayside."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27ecc52d99584d6f4320b7f991dd4bc8b5f20137/0_122_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d25e9868971d4718d322dc1ab3fbebf9","title":"simone biles all around worlds gold","story":"Simone Biles overcame a series of uncharacteristic mistakes to become the first woman to win four all-around world championships on Thursday in Doha.The 21-year-old American, despite falls on the balance beam and vault, finished with a score of 57.491, seeing off Japan’s Mai Murakami, who finished 1.693 points behind for the silver. Morgan Hurd, last year’s world champion in Biles’ absence, finished 0.066 behind Murakami for bronze.The margin of victory, even accounting for Biles’ first falls in more than 60 career routines in the Olympics or world championships, marked the largest of her four all-around world titles.Biles has finished first in every meet she’s entered since the 2013 US championships, though this one was far tighter than usual.In the end, however, it was Biles against herself.Not content to simply rely on her remarkable talent, Biles is intent on pushing the sport forward. It’s an approach that leads her to put together the most difficult routines and gives her basically a head start in every meet because her start values are so high.For once, Biles needed the cushion to pull through.Nearly a year to the day since she returned to the gym following a well-deserved sabbatical after her five-medal haul at the 2016 Olympics, Biles came into the all-around final at the height of her considerable powers. She put on a spectacular display during qualifying, her total of 60.965, 4.5 points clear of Hurd, made all the more startling considering she revealed she’s battling a kidney stone she’s jokingly called “the Doha Pearl”.It was more of the same during team finals, when Biles served as the anchor on all four events as the Americans cruised to their fourth consecutive world championship with ease.Yet the casual dominance Biles has won with for a half decade evaporated in the desert.Most meets with Biles typically start the same. She drills the vault where she is the reigning Olympic champion and then spends the next three rotations simply padding her lead to margins that look like typos.Not this time. Attempting ‘the Biles’ – a roundoff, half-twist onto the table, front double full off typically done by men – her left arm barely touched the table, causing her to under-rotate. She landed and promptly sat down, forcing her to play catch-up.Known for getting angry after mistakes, she responded by drilling her significantly improved uneven bars set, nailing her double-twisting double-somersault dismount to move slightly in front of Hurd halfway through.Then things got weird. Biles hopped off the beam early in her routine then grabbed the four-inch piece of wood later when she had trouble landing a front flip, a sequence she struggled with during qualifying.The miscues gave the rest of the field a small opening. One no one in the rest of the top six could get through. Hurd wobbled twice during her set, leaving Biles a slim margin of .092 over Belgium’s Nina Derwael heading to Biles’ signature event.Murakami’s excellent floor routine put pressure on Biles, but only a little. Needing a 13.308 to win, her 15.000 was the best on the floor by a full point even though her right foot went out of bounds during the end of her intricate opening tumbling run.Not that it mattered. In the end the meet finished the way they have always finished for the last five years when Biles is involved: with her atop the podium standing above a sport that is desperately trying to keep up.Biles, now on two golds at this year’s worlds after leading the United States to the team title on Tuesday, will have four more opportunities for silverware in the apparatus finals and can become the first woman to win six medals at a world championships since Yelena Shushunova of the Soviet Union in 1987.Great Britain’s Ellie Downie upgraded her qualifying scores on all four pieces of apparatus to total 54.233 and finish in 11th place on her return to competition."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4214fc434d23959f7b1c5377d1b837725eee6e97/0_170_2145_1287/master/2145.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=182d6f694333d38b242916a8d0db8d36","title":"usain bolts trial with central coast mariners ends","story":"It began as a seemingly impossible dream – a change of sporting career for the world’s fastest man at the unlikely age of 32 – and, having somehow got to within touching distance of a deal, so it will remain for the foreseeable future. Usain Bolt’s quest to become a professional footballer in Australia ended on Friday when the Olympic sprint champion officially turned down Central Coast Mariners’ offer of an A-League contract.The Mariners announced that, despite having been in discussions with several “promising” potential commercial partners, the club and Bolt had amicably concluded a deal would not be struck.“Despite the fact that we could not come to an agreement that would continue Usain Bolt’s football journey with the Central Coast Mariners, we’ve been thrilled to have the Olympic champion sprinter and world record holder as part of our club for these past eight weeks,” Central Coast Mariners owner, Mike Charlesworth, said. “For the Mariners, it’s been a pleasure to work with Usain as he pursued his desire to become a professional football player.”Having trained with the club since mid-August, the eight-times Olympic sprint champion had been excluded from team sessions for the past two weeks as the Mariners sought to escape any distraction caused by speculation over the Jamaican’s future. Bolt, meanwhile, was weighing up an offer of a reported $150,000 deal – some way short of the $3m he was said to be expecting.“I would like to thank the Central Coast Mariners owners, management, staff, players and fans for making me feel so welcome during my time there,” Bolt said. “I wish the club success for the season ahead.”Bolt debuted for the Mariners over two months ago and in his second trial match scored twice. Despite the goals – one well-taken, one a tap into an empty net – and a clear improvement in his level of football fitness between those two games, serious questions remained over his general play and ability to turn into an elite athlete in a second sport.The Mariners insisted from the outset that Bolt would be given every opportunity to prove himself – he was promised an indefinite training period that could have lasted up to a year – but for all the clear commercial benefits that investment could potentially bring, there were doubts from the outset about his chances of success on the pitch.Marcus Babbel voiced his concern – not in “100 years” would he make it as a pro, said the Western Sydney Wanderers coach – while former Socceroos boss Ange Postecoglou asserted it would be “very, very difficult” to change careers at such a late stage.Regardless, Central Coast tabled an offer, although as reports filtered through of the contract, Mariners coach Mike Mulvey was seemingly caught unaware when asked to comment on live television. Mulvey bristled and fired back a question at the reporter: “You have a look at our front line today and you wonder whether he could get into any of those positions, wouldn’t you?”The incident lifted the lid on the conflict of interest between the football department and the commercial side of the club. Bolt’s value to the latter in the end trumped his ability as a footballer, although somewhat ironically, finances appear to have been the undoing of any deal.Football Federation Australia had been adamant it would not dip into the marquee player fund to finance the Bolt deal and with what was effectively a training contract offered – and no third-party sponsor willing to top that up to a level the Jamaican’s camp were happy with – the deal was doomed.“This has been a mutually beneficial partnership that brought an increased level of excitement and attention to both the Mariners and the Hyundai A-League,” Charlesworth said. “From day one, Usain dedicated himself to being part of the Mariners. He integrated very well into the team and made great strides as a footballer.”Having failed to realise his dream on the Central Coast, Bolt will depart – and with him the media circus that has followed his every move in Gosford – but Charlesworth left the door ajar for the Jamaican to return in a non-playing capacity.“Whilst we understand that Usain will not be part of the club going forward, the Central Coast Mariners wish him all the best in his future endeavours and we hope that opportunities arise to collaborate in other capacities in the future,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4c3ebb58abd2788408c16d38439d1bb080e9c62/390_0_1610_966/master/1610.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aee5ad4ea0e8de1d6b91edff41dfa3f5","title":"darcey bussell strictly steps back in time in pictures","story":"In her new book, Evolved, the Strictly judge and former Royal Ballet star gives an intimate account of her career, alongside photographs of her rehearsals, performances and fashion shoots"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17176a827da7c5d3f9fd5a108576d25c6fa3a1bc/0_0_4116_2470/master/4116.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2e07630c240d88b2752d3aa155a4d2a","title":"oneplus 6t review in display fingerprint scanner speedy performance all screen design notch","story":"With in-display fingerprint scanner and speedy performance, this is the smartphone that brings all-screen design up a notchThe OnePlus 6T proves that cutting-edge technology doesn’t have to cost the Earth, bringing an in-display fingerprint scanner and a tiny notch for just £500.OnePlus has kept things simple for years, offering top specifications for budget prices. The price has slowly crept up to not-quite-so budget, but the level of refinement and technology has also improved.The OnePlus 6T builds on the already excellent OnePlus 6, by further cutting away anything that isn’t screen. The gorgeous, crisp and colourful OLED display is a smidgen bigger at 6.41in, with a smaller chin at the bottom and a tiny teardrop-shaped notch at the top.It’s an impressive design and proves that notches for the selfie camera don’t have to be that intrusive. It looks a little like a widow’s peak but is rapidly forgotten about, and you can even hide it in a black bar if you hate notches. The earpiece speaker is embedded in the rim at the very top of the phone above the camera and works fine when you’re on the phone.Centrally located about 2cm up from the bottom of the screen is a hidden in-display fingerprint scanner that lights up in wild electric green colour when active. That leaves the frosted or polished glass back free of intrusions apart from the camera and LED flash.The smooth, curved glass back feels nice in the hand and isn’t as slippery as some, but it will slide off furnishings if you’re not careful. The glass meets the metal sides with a little lip on both the front and the back of the device, which doesn’t feel quite as well finished as its predecessor.At 74.8mm wide, 8.2mm thick and 185g in weight, the OnePlus 6T is ever so slightly narrower, thicker and heavier than its predecessor, but is narrower and 23g lighter than the iPhone XS Max and around the same dimensions all round as Google’s Pixel 3 XL.The bottom of the phone has symmetrical speaker grilles, one of which is for show, and the USB-C port, making the 6T the first from OnePlus without a headphone socket.Overall it’s a sleek design that’s so understated it’s almost a little plain in the frosted midnight black colour.The OnePlus 6T has the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor, 6 or 8GB of RAM and at least 128GB of storage as the OnePlus 6 launched in May, and as such performs exactly the same in general usage.The OnePlus 6T flies along, matching or exceeding rivals for raw speed of launching apps, switching between apps and launching the camera. Gaming performance is also top notch using OnePlus’s new gaming mode and smart boost systems speeding up game loading. Frame-rates were super smooth even over an hour or so playing Shadowgun Legends.Battery life is solid but not exceptional. With relatively heavy use it would last 30 hours between charges, lasting from a 7am morning alarm on day one and stretching till gone 12-noon on day two.That was while using it as my primary device, sending and receiving hundreds of emails, messages and push notifications, listening to five hours of music on Bluetooth headphones, watching an hour of Netflix, 30 minutes of gaming and shooting about 15 photos.The OnePlus 6T charges pretty quickly via the fast charger that comes with it, reaching a full charge in around 90 minutes – but it doesn’t have wireless charging.OxygenOS is OnePlus’s customised version of Android, this time based on the latest Android 9 Pie.As with previous versions, OxygenOS 9 is a slightly refined version of the standard Android experience, made to be as responsive as possible while adding some much-needed customisations.For instance, you have a choice of standard home, back and overview navigation buttons, Google’s new gesture button or OnePlus’s swipe gestures which are superior to Google’s efforts and remove the need for a navigation bar at the bottom of the phone. You can also edit which icons appear in the status bar, change the colour of the interface and other bits and pieces.The ability to duplicate some apps, such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Uber is useful if you have multiple accounts tied to different phone numbers, and particularly useful for those who put two sims for two phone numbers in the phone.In many ways, OxygenOS is closer to the lean and clean “stock” Android championed by enthusiasts than Google’s version of Android on its Pixel smartphones.The big new thing for the OnePlus 6T is a fingerprint scanner embedded in the screen. It’s the second such device to ship with one after the Huawei Mate 20 Pro in October, but it is slightly faster and more accurate.A spot that is slightly bigger than the one on the Mate 20 Pro lights up on the screen where you have to press your thumb to unlock the device or app and then pulses with a futuristic green glow as it scans your print.You have to press your thumb or finger a little harder on the screen than you normally would on a rear-mounted sensor, and it is ever so slightly slower than the best of the old generation of sensors, but it works very well if you get it in the right spot.There’s also a very fast face unlock system using the selfie camera, but it isn’t 3D and so is less secure than rivals such as Apple’s Face ID or Huawei’s 3D face unlock.The OnePlus 6T has the same 16+20-megapixel dual-camera system on the back as the OnePlus 6, and performs similarly, producing some really nice, well detailed images in good light. Low light performance is good, but not quite up to par with the best from Samsung, Huawei, Apple or Google.The new nightscape low light mode does a good job of eliminating hand-shake from long-exposure shots. The selfie camera is also pretty good, but can be a little washed out and soft on detail in poor lighting. Portrait mode works as advertised.Overall, the camera on the OnePlus 6T is good, but not quite the very best. Most will be very pleased, particularly if upgrading from a two-year-old phone.OnePlus phones have always been good for the money, offering top specifications in well-built devices, but not pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.That’s changed for the OnePlus 6T. It is pushing what’s possible with the popular all-screen design using a tiny, attractive teardrop notch and a smaller chin, and it’s a better phone for it. But it is the introduction of a cutting-edge in-display fingerprint scanner, and making it work really well for as little as half the price of an iPhone XS, that is most impressive.Sure, the camera isn’t quite as mind-blowing as the very best, there’s no wireless charging, it doesn’t have any of the fancy 3D face systems of some and it looks a little plain, but everything else is top notch. Even the software experience is excellent.At £500, you have to spend an awful lot more money to get a better phone than the OnePlus 6T.Cons: glass back but no wireless charging, no IP water resistance rating, no expandable storage, no headphone socket This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

I am accompanied by Sophie, my partner, a woman who spent many years inspecting hotels, with clipboard in hand. She has never lost the skills. “Remember,” I hear myself say. “Try and enjoy yourself.” She gives me that look, the one that says, I’ll do what has to be done.We both like Beverley, a cluster of architectural gems around a market square. When Henry V came to town after Agincourt, it took three days to get all the muck out of the market, but these days it is spotlessly neat and tidy. Almost uniquely in modern Britain there is only one empty shop, something of an achievement in itself, and the rest look satisfyingly prosperous. The medieval minster is the big draw, and a worthy one too, filled with grotesque carvings, soaring columns and ancient artefacts. Nearby stands the house where Mary Wollstonecraft spent some of her early teenage years, a fact only rediscovered in early 2018. There’s a plaque on the facade (it’s at 2 Highgate).The Beverley Arms, where we are headed, is an imposing Georgian pile with another Wollstonecraft connection: part of it was once home to her schoolfriend Jane Arden, whose father influenced the writer with his liberal ideas. Opposite is 12th-century St Mary’s, almost as impressive as the Minster with its flying buttresses and impressive wooden ceilings.The Beverley Arms has undergone a two-year, £6.5m renovation project. The downstairs area is now a seamless flow of lounges, bar, restaurant and dining areas. Colour schemes are respectful to the heritage, but the paintings skip through a riot of colour, even spilling out of their frames. The first thing I notice is that the bar serves hand-pulled beers, including Thwaites (which owns the place) and Wainwrights. The first thing Sophie notices is the old ladies. “They’ve got their coats on,” she says, nodding at a brace of couples in corners. “It’s not warm enough.” And being Sophie, she tells the manager, who assures her that the building team are, even now, attempting to sort the underfloor heating problem. Judging by the numbers of hi-vis jackets, they are taking it very seriously indeed.I like the bedroom. The country inn style may not be particularly adventurous but the bed is magnetically comfortable, the soft subdued colours easy on the eye, and there are some books. I pick up a Bill Bryson and settle on the sofa with a homemade biscuit from the tray and a pot of tea. I like hotels that provide tea pots, good biscuits, books and sofas.Sophie prowls with her invisible clipboard. “Hmm! No shower cap or phone.” She examines the one picture on the bedroom walls: a naïf line drawing of a mouse, artfully incomplete. “They must have run out of the colourful stuff from downstairs. This one isn’t even finished.” I’m wishing there were a few more biscuits.We go down for dinner. It is a large open-plan area with tiled floor and a mix of cane chairs and plaid sofas. The cosier section is next to the old brick kitchen arches, all now scrubbed and decorated with lamps and copper pans.The menu is clearly aimed at me, an omnivore, not Sophie, a vegetarian. Despite my own dietary preferences I do sometimes wonder why UK menus are so carnivorous when more than a quarter of home evening meals are now vegetarian or vegan. We go for the mediterranean moussaka and the pan-fried cod washed down with a bottle of Running Duck sauvignon, product of the excellent Stellar Winery in South Africa. (They have great social values and also happen to make some of the best wine on the planet – organic too. It’s good to see them on the list.) Food portions must be good because I agree to share a sticky toffee pudding, an agreement that I instantly regret on tasting the delicious dessert. Over coffee I become philosophical and vow always to eat a full portion.One of the bizarre things about hotel stays for me is that you eat a big dinner, go to bed, get up, then eat again. At home I’d never manage that. But here? The scrambled eggs are perfectly cooked. Sophie gets them to turn off Radio Two and fellow breakfasters at the next table applaud. I think she’s happy now: she has made a positive contribution. As for me, I loved it.• Accommodation was provided by the Beverley Arms, doubles from £105 B\u0026ampBLee Karen Stow is a Beverley-based journalist and documentary photographerTucked away from sight, Poma in St Mary’s Arcade is great for a robust flat white Italian coffee or Italian gelato ice cream in dreamy creamy flavours of pomegranate, purple plum, almond and coconut.• DrinkThe legend that is Nellie’s (The White Horse) pub looks nothing like a pub from the outside – bending whitewashed walls, doorway opposite St Mary’s Church.

It is an opportunity to “engage black voters in black sacred, culturally connected spaces” – a hallmark of her organization’s mission, Thompson says.Organisations like Woke Vote have become especially important since 2013, when the supreme court struck down a key part of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which had helped stymie attempts to curtail the voting rights of minorities in Alabama and other southern states.In the years since, the state has enacted a series of restrictive measures, many of which disproportionately affect African Americans, Latinos and other marginalized groups, making voting harder for them.Despite this, black voters, especially black women voters, showed their voting power last year when the bloc was credited with being instrumental in the victory of the Democrat Doug Jones, who defeated the Republican Roy Moore in the race for Jeff Sessions’ open Senate seat.But the Jones win was a novelty in Alabama’s march toward a more Republican-dominated political environment. Of its seven congressional districts, only one district is represented by a Democrat – Terri Sewell.African Americans in the United States, Alabama included, reliably vote Democratic, but don’t reliably turn out to vote at every election. Efforts to get out the vote often fall to outside groups like Thompson’s.“More blacks and more young people align with Democrats on the big issues, but too many Democrats often take both of those constituencies for granted,” said John Della Volpe, the director of polling at Harvard’s Institute of Politics. He believes that the Democratic party treats the “black constituency as a special interest rather than a trusted member of a larger coalition”.Thompson was previously involved at a high level in community engagement at the Democratic National Committee, but found that getting a commitment for large funds to turn out black voters was a tough sell. So, she raised $2.5m to get Woke Vote’s operations started a year ago.Now it operates in nine states, primarily in the south, including some with the most hotly contested gubernatorial races, such as Georgia and Florida.One of those emerging leaders is Cara McClure, a Birmingham native and alumna of the Woke Vote fellowship program. As a candidate to be the first black person on Alabama’s Public Service Commission, she understands the importance of cultivating relationships within the black community before asking for their vote. We met in a Chick-fil-A in south-east Birmingham five minutes from her home.As a formerly homeless single mother, she doesn’t have the usual trappings of a typical candidate. But like other Woke Vote fellows, she received training online and in person that “worked on just about everything, even my stump speech”, McClure recalls.The commission is the “most important state agency that no one knows about” even though it regulates utility prices and hasn’t had a public hearing on utility pricing since 1982 (she mentioned that other states have hearings every three to five years).In McClure’s opinion, she can now “marry issues of poor, marginalized communities to the work of the Public Service Commission” because while Alabama has one of the lowest average household income rates in the country, it is second highest for utility prices.As the lone black woman on the nine-person Democratic state ticket, “all of the other candidates are looking to me to turn out the black vote for them,” she said. “It’s a lot of pressure.”But, McClure asks, “Who’s getting the white vote for me?”Will black voters in Alabama turn out this year? For Thompson, Volpe and Gillespie, it depends on how meaningfully and consistently black voters are engaged as, in Volpe’s words, “trusted partners”.

Church bells were rung in towns and villages across the UK, for the first time since the war began, both as a symbolic gesture and to let people know the war was over.Though this was a joyous moment for the allies at least, the devastating loss of life affected many families and communities in Britain and across the world.

Ramaphosa served as deputy president under Zuma.Speaking to a small group of reporters in Johannesburg on Thursday Ramaphosa spoke of a “new dawn” for South Africa and for the ANC, which has been in power since the country’s first free elections in 1994.“There is a new confidence, a new hope in the ANC. The shine that had been tarnished is coming back,” the 65-year-old tycoon and veteran politician said.However Ramaphosa admitted there were concerns about his years serving under Zuma.Hearings of the judicial inquiry into the accusations – set up earlier this year on the orders of the powerful public anti-graft watchdog – have already led to revelations that have deeply embarrassed senior officials, and forced the resignation of the respected finance minister.Ramaphosa said the judicial inquiry was working in an organised way to “shed light” and “when the moment comes the criminal justice system will kick into action”.A former trade unionist who was one of the leaders of the struggle against apartheid in the 1980s, Ramaphosa spoke to journalists after addressing a business leadership summit and a conference on gender-based violence.The South African premier, who appeared tired but determined, faces challenges on every front. The economy is weak, expectations are high and his broadly centrist market-orientated policies face strong opposition from within his own party.Entrenched networks of government and ANC officials loyal to Zuma are still powerful, while international investors, though interested by South Africa’s undoubted potential, remain wary.The economy is in recession. Unemployment – already very high – is rising and inflation is hitting poor people’s budgets hard.Twenty-four years after the end of the racist, repressive apartheid regime, South Africa remains a country with enormous resources and great wealth but also vast inequality.This, and a decision to press ahead with a constitutional amendment to allow expropriation without compensation has rattled investors, as well as prompting Donald Trump to tweet an unfounded rightwing claim that white farms were being seized by the government and farmers suffering “large-scale killing”.Ramaphosa said he had sat next to Trump at a lunch on a recent visit to the US but the issue had not been raised. Instead the two leaders had spoken about golf, with Trump quizzing his counterpart on South African golf champions.The president said he was confident the party would win an “overwhelming victory” in the polls, though admitted it had lost ground in recent years and that party officials continued to commit “misdemeanours” .“We went through a real period of decline …because many people felt we had departed from our value system but there is a new mood in the country, much as it is tempered by the economic conditions we are going through. We need to do more,” he said.Though successive ANC governments have made huge efforts to build homes and supply basic services to millions of people, they have been unable to meet expectations. Many people still live without electricity or sanitation. Schooling and healthcare are often rudimentary. One recent survey found eight out of 10 nine-year-olds in South Africa are functionally illiterate. Levels of violent crime are among the highest in the world, with poor South Africans suffering most."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd47d219b5f36c15c74926e237d1b4603d3fe5d2/0_234_8128_4876/master/8128.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e736275a414af3860cf68f5b6bcf6f6","title":"japanese island disappears esanbe hanakita kojima","story":"Esanbe Hanakita Kojima is believed to have been eroded by wind and drift iceJapan could see its territorial waters shrink near its maritime border with Russia after a tiny island off its north-east coast “disappeared”.The uninhabited islet, called Esanbe Hanakita Kojima, is thought to have slipped beneath the waves, apparently unnoticed by residents living in Sarufutsu, a village on the northern tip of the main island of Hokkaido 500 metres away.Esanbe is one of 158 uninhabited islands that were given names by the Japanese government in 2014 in an effort to clarify its territorial reach and extend its exclusive economic zone.Japan’s outlying islands have taken on increasing significance amid territorial disputes with China over the SenkakuDiaoyu islands in the East China Sea.Esanbe Hanakita Kojima lies west of the Northern Territories, which are at the centre of a long-running dispute between Japan and Russia, where they are known as the Kurils. The islands were seized from Japan by Soviet forces days after the end of the Pacific War.Locals were alerted to the islet’s possible disappearance in September after the author Hiroshi Shimizu visited Sarufutsu to write a sequel to his picture book on Japan’s “hidden” islands, according to the Asahi Shimbun.He alerted the local fisheries cooperative, which sent boats out to its supposed location only to find it had gone missing.Older fishermen told the Asahi they recalled seeing the island decades ago but later avoided the area because navigation systems recorded it as an undersea reef.The Japan coastguard said that when the island was last surveyed in 1987 it protruded just 1.4 metres above the surface, leading experts to conclude that it had been eroded by wind and drift ice that form in the Sea of Okhotsk every winter.International law defines an island as a “naturally formed area of land, surrounded by water, which is above water at high tide”.The coastguard is to visit the area to determine the island’s fate. If it confirms that it has indeed disappeared, Japan’s EEZ will shrink, albeit by just half a kilometre.Japan isn’t the only country to have lost an island recently. A piece of the United States was wiped off the map after East Island, a remote spit in Hawaii, was washed away by Hurricane Walaka last month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c311f9124a0bc9be881be68efb15c03e08f9767/0_332_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1825a7b416db75171c41d4d13e4b1860","title":"pacific island to introduce world first reef toxic sunscreen ban","story":"From 2020, lotions containing any of 10 chemicals linked to coral bleaching will be outlawedThe tiny Pacific island nation of Palau will ban “reef-toxic” sunscreens from 2020 in what it claims is a world-first initiative to stop chemical pollution killing its famed corals.Palau, which lies in the north-west Pacific, east of the Philippines and directly north of Australia, is regarded as one of the world’s best ing destinations, but the government is concerned its popularity is coming at a cost.A spokesman for President Tommy Remengesau said there was scientific evidence that the chemicals found in most sunscreens are toxic to corals, even in minute doses.He said Palau’s e sites typically hosted about four boats an hour packed with tourists, leading to concerns a build-up of chemicals could see the reefs reach tipping point.“On any given day that equates to gallons of sunscreen going into the ocean in Palau’s famous e spots and snorkelling places,” he said.“We’re just looking at what we can do to prevent pollution getting into the environment.”From 1 January 2020 anyone importing or selling sunscreen containing any of 10 banned chemicals faces a $1,000 fine and tourists who bring banned sunscreen into the country will have it confiscated.Among the chemicals raising concerns are oxybenzone, octinoxate, octocrylene and some parabens. There are fears these chemicals make coral more susceptible to bleaching and could stunt the growth of baby corals and that sunscreen pollution can affect reefs up to 5km away.Experts say these chemicals can be found in roughly half of all suncreen brands.It is believed that the ban will be the first in the world to come into effect. The US state of Hawaii announced a ban on reef toxic sunscreens in May this year, but it does not come into force until 2021, a year after Palau’s.Palau has long been a pioneer in marine protection, introducing the world’s first shark sanctuary in 2009, a move that has been widely adopted.It has also banned commercial fishing from its waters and last year introduced the “Palau Pledge” requiring international visitors to sign a promise stamped into their passport that they will respect the environment.Craig Downs, executive director at the Haereticus Environmental Laboratory in Hawaii, said other nations would be watching Palau’s move closely.“It’s the first country to ban these chemicals from tourism. I think it’s great, they’re being proactive,” he said.“They don’t want to be like Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia, where they’ve had to shut down beaches. The coral reefs around those beaches have died.”Downs called on sunscreen manufacturers to “step up and innovate”, saying the chemicals used for UV protection had been largely unchanged for 50 years.He said there were some sunscreens containing zinc oxide and titanium dioxide that were not reef toxic but added: “The other alternative we’ve been pushing is sunwear – cover up, wear a sunshirt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Scene sealed off for technical examination as garda\u0026iacute appeal for informationPeople without private insurance but who earn too much for medical card losing outWoman convicted of manslaughter tells court of former partner\u0026rsquos violenceGarda\u0026iacute discovered 34-year-old David Boland from Nurney, lying on pavement outside shopEoin Berkley\u0026rsquos breach of court order ignored, says Dublin Rape Crisis CentreMinister objected to Catholic families event getting cash after removal of LGBT materialWoman sent as infant from Cork Mother and Baby Home to US calls for document accessGovernment aware that not looking at other sites might be an issue \u0026ndash ZapponePeace and rights advocacy group previously headed by Kofi Annan and Desmond TutuDepartment of Education finds 19 of 42 inspected schools fit to reopen without workHearing-damaged Gary Kearney \u0026lsquocan\u0026rsquot say enough good things\u0026rsquo about people at ChimeMan was crushed during loading of trailers on vessel at Dublin Port in June 2017Paul Wells snr pleading not guilty to murder but admits shooting and dismemberingNew book by David McWilliams explores transformation of Irish society since 1979Judge says obligation to manage grievances and difficulties with regime breached in caseAppeals centre on constitutional separation of powersEvent held for murdered journalist in Dublin amid calls for international actionGarda investigating breaking of 104 panes at St Catherine\u0026rsquos Church in TullamoreBrazilians living in Ireland express mix of relief and concern following election of far-right candidate"},{"url":null,"title":"halloween celebrations costumes around world pictures","story":"Around 2000 people gathered on the streets of Kawasaki, Japan, to watch the country\u0027s largest Halloween parade on Saturday 28th October.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

He said: We have to go through a long training period. We have to know what animals\u0027 muscles do, which parts of the animal are tough and which are tender, and whole lot more on top of that. I think many butchers will see the name vegetable butcher as a sleight on their skills. It\u0027s not just about chopping something up - greengrocers can do that and so can housewives. Butchers are highly skilled and go through years of training I suppose its a unique selling point and just like someone fees more comfortable having a barista make their coffee, they will like to have someone preparing their veg.Perhaps they\u0027ve got someone who really knows vegetables. I can see the merit in that and I wouldn\u0027t knock it, but they should be called vegetable craftsman, or something else, because the name butcher really does belong to meat.  However Amber Locke, a vegetable artist, defended vegetable butchers, arguing that many were in fact highly skilled and that vegetables were no longer just a side dish.She said: It\u0027s a useful way to describe a skill because people understand the word \u0027butcher\u0027. Generally people aren\u0027t very good at thinking at new ways of cutting up veg. Often when you\u0027re working with vegetables it can be very labour intensive, so this is a great time saving thing. But also you can apply a level of skill to anything, and many vegetable butchers are highly skilled. They know how to use every part of the vegetable so there\u0027s no waste.Met Police launch investigation into allegations of anti-Semitic hate crimes within Labour PartyWhy Tommy Robinson and the rise of the alt-right is provoking alarm in Australia US mid-term elections 2018 poll tracker: Who is predicted to win the Congress?Comment: Advice to Americans: if you\u0026#39re going to insult somewhere in Britain, at least get the name right David Cameron\u0026#39s rumoured return as foreign secretary in future raises eyebrows among MPsKim Jong-un’s health under scrutiny in South Korea - as questions raised over successorPolice hate crime focus is questioned as burglary and violence continue to riseDeborah McAndrew interview: ‘I still get greeted as \u0026#39Angie\u0026#39 all the time’\u0026#39Have sex, save lives\u0026#39: Zara Larsson fronts condom campaign to fight HIV The First, review: This mission to Mars failed to launchLabour front bencher spoke at party conference event claiming the war on drugs is collapsing\u0026#39 as her son faced drugs chargesBBC\u0026#39s Watership Down will replace Bright Eyes with Sam Smith song Comment: The police\u0026#39s job should be to prevent crime - not delve into its motivation  Comment: David Mundell won Common Fisheries Policy battle by speaking softly but carrying a big stickPolice revolt as senior officers defy Sajid Javid over push to focus on hate crimeComment: The Butte de Warlencourt: this bitterly contested mound is a memorial to both sides in the Somme battleFlash mob proposal at Waterloo stationComment: The Tories should learn from Trump that it\u0026#39s no longer just about \u0026#39the economy, stupid\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/11/01/TELEMMGLPICT000179523573_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqJOFPLyy_tlW1XZeapVO4-oTfaxFLFKTsddCrjfeRcj4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"advice americans going insult somewhere britain least get name","story":"Jaywick Sands before its American makeoverWhen I was 17, sitting on a bus on my way to school, I overheard two Americans complaining about the shabbiness of London. “It all looks so depressing!” exclaimed one, pointing at the faded, peeling shopfronts of my local high street. “Why can’t they just give it a lick of paint?”The fact that I can still remember the conversation shows how much it stung.

Within a few years, it would be worth more than $10 billion and would eventually peak above $300 billion – surpassing the market cap of the payments giant Visa.Yet despite this success, bitcoin and the thousands of cryptocurrencies that have since appeared are still largely a fringe technology, unable to truly break into the mainstream.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearWhile bitcoin has taken off and is seen as the leader of the cryptocurrency market, it’s been adopted by the few not the many, said Chakib Bouda, chief technology officer at US-based payments firm Rambus.Confusion amongst users has played a part, but arguably the biggest failings for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies over the past years lies with security, in the first six months of 2018 alone over $761 million bitcoin was stolen, with experts predicting that the amount stolen from exchanges will top $1.5 billion by the end of the year.The key to overcoming this issues, Bouda\u0026nbspsuggested, is keeping the private keys needed to access and use cryptocurrency funds both secure and easy-to-use.\u0026nbsp One way of doing this would be adopting technology used within the traditional financial sector to bring cryptocurrencies up to the levels of security and usability that people expect of a modern currency.Once this secure ecosystem is in place, it’s going to transform how many sceptics view bitcoin transactions, Bouda said. So whilst cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have been described as the ‘Wild West’ by the UK treasury, we expect in 10 years’ time, bitcoin will become mainstream and have a remarkably different reputation.If bitcoin is able to transform its reputation in this way, bitcoin could find its way into everyone\u0027s pockets through mobile wallets –achieving\u0026nbspmainstream adoption\u0026nbspin time for bitcoin\u0027s next\u0026nbspbirthday.It\u0027s a view shared by Iqbal Gandham, the UK managing director of the online trading platform eToro. The next decade could see bitcoin being accepted as the norm when it comes to money transfer and payments, he said. As with any startup idea, early days are always risky, but I feel these are now few and far between.Alternatively, if another cryptocurrency is able to become a safe and\u0026nbspconvenient payment method\u0026nbspbefore bitcoin developers implement the necessary technology, bitcoin\u0027s place as the world\u0027s most popular cryptocurrency could be usurped.This is the view of Nigel Green, founder and CEO of the deVere\u0026nbspGroup, a financial consultancy firm based in London. Mr Green suggested that bitcoin\u0027s influence will drastically reduce in the cryptocurrency sector, however the overall crypto market will expand by at least 5,000 per cent.“Bitcoin is what kickstarted the crypto revolution and it has changed the way the world handles money, makes transactions, does business, and manages assets, amongst other things, forever.\u0026nbsp It all began with bitcoin, Mr Green said.\u0026nbsp“However, whilst I don’t wish to rain on anyone’s parade, I believe that\u0026nbspbitcoin’s influence and dominance of the cryptocurrency sector will drastically reduce in its second decade.\u0026nbspThis is because as mass adoption of cryptocurrency grows, more and more digital assets will be launched – by organisations in both the private and the public sectors. This will increase competition for bitcoin and dent its market share.He continued: “In addition, it is likely that bitcoin will be hit by the superior technology, features, and problem-solutions, offered by existing and yet-to-be-released cryptocurrencies.”If the deVere\u0026nbspCEO\u0027s forecast is correct, the boost from\u0026nbspmajor institutional and retail investors will see the cryptocurrency market rocket towards\u0026nbspthe $20 trillion mark by 2028.Financial institutions and regulators, amongst others, understand that cryptocurrencies are the future of money, he concluded.\u0026nbsp“As such, the market will have grown beyond recognition when bitcoin celebrates its 20th anniversary.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But the Bank warned that conditions now were very different.\u0026nbsp“The current situation differs materially from that on the eve of the referendum,” said the Bank’s Governor Mark\u0026nbspCarney. “The economy is now broadly in balance, rather than in being material excess supply as it was then. Inflation is notably above target, not significantly below.”The Bank also stressed that\u0026nbspa no deal would “probably” cause another slump in the pound, pushing up domestic inflation and bolstering\u0026nbspthe case for borrowing costs to rise.After the referendum, sterling suffered a record one-day fall against the dollar.However, in a press conference, Mr Carney conceded that it would be difficult for the MPC to determine, in the circumstances of a chaotic Brexit, how much of the economic damage reflected a hit to economic supply (which would support the case for higher rates) and how much to demand (which would support a cut).The MPC, as universally expected by markets, left interest rates on hold at 0.75 per cent on Thursday.But it presented a relatively hawkish set of projections, saying slack had now fully disappeared from the UK economy and that inflation was set to be slightly above the official 2 per cent target, under current market interest rate expectations, by 2021.Markets are now pricing in the next rate hike\u0026nbspat the end of 2019 and another in\u0026nbspearly 2021.The Bank noted that average pay excluding bonuses in the third quarter of 2018 was up\u0026nbsp3.1 per cent year-on-year, higher than its expectation in August of 2.6 per cent.The latest\u0026nbspforecasts were also compiled before the government’s Budget on Monday. The increased public spending for the NHS next year and the cut in income taxes is likely to have a\u0026nbsppositive near-term impact on UK demand and therefore on inflationary pressures.The Bank predicts growth this year will be\u0026nbsp1.3 per cent, rising to 1.7 per cent in 2019 –\u0026nbspsimilar to its last report in August.“The MPC has indicated to markets that interest rates will need to rise at least three times in the next three years if a Brexit transition deal is signed off soon,” said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon.\u0026nbsp“Given that the MPC already thinks that the output gap has closed and excess demand will emerge in 2019, it will judge that it needs to accelerate its tightening plans to prevent the fiscal stimulus from fuelling inflation.”\u0026nbspYet this is all based on a smooth\u0026nbspBrexit and the UK entering a 21-month transition period, where it remains in the single market and customs union.The Bank presented other survey research showing that Brexit is the largest headwind to firms’ investment. Official data on business investment has also been weaker than it expected three months ago, consistent with rising concern over the possibility of no deal. The Bank also highlighted that traders have been increasing their bets on a large depreciation of sterling over the next six months.The Bank’s Governor, Mark Carney, has told the Treasury Select Committee that it will publish formal no-deal economic scenarios before MPs have their “meaningful vote” on any\u0026nbspBrexit deal the Government produces.Mr Carney reportedly told the cabinet earlier this year that its 2017 banking stress tests assumed a 33 per cent hit to house prices, which could be similar to the aftermath of a\u0026nbspno deal.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Previously Just Eat connected customers with restaurants that had their\u0026nbspown couriers.Just Eat expects full-year revenues to come in at the top end of its £740m to £770m forecast\u0026nbspafter jumping 41 per cent in the third quarter to £195m.Uber \u0027in talks to buy Deliveroo\u0027But profits are expected to be dented by investment for\u0026nbspLatin American expansion as well as increased competition. The London-based firm, which was founded in Copenhagen, now operates in 12 countries, including Mexico and Brazil.Earnings will be towards the lower end of its £165m to £185m range due to “investments in our dynamic LatAm\u0026nbspmarkets in addition to our delivery initiatives”, the company said.The results sent shares up 3.8 per cent on Thursday morning. The company’s valuation had suffered recently amid\u0026nbspspeculation\u0026nbspthat Uber is in talks to buy Deliveroo to create a beefed-up competitor in the rapidly expanding British takeaway market.While restaurant chains including Jamie’s Italian, Prezzo and Byron have closed scores of outlets this year, takeaways have cashed in.Growing demand for convenience food delivered to the door has seen the takeaway delivery market grow\u0026nbspfrom £2.4bn to £4.2bn in a decade.\u0026nbspMarket leader Just Eat continues to ride that wave, with orders in the three months to 30 September rising\u0026nbsp27 per cent to £54.7m. UK orders were up 16 per cent to £30.3m, which included its first ever weekend with more than one million orders.Just Eat chief executive Peter Plumb said: “The group has delivered another strong quarter as we helped our 97,000+ restaurant partners serve over 54 million takeaways to millions of hungry customers.“Our delivery expansion plans are on track, ensuring we give customers exactly what they want, and I\u0027m very pleased with the progress we are making against our strategic objectives.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But the Bank warned that conditions now were very different.\u0026nbsp“The current situation differs materially from that on the eve of the referendum,” said the Bank’s Governor Mark\u0026nbspCarney. “The economy is now broadly in balance, rather than in being material excess supply as it was then. Inflation is notably above target, not significantly below.”The Bank also stressed that\u0026nbspa no deal would “probably” cause another slump in the pound, pushing up domestic inflation and bolstering\u0026nbspthe case for borrowing costs to rise.After the referendum, sterling suffered a record one-day fall against the dollar.However, in a press conference, Mr Carney conceded that it would be difficult for the MPC to determine, in the circumstances of a chaotic Brexit, how much of the economic damage reflected a hit to economic supply (which would support the case for higher rates) and how much to demand (which would support a cut).The MPC, as universally expected by markets, left interest rates on hold at 0.75 per cent on Thursday.But it presented a relatively hawkish set of projections, saying slack had now fully disappeared from the UK economy and that inflation was set to be slightly above the official 2 per cent target, under current market interest rate expectations, by 2021.Markets are now pricing in the next rate hike\u0026nbspat the end of 2019 and another in\u0026nbspearly 2021.The Bank noted that average pay excluding bonuses in the third quarter of 2018 was up\u0026nbsp3.1 per cent year-on-year, higher than its expectation in August of 2.6 per cent.The latest\u0026nbspforecasts were also compiled before the government’s Budget on Monday. The increased public spending for the NHS next year and the cut in income taxes is likely to have a\u0026nbsppositive near-term impact on UK demand and therefore on inflationary pressures.The Bank predicts growth this year will be\u0026nbsp1.3 per cent, rising to 1.7 per cent in 2019 –\u0026nbspsimilar to its last report in August.“The MPC has indicated to markets that interest rates will need to rise at least three times in the next three years if a Brexit transition deal is signed off soon,” said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon.\u0026nbsp“Given that the MPC already thinks that the output gap has closed and excess demand will emerge in 2019, it will judge that it needs to accelerate its tightening plans to prevent the fiscal stimulus from fuelling inflation.”\u0026nbspYet this is all based on a smooth\u0026nbspBrexit and the UK entering a 21-month transition period, where it remains in the single market and customs union.The Bank presented other survey research showing that Brexit is the largest headwind to firms’ investment. Official data on business investment has also been weaker than it expected three months ago, consistent with rising concern over the possibility of no deal. The Bank also highlighted that traders have been increasing their bets on a large depreciation of sterling over the next six months.The Bank’s Governor, Mark Carney, has told the Treasury Select Committee that it will publish formal no-deal economic scenarios before MPs have their “meaningful vote” on any\u0026nbspBrexit deal the Government produces.Mr Carney reportedly told the cabinet earlier this year that its 2017 banking stress tests assumed a 33 per cent hit to house prices, which could be similar to the aftermath of a\u0026nbspno deal.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Christine Manby\u0026nbspshares a cup of tea\u0026nbspunderground with\u0026nbspthe free miners of\u0026nbspthe Forest of DeanClick to followThe IndependentThere are only seven working coal mines in the Forest of Dean and the average age of the free miners edges ever higherMy guide Iain Jamieson is applying mindfulness techniques to a situation I never thought to find myself in. It’s a Tuesday evening in October, deep in the Forest of Dean. It’s a clear night. The smell of autumn is in the air. Stars gaze down on woodland alive with animals unseen. Drinking tea made on a coal-burning stove in the middle of a small secret clearing, while the notorious local wild boar lurk nearby, feels like a big enough adventure for me.But now I’m at the bottom of Morse’s Level, a Victorian coal mine, crawling my way to the seam. For a while, the tunnel is high enough to stand in, then it shrinks away to two-thirds my height. I’ve been banging my head with alarming frequency. I’m not sure if I’m delirious from adrenaline or concussion. I don’t think I can fold myself any smaller but we’ve reached the entrance to a long shaft barely wider than the shoulders of man-mountain Iain. The shaft follows a sharp incline upwards. The seam is at the other end of it.Iain’s fellow miners Adam Taylor and Paul Baverstock have gone on ahead. Their helmet lamps illuminate the way as they look down on us. The dull brown sandstone walls, floor and ceiling are slick with moisture. The wooden posts lining the tunnel look suddenly insubstantial. Small stones skitter down the chute as the men shift position above. If this were a film, it would be the harbinger of a landslide.Ghosts of past mining disaster still haunt the Welsh valleys“It opens out at the top,” Adam tells me.\u0026nbspI’m beginning to understand that “opens out” is a relative term down here. I can see he is almost bent double. “Start by putting your left knee up on the ledge,” he suggests. “Then grab that post and pull yourself in.”“I can’t,” I say, collapsing on to my backside on the muddy clay floor.\u0026nbspI look back along it in the direction we came. I can’t see anything beyond the circle cast by my lamp. I certainly can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel.Iain, whose head almost touches the ceiling though we’re squatting like yogis, gets down on all fours. “You can stand on my back,” he says.The thought of using him as a footstool makes me feel ashamed and I make one last effort to haul myself into the shaft, channelling Shelley Winters facing the flooded engine room in\u0026nbspThe Poseidon Adventure. Grunting with the effort, I drag myself forwards. As I scramble up, another film scene flashes into my mind. The ghost girl climbing the walls of the well in\u0026nbspThe Ring Two, using her knees and elbows. It makes me move much faster.Created with Sketch.Free mining in the Forest of Dean Show all 22Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mike deep in the minePhil gets ready for a session in the mineIain, John and Rob work on the surfaceJohn adds hot water to the Assam teaIn the mine it’s wet and muddy most of the yearEdward, solid, six foot and broad, working undergroundTruggs (buckets) filled with coalCandle power: the original miners’ light sourceInside the workers’ hutIain and Adam grade the coalEveryone works together as a teamMike deep in the minePhil gets ready for a session in the mineIain, John and Rob work on the surfaceJohn adds hot water to the Assam teaIn the mine it’s wet and muddy most of the yearEdward, solid, six foot and broad, working undergroundTruggs (buckets) filled with coalCandle power: the original miners’ light sourceInside the workers’ hutIain and Adam grade the coalEveryone works together as a teamAs I suspected, there is no “opening out” at the top. I can’t sit up. The ceiling is horribly close and looks bloody heavy. But Adam and Paul have prepared a special treat for me. A lump of coal stands proud of the seam. Everything around it is already chipped away so that it will fall with one good whack. Paul hands me a pick.“Give it some welly.” I\u0026nbspgive it some serious welly but the only thing that happens is I get a shower of cold wet coal chips in the face. I drop an F-bomb.“She speaks French,” someone observes.\u0026nbspI speak some more French until the chunk finally falls at my feet. I can find nothing but more expletives to describe the delight of it.“There you are,” says Iain. “That coal you’re holding hasn’t been seen for millions of years. Three hundred million years. And more people have stood on the top of Everest than have been down here and seen this.”He reminds me to look around. This is a view I may not see again. I take a proper look at the seam, 50 centimetres thick, glittering darkly. It’s as strange and wondrous as any mountaintop. The lump of coal I’ve liberated is the size and shape of a travel iron and jagged like a flint. I’m taking it home.\u0026nbspThen Adam tells me how we’re going to get back to the surface. He points out our exit. “Stick both your arms through first, like you’re ing.”Looking at an opening barely bigger than the hole at the centre of a loo seat, I see my own personal Everest may still be ahead of me.\u0026nbspThe Forest of Dean coalfield, which lies beneath the Forest of Dean,\u0026nbspnestled between the rivers Severn and Wye, is one of Britain’s smallest coalfields. It is\u0026nbspunique\u0026nbspfor the practice of free mining, which is vastly different to industrial mining. The free\u0026nbspmining of coal, stone and iron ore in the forest region predates the Romans it\u0026nbspis a practice that is deeply tied to place, and requires\u0026nbspa specialist knowledge of the land and its archaeology.Free mining originated in the reign of Edward I. In the 13th\u0026nbspcentury, miners played an important part in many of Edward’s military campaigns. After a hundred men from the forest helped end the siege of Berwick-upon-Tweed by undermining the castle with their tunnelling, Edward rewarded them with “free mining” status, bestowing upon them the right to mine anywhere in the forest (except beneath churchyards, orchards and gardens).To become a free miner, you had to be born within the St Briavels Hundred (pronounced St Brevels), the boundaries of which roughly corresponded to the boundaries of the forest itself. You had to be male, be over 21, and to have worked in someone else’s mine for a year and a day. You could then apply to the crown’s representative, the deputy gaveller (perhaps a corruption of “gale giver”), to take out what is known as a “gale”. According to a document dated 1673, a gale was defined thus: “The miner shall have as much space to work and store his materials as he can throw a stone.”Mining has long been at the heart of the Forest of Dean’s industry. Not just coal but iron ore, stone and ochre. By the 19th century, there were more Foresters working underground than above it. There’s even a theory that the impenetrable Forest accent has its origins in the mine, from when candles were still the only light source. How do you carry a candle when you need both hands free to crawl through a tiny shaft or chip away at a seam? The solution? A sticky and a nelly. A sticky was, quite literally, a stick. The nelly was a piece of clay moulded into a candleholder at the end of that stick, which the miner would then hold in the corner of his mouth to light the coal face as he worked. Try saying anything while holding a stick in the corner of your mouth. You’re talking Forest of Dean.Half a millennium after Edward\u0026nbspI,\u0026nbspwhen the Industrial Revolution led to an increased demand for iron and coal, the free miners came into conflict with powerful outside mining interests eager to exploit the forest’s reserves. To protect the miners, the Dean Forest (Mines) Act of 1838, restated the free mining rules. That same year, free miner George Morse, took out the gale that would become Morse’s Level.Today, Morse’s Level and its sister mine, Wallsend, are headed up by Mike Howell and Phil Schwarz, both Foresters born and bred. Phil’s grandfather and great-grandfather were both miners. Mike also comes from a mining family. His father was deputy gaveller.\u0026nbspHis son Daniel currently holds the role.\u0026nbspMike and Phil, both white-haired and now in their sixties, were school friends and caving buddies.\u0026nbspThey didn’t follow their forefathers straight into mining but took it up as hobby in the 1970s. They took over Morse’s Level – where they had volunteered – in 1978. “You could call it a management buyout,” Mike says. They went to mining college to learn about safety and explosives and get their deputies’ papers.All the men who work Morse’s Level and Wallsend today are volunteers. Their day jobs vary widely. Paul is an engineer, specialising in the removal of asbestos. He’s worked all over the world and has a hair-rising collection of stories about asbestos found in public places. Ed Morgan Dyer, who hails from the Welsh Valleys, is a cobbler. With an extravagant Edwardian-style moustache and an Australian miner’s hat, he certainly looks the part. Rob Rutsch maintains industrial printers for Xerox. Adam is an accountant. Like Mike and Phil, several of the men were cavers before they became miners. Paul is a member of the Gloucestershire Cave Rescue Group. What they all have in common is that after one trip down a mine they were hooked by the adrenaline and the weird magic of the coal seamThe men come to the mine on Tuesday evenings and all day on Saturdays. “When the missus allows.” On this particular Tuesday evening, back at Wallsend, the operational centre – AKA where the tea is made – there’s a cart full of coal ready to come to the surface.\u0026nbspThe men are proud of their new grading machine, rescued from a disused mine and refurbished and reassembled with care. A generator is fired up and a winch pulls the full cart out of the mine to a platform above the grader. John Smith and Adam stand at the top, ready to receive it.The miners don ear defenders and gather round. At the top, John and Adam scoop buckets from the cart. At the bottom, the others pluck bigger pieces from the belt before they can be shaken smaller. The rattling makes conversation impossible. Everyone concentrates hard on the job for the few noisy minutes it takes to empty the cart. At the end, the coal is separated into four grades. From the prized “lumpy” through “peas” to the very smallest parts, hardly more than dust, which could be pressed into briquettes. The miners are looking into the possibility of buying a machine to do just that.With the coal sorted, it’s time for tea. It doesn’t take long for the kettle to boil on the old stove in the hut. “This is steam coal,” Phil explains. “The kind they used in the trains. It gets so hot it can melt an iron grate.” An iron grate, buckled as though it were plastic, is presented as evidence.The tea is pure Assam. “Tesco’s Finest,” Adam points out, as he arranges the pristine mugs on a table in the open air.\u0026nbspTonight there’s homemade cake to go with the biscuits and the giant marshmallows that are a regular feature of teatime at Wallsend. On Saturdays, the day is broken with a run to the local chip shop for lunch. The jokes are gentle. Paul arrived early tonight. He used the opportunity to creep up on John, who was quietly mending a wall further up the hill, and impersonate a wild boar to frighten him.“I knew it was him all along,” John protests. \u0026nbspNobody wants to meet a real wild boar in the dark. Since a handful were illegally released into the forest in the 1990s, followed by another 60 in 2004, their number has swollen to more than a thousand. Earlier this year, a dog walker had the tip of his finger bitten off in a particularly unfortunate boar encounter. Everyone would prefer to see the otters, which Paul is certain have infiltrated the tunnels at Morse’s Level. He’s seen footprints in the mud underground. They might have come in via the culvert that occasionally floods the mine.\u0026nbspFrom boars to Brexit. The Forest of Dean voted “out” in the 2016 EU referendum. No one here was surprised. The perception of some locals is that EU immigration without a commensurate increase in funding for services has hit the forest hard. Paul describes how his wife waited four weeks to see a GP. He doesn’t blame EU migrants though. They’re only coming to work. They’re contributing too.Adam is pro-Brexit. He believes that EU tariffs keep the brakes on British business. He sees the evidence of it in his work in finance. Whatever they think of Adam’s view on trade tariffs, everyone agrees that the Brexit negotiations are a shambles.\u0026nbsp“No one over 65 should have been allowed to vote,” says Paul. One of the older guys at the mine tonight, Rob Rutsch, agrees. “It’s not our future that’s at stake,” he says. “It’s not going to affect us in the same way as it is the young people.”“Let’s talk about something else,” someone suggests. The conversation moves to organ transplantation and deemed consent. Once again, opinion is split. Paul thinks the system should remain as it is, with people happy to be donors opting in. Iain is for opt out.“When you’re dead, whatever it is that makes you you is gone,” he says.Inside the world\u0027s most beautiful coal mineDo they ever worry about dying in the mine? I wonder. I know I did, down there in the dark and the wet, knowing that if something happened, even if we got back to the surface, we were miles from the nearest town down a road that nobody drives unless they have to.Phil assures me there’s no need to worry. In the long history of the mines at Morse’s Level and Wallsend, only two people have been killed. “Hundreds of years ago.” Though Phil then recalls a recent nasty rock fall that completely blocked a tunnel the men had been working only hours before. “If it had happened while we were in there…” Then there’s the danger of flooding. And\u0026nbspblack damp.“Which isn’t damp at all,” Phil explains. “It comes from\u0026nbspdampf, the German word for vapour.” Phil’s father is Austrian.\u0026nbspBlack damp is an excess of carbon dioxide and nitrogen, which reduces the available oxygen in the air. It’s caused by poor ventilation and is a particular problem in mines that have lain unused for any length of time. Coal exposed to air begins to absorb oxygen. How do you know if you’ve got black damp? You can’t see it. You can’t smell it.There must be fancy alarms for it now, I suggest. Iain shows me the modern-day free miner’s method for staying safe. It’s remarkably low-tech. “You carry a candle,” he says. “So long as the flame stays good, you’re OK. It’s the perfect system. No batteries to run out.”Phil explains the other official safety measures. The mines are regularly visited by official inspectors. Meanwhile, in the hut is a panel from which dangle fobs carved with the names of every miner. “You’re supposed to move your fob from one end of the board to the other, to show that you’re down the mine so no one gets left behind. They’re always forgetting,” Phil tuts.\u0026nbspAbove the safety board, a garish effigy of Thatcher hangs by her neck from a nail.The conversation turns to other visitors. In the summer, a group of German miners dropped by. They brought German biscuits and an elaborate silver-headed ceremonial pick. A return visit is planned for next year. More recently, a descendant of George Morse came to the mine. His great-great-great granddaughter Makere Stewart-Harawira is a New Zealander of Forest, Scottish and Māori descent, currently living in Canada. When she visited the forest to find out more about her ancestry, the miners took her down to the seam at Morse’s’ Level.“She was a bit cagey about what it is she does,” says Phil. “Then we found out she’s a professor of climate change.”Specifically, she’s professor of indigenous, environmental and global studies,\u0026nbspsocial justice and international studies in education specialisation at the University of Alberta where her current area of research is described as “Intersections of Sustainability. Collaborative Research Network on Water Governance, Climate Change and Traditional Communities”.“She got emotional when she saw the mine though,” says Phil.It’s easy to understand why. The history in this place is palpable. At Wallsend, 200 miners once worked the seam. Not just men but women and children too. Many of the shafts were so small, they could only have been worked by kids. Twelve-hour days. Six days a week.\u0026nbspPaul talks about finding the print of a hobnail boot in a disused level and next to it a footprint. A bare footprint. A\u0026nbspchild’s\u0026nbspfootprint. Child labour was used extensively until it was made illegal in 1842. Even then, an 11-year-old was still counted as an adult. There were pit ponies at Wallsend too.“We’ve got a list of their names,” says Adam. “From when the mine was shut and they came up for auction. Some of them lived their whole lives underground.” There’s a moment of quiet. Half an hour on Morse’s Level was enough to leave me delirious. The idea of a lifetime. Never seeing the sun…It’s getting late. Adam fills a washing up bowl with more hot water. “Don’t forget your eggs,” he says, as other miners wash their hands and faces and get ready to go home. Adam and his wife keep rescue hens. They’re prolific layers. “I’m sick of eggs,” he says. The other miners have all come prepared with empty egg boxes to exchange for a fresh half dozen. Everyone assures me that the eggs are delicious and I’m thrilled to receive a box of my own.“Still got the shit on them though,” someone complains. “Where’s the swear box?” another miner asks.I think I owe the swear box more money than anyone else here tonight. There’s an underlying respect and old-fashioned gentleness in the way the men talk to each other, perhaps born of the fact that underground each man holds the other men’s lives in his hands. This is a true gentleman\u0027s club, I suggest. “More like Last of the Summer Mine,” says Iain.Later, in a nearby pub, Mike Howell expresses his concerns for the future. Morse’s Level and Wallsend have weathered centuries of change. The 1838 act that restated the free miners’ rights also allowed them to sell their gales to persons other than other free miners. It saw major industry swoop on the forest and introduce deep mining. By the 1920s, many of those mines were already deemed too expensive to be viable. The last deep mine was closed in 1965.When Labour nationalised coal in 1947, the rights of the free miners were recognised with a simple token licence system but with privatisation in 1994, the Coal Authority insisted that the free miners needed planning permission and tried to impose a new system that would have cost £2,000 per mine. With the help of the Forestry Commission and the deputy gaveller, the licence amount was reduced to £50 in 1997. All the same, the mines continued to close.Today there are only seven working coal mines in the Forest of Dean. The average age of the free miners edges ever higher. Meanwhile, the number of people eligible to take out a gale is falling as it gets harder to be born in the right place. The local maternity unit has been closed down and Mike talks of local women being “bullied” into having their babies at Gloucester Royal Hospital, some 15 miles away. In any case it seems the forest’s sons don’t wish to follow their fathers underground and though in 2010 Elaine Morman won the right to become the first female free miner (she mines ochre), she remains in a minority of one.The latest challenge to the centuries-old tradition isn’t financial or demographic. It’s environmental. Defra,\u0026nbspthe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, is set to publish a comprehensive clean air strategy to further tackle air pollution, in anticipation of a new Clean Air Act. In preparation, Defra\u0026nbspseeks to “understand the impact of phasing out the sale of the most polluting mineral fuels, such as bituminous house coal”.Mike shows me an email he’s written to Defra, asking how a new Clean Air Act would impact the free miners in particular. “The Forest of Dean free miners’ acts and rights must be considered in any new arrangement... The coal we dig is not smokeless, and if we have no market for our coal then our ancient rights and the value of our coal reserves will be destroyed.“These reserves for each mine are valued at several million pounds per gale and this must be considered in any future government legislation. The protection of our rights is very important from a historical and monetary point of view.”Mike has never seen a penny of profit from Morse’s Level or Wallsend. “I do this for a couple of bags of coal a year,” he says.“If someone would just engage their brain about this act and see that there are still country communities which rely on coal. We’re not making as much pollution as 50 London taxis still running on diesel or one shipload of smokeless fuel coming from overseas. There are no air miles on our coal. They’re going to destroy our heritage for so little gain.”We’re not making as much pollution as 50 London taxis still running on diesel or one shipload of smokeless fuel coming from overseas. There are no air miles on our coalAt the very height of its output at the beginning of the 20th century, the Forest of Dean coalfield produced a million tonnes a year (out of a UK total of about 300 million). These days, Mike estimates that the total output of all the mines in the Forest is less than 500 tons a year. Phil has calculated that equates to 0.0000067 per cent of the world total.Defra\u0026nbsphas yet to respond.As the night draws to a close, Phil pulls out his iPad to look through his photographs of the mine through the years. The wifi in the pub is spotty but Phil eventually finds photographs of the auction catalogue with the list of names of the last pit ponies to have worked Wallsend. \u0026nbsp“Polly. Black Dolly. Kit. Beauty. Dolly. Spider. Darkey. Bessie. Mousey…”What became of them? I wonder. Did they go straight to another pit or did the auction mark the beginning of a better life above ground?\u0026nbspPhil brings up more photographs of the mine in its heyday. No Assam. No marshmallows. The faces of these miners are pinched and tired.\u0026nbsp“Me going down the mines when I don’t have to do it for a living,” Phil muses as the barman calls last orders. “My grandfather must be rolling in his grave.”Next day, the forest I’ve known since I was a child growing up in nearby Gloucester looks different. There’s a definite wisp of coal smoke in the air. But for how much longer? I wonder if free mining in the forest is facing an inevitable end. It’s simply out of time.Beavers returned to Forest of Dean after 400 years How South Wales is learning from community forests in ScotlandInside the world\u0027s most beautiful coal mineInterestingly, Makere Stewart-Harawira thinks not. In an email she told me: “My work, my research, my passion is about water, energy and the climate catastrophe that we are now in... And the worst culprit is coal… But here is what I know...\u0026nbsp“Free mining is also a small, local economy that helps maintain some of the families in the Forest of Dean today... There are ways of reducing the carbon emissions that are emitted in the local burning of these coals. Research regarding these methods, some of which involve processes for which the patents are now freely available… could be funded by the government as part of its commitment to carbon emission reduction as well as its commitment to supporting small local economies. The free mining activities of the Forest of Dean could potentially become one model for how we negotiate the tension between carbon emission reduction and the need to support local, autonomous economies. I’m passionate about helping to explore and promote that in any way that I can.”\u0026nbspI believe Professor Stewart-Harawira is right. The mines and the forest itself have a unique symbiotic relationship. This volunteer mining thing is not just “Last of the Summer Mine” as Iain had joked.\u0026nbspTo understand what it really means to mine the coal that has fired centuries of change is humbling. It’s a heritage worth honouring. The miners of Morse’s Level and Wallsend are preserving not only a tradition but also a genuine emotional connection to the people who went before them and to the very land itself. I think Phil’s miner grandfather would have been proud of him for that.Forest of Deanrights to mineShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

What’s more, it has done it with mostly “B”\u0026nbspcharacters.\u0026nbspThe comic book publisher’s prior practice had been to licence its top properties to others. This is how Sony got Spider-Man, and Venom, and 21st Century Fox got the X-Men suite of characters, and the Fantastic Four.\u0026nbspDespite this, not since Captain America, back in 2011, has an MCU film failed to gross more than $500m globally. Six have broken the $1bn barrier and Avengers: Infinity War raked in twice that.\u0026nbspCritics sometimes grouse about the popularity of superhero movies, and the stranglehold they hold over multiplex screen space and the global box office, but they’ve been remarkably kind to the MCU’s output when it comes to their reviews.\u0026nbspAll its movies have been certified fresh by review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with scores ranging from 66 per cent (Thor: The Dark World) to 97 per cent (Black Panther), an achievement unmatched by any other major franchise.\u0026nbspIf you find Tomatoes’ binary “freshrotten” system too simplistic, how about Metacritic? It puts together a weighted average of critics’ reviews to create a “Metascore”, and also separates films into five bands (two red, one amber, two green).\u0026nbspAll but three of Marvel’s films boast a green, “generally favourable”\u0026nbspor better rating, with Black Panther’s 88 again at the top (indicating “universal acclaim”).\u0026nbspIt just wouldn’t do to have the Best Film Oscar going to a superhero flick, so the Academy has created a gong for “Outstanding Achievement in Popular Film”. It’s already been dubbed the Black Panther award.\u0026nbspThe Dark World again brings up the rear, its score of 54 rating puts its reviews into the “mixed or average”\u0026nbspband.\u0026nbspBut compare that with rival franchises. That 54 low point is still better than any of the three Fox Fantastic Four filmsWarner Bros has produced five movies in the much younger DC extended universe, just one of which (Wonder Woman) has garnered “universal acclaim”\u0026nbspwhile being “certified fresh”. They’ve all grossed more than $500m (I’m charitably excluding the disastrous Green Lantern here, which everyone tries to forget about) but not one has breached the $1bn barrier. “Troubled”\u0026nbspis a word that is frequently applied to the project.\u0026nbspDeadpool’ has been\u0026nbspFox’s best grossing superhero flick so farAlthough Fox’s 11-strong X-Men slate has produced several critical hits, it has still turned in three “certified rotten”\u0026nbspduds alongside them.\u0026nbspIts best gross of $783m, meanwhile, came courtesy of the R-\u0026nbspor 15-rated Deadpool, something no one really expected upon the delightfully anarchic movie’s release.\u0026nbspIt should be noted that I’m not allowing for inflation here, and the first X-Men film was released back in 2000, but even had I done so, the X-movies would struggle to hold a candle to the MCU. \u0026nbspThe critics who have speculated (plaintively sometimes) about superhero fatigue setting in got some ammunition courtesy of the (relatively) disappointing opening for Antman \u0026amp The Wasp.\u0026nbspBut that film has now grossed in excess of $100m more than the franchise’s first outing at $620m and counting, which isn’t too shabby for a second tier franchise with a light (for a superhero flick) production and marketing budget.\u0026nbsp“Never bet against Marvel,” said Forbes, reporting on the numbers. And given all that, why would you?In a word, gravity. It has even started to weigh on even a Star Wars franchise that managed to sell three bad movies to an adoring public and looked all but bomb proof until audiences shrugged their shoulders at Solo: A Star Wars Story, which now, shockingly, looks set for a loss despite enjoying mostly positive reviews.\u0026nbspSo Marvel’s job isn’t going to get an easier.\u0026nbspBut it still has cards it can play...This one is blindingly, glaringly obvious. Launching the MCU with mostly middling characters, in terms of public perception, was a big risk. Marvel then doubled down by producing some highly successful films starring heroes that were largely unknown outside of the comic buying public such as Antman, the s, even Dr Strange.Yet in spite, or perhaps because of, a willingness to roll the dice, even on a superhero who’s main power is shrinking in a movie featuring a fight on a Thomas the Tank Engine toy railway that results in Thomas suddenly growing to giant size and exploding out of a house, Marvel has proved remarkably conservative with respect to its leads.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.33 Superhero films set for release between 2016 and 2020 Show all 34Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Release date: 6 May 2016.

The film already has an incredible cast, including Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachael McAdams and Tilda Swinton. Release date: 20 February 2017.

However, this time it is part of the MCU, with Tom Holland as the titular character, and a heavily rumoured cameo by Iron Man could be in the pipeline. We can dream.Release date: 6 October 2017. In a strange announcement, Fox decided to withhold the release of Gambit until a future, as-yet unannounced date, which could be here, or this could be a completely separate project. Many suspect Deadpool 2 could nicely fit here, Fox capitalising on the success of the first film.Release date: 3 November 2017.

Peyton Reed will be back to direct this surprise sequel to one of the better received MCU films. While the name is ridiculous, at least Marvel are finally having a leading female superhero.

Expect a big finish with at least a few planets being destroyed.Release date: 14 June 2019. Soon after the Infinity War story reaches its conclusion, so will the Justice League’s. Not much is known, except Darkseid will likely be the villain for at least one of the parts.Release date: 12 July 2019. The concept of Inhumans (or Marvel’s mutants) has already been introduced in TV, through Marvel’s Agents of Shield, yet the film is expected to introduce the Royal Family who have yet to be seen in the show.Release date: 3 April 2020.

As well as Spider-Man or s of the Galaxy sequels, a Doctor Strange or Black Panther one could fit in nicely here. Or perhaps Black Widow may finally get the solo-film she deserves.Release date: 6 November 2020. Some speculators also think a Blade film could fit in here, marking over 20 years since the first Blade.

When this is due, no one is quite sure but expect it sooner rather than later if Batman v Superman is a success. Release date: TBA (rumoured 2017). A sequel to Suicide Squad is expected to come in 2017 according to recent reports, but nothing has been confirmed. If the first is successful, it should come as no surprise for Warner Bros to rearrange their schedule to fit in this surefire hit.Release date: TBA. This is an odd one, as it has been confirmed Sony are wanting to release a Venom film completely unrelated to the upcoming Spider-Man reboot.

It would have been in the top 10 were it a Marvel outing.\u0026nbspLupita Nyong’o as Nakia\u0026nbspand Letitia Wright as Shuri\u0026nbspin ‘Black Panther’ (Marvel StudiosDisney)There are welcome signs that this is changing. Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel is slated to play a big role in the MCU’s future. Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow also looks like she’s finally going to get a solo outing, although her fans might have to wait a while. The next s outing is rumoured to focus not on\u0026nbspChris Pratt’s Peter Quill, but\u0026nbspmore on the character of Gamora, played by Zoe Saldana, who is of Domican and Puerto Rican descent but is bright green in the films.\u0026nbspApart from the fact that this is the right thing to do, a more erse roster ought to be good for the finances.\u0026nbspLet’s face it, if you’re going to shell out more than $200m in production costs, plus the same again (at least) for the marketing, you need a global audience. The domestic gross just won’t cut it.\u0026nbspTories, Ukipers and Trumpkins can cry about all they want, but the world is a pretty erse place. DC’s Suicide Squad provides another example of how lucrative ersity can be. It had Will Smith at the head of multi-racial cast, with Viola Davis as one of the main antagonists.\u0026nbspDespite the disdain of the critics, the film pulled in a more than healthy $750m, and might have done better had it secured a release in China and not been hampered by a 15 rating in countries like Britain and Australia. Deadline Hollywood nonetheless ranked it as the tenth most profitable movie of 2016. ‘Nuff said.\u0026nbspIt’s not that they’ve been, well, bad. But the MCU’s villains mostly haven’t been particularly memorable, at least not until recently.\u0026nbspIt might be asking a lot to find something that rivals the late Heath Ledger’s Oscar-winning turn as The Joker in Batman: The Dark Knight. That sets a very high bar.\u0026nbspBut there’s room for improvement. Beyond Tom Hiddleston’s multiple outings as Loki, I struggle to recall all that much about the others, having seen every MCU film on multiple occasions. They do rather merge into one another.\u0026nbspBut there are signs that that too is changing for the better.\u0026nbspJosh Brolin’s Thanos provides a black hole for the dizzying array of characters featured in Avengers: Infinity War to orbit, and helps bring together what might otherwise have served as a rather aimless series of spectacles.\u0026nbspA study in understated menace, what makes him stand out is his utter conviction that his genocidal vision is right and moral, by contrast to the nihilist portrayed in the comics.Tennant gets his evil on as Kilgrave in ’Jessica Jones’ (Netflix)Then there is the charismatic revolutionary Killmonger (Michael B Jordan). There are many, myself included, who found themselves rooting for him as much as for the Black Panther he faced off against.\u0026nbspOnly his methods, and carelessness towards the civilians getting in his way, make him a villain.This is a good sign, but Marvel’s going to need more multi-faceted and layered baddies if it’s going to counter the feeling of, oh, I see, another superhero flick. I dunno, fancy a game of Fortnite?\u0026nbspPS: If Marvel has any sense it will find a way to resurrect David Tennant’s Kilgrave, who made the first season of Netflix’s Jessica Jones so compelling. His cameos also livened up the disappointing second outing. Now there’s a truly memorable villain. Which brings us neatly to...I’m probably on a hiding to nothing with this one – Marvel Studio’s president Kevin Feige, who deserves much of the credit for the monster that’s been created, has been notably lukewarm about the prospect of bringing it\u0026nbspto the silver screen. Marvel has multiple properties, hosted by multiple broadcasters.\u0026nbspABC’s Agents of Shield started out shadowing the films. The show’s lead character Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) appeared in the first Avengers movie, Thor and two of Iron Man’s three outings. He will show up in the 1990s set Captain Marvel too. Samuel L Jackson, who plays Nick Fury in the movies, also turned up in the show a couple of times.\u0026nbspBut it went on to erge and one of its stars, Chloe Bennet, notably expressed her frustration at the films’ failure to acknowledge the show.\u0026nbspYou could be forgiven for thinking that the mostly successful Netflix series featuring “street”\u0026nbspheroes trying to save their neighbourhoods rather than the galaxy, are set in an entirely different universe.\u0026nbspThey’re grimy, 15 rated, and violent. That violence feels much more real than what is depicted in the films. When people get hit they get hurt. They end up in hospitals. Rosario Dawson’s Night Nurse sometimes has to patch them up.\u0026nbspDeadpool showed how successful taking a 180 degree turn can be. It was produced for just $58m, about a quarter of what it costs to get a top line superhero flick done, and there were no 3D\u0026nbspcameras around on set either.\u0026nbspThe global\u0026nbspgross of the wildly successful ‘Spider-Man: Homecoming’The Defenders, in which four of the Netflix stars teamed up for a mini series that, sadly, added up to less than the sum of its parts, occasionally gets mentioned as a possibility for a film, albeit a distant one.\u0026nbspPerhaps that will change if superhero fatigue starts to set in and the studio has to think about something genuinely different to tickle audiences’ palates. Disney’s own streaming ambitions add a further ingredient to the TVfilm crossover stew. \u0026nbspThis is a card the studio really shouldn’t play. When story takes a back seat to spectacle, the film suffers. Warner’s first DC Universe outing, Man of Steel, was ruined by director Zack Snyder indulging in a spectacle laden battle between Superman and General Zod, which smashed up the city of polis. It was jarring –\u0026nbspthe comic book character would have done his damnedest to protect the city –\u0026nbspbut worse still, it was kind of boring.\u0026nbspThe first trailer for Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel is hereRuby Rose to star as lesbian superhero Batwoman in new seriesSupergirl to get television’s first ever transgender superheroThe same is true of X-Men: Age of Apocalypse. The hotly anticipated return of Brian Singer, who got the franchise rolling with the critically acclaimed first outing, also majored on spectacle, and the resultant film ending up a disappointing mess after an encouraging start. Story rules. Write that out 10,000 times. Then write it out again. \u0026nbspIf superhero fatigue really does start to set in, there’s always the X-Men – which will be under Disney’s control if and when the entertainment behemoth’s deal to buy a big chunk of Rupert Murdoch’s Fox empire makes it past America’s anti-trust watchdogs.\u0026nbspIf you bring the mutants into the MCU, and then have them fight a new team of Avengers, like they did in the widely successful Avengers v\u0026nbspX-Men comic book event, you’ll likely have another $2bn beast on your hands, or even multiple such creatures.\u0026nbspGeekdom is positively drooling at the mere thought of such an event.

It used the wizard symbol to represent Sir\u0026nbspIan McKellen\u0027s character Gandalf, as well as the diamond ring emoji to represent the infamous piece of jewellery that gave its name to the franchise.The three movies debuted on Netflix on Thursday, much to the excitement of fans looking to immerse themselves again in the universe first created by JRR Tolkien in his fantasy series.The Fellowship of the Ring, the first instalment of Peter Jackson\u0027s big screen adaptation, came out in 2001. It stars Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins, the hobbit who inherits the malevolent One Ring and sets out to destroy it, Sean Astin as Frodo\u0027s loyal companion Sam, and Viggo\u0026nbspMortensen\u0026nbspas Aragorn.

Beset by financial issues, the production ultimately stretched to 1976 and soon gained industry-wide notoriety, never to be completed or released. 413 They\u0027ll Love Me When I\u0027m Dead - out on 2 NovemberOscar-winning director Morgan Neville (20 Feet from Stardom) tells the provocative story of legendary director Orson Welles during the final 15 years of his life.

Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts.Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein’s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 1340 Lord of the Flies, William GoldingAnyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding’s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile.The protagonist of Rushdie’s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He’s also born with superpowers, and he’s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India’s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities.You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature’s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the “small, plain” Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplombThis is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829–32. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash isions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch.An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you’ve “seen something nasty in the woodshed,” just shut the door.Dedicated to the “Sixty Million and more” Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America’s history.Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles’s entire relationship with Sebastian’s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts…) and you’re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts.Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein’s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 1340 Lord of the Flies, William GoldingAnyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding’s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile.The protagonist of Rushdie’s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He’s also born with superpowers, and he’s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India’s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities.You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature’s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the “small, plain” Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplombThis is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829–32. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash isions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch.An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you’ve “seen something nasty in the woodshed,” just shut the door.Dedicated to the “Sixty Million and more” Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America’s history.Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles’s entire relationship with Sebastian’s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts…) and you’re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker.

Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.Jack Reacher author Child said of the chosen charity: “Torture victims are the most damaged and demoralised people among us, so any move to embrace, console and help them is to be applauded and supported.”The author added that the winning bidder would name a character set to\u0026nbspappear alongside Child’s fictional maverick – played by Tom Cruise on the big screen – in the\u0026nbspupcoming novel Blue Moon, due out next year.The charity, which takes place on the 15 November under the name Freedom: Not Just Another Word, will also auction off a signed screenplay donated by Dame Helen Mirren. There’s also the chance to commission a work by Sir\u0026nbspQuentin Blake and to have a portrait done by\u0026nbspformer children’s laureate Chris Riddell.Opening bids for character names are placed at £150 and £250 but are expected to exceed these amounts by some way. Last year, the highest bid was £2,500 to name a character in Ian McEwan’s next book.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I got kicked out (of school), not for anything crazy, he said.

Enough to entrap the whole human body. It was a spontaneous attack actually.It was just some banter, as you do. It sounds crazy but it was just jokes.Stormzy\u0026nbspadmitted that he had got in trouble prior to the chair incident, resulting in his removal from the school.It was like the 100th strike, you don\u0027t get kicked out for putting chairs on someone, he added.The rapper referred to his younger self as just a little s*** and said his mother was left fuming.Created with Sketch. Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Todd Haynes followed his glam rock pseudo-biopic Velvet Goldmine (1998) with this inventive exploration of the many sides of Bob Dylan. Six actors – Cate Blanchett, Heath Ledger, Christian Bale and Ben Whishaw among them – portrayed Dylan at different stages of his career as part of an appropriately freewheelin’ approach to narrative.To convince director Oliver Stone to give him the part of Jim Morrison, Val Kilmer undertook hours of extensive research into his hero, learning 50 songs to mimic his singing voice. When the surviving members of the Doors assembled to hear a recording of Kilmer, none could tell which was the impersonation and which the real Morrison. The Doors was not loved by all but the great Kyle MacLachlan and Meg Ryan were memorable in supporting roles as keyboardist Ray Manzarek and Morrison\u0027s girlfriend Pamela Courson respectively. Gary Oldman was a dead-ringer for the late Sex Pistols guitarist Sid Vicious in director Alex Cox’s appropriately grotty account of the punk star’s pointless death from heroin following the overdose of his girlfriend Nancy Spungen (Chloe Webb) in New York’s Hotel Chelsea. Bandmate Johnny Rotten was predictably dismissive of the project but understandably annoyed that Joe Strummer of The Clash had been consulted but not him.410 7. Get on Up (2014)Like Rami Malek, Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman faced a seemingly impossible task in portraying soul superstar James Brown, “Mr Dynamite” himself. He acquitted himself well, however, in a film that largely conformed to genre formula but offered strength in depth with Dan Aykroyd, Viola Davis, Lennie James and Octavia Spencer among the supporting cast.510 6. What’s Love Got to Do with It? (1993)Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne were superbly matched as Tina and Ike Turner in Brian Gibson’s unflinching account of their rise to fame and abusive marriage. Adapted from Tina’s memoir I, Tina, the movie follows Ike’s violent attempts to dominate her before a conversion to Buddhism gives the soul star the strength to break free and go it alone.Depicting the rise of game-changing LA rappers NWA in the late 1980s, Straight Outta Compton appeared in 2015 and was a smash hit, making $200m (£153m) at the box office on a $50m (£38m) budget. While F Gary Gray\u0027s film lost its way in its second half, becoming bogged down in contract disputes, overall it did a superb job of capturing the vitality and righteous anger of the album of the same name. O\u0027Shea Jackson Jr\u0027s performance as his own real-life father, Ice Cube, was a revelation.Jamie Foxx was ideally cast as Ray Charles in Taylor Hackford’s telling of the life of the blind soul star, charting his rise from poverty in rural Florida to worldwide acclaim.

Walk the Line (2005)James Mangold’s film, in which Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon excelled as Johnny Cash and June Carter, was a highly accomplished period piece and swept up its fair share of awards. Admittedly conventional - containing at least three eureka moments in which the leads are inspired to write their best known songs - this is solid and fair-minded stuff.Marion Cotillard became an international star and was named Best Actress at the Oscars for her incredibly emotional turn as tragic French chanteuse Edith Piaf in Olivier Dahan’s 2007 film. Covering the central events of her life from childhood to middle age, the biopic captured the defiant, uncompromising character of its subject, as expressed by her signature song “Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien”.The directorial debut of Anton Corbijn, who had photographed Joy Division in their prime, Control married the British kitchen sink realism of the 1960s with the doom-laden atmosphere of Ingmar Bergman to appropriately eerie effect. Todd Haynes followed his glam rock pseudo-biopic Velvet Goldmine (1998) with this inventive exploration of the many sides of Bob Dylan. Six actors – Cate Blanchett, Heath Ledger, Christian Bale and Ben Whishaw among them – portrayed Dylan at different stages of his career as part of an appropriately freewheelin’ approach to narrative.To convince director Oliver Stone to give him the part of Jim Morrison, Val Kilmer undertook hours of extensive research into his hero, learning 50 songs to mimic his singing voice. When the surviving members of the Doors assembled to hear a recording of Kilmer, none could tell which was the impersonation and which the real Morrison. The Doors was not loved by all but the great Kyle MacLachlan and Meg Ryan were memorable in supporting roles as keyboardist Ray Manzarek and Morrison\u0027s girlfriend Pamela Courson respectively. Gary Oldman was a dead-ringer for the late Sex Pistols guitarist Sid Vicious in director Alex Cox’s appropriately grotty account of the punk star’s pointless death from heroin following the overdose of his girlfriend Nancy Spungen (Chloe Webb) in New York’s Hotel Chelsea. Bandmate Johnny Rotten was predictably dismissive of the project but understandably annoyed that Joe Strummer of The Clash had been consulted but not him.410 7. Get on Up (2014)Like Rami Malek, Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman faced a seemingly impossible task in portraying soul superstar James Brown, “Mr Dynamite” himself. He acquitted himself well, however, in a film that largely conformed to genre formula but offered strength in depth with Dan Aykroyd, Viola Davis, Lennie James and Octavia Spencer among the supporting cast.510 6. What’s Love Got to Do with It? (1993)Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne were superbly matched as Tina and Ike Turner in Brian Gibson’s unflinching account of their rise to fame and abusive marriage.

We know the UK government has started making such plans as a result of the growing demand for such a vote, demonstrated by last weekend’s march.“The EU should do the same, because MPs who back the People’s Vote are fast forming the biggest and most cohesive bloc in Westminster.”UK-EU transport links after Brexit ‘increasingly a cause for concern’MPs ‘far more likely to reject Brexit deal’ if unable to amend itPound sterling falls to six-week low as Theresa May faces Brexit backlPlaid Cymru Westminster group leader Liz Saville Roberts, who also met with Mr Barnier, said she had used the meeting to push for an extension to the negotiation period to accommodate a referendum.“I pressed Michel Barnier on protecting Wales’s interest through the extension of Article 50 and a People’s Vote,” she said.“In Westminster, with the prime minister’s proposals amounting to nothing more than a mix of fudge and fantasy, a People’s Vote is more likely than ever.”The EU has previously reacted cooly to suggestions that the period could be extended, but has not ruled it out. An extension would require the unanimous approval of all 28 EU leaders on the European Council.\u0026nbspSadiq Khan visited Brussels on Friday\u0026nbsp(Getty)Brussels is particularly wary about extending the transition into May, when Britain would have to take part in the next European Parliament elections if it was still in the EU.Mr Khan, speaking after a separate meeting on Friday, said: “The point I made to Michel Barnier, really quite forcefully, is that there is a possibility of the British parliament rejecting the deal that Mrs May secures from the EU.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

In those circumstances, I suggested the EU should begin preparatory work on the extension of Article 50.“Because what would not be a good thing in my view is if we managed to get a referendum but it was too late because we had left the EU or the EU had not made preparations for an Article 50 extension.”Mr Khan added: “Whatever Theresa May brings back will probably be rejected by cabinet, almost certainly rejected by the party, and if not will definitely be rejected by parliament.“That’s why I said to Michel Barnier: listen, you need to start preparing for the possibility of extending Article 50 because if that is the case we will need time to have a referendum.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A former French foreign minister, Barnier hails from the continent’s pro-European centre-right. He is the EU’s face in negotiations and has been given the sole authority to negotiate for the bloc – sometimes to the chagrin of the British side, who would rather bypass him. Takes his negotiating guidelines from the European Council (the 27 other EU leaders) and reports back to them regularly so he can speak with a consensus behind him.\u0026nbspThe president of the European Commission – the EU’s executive, based in Brussels. Was appointed in 2014, his term ends after the next European Parliament elections in May. Mostly leaves Brexit to Barnier, but makes occasional interventions. Centre-right pro-European and former prime minister of Luxembourg.Ireland’s prime minister, a role known in the Irish language as the Taoiseach. Has a key role because of the importance of the Irish border issue, and backs the EU line on the so-called backstop, at least in public.The president of the European Council – representing the 27 national leaders collectively. Is supposed to consult with the national leaders before making statements, and try and reflect their views. A former Polish prime minister and sports fanatic, has often presented himself as a calming influence on talks, expressing optimism that a deal can be reached.\u0026nbspThe Brexit coordinator for the elected European Parliament. Staunchly pro-EU and the leader of the liberal group in the parliament, he acts as a spokesperson for the body on Brexit issues. Consults with and leads\u0026nbspthe parliament’s Brexit taskforce, a committee of MEPs representing the non-European sceptic groups. Draws up motions about Brexit for MEPs to vote on, which are usually passed with a huge majority. Outspoken and often an outrider for the EU. Former Belgian prime minister.Michel Barnier’s second in command, Weyand does the heavy lifting in negotiations and has a firm grasp on the technical detail. Tends to shun the limelight but can be found in Brussels explaining the complicated aspects of talks.The president of the European Parliament. Has taken somewhat of a backseat in the media compared to showman Verhofstadt on the Brexit issue, but still has an important role in representing the Parliament’s interests – for instance in meetings with leaders at the European Council. A former Italian EU commissioner, associated with Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia.Germany’s chancellor, leading the country’s government. Rarely intervenes on Brexit, but her role as chief of Europe’s largest economy gives her huge clout when she does. A centre-right Christian Democrat who values stability – and Germany’s central role in the European project.The French president. A pro-European liberal centrist, Macron has taken one of the harder lines in Brexit talks of any national leader. Said to view Brexit as a form of populism akin to the right-wing governments springing up in the east of the continent, has been so far-successful in convincing other EU leaders not to compromise their principles too much. Accused Brexiteers of being liars.The Irish foreign minister, often seen representing Ireland’s interests abroad with Varadkar is doing something else. Knows Brussels well as a former MEP. He is also the Tánaiste – Ireland’s deputy prime minister – a sign of his senior role.The head of the EU’s civil service, Selmayr is a former aide to Jean-Claude Juncker who is notorious in Brussels for his abrasive approach. Nick-named “the monster” by his own boss, he is feared as a smooth and ruthless operator in the EU capital. Is in charge of no-deal planning for the bloc. Has been accused of dirty tricks by leaking sensitive accounts of meetings with Theresa May to the German press – which he denies.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

if Britain crashes out of the bloc without a deal.According to The Times\u0027 report, Brussels will accept the UK has “equivalent” regulations to the EU, allowing British financial services companies to generally continue business as usual in Europe.EU officials have said its financial market access system, known as “equivalence,” under which it grants access to foreign banks and insurers with broadly similar home regulations, is likely Britain’s best option.So far, the equivalence scheme has had limited use\u0026nbspbecause existing rules state market access can be withdrawn unilaterally with only a month’s notice.However, The Times report claims that under the new deal, equivalence will be extended to encompass part of a\u0026nbspwider trade treaty, allowing the EU and the UK to alter financial regulations after first consulting each other.Responding to\u0026nbspThe Times\u0026nbspreport, the prime minister\u0027s spokesman said reports that Britain was close to securing a deal to give it basic access to EU financial markets were speculation, and negotiations were ongoing.Theresa May\u0027s chief Europe adviser, Ollie Robbins, is continuing negotiations in Brussels,

If the Home Office can\u0027t even get its own ministers and officials to agree on policy, let alone get that past No.10, how can we possibly expect to come to a wide ranging and complex agreement with 27 other nations”The uncertainty was revealed after the immigration minister, Caroline Nokes, was forced to u-turn\u0026nbspafter saying employers would have to check if EU nationals had the right to work, or were newly-arrived.The Home Office they would “not be expected to differentiate between resident EU citizens and those arriving after exit”, even if the UK crashed out of the bloc without a deal.Asked, on ITV’s Peston programme, if he accepted such checks would be “pointless”, Mr Javid replied: “We’ve just got to be practical.Arron Banks and other Brexit campaigners referred to crime agencyUK manufacturing output slumps to two-year low in wake of Brexit fearsBorder Force to open two new processing centres for Brexit“If there\u0027s a no-deal, we won’t be able to immediately distinguish between those Europeans that were already here before March 29, and those who came after – and therefore, as a result, I wouldn’t expect employers to do anything different than they do today.“There will need to be some kind of sensible transition period. I mean, these are the kinds of things I’ve been working on for months and months.”The No 10 spokesman denied Mr Javid and his top civil servant had contradicted each other, saying: “Planning for a no-deal outcome is ongoing and we will be able to set out the government’s position in due course.”He declined to say that work would be done by the end of the year, but claimed: “No-deal preparations are continuing at pace.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Operations at Preston New Road, Lancashire,\u0026nbsphave stopped three times due to concerns about earth tremors.The government has stated it wishes to make such decisions “faster and fairer”, but opponents say it would make fracking as easy as putting up a garden shed.Mark Menzies, a Conservative MP whose Fylde constituency includes the Preston New Road site, cited the massive infrastructure developments needed at new fracking sites including “a 30-metre drilling rig”.“Now, who on Earth thinks that is equivalent to building a little extension on the side of your bungalow? It is not,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Moving to permitted development is nothing short of irresponsible and downright bonkers.”Zac Goldsmith, Conservative MP for Richmond Park, said the government supporting fracking while blocking new onshore wind developments was “inexplicably inconsistent” and evidence of “policy that is driven more by ideology than anything else”.Created with Sketch.How fracking works and where it could happen Show all 2Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There are reportedly up to 20 Conservative MPs ready to rebel over the government’s plan, which critics say would effectively strip local people of the ability to block fracking applications.Tories from constituencies facing new fracking sites including Kevin Hollinrake and Lee Rowley expressed their concerns that people’s voices would be taken away.Mr Rowley, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on the impact of shale gas, has questioned whether it will be possible for fracking plans to ever be scaled up into a workable industry in the UK.The same concerns have recently been expressed by Francis Egan, the chief executive of oil and gas firm Cuadrilla, which operates the site in Lancashire.With persistent earth tremors repeatedly halting proceedings since they began at the site two weeks ago, Mr Egan has stated the current regulatory system could stop fracking becoming commercially viable in the UK.Under the traffic light system currently used by the industry, fracking must stop whenever it causes tremors with a magnitude above 0.5.\u0026nbspOne independent study estimated that over 6,000 wells will be needed to make it a practical option to supply gas to the UK’s energy system.\u0026nbspThe most recent estimate by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) suggested there will be 155 wells by 2025, although energy minister Claire Perry has stated this figure is now “out of date”.Hundreds of thousands urge government to stop fast-tracking frackingDaniel Carey-Dawes, senior infrastructure campaigner at the Campaign to Protect Rural England said the debate was a clear demonstration of the widespread growing anger\u0026nbsp– by MPs on all sides of the political spectrum – towards the government’s plans to fast-track fracking.The government recently closed its consultation on whether new shale exploration sites should be treated as permitted developments.\u0026nbspResponding to the concerns raised at the debate, housing minister Kit Malthouse said the government remained “fully committed to ensuring that local communities are fully involved in planning decisions that affect them, and to making planning decisions faster and fairer”.“Those are long-standing principles and I am adamant that we should stick to them.”BEIS has emphasised the role it sees for natural gas in meeting the UK’s climate targets, and the role fracking can play in this.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In addition, two people will tragically take their life\u0026nbspevery day due to gambling related problems and for that reason as much as any other I believe this delay is unjustifiable.”There was “no reason why implementation cannot come in sooner than October”, she added.Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader and shadow culture secretary, welcomed Ms Crouch’s resignation and accused Jeremy Wright, the culture secretary, of having “prioritised corporate interests over victims”.He wrote on Twitter: “Tracey Crouch has taken a courageous and principled decision to resign from the government over Jeremy Wright’s decision to delay cutting the maximum stake on FOBTs.“She poured her heart and soul into a significant review of these destructive machines, faced down a systematic lobbying attempt by the gambling industry and took the right decision for those suffering from problem gambling, their families and communities.“The new secretary of state has threatened all of this good work.\u0026nbspHe has prioritised corporate interests over victims, profits over public health and greed over good.\u0026nbsp He should be thoroughly ashamed.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Google staff stage a walkout at the company\u0027s UK headquarters in London as part of a global campaign over the US tech giant\u0027s handling of sexual harassment.

I don’t believe it’s an issue for the Finance Bill but I’m certainly happy to discuss what more we can do.”The\u0026nbspgovernment insisted the October 2019 date was not a delay, saying it had brought forward the\u0026nbspdate from\u0026nbspApril 2020.Mr Wright told MPs: “I’ve heard language twisted to various uses in this place, but the idea that a move from April 2020 to October 2019 is a delay is going a little far. It is not a delay.”Theresa May’s spokesperson said the change would be made “exactly when it was set out in the Budget”.But former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said the decision to introduce the cut\u0026nbspin October 2019 was a delay.He told Mr Wright: “I was under the impression then that the industry itself recognised they would need nine to 12 months to implement this.“That would have taken us to around about April or May next year.”“I say to him, it is not too late.”The culture secretary had earlier refused to confirm whether Ms Crouch was resigning.Ms Crouch arrived in the Commons chamber minutes after resigning\u0026nbspand was greeted with a hug from Labour MP Carolyn Harris.\u0026nbspSpeaking in the Commons earlier in the day, Ms\u0026nbspHarris, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on FOBTs, said she was “incandescent” with the delay and suggested Ms Crouch felt the same way.Cutting FOBT stakes must be just the start of gambling industry reformBetfred urges employees to oppose cut to £100 FOBT stakeBookmakers’ shares plummet on report Hammond will slash FOBT stakesShe said: “I am incandescent, along with other members of this House, including, I would argue, the minister for sport, who if she does resign will be a great loss to the frontbenches because her integrity and bravery surpasses anyone else I see in here today.“What is happening to the families who are losing children, what is happening to the children who don’t get Christmas presents because of an addictive parent?“What happens to the people who go to food banks because they have an addiction to these machines?“Don’t give me warm words, give me action, April 2019, we cannot lose any more lives because of these dreadful, dreadful machines.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Those who lead our parties must confront reality and change the way their institutions work.Dame Laura Cox\u0027s report is a massive wake-up call. But the best way to change parliamentary culture is to be there to drive that change so we urge women to come forward as candidates and create a Parliament fit for the next 100 years.

US TRADE WAR: China SMASHED by Donald Trump battle as yuan slidesThe report also predicted business investment has screeched to a complete halt overall this year as uncertainty wreaks havoc on company spending decisions.In a press conference following the publication of the inflation report, Bank Governor Mark Carney warned interest rates could rise in the event of a no-deal Brexit if a cliff-edge withdrawal sends the pound into freefall.Mr Carney said there are scenarios where policy might need to be tightened in the event of a no deal, no transition Brexit, should a plunge in the value of the pound cause inflation to surge and impact UK production.He stressed a no-deal Brexit was not the most likely scenario, but said the Bank had to be prepared for the worst case and this could mean rates moving in either direction.The Bank\u0027s boss also cautioned that monetary policy might not be able to help soften the economic blow of a no-deal disorderly Brexit.He said: There is little that monetary policy can do to offset large, negative supply shocks, which occur relatively rarely in advanced economies.\u0026nbspBrexit news: The Bank of England has warned of interest rate hikes  (Image: EPA )The bank said consumer spending had been helping prop up the economy, with a summer heatwave shopping spree set to see growth accelerate to 0.6 percent in the third quarter, up from 0.4 percent in the previous three months.\u0026nbspBut this is likely to have been only a temporary boost, and the Bank expects growth to pare back to 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter before steadying at 0.4 percent thereafter.This saw the Bank trim its forecast for growth overall in 2018, to 1.3 percent from 1.4 percent predicted in August, while it also nudged its 2019 outlook down to 1.7 percent from 1.8percent.Its forecasts are based on a smooth exit from the EU, with financial markets pencilling in around one rate rise a year for the next three years.However, the Bank admits the economic outlook will depend significantly on the nature of EU withdrawal.It comes after it was reported Theresa May had secured another Brexit victory after the EU caved in to allow UK financial services continued access to the Brussels bloc after Britain\u0026rsquos exit.UK and EU negotiators were understood to have reached a tentative agreement on their future relationship surrounding services, as well as the exchange of data, with just five months to go before Britain leaves.But Number 10 said the reports were speculation and talks were ongoing, while the EU\u0027s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier hit out at misleading accounts.Follow Express for live Brexit updates below:Brexit news: Mark Carney speaks following the Bank of England\u0027s statement  (Image: PA )                Barclays

tax documents, education certificates, bank statements or employment contracts if they do not have a passport in case they are asked to prove they have lived in the UK for at least five years.His warning comes after community leaders at the Traveller Movement national annual conference voiced concern over the threat of deportation after Brexit.4pm: Ireland \u0026lsquoriding

reasonable grounds to suspect that Mr Banks was not the true source of \u0026pound8 million worth of loans made during the campaign.Leave.EU, co-founded by Mr Banks, its chief executive Elizabeth

A seven-hour slog live from Westminster City Hall, presented by Adam Hills, Maya Jama and the network’s spare part Alan Carr, who set the tone for most of what followed interviewing Foxy from SAS: Who Dares Wins.“It’s been announced you’ve got a new Stand Up To Cancer series starting next year. Tell us about it.”“I can’t.”“Give us some names.”“I can’t.”No sooner had we written that one off than it become apparent there was no Bake Off special either — just a promo for a show that will be screened months from now. No matter, though. With its lofty public-serving hat on, Adam Hills faithfully promised Channel  would “educate, entertain and inspire” us for the remainder of the evening, which must have looked quite good written down.In practice The first thing to say about Stand Up To Cancer is that it featured some of the most beautul and affecting films you’ll see on a telethon.They needed to be, as well, ’cos you don’t have to have watched the event to know it contained a lot of feeble stunts and sketches.I also could have lived without Adam Hills carrying out a threat to have his pubic hair waxed, live, once the total reached £million, and the educational segment, with Katherine Ryan and Chris O’Dowd, which was sunk the moment he announced: “We’re goingto put the humour in tumour.”Tellingly, there was also a fair bit of non-network talent involved, including James Corden.I’ll not dwell, though, on what Channel ’s Twitter feed did to the Carpool Karaoke segment, where Michael Buble talked about his son’s illness, except to say it was one of those productions where the left hand wasn’t talking to the right.So when Chris O’Dowd was moved to tears talking about the cancer films, the studio audience was guffawing loudly at Alan Carr manoeuvring himself into background position in a Prue Leith wig.By a process of elimination and production gaffs, though, it became apparent the centre of Channel ’s entire universe now is Gogglebox, which had created an all-star version with Louis Tomlinson, Danny Dyer and daughter Dani for the occasion.They missed a trick, frankly, by not capturing Louis falling asleep to The X Factor. But it was still riotously funny watching the regulars pick apart Naked Attraction, with the choicest comment being: “That one looks like Homer Simpson’s mouth.”This was not the sound of people laughing with the channel, though. They were laughing at it.A network that was once known for being brave and innovative is now far more readily associated with a genital parade, third-rate reality shows and cakes than anything in the way of ground-breaking drama or comedy.In fact, the only two genuinely funny people on its payroll are probably Jimmy Carr and Sean Lock, who had to make way, at Stand Up To Cancer, for box-ticking randoms like Mo Gilligan, who was served this testicular curve-ball by Maya Jama.“Do you have a special name for your balls, by any chance ”He does.The Big Narstie Show.So there I was, gently drting off as Darcey Bussell went through the technical motions on Strictly. “The control in the rise and fall. Strong in the two-three.”When, unless I’m imagining it, she told Sean Walsh: “You have to smooth it out and iron it out, so it isn’t jerking off or skippy.”Suddenly I was all ears for the show’s Halloween special – an event which, for three good reasons, is usually my least favourite of the run.Firstly, Tess always expects a laugh for referring to it as a “spook-tacular”. Secondly, someone does The ****ing Timewarp. And thirdly, the worst danceris forced to jig around to The Monster Mash.We got it all, on Saturday night, of course, yet somehow it didn’t feel quite such an endurance as normal.This may have been partly down to Ashley Roberts and Faye Tozer, who both danced like dreams, but it definitely owed something to the presence of Sean, who’s added real jeopardy to proceedings andactual comedy.His snog with Katya has made sense of a dreadful line-up and the BBC should be eternally grateful to The Sun and the photographer for capturing the moment.So although the handbag-clutchers will no doubt disagree, I was genuinely sad to see him voted off and probably back to the ex-girlfriend, where, in the words of Darcey Bussell, he’ll have to “smooth it out and iron it out” or he’ll end up, you know . . . “skippy”.Sandra Oh’s performance in Killing Eve.

There were announcements on schools funding, defence, moving “from disposable to reusable cups across all beverage types” — even a tax break for public loos. More money for social care and Universal Credit.Shopkeepers will breathe a sigh of relief at a hefty cut to business rates.There were hints of more money for the police. Sun readers will also welcome the tax freezes on beer, spirits, cider and short-haul flights.But the big bucks — some £.billion of the £.billion extra the Government expects to spend come - — went to the NHS, fulfilling the Prime Minister’s summer promise to increase spending as a th birthday present to a health service creaking under the strain of an ageing population.The question, of course, was how the Chancellor was going to pay for it.Before the Budget, all sorts of grim possibilities had been floated.Extra taxes on white-van men, lower- ing the VAT threshold and tightening the rules about National Insurance contributions. Taxes on plastic cups . Taxes on pretty much anything, really.Perhaps the best thing the Chancellor did in his Budget, then, was say “No”.To almost all of it. For an hour or more, I waited for the sting in the tail — the bit where Fiscal Phil turned Hatchet Hammond.But it never came. In paying for his promises — and above all, the NHS — the Chancellor was helped by better-than-expected borrowing forecasts, which showed our economy’s remarkable record of creating jobs is still going strong.But he has also made a calculation that it is better to live with a small and manageable deficit than try to drag the finances back into surplus at the cost of higher taxes. And that voters will see through Labour’s promises to hike borrowing back to stratospheric levels in the name of a socialist transformation of the economy.He decided, in other words, people pay enough tax already.And he’s right. All too often in recent years, it has felt like the answer to every problem — at least from Whitehall’s point of view — is higher taxes and more interference.Hammond was never going to copy his tax-slashing Tory predecessor Nigel Lawson, who made it a point of principle to abolish a dferent tax with every Budget.But at least he drew a line in the sand, deciding it is better when hardworking people get to keep more of their own money.That ending austerity should not, and must not, mean higher tax bills. That hard work should mean hard cash in your pocket.Yes, Hammond — like every Chancellor since Gordon Brown — made too many fiddly little announcements.But he avoided the kind of whacking- great raid on taxpayers’ pockets so many were urging him towards.This doesn’t mean we are out of the woods. Britain’s growth prospects over the next half-decade are still extraordinarily sluggish.The outcome of the Brexit deal will drastically change the fiscal picture.In many ways, Hammond’s speech yesterday was a holding action ahead of the much bigger decisions to come.We still need much more radical action to kickstart growth and productivity. Despite the scale of the housing crisis, for example, there was only tinkering around the edges.But a large part of delivering that growth must involve making the economy more dynamic, more competitive and letting people keep more of their own money as a reward for their efforts — moving the country in the direction outlined by Philip Hammond, rather than the one sketched out by Jeremy Corbyn .The overall verdict on the Budget  The jokes were worse than expected but the numbers were better.More spending on the NHS, tax cuts for millions of voters and the worst ideas kept out of it.Yes, borrowing will be higher — but low enough to keep us out of the danger zone and far, far lower than under a Corbyn government.That is a menu Philip Hammond will be pretty happy with.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Another £.billion to iron out Universal Credit problems. A near five per cent hike in the minimum wage. A big, welcome cut in business rates for struggling firms.New ideas flowed: a levy on web giants’ UK revenues, potentially raising £million, is long overdue — though Philip Hammond must ensure the ­burden does not fall on online shoppers.There was major funding to help councils transform our hollowed-out High Streets, including turning vacant shops into homes. A huge increase in firms’ annual investment allowance will let them deduct from taxable profits up to £million spent on tools and machinery.Heathrow’s e-gates will now speed up entry for visitors from the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan as well as Europe — a symbol of a global Britain open for business.Some bad ideas The Sun has criticised, including the proposed “latte levy” on plastic cups, were binned. Duty was frozen again on fuel, as well as beer.Even the OBR’s normally pessimistic forecasts were on Mr Hammond’s side. Growth is predicted to rise steadily, albeit too slowly. Unemployment is set to fall to its lowest in  years.We wish the Chancellor had outlined more radical, visionary low-tax measures. He will need them should Brussels shove us into a no-deal Brexit. But that gripe aside, what was not to like The Tories must not try to ape Corbyn’s £trillion spending fantasy. But it is not “Corbyn-lite” to spend billions fixing Britain’s most pressing problems, evenwe are still running a deficit.As for Corbyn himself, it was obvious he took in barely a word of the Budget.In his “response” he merely recited his normal scripted complaints, flubbing his words and shouting randomly, as is now traditional. He somehow contrives to make even this chaotic Government look like a model of competence.Budgets often unravel when acres of small print are finally scrutinised.But for now... nice one, Chancellor.ANGELA Merkel is a once-brilliant politician scuppered by an arrogant disregard for voters.For years she was admired worldwide. Then she flooded Germany with a million migrants, enraging the public, fuelling extremism and sealing her own downfall.Don’t expect Brussels to learn from it.Their contempt for citizens is even worse.

which wraps six benefits into one.That will start around July next year, its expected.If your circumstances change, for example you lose your job, move house or move in with your partner, you might have to claim Universal Credit instead.If your Jobcentre area is not on the list then enter your postcode here to find out when it’s coming to near you.Most people will need a bank account to receive benefits - or a similar account with a credit union or building society.You need to be able to receive payments and set up direct debits and standing orders with it too.If you’re living with your partner and you’re both eligible for Universal Credit, you’ll get a joint payment - so you might want to consider a joint account too.The new Universal Credit system is mainly online, though you can get help in the job centre and over the phone too.Most Jobcentres and libraries have computers and free wi-fi you can useyou can’t get online.Andyou’re using it from home on a budget, make sure you shop around using services like U-switch to get the best internet deal too.Drawing up a budget of all your household incomes and outgoings will be helpful before you make a claim for Universal Credit.UC will be paid to you in one monthly payment for the six benefits, but in some extreme circumstances you can ask for it to be paid fortnightly or even weekly.Consider how much you get or expect to get in benefits, work and other income, and when in the month they come in to try and help you budget.And youll need to know information about your existing savings and pensions.Before you apply you should also work out your outgoings on everything from rent, food and travel, to electricity, gas, phone bills, and paying off debts.You can use a benefits calculator here to give you an estimate of what you could get.Bear in mind theres a cap on the total amount of benefits that most people can get - some benefits are included in the cap but others are not.Youll also need some form of ID to prove who you are - it can be a passport or driving licence, but they also will accept things like debit or credit cards too.Universal Credit rolls six benefits into one.If youre already on benefits, you dont need to apply for Universal Credit unless your circumstances change or youre told to by the DWP.They work it out by looking at how much you earned in the last assessment period - so anything you earn after you start a claim will count towards your income levels and could affect the amount of benefits youll get.You can earn a certain amount under Universal Credit butyou earn more than the allowances then your benefits will be reduced.Other benefits like Carers Allowance, Personal Independent Payments, and Child Benefit are still separate to Universal Credit and wont be part of your lump payment.But the income from that could affect your Universal Credit amount.You might need to book and attend an interview at your local Jobcentre before you get your first payment.Once you have successfully applied and have given all the relevant information, it will take five weeks for your first sum to come through.But you can apply for an advanceyou dont feel youll be able to manage financially until that happens. The money you owe will be taken off your UC sum in future months.After youve applied you can sign in to your Universal Credit online account to report changes in circumstances, add notes to your journal, see anything you need to do, and check when your payment is coming.Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.The new Universal Credit systems rollout has been far from smooth - with many Brits claiming its pushing them into debt.One single mum told us how she was at risk of losing her home after applying for Universal Credit - because she couldnt claim help with her mortgage debt.But that wont affect everyone, and millions wont be affected by the changes.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Not for her the rictus grin and stilted performance of other royal tours — this was pure Hollywood magic.It was Meghan’s first international tour with husband Harry since their wedding in May. And she charmed her way through public walkabouts, formal dinners, hugs with kids and formidable speeches.The pregnant Duchess even baked banana bread for her Aussie hosts and did yoga at am when the jet lag kicked in.The Fijians and Tongans were delighted the royals had come to town, while the Aussies couldn’t get enough of Meghan and the Kiwis went wild, too.On the tour’s own merits, she did a great job and didn’t put a foot wrong — even more impressive considering she only made her public debut with Harry just over a year ago. Since then Meghan has changed the face of The Firm for ever, and has made Prince Harry incredibly happy.The Duchess is now very much a Republican’s nightmare her natural charm and modern approach have set back their cause for a generation.But it was never a given.Meghan embarked on this mammoth tour with the dark cloud of her father Thomas Markle’s constant brickbats in the Press. To say he had been a thorn in her side would be the understatement of the year.I’ve covered these tours for years and while they look like — sometimes literally — a walk in the park, they are anything but. Le under this kind of unrelenting microscope is tough, even for a royal veteran.Meghan, , may well be a seasoned actress and used to meeting and greeting fans, but a royal tour is a completely dferent gig.For every single person they meet, that five-secondencounter with the young royal superstars is one that will be remembered for ever. So every handshake, every “hello I’m Meghan”, every “so nice to see you today” matters to the thousands of people they met on the tour.The smile can’t falter, the grip can’t shake and they have to be on form at all times — for  days straight.And it was here that Meghan’s Hollywood training kicked in. The former Suits actress didn’t miss a beat.Harry often looked grumpy — it was extremely tiring with early starts and up to five engagements each day — and at one particularly long welcome ceremony in Fiji he looked like he wanted to thump someone.Thankfully, when the red mist descended Meghan, always composed, always smiling, was ready to hold his hand to cheer him up. And it was clear that her extraordinary beauty was the tonic that could lt him out of his darkest mood.Seeing them together, standing in the rain in Dubbo in Oz — with Meghan shielding Harry from the rain with a giant brolly while her husband made a speech — was a powerful image. Meghan, of course, knows the power of a picture. Right from the start of the tour, she used her wardrobe and jewellery to send substantial messages.She wore two Aussie designers on Day  in Sydney — with her Karen Gee “Blessed” dress showing off the merest hint of a baby bump.But it was her earrings and bracelet that caught the eye. The butterflies at her ears had belonged to Princess Diana, the bangle too, and showed that Harry’s mum was with them on the journey as they began their own family.It was a clever piece of signalling — and a respectful inclusion of Diana, who is still hugely popular Down Under — and the crowds loved this glamorous new daughter-in-law.In Fiji, Meghan had chosen the blue of the Fijian flag for her black-tie dinner gown. Her hosts loved the tribute to their country, which still fondly remembers the Queen and Prince Philip’s visit during the Commonwealth Tour of . The couple had waved to the excited crowds in the island’s capital Suva from the balcony of the Grand Pacic hotel, in an exact replica of Harry’s grandparents  years before.And in Tonga, Meghan stepped off the plane in a red Self-Portrait dress to echo the Tongan flag.There were no structured coat-dresses, boxy hats or nude court shoes. This was a working wardrobe for a new working royal, Meghan Markle-style.Skirts were longer, colours more muted than in her previous le as an actress. She looked the business.And there was substance, as well as style. She gave three impressive speeches. Kensington Palace had billed her debut as a fully-fledged royal as “a few words”.It was much more than that at Fiji’s University of the Pacic.She spoke eloquently about how everyone deserved the opportunity of an education. A speech at the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games in Sydney paid tribute to all the friends and family of those who had been injured in the line of duty.But the most powerful, and perhaps personal, speech came at Wellington’s Government House on Sunday.To celebrate  years of New Zealand giving women the vote , the female Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern hosted a reception. Keen advocate of women’s rights, Meghan gave the keynote speech: “Women’s suffrage is about feminism, but feminism is about fairness. Suffrage is not simply about the right to vote but also about what that represents. The basic and fundamental human right of being able to participate in the choices for your future and that of your community.”It was clear she had written these speeches herself and worded them in her language, not the formal words of a British royal court.Again, here was that Hollywood sparkle in full effect.And the message that she delivered — equality for everyone and be the best you can be — struck home.From Maori kids in New Zealand to Aboriginal girls at a school in Australia, the fact a mixed-race American had been accepted by the royals showed them anything was possible. Time and again I heard that Meghan is a role model for young women. But does this new superstar in the royal firmament pose a threat for those already established  It is perhaps too early to say.What we know is that Prince Charles adores her and their warm relationship has fostered a renewed closeness between father and son. Meghan views Charles as a new father figure after cutting off her biological one for incessantly speaking out and missing her wedding.Camilla, too, knows what it’s like marrying into The Firm and has been a source of support. They are content to see Harry and his new we steal the headlines.But comparisons with William and Kate are perhaps inevitable.If Meghan is in danger of eclipsing even Kate,  — and certainly in the battle of the evening frocks last week Sussex beat Cambridge — perhaps that explains why the Cambridges and Sussexes are thinking of separating their courts. Currently all the “Fab Four’s” work is handled by one office at Kensington Palace, but William and Harry are thinking of setting up one for each brother and their families next year.Right now the only cloud for Meghan is her troublesome family.Dad Thomas, , and half-sister Samantha, , have frequently offered their views on their new royal relation — much to Meghan’s distress.It appears she has not spoken to her father since the wedding — and has no plans to do so. He claimed he heard about his daughter’s pregnancy from the radio.However, her new family will be pleased with all the positive headlines and renewed royal fervour in the four Commonwealth countries.After all, Harry and Meghan were representing the Queen, and everyone agrees it was a tour de force.Granny will be delighted.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Malls worth poundbillion are at risk of going into administration amid a wave of store closures, a report estimates. Some have been sent into a “downward spiral” by the loss of anchor tenants such as BHS and Toys R Us. With Debenhams to close  stores and fears of more House of Fraser branches being shut, other shopping centres face a worrying future.  Nelson Blackley of the National Retail Research Knowledge Exchange Centre, at Nottingham Business School, said: “If centres close, particularly in small towns, it will be catastrophic. “If a major anchor store moves out, that has a halo effect on other stores in that centre. It’s a downward spiral and you can’t fill shopping centres with nail bars and vape shops.” The Mirror has highlighted the impact of waves of shop closures as part of our High Street Fightback campaign. Stores have been hammered by a toxic combination of soaring costs, including business rates, and competition from online rivals such as Amazon. Asset management firm APAM’s report said the -plus centres at greatest risk were those needing funds for “much-needed redevelopment”.  They include many sites owned by overseas private equity firms, and are believed to include ageing centres in smaller towns. Experts fear going the way of the US, where mass store closures created “ghost malls” such as Randall Park in Ohio. University of Salford Business School’s Dr Gordon Fletcher said: “The issue for towns and communities is that the large, self-contained environments of shopping malls creates massive problems for the entire town centre when they fail or under-perform. “Consumer preference for mass custshyomisation lends itself to locations on the edge of town centres, where rates and rentals can be lower and more flexible.” Yet out-of-town shopping malls are also struggling. Last week industry giant Intu, which runs the Trafford and Arndale centres in Manchester and Lakeside in Grays, Essex, cut the value of its estate by poundmillion. The firm, which has  centres, responded by earmarking excess land for , homes. It comes after rival group Hammerson put all  of its out-of-town retail parks up for sale earlier this year. The firm slashed the value of the sites by poundmillion to just over pound.billion, after reporting that half-year profits had ed % to pound.million. Meanwhile, supermarkets with mega stores are trying to get other retailers to rent excess space. Experts say out-of-town shops will have be converted. There is speculation online firms could take some over as warehouses to speed up local deliveries. This week’s Budget proposed changes to planning rules to make it easier to turn empty shops into homes and offices.

Those are the stark findings of the Office for National Statistics, which says the population is now at a record high of million – and set to soar still further. On current trends, the UK will be home to million people by  and .million by . Ten years ago just .% of the population was aged  and over. Last year the figure reached .%, which is million, and this is projected to stand at % by  – one in every four Britons.  These statistics are both a cause for celebration and consternation. The good news is they show that advances in healthcare and changes in lestyle means we are living longer. Babies born be- tween  and  are expected to live . yearsmaleand . yearsfemale . Remarkably, .% of boys and .% of girls born this year will live to be , the ONS forecasts. But an ageing population brings additional challenges in the forms of pension, health and social care costs. The ONS says the rising number of elderly people flows from the second wave of baby boomers – those born in the s and s. These are the children of the first wave of baby boomersand they will turn  or  in the s, s and s.  By  there could be an additional .million Britons aged  and over – a population roughly the size of present-day London. That would take the total to .million, or .% of the entire population. There has also been a % rise in the number of people living alone. In the - age group the total is .million, with .% of them men. The figure for those aged  and over is .million – and .% of them are women. Of Britain’s million families, .million feature a couple who were either married or in a civil partnership, .million contain a cohabiting couple and .million are headed by a lone parent. Costlier housing has led to an increase in the number of young people living with their parents. The ONS says % of men and % of women aged - now do so – the highest number since records began in .  The population rise has been fuelled by births outnumbering deathsand immigration exceeding emigration . In  some % of the country’s inhabitants were born in the UK and % were British nationals. Last year the respective figures were % and about %. The number of EU nationals here has doubled from .million in  to .million last year. This includes , Poles, , Irish, , Romanians and , Germans. From outside the EU there are , who were born in India living in the UK, , from Pakistan, , from Bangladesh and , from South Africa. Statistician Sarah Coates, of the ONS’s Centre for Ageing and Demography, said: “The country’s population has doubled over the last  years, reaching a new high of million in . “Our current projection is that there will be almost million people by . “This growth is due to there being more births than deaths and more people moving to the UK than leaving. “As well as growing, the population is also ageing. From looking at past patterns, we project that more than a quarter of UK residents will be aged  or over within the next  years.”  Comment: Debora Price – Professor of Social Gerontology The fact that populations in countries all over the world are ageing is not just down to people living longer on average. It’s also because youngsters’ mortality improves, because more women survive childbirth and because the treatment and eradication of infectious diseases is far better. However, in many countries, including the UK, fewer children are being born – which means the population is not replacing itself and on average gets older. So we end up with a host of challenges. These are partly about changes in population structure and in the types of diseases that afflict and kill people. But there are also major changes in how families form and break up, in migration, in globalisation and in climate change. All this means it’s hard to imagine a part of modern le not affected by population ageing. So we need to think of how we deliver health, social care, housing, pensions, jobs and a decent income in this new world for populations that might live a very long time. There are fantastic global opportunities here for design, technology, town planning and the provision of housing. Those involved should think creatively about innovative new solutions to the issues that confront us all as we age. Most important of all is to realise that ageing is a very unequal business – that people with resources are able to grow older much better than those without. This unequal ageing is perhaps our greatest challenge.

The alignment of the stake reduction with an increase in remote gaming duty was a condition put on by the Treasury to provide fiscal neutrality but is not a technical necessity, so there is no reason why implementation cannot come in sooner than October.I know there is never a good time to resign and appreciate that this will be an unwelcome distraction but as the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said in the House this morning, it is a fact of Government that ministers must adhere to collective responsibility and cannot disagree with policy, let alone when it is policy made against your wishes relating to your own portfolio.I would like to place on the record my enormous gratitude to the amazing team of civil servants who have helped me over the past three and a half years in post. I am very proud of what we have achieved in that time including the sports strategy, the gambling review, the Civil Society strategy and of course the most recent loneliness strategy, which I was humbled to lead on your behalf.I have had the privilege of meeting many charities, volunteers and social enterprises working collectively to support and enhance civil society cheered on our summer and winter Olympic and Paralympic athletes and have attended almost every major sporting event meeting great sports men and women past, present and future.I hope you understand my position and accept my resignation with the sadness it is tended.Yours ever,Tracey Crouch MP "},{"url":null,"title":"babes wood accused linked sweatshirt","story":"NewsBabes in the Wood accused linked to sweatshirt found near murder scene by DNARussell Bishop was acquitted of the murders in  but was ordered to stand trial a second time following advances in DNA testingShareByTom Pettor:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsThe Blue Pinto sweatshirt which was found beside a path behind Moulsecoomb railway station \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis is the sweatshirt at the centre of the trial of a convicted paedophile accused of murdering two young girls in .

Prosecutor Brian Altman, QC, has told the jury: “We say you can conclude that the Pinto sweatshirt obviously belonged to him, that it came into recent contact with the girls’ clothing and that recent contact can only have been at the time of their murder.”  The court heard yesterday that the sweatshirt was found beside a path on a route Russell, then aged , would have taken home from the murder scene in Wild Park on the edge of Brighton. The crew-necked sweatshirt, which smelt strongly of sweat and had red stains on it, was handed in to police on October , the day after the girls vanished. It was put in a brown paper bag and taken to Brighton police station before being transferred to a clear sealed bag, jurors were told. Retired chief superintendent Christopher Bentham told jurors that he examined it wearing a lab coat and disposable gloves. He said the role of scenes of crime officers at the time was to “obtain and preserve the integrity” of items to prevent contamination. Sealed exhibits were later sent off to Aldermaston Forensic Laboratory for testing, jurors were told.  Former Superintendent David Tomlinson, who was in charge of the search, said he was told the girls had been found at about .pm on October  . He said: “There was still an amount of undergrowth. With the position of the bodies it was dficult for me to see what had happened. “I was able to see the two bodies but they were not in a comfortable position. I got the impression one body had been almost thrown or tossed against the other.” The girls were found dead in a clearing amid undergrowth near steps known as Jacob’s Ladder a day after they vanished.  Bishop was acquitted of the murders in  but was ordered to stand trial a second time in light of new evidence following advances in DNA testing. Bishop, a former roofer, who is now , has denied the murders. The trial continues.

The chain has hundreds of sites across across Britain and will leave each to decide whether it wants to impose a ban. Some cafes have started challenging those looking under  and refusing to serve them caffeine, the Bristol Post reported.One dad said his -year-old daughter was turned down at the Costa Coffee cafe in Conwy, Wales, this weekend when she ordered an iced coffee.  I had never heard of Costa doing this before, her older sister has often bought her own drinks at Costa before, he said. This is as an occasional treat rather than regular coffee drinking and a lot of Costa drinks do seem to be aimed at younger people. They should be clear with their policy, they either serve under s or not, rather than just being at the discretion of particular places. Then people know where they stand.  If they are concerned about health then perhaps they should they also stop selling cakes or high calorie drinks to overweight children because obesity is a far more serious health issue in this country than caffeine consumption. Costa has confirmed they do not encourage the sale of caffeine to children under s and it was at the discretion of inidual stores to enforce this. Many major supermarkets have banned the sale of energy drinks, which typically contain high levels of caffeine, to under s.  But most cafeacutes have continued to sell coffee to under s. A Costa spokesman said: We do not encourage the sale of caffeine to children under  and it is at store discretion to question a customer’s agethey have any concerns. Our advertising is not directed at children and you must be  or above to own a Costa Club Card. Caffeine information is available upon request should a customer wish to know the level of caffeine in their favourite Costa coffee.

Of course shes got a fantastic glam-squad on hand to help her out, but she also works hard to stay in shape. Royal fans were in awe of her slim figure when she donned a pair of black skinny years for an event in Essex this week, with many wondering how shes got her figure back just a few months after giving birth to her third child. Kate dressed all in black to play a game of tennis at Basildon Sporting Village, and she looked incredible.  Over the years Kate has spoken about how shes lost her baby weight after her pregnancies with Prince George and Princess Charlotte, and its likely shes using the same techniques after having little Louis. The Duchess reportedly followed a fitness programme written by busy mum-of-two Kelly Rennie, and even wrote to her to thank her for the help it offered. The -year-olds plan encourages mums to stop emotional eating, but she never imagined it would receive praise from someone as famous as Kate. Kelly, who lives in Christchurch, New Zealand, transformed her own body by living by her own programme. DAILY DIET AT HER HEAVIEST:BREAKFAST: Cereal or toast.LUNCH: Sandwich, crisps and a chocolate bar.DINNER: Fast food takeaway such as McDonalds with an unhealthy dessert.

During her visit to New Delhi, India, in  Kate was asked by Professor BulBul Dhar-James how she got back into shape after giving birth to Princess Charlotte. She responded simply: I am running after my kids.  Kates mum Carole swears swears by the Dukan diet, a high-protein low-carb plan that originated in France - so theres also a chance the Duchess might be taking a few tips. The diet is popular with the likes of Jenner Lopez and Nicole Kidman.  Followers of the strict regime swear by lean meat and fish, fat-free dairy products and they drink only water, tea and coffee. But it has been claimed the diet can lead to nutritional imbalances with too much salt, and a lack of fibre and vitamin C.

The Duchess of Sussex went barefoot for a formal Māori welcoming ceremony in New Zealand on Wednesday. Eagle-eyed royal fans spotted a small faded scar on the inside of her left foot. Kumar Kunasingam, consultant trauma and orthopaedic surgeon for BMI Shirley Oaks hospital, says that the scar is definitely due to open bunion surgery - which can be very painful. He saids: It can take up to three months before patients can wear heels again.  Meghan is known for her love of Manolo Blaknik heels and has a designer shoe collection worth thousands. It is thought she had the surgery in  after suffering from bunions for four years - and getting trolled online for them. Mr Kunasingam explained: The joint on metatarsal [the bone above the big toe] where bunions tend to occur has many layers. During surgery you have to cut through all these layers to get to the bone, which is then broken, straightened and pinned.” “A bunion is a bit like an onion. It has so many layers and both pre and post-surgery they can make you cry.”  But the surgeon says it is a myth that high heels cause bunions - because they are hereditary. He said that the affliction affects % of the population and is more common in women. Other female stars who appear to have suffered from bunions include Victoria Beckham, Oprah Winfrey and Tilda Swinton. Recovery from open surgery can be very painful, says the orthopaedic expert.  It can take up to eight weeks to be able to walk unaided with patients having to bath or shower with plastic bags on their feet for six weeks afterward. But since her operation Kumar notes that Meghan, , has made intelligent choices with her footwear.  “In  you can see her scar is still pink yet she’s deliberately chosen heels that don’t rub on the area. There’s also a lot of give and room in her shoes and I imagine it’s all because of her bunion surgery.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle prince harry went","story":"NewsMeghan Markle and Prince Harry went trick-or-treating - and she even shared photo on InstagramPrince Harry travelled to Toronto in  to spend the weekend with his then-girlfriend Meghan Markle, and it sounds like they had a great timeShareCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience EditorEmmeline Saunders:,  NOV NewsMeghan and Harry got into the Halloween spirit \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis year Meghan Markle spent Halloween saying goodbye to New Zealand after finishing her first major trip as a member of the Royal Family.

Its believed that Prince Harry travelled to Toronto to spend the weekend with Meghan, and the new couple went partying and trick-or-treating. The fun weekend happened before the now-Duchess closed her social media accounts down, so she even posted a photo from the weekend which many believe was taken by her future husband.  The pair, who reportedly started dating a few months before in the August, went to Soho House Toronto for a spooky themed party on the Saturday night.

Anya Lloyd was walking home from a friend’s house when she was set upon from behind by two other girls who dragged her across the road by her hair and kicked her in the head. The teen, who has Type  diabetes, said she doesn’t remember much after that but woke up face down on a grass verge. Her mother Joanne happened to call Anya during the attack because she was concerned she had not ed to her home in Buckley, near Mold in Flintshire, yet.Her daughter managed to pick up just before the beating but then all Joanne could hear was screaming and the words “just die you f****** b****, just die”. Anya told the Daily Record: I crossed the road two or three times because two girls were following me. I felt intimidated so I started walking quicker to get away from them.  Thats when they came up behind me, grabbed my hair and threw me on the floor. They trod on my hair so I couldnt get back up.” Anya suffered injuries to her head and chest and was left with incredibly low blood sugar levels following the attack, that her mum says could have killed her. Ms Lloyd, who felt sick to the core, said the phone call was something she would take to her grave. She said: I can honestly say that call has haunted me ever since. I felt sick to the core. The noise that I heard over the phone is something I will take to the grave with me. Its absolutely horrible. Thankfully, we knew her route so my partner raced to get her. She was very dazed when she got home because her blood sugar levels had dropped so low. She was shaking and was completely terried. She was completely withdrawn and quiet.” She continued: She could have died on that grass verge, and it may have been a real possibility had she not picked the phone up to me. She was vulnerable and hypoglycemic which put her in real danger.  Shes trying to say it doesnt matter, but it does matter. We dont want to let this go. This is a serious issue. Psychologically it has affected her, but shes a tough cookie. I will not give up until she gets justice. Despite informing police of the incident, Ms Lloyd says she is yet to hear anything further from the force. Ms Lloyd said: I just want to express my sincere gratitude to all the people who have come forward to offer their support and help. The amount of support she has received is humbling. Weve also had contact from some other teenagers who have offered their support, which just goes to show that for every one bad person, there are hundreds more who are good.

Emily Catterall had been plagued by discomfort and an unsettling churning in her stomach for months. The -year-olds GP diagnosed acid reflux and irritable bowel syndromeand placed her on two forms of medication at the start of the year. But Emily, from Preston, Lancashire, was determined to find the cause of the bloating and not simply rely on a quick fix. Emily, who works for a social housing group, avoided socialising with friends and eating out for fear it would trigger her symptoms. She said: “For about four months I was suffering from really bad stomach aches and a really swollen stomach. I went from wearing size  jeans to looking like I was nine months pregnant.  “It mostly happened in the afternoon so I knew it was something to do with that I was eating for lunch. “It would continue all through the night and I couldn’t sleep. My stomach would constantly be churning and I had discomfort all the time. “One night I went out running with my friend and she could hear my stomach churning as I was running along. She told me ‘that’s not right’.” Emily tried to eliminate foods from her diet to pinpoint what was causing her problems, but found it dficult. She said: “I was changing my lunch so often to try and find out what was causing the problem that it just became impossible. “People were telling me to cut out gluten, and then to cut out dairy, but sometimes my lunch wouldn’t contain one or the other and I was still having issues every single day. “I took the medication that the doctor gave me for about a week but decided that I didn’t want to be on medication for the rest of my le. I wanted to find out what was causing it.” Emily, who has more than , followers on Instagram , turned to social media for help. After sharing a picture of her bloated stomach one of her followers suggested she try a YorkTest food intolerance test.  The test analyses IgG reactions to  food and drinks - from common ingredients like cow’s milk, gluten and egg, to foods such as kale and quinoa. Emily said: “I had already done some research around food intolerances so decided to give YorkTest a go. “My results came back within  days and showed I was intolerant to egg white, egg yolk, cows milk, goats milk, and I had a borderline intolerance to yeast and beef.” Emily’s previous diet had included salads, jacket potatoes with ious toppings, and cup-a-soups. She said: “Even though I thought I had been changing my diet I was still eating a lot of these foods because eggs and milk can be hidden in all sort of things.” After eliminating the ‘problem’ foods from her diet for  weeks, Emily has dropped eight and a half pounds.She’s also back at the gym and often eats out with family and friends. She said: “I felt amazing from day two. “I described to the nutritional therapists what I would normally eat, so for breakfast I would have natural yoghurt and berries. And they were really good at suggesting things I could eat instead. “Not being bloated has made such a big dference to my confidence.I don’t take any medication and, touch wood, I don’t have any discomfort. I’m so happy.” Dr Gill Hart, biochemist and scientic director at YorkTest Laboratories, said: “Once a food intolerance sufferer understands their trigger foods, and has a period of eliminating them from their diet, there is evidence that they can be reintroduced into the diet in small doses at a later date. “Many people are able to reintroduce foods back into their diet once their immune system has ‘reset’. “I’m really pleased Emily is doing so well.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather tropical nights scorching","story":"NewsUK weather: Tropical nights and scorching summer days expected due to climate changeThe hottest summer days are getting hotter and the coldest extremes less bitingShareCommentsByEmily Beament:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video heavy-rain-incoming-watch-weather-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBrits could be in for much warmer weather as the climate continues to change, according to a report from the Met Office focusing on weather extremes.

Historians say it is the “ultimate find” after experts used satellite technology to solve the mystery of the famous ship’s last resting place. And now ers have recovered  pieces of evidence, including burnt wooden timbers and mast sections from the historic wreck. The USS Bonhomme Richard defeated the British Navy in home waters during the American War of Independence in . The incredible discovery, just off the coast near Filey, North Yorkshire, could bring in millions of pounds for the UK’s tourist industry. Experts believe Americans will flock to the Yorkshire coast to visit the birthplace of their navy. Their first ever American sea captain John Paul Jones took on the might of the English Royal Navy in the -gun ship, which was a gt from the French.Captain Jones had been sent to stop supplies reaching the English in America.  But on September , a vicious four-hour battle erupted after the US raider was intercepted by the -gun HMS Serapis, which had been escorting a convoy of supplies.The ships became locked together just off Flamborough Head. It was the bloodiest battle in naval record, with  men lost between them.Despite facing defeat, when Cpt Jones was asked to surrender by his British counterpart, he uttered the immortal line: “Sir, I have not yet begun to fight.” He eventually won the fight, even though his ship was burning and sinking. He boarded the Serapis, took it over and used it for the rest of the war. Now, a British specialist satellite firm from Harrogate, in North Yorks, claims to have found the ship. CEO of Merlin Burrows, Bruce Blackburn, , described it as the “ultimate find”. He said the US Navy had sent out at least  expeditions, including a nuclear submarine, to try to track down the wreck themselves. Mr Blackburn said: “We think they’ve spent in excess of million, but have been looking in the wrong place.They have relied on their own experts, who think the wreck is six miles off the coast. But Captain Jones says in his log the cannonballs were striking the clf as people stood witnessing the battle. You can’t do that six miles away. “We are % sure it is the Bonhomme Richard. The timbers we’ve recovered are burnt and it was the only ship that went down in flames.”Mr Blackburn also told how they had scans of two unusual bells which belonged to the ship. “This will cause a pilgrimage of American tourists to the Yorkshire coastline for the rest of time, so the Americans can get in touch with their naval heritage,” he said. “It’s the birth of their navy.

Edmund Zagorski died at approximately .pm local time just  minutes after a last minute of stay of exection was denied by the Supreme Court. He is the second man to die by electric chair in Tennessee since . According to witnesses, -year-old Zagorski was askedhe had any last words and he replied “let’s rock” shortly before the execution was carried out. According to local media Zagorski , who shot and slit the throats of two men in  during a drug deal, also “smiled and grimaced” as he was being prepared to die.  His lawyer Kelley Helen said she smiled at him and tapped her heart and later told the Tennessean: “I told him, when I put my hand over my heart, that was me holding him in my heart.” Reporters who witnessed the scene said that the Extraction Team - the team that extract a prisoner from the holding cell to the chair - then put a sponge with saline solution on Zagorski’s head and secured it with two straps. A hooded shroud followed. Ms Henry said he appeared to wave then clenched his fists as the first , jolts of electricity flowed into his body for  seconds and that his little fingers appeared to “dislocated or broken” due to the force of straining against the straps. She also said there were signs he was still breathing before the second bolt was administered for  seconds. A doctor then appeared and confirmed that Zagorski was dead.  According to his lawyer, he made the following statement before he was taken to the execution chamber: First of all I want to make it very clear I have no hard feelings. I don’t want any of you to have this on your conscience, you are all doing your job, and I’m good. It was very important to him that this not be a day of sadness for us, she added. He very much wanted a light mood, and he was in a light mood every time I saw him.  Zagorski chose the chair because he believed it wouldnt be as agonising as being killed by lethal injection. However, the man who built the chair, Fred Leuchter, had earlier revealed he feared it wouldnt work properly for Zagorskis execution and would be just as inhumane as the injection. The execution was initially set for October , but it was delayed because the state was not ready for an electrocution. For his last meal, Zagorski chose to dine on pickled pig knuckles and pigtails.  When he was previously on death watch, Zagorski chose not to order a last meal, but fellow death row inmates pooled their resources to give him a pizza dinner, the Tennessean also reported. Death row inmates are usually given to spend on a special meal before they are put to death. Zagorski was convicted of first-degree murder in the deaths of two men - John Dotson, , and Jimmy Porter,  - in . Then , he had convinced the pair he could supply them with lbs of cannabis and lured them into a wooded area in Tennessees Robertson County, where he shot them and slit their throats.

After someone complemented her on the beauty of her feet, Roxy Sykes, , realised she could break her way into the foot fetish industry. The property investor decided to set up an Instagram page to see how true the interest in her feet was, and after reaching over , followers in a month decided to listen to her fans. Roxy, from London, then started selling shoes and socks on her social media accounts for pound per pair of socks, and pound for shoes. Having been in the business for four years now, Roxy claims she can earn up to pound, in a busy month.  Roxy said: After being told by a colleague that I had beautul feet, I was convinced to set up a social media account to show them off. But it wasnt until I started getting thousands of followers and messages about selling used items that I realised I could profit from it. I didnt show my face or anything at first, so I knew people were just interested in me for my feet, so it didnt feel too personal. But when I started selling I got a real buzz from it, and realised just how much I could make from selling shoes and socks from time to time. I realised how much money I could truly make on my busiest month, where I saw over pound come in just for videos, socks and shoes. Now I can never see myself stopping this - however old I get my feet will always be able to make me money! After initially starting up her side project as just a social media account, Roxy knew she had to progress furthershe wanted to keep up with the competition. She said: Posting photos and videos of my feet was all well and good, but people always wanted more and wanted to physically own something to do with my feet.  I would be in business meetings, taking photos of my feet under the table, and getting an influx of messages by the hour askingthey could buy anything. So I moved my business onto dferent websites, as well as just social media, and suddenly started making pound a week from just one website alone. Pairs of shoes that I would wear for two months would sell for pound, and a pair of socks that I wore for a day would sell for pound. Then a single video of even me just wiggling my toes would make pound, so I was really raking in a lot of money. Despite the industry sometimes being frowned upon and retaining a lot of stigma, Roxy claims that she loves the buzz she gets from the fetish industry. She said: I really like what I do, and I think thats because I really got desensitized from it and saw it as work.  I have never had any trouble getting into relationships because of what I do, and my friends and family are on board with what I do. Its great to be able to get home from a normal working day to know I can make a bit of extra money from a photo of my feet. I know its something I will never stop doing - the money is so good and its so easy, theres no reason I would! Alongside setting up her own business, Roxy has helped to mentor fellow fetish models. She said: I have started to train dferent models in how to get into the fetish industry and make money like I am. Its great to be able to help others and teach people my apparent talent so that they can follow what I do. Its also amazing to see peoples confidence grow when they make these videos and start to earn money from something like a pair of socks. Working as a team together also helps to beat the stigma and make the industry less frowned upon.

In a post on Tumblr, the -year-old explained how she worked for a middle-aged man who used to slate tampon machines in the womens toilets. He insisted theyre not necessary which she thought was odd. One day she said she asked him to go to the bathroom and he said no, asking why she had to go so suddenly. She explained her period started and he started ranting and raving.  She wrote: He started ranting about how lazy women were. How we wasted time. How we were so careless and unhygienic, and that there was no call for that.He finished by telling me that I certainly was NOT going to the ladies room and that I was just going to sit there and work. He finished this off with a decisive nod, asId just been told and there could be no possible argument. It then turned out that he didnt understand that there was any urgent reason why she should get to the bathroom.She said that he replied to her: Wait, you mean thatyou don’t go, you’ll just keep on bleeding  I thought that women could turn it off any time that they wanted! It turned out he had no idea about periods at all, thinking periods can be turned off and that women use tampons to masturbate with. The woman wrote: He actually thought a that women could shut down the menstrual cycle at will, b that we essentially picked a week per month to spend more time in the bathroom, i.e. to goof off, and c that napkins and tampons were sex toys. Just wow.Although its tricky to very the story, research shows a lack of understanding about periods is scarily common. According to one study, theres a serious lack of education about menstruation in UK schools with  per cent of young people not learning anything about them at all. Lack of education feeds into ridiculous myths about women enjoying using tampons and so on - although theres really no excuse for grown adults to be so grossly ill-informed."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle steps out daring","story":"NewsMeghan Markle steps out in daring see-through Givenchy skirt on final day of royal tourThe Duchess of Sussex wore an elegant pleated skirt and navy jumper by her wedding dress designerShareCommentsByNicola OakleyHead of Audience:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video duchess-sussex-gives-big-hug-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeghan Markle slipped into a stunning bespoke Givenchy outfit on the final day of her first overseas tour with husband Prince Harry.

In certain lights, when Meghan was outdoors meeting the public on a walkabout, her skirt appeared to turn see-through where the pleats flatten out, revealing her underwear line and a flash of bare leg. The lower part of the dress has black and lighter blue stripes, giving an optical illusion that she is showing her legs the whole way down. Its not clear whether this is another wardrobe mal - Meghan was dubbed very relatable after leaving the tag on one of her outfits last week - or a totally intentional choice by the fashion-forward Duchess. Meghan is fast becoming a fashion icon, known for her bold statements, so its entirely possible she was aware the skirts material was quite sheer. It was also bespoke and not off the rack - and the choice of designer seems to be a meaningful one for Meghan.  The beautul pleated navy skirt was designed by Claire Waight Keller, for Givenchy, who also created Meghans stunning bridal gown and bridesmaid dresses for her wedding in May.

streets","story":"People in Lochee are afraid to go out at night because of poor street lighting, it has been claimed.Local residents have asked Dundee City Council to do something to improve the lighting in the area.However, the local authority says it meets current UK standards.Residents have spoken out following an incident in Lochee in September when a man was allegedly attacked and robbed on the footpath running between Forth Crescent and South Road.Speaking to a meeting of Lochee Local Community Planning Partnership, Stella Carrington, chairwoman of Charleston Tenants and Residents’ Association, said that the incident – combined with “poor lighting” – had left people afraid to venture out after dark.Ms Carrington said: “There’s no doubt that the quality of street lighting in the area is very poor.“People, particularly the elderly, are afraid to head out at night because it is so dark.“There was an incident reported where a man was attacked and robbed in the South Road area.“It is particularly bad there because the lighting is not good enough and street lights are also obscured by trees on South Road.“The robbery has left people afraid – and it’s not only the older ones who are worried.“I’ve also spoken to young mums with prams who don’t like walking in the area and people are not happy letting their children out to play now that it is darker earlier.“It would be goodthe city council could take a look at the lighting and improve it.“It’s not only South Road – other parts of Lochee are also affected and people don’t feel safe.”A council spokesman said: “All

hair and make-up experts is waiting in the wings to ensure each participant is hot to trot on November .Freedom Hair, which has salons in Dundee city centre and Broughty Ferry, will be taking charge of each couple’s look for the contest being judged by TV presenter Gok Wan.Salon owner Irving Miskell-Reid has assembled a crack team of  stylists who have been holding consultations with the dancers to come up with ideas to match both their costumes and dance routine.Irving said: “We have really collaborated with them all.“The consultations have been to decide what style of dance that they are doing, what music they are using, what outfits they have pulled together and what they envisage their final look to be.”Looking ahead to the evening, he said: “On the night each couple will get a glamour photo just before they go on stage.“We’ve got a table and we’re very much looking forward to it. Our main thing is to get the contestants ready.“The stylists are doing all the hair, I am just co-ordinating it. I daresay my hands will be in there somewhere on the night, but it will really be the Freedom team mainly.”Freedom Hair is a regular supporter of Help for Kids, which Strictly Come Prancing is in support of. The charity, run by manager Stacey Wallace and co-ordinator Hannah Kemlo, supports local children through the provision of inidual funding, as well as funding for clubs and organisations.Irving said: “If Stacey and Hannah ask, we do. Whatever they think we could offer to help them raise funds, then we are willing to do that.”Stylist Claire Murray said: “It’s really fun and exciting, it’s for a good cause. I think it will be a good night.“The consultations have been quite in-depth, we’ve got what the theme is, what they are wearing, what type of make-up, so we know what it all fits into.”Kezia Miskell-Reid is organising the make-up artists for the night and will also be making an appearance as a judge.Kezia, a beauty therapist, said: “I’ve put together a team of freelance make-up artists.“The make-up scene in Dundee is really, really good right now, there are a lot of excellent freelance make-up artists.”Kezia says they have four artists so far, Carol Paterson, Steph Devlin, Jillian Elizabeth and Emily Patterson.She added: “I love being involved with Help for Kids.”Carol said: “I am doing the make-up with a few others. I have been put in charge which I am extremely excited about. It’s amazing that Dundee is doing a great thing for charity especially. I am so privileged to be part of it all.“I have taken part in previous events to raise money for Help for Kids along with Freedom Hair who helped me get involved. So it’s amazing to take part again. It’s good to give something back.

Other outfits in the Championship quickly worked out while getting the ball quickly was an option,that wasn’t on they’d have time to get the ball under control and pass their way up the pitch.As Partick Thistle, Inverness Caley Thistle and now Dunfermline have discovered, it’s been all change under the new manager.When his team lose the ball they will work hard, fast and high up the pitch to get it back as quickly as possible.That brought them their goals in Robbie’s opening game at Firhill, when for both strikes home players actually had good possession in their own half but were caught out by the speed with which they were closed down.And in the draw against ICT and in Saturday’s win over the Pars, a feature of United’s play was the number of times they won the ball back in, or near, the opponent’s defensive third.Watching from the stands, what is striking about the new policy is the amount of ground it involves the attacking players covering. At the sharp end has been Pavol Safranko. Fortunately for United, as well as being a talented goalscorer, the Slovakian prides himself on his work-rate.At the weekend he almost literally ran himself into the ground – going down with cramp in injury time and being forced off.Not far behind have been the attacking midfield trio of Paul McMullan, Fraser Aird and Billy King. As well as being expected to get forward and get on the ball, there is little respite for them when the other team’s defenders have it.Delighted as he’s been with that quartet’s attitude to a side of the game creative players do not always relish, Robbie stressed the system only works and will continue to,every outfield player buys into it.One chink in the armour though and he knows it will fall apart, allowing the other team to find men with space and time to hurt United.“Pavol’s been great. I know that he’s a very good player and, as I’ve said, I knew about him before I came here because I’d seen him play at Aalborg ,” said the gaffer.“But we also have McMullan, King, Aird, the boys behind, doing a lot of running as well.“And I’m a big believer that when we go and press, even when we’re attacking, the defence have got a big role to play in it as well.“If we’re asking forward players to go and run , ,  yards to go and press people, then the midfielders and defenders have to do it as well.“There is a responsibility on them to go and do it as well. As a team we are getting better at it, but it’s early days, we’re only three games in.”That note of caution possibly stems from the fact, although he’s been pleased with the way the players have taken to the tactic, the next couple of weeks could provide sterner tests of it.Partick and the Pars have been struggling for form and while Inverness remain the only unbeaten second tier team, as five of them in a row indicates, they have become the draw specialists of the ision.Up next are Queen of the South and leaders Ross County, two sides who might just be better equipped to cope with the high press."},{"url":null,"title":"tom duthie neil mccann tried to change too much too soon at dundee","story":"When Neil McCann looks back on his time as Dundee boss he will surely learn several lessons, ones that can stand him in good steadhe s to management.Perhaps the most obvious will be that, whatever your football philosophy, it has to be tapered to suit the resources you have available when it comes to players.McCann’s mantra at Dens was to play passing football at all times and, ultimately, at all costs. That led to too many goals being lost by errors as, at high risk, the ball was played out from the back.It became increasingly clear some of his defenders in particular were not comfortable with this policy but the manager was not for budging and persevered with the style of play he was convinced would, ultimately, bring success.The number of goals it cost made it inevitable what many saw as stubbornness was what cost McCann his job.That is, perhaps, an over-simplication and, now the dust has settled on the former Scotland international’s departure, a more in-depth look throws up other factors.A look at the players he used in his eight Premiership games in charge this term highlights another couple of causes for his downfall.First off, the list of those involved looks too long. In just two-and-a-half months of league football, Dundee fielded  dferent players.Of course, injury and suspension means some of the constant stream of changes were enforced, but others suggest he was never totally sure of what his best line-up was. Given the style of play he wanted, this lack of consistency in selection had to be an issue.Arguably, an even bigger one was that he fell into the rookie manager’s trap of trying to make too many changes too quickly.The Premiership may not be one of the top leagues in Europe but it does have its own unique qualities. One of them, as most new arrivals testy, is the tempo of the play here is more frantic than in many other countries.Even players coming up from England, where the pace is higher than on the continent, usually comment on that.What that means is players from where have to be given time to adjust and, as they do, it’s important they have men around them who are already experienced campaigners in our top ision.A glance down the list of the men used this season suggests there were not enough performers who fitted into that category.Of the  he used, nine were completely new to the league, while eight others had no more than a season’s experience of it.Ironically, the most used who fell into those categories was when  started the solitary win at Hamilton last month but, in the other outings, seven or eight such players were used.That’s not saying these players are not good enough for this level but, as most experienced managers in any league will say, whatever the level of talent, having so many who are not familiar with their surroundings is a risk they wouldn’t be prepared to take.While McCann did bring in vastly-experienced Premiership performer Kenny Miller at the end of the summer transfer window, the loss through injury of Paul McGowan had to be a major blow.And it should not be seen as insignicant that, as he’s scoured the free-agent market since his arrival as manager, new boss Jim McIntyre has paid particular attention to men who know the top flight well.Martin Woods is expected to sign up once he’s proved his fitness, though Celtic on Wednesday may be too early for that. Woods’ old Ross County team-mate from when McIntyre was in charge, Paul Quinn, has also been linked."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/5bdad577ee4ff.jpg ","title":"workers fume as dundee council introduces heavy handed ban on smoking and vaping on shift","story":"Dundee City Council workers face disciplinary actionthey smoke on sht under a new policy which has been branded “heavy-handed”.The policy, seen by the Tele ahead of it coming into force on Thursday, explicitly bans staff from smoking on company time.This applies when they are outside, travelling between offices and on tea breaks, meaning workers can only smoke on unpaid lunch breaks. vw, px\"  The ban applies evensmokers aren’t identiable as council workers and does not distinguish between cigarettes and vaping.Those who flout the policy face “disciplinary action”.George Barr, local Unite convener, slammed the plan as “heavy-handed” and said some workers feared losing their jobs.Mr Barr said: “We have been asking what help the council will give and it doesn’t look like it will be anything substantial.“The council should be helping people to give upit wants to enforce this policy, especiallypeople could potentially be sacked for smoking. This is an attack on people who smoke. It’s not an easy thing to give up – and not everyone wants to either.”Council workers who spoke to the Tele on condition of anonymity don’t believe the policy will be enforceable.One said: “I think this is going to affect a lot of people. I can see why the council is doing it but I don’t think they’re doing it in the right way. I smoke about  a day. When I first heard about the policy I thought about buying a vape but they’re banning those too.“A lot of the older people are worried they’ll lose their jobsthey get caught, and they’ll lose their pensions – pensions that are in tobacco. It’s ludicrous.”Dundee, together with Angus and Perth and Kinross Councils, invests £. million of pension money in tobacco firms through the Tayside Pension Fund. Another worker said enforcing the ban could create rts between employees and their managers.“I don’t think it’s enforceable,” the worker said. “Managers are going to have to go round telling people to put it out and that’s going to be more hassle for them.“The council is going about this completely the wrong way.“Look at the NHS’s no-smoking policy – you still have to walk through a cloud of smoke to get in the front door at Ninewells.” The council says the move is a response to a Scottish Government report which called on authorities to adopt “fully smoke-free policies”.A government spokeswoman said it encouraged councils to “make their grounds smoke-free”, adding: “Cosla has published guidance for local authorities on how to implement this.”Cosla, which represents most Scottish councils, said authorities were ultimately free to choose how to impose a smoking policy.A spokesman added: “Councils play a vital role in improving public health outcomes for our communities and this often begins with our own staff policies and our own premises.”Council bosses claim the policy will protect adults, and reduce the number of adult “role models” seen smoking in public by children.A spokesman for the local authority said: #The council has revised its smoking policy as we are working to protect the health of employees and also promote positive health messages across the wider community, in line with the agreed #Our People Strategy# and health and wellbeing framework.#The council is committed to helping achieve the national targets on reducing smoking in the Scottish Government’s #Creating a Tobacco-Free Generation# strategy.#A key part of that approach involves discouraging children and young people from taking up smoking.#One way to assist that is to reduce the number of adult ‘role models’ who can be seen smoking in public.#Across Dundee, there has been the introduction of voluntary no-smoking areas at children#s playparks and we will be looking to extend this to  more open spaces in the future.#The new policy mirrors recent changes brought into effect by NHS Tayside and by other councils across Scotland. The council will assist any employees who want to try to give up smoking.#There was detailed discussion with trade unions during the formation of the new policy and employees will be able to ask their line managers about the implications for them at the start of this early implementation stage.#"},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged pound million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"hydro-turns-five-meet-the-head-of-entertainment-who-spoke-on-anniversary","story":"OVER five million concert-goers in five years have visited the SSE Hydro...a figure which has exceeded the expectations of the woman responsible for bringing some of the worlds biggest acts to Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas -

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities. Alzheimer Scotland wants to make sure that people with dementia and their carers can work with local decision makers, helping to influence important decisions about how vital care and support is delivered in their area.We need your help to ensure people with dementia and carers get the best possible standard of care and support, anywhere in Scotland.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

The Star youngsters will find out on Tuesday October  who their opponents will be in the next round.Lastly, two former Soccer Centre kids and members of the Red Star  team are now playing for Rangers Girls under s.

So many of our players have had really big matches for their clubs in the lead up to the international but they are done now and our total focus is on Ireland this Saturday.#The spine of the squad is from Newtonmore and that should not be any surprise given they have just won the treble.#There are a few Argyll representatives aside from the team captain. Irvine#s Kyles team-mate Roddy MacDonald has also been selected and there are places for Oban Camanachd duo Lorne Dickie and Andrew MacCuish.The Scottish mantra in recent games has been to keep the ball on the ground and to use the wide open spaces to stretch the Irish defence and not allow the hurlers to build up a head of steam with their aerial game.Caberfeidh’s dead-ball expert Kevin Bartlett will again be key and he scored twelve of Scotland’s eighteen points a year ago.There are no rule changes as such this year but there will be an Irish referee, John Keane, which brings its own dimension.Garry Reid added: #The interpretation of the rules will be key. In general, Irish referees tend to let more go and there may be more of a tendency to get away with hands on the back and perhaps more pulling and shoving.#We’ll just need to be careful and concentrate on our game.

And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13513457.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Silverburn.jpg","title":"big changes set stagecoach bus","story":"NewsBig changes set for Stagecoach bus timetables in Ayrshire as operator ditches Silverburn serviceOperator Stagecoach said new timetables would \"better reflect our customers travel habits\".ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT NewsStagecoachs Ayr base \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSweeping changes are planned for the Stagecoach bus network - and the direct shoppers express to the Silverburn mall is to be put off the road due to lack of trade. Stagecoach insist they have to keep developing the Ayrshire network and fish where the passengers are. And they say: “These changes better reflect our customers travel habits. “A number of these changes will deliver improvements in reliability and frequency, while others will offer a service proportionate to demand.” The switches in service are planned to begin operating in January. The changes were discussed by the Ayrshire Bus Users Group in Troon on Saturday. Watchers are particularly interested in the failed route which served the Silverburn mall in Pollok at weekends. It was launched exactly two years ago with the now departed managing director Tom Bridge crowing: “Shopping habits are changing from traditional high streets.” Ayrshire traders, however, deemed it a slap in the face. But of the X from Ayr, Prestwick and Kilmarnock to Silverburn, they now admit: “Our plan is to remove this service due to very low passenger numbers.”  Stagecoach’s Ayr HQ is wanting passenger feedback on the plans and staged an information day at Ayr Town Hall on Monday. Travellers are now likely to get back their direct Ayr to Irvine number  route via Troon. The last change the company made was to introduce a A which will be scrapped. But this will only be every  minutes. The new  route will take in Barassie, Monkton and Loans. That means Loans will no longer get the  coaster which had erted through the Main Street off the A. Belmont would no longer get the number six which was every  minutes. Instead it will get the number seven every  minutes - andpassenger numbers dont improve it may also be culled. The number two will pull out of Dalmilling and Hayhill, with the areas served by the number one and three. Stagecoach want to sht the X to Hamilton from Ayr away from Prestwick and take it up Whitletts Road. The number  from Ayr to Muirkirk will lose some early and late night services due to some routes shting via the Cumnock depot. The busy X from Ayr to Glasgow is to get extra capacity. The company want new departures from Ayr at .am, .pm, .pm, .pm, .pm. Extra s would be .am, .am, .am, .pm and the .pm to Doonfoot.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnGlasgowAyrKilmarnockTroonPrestwickCumnockAyr NewsStagecoach"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13489965.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18066403.jpg","title":"partick thistle 0 ayr united","story":"NewsPartick Thistle , Ayr United  - Three things we learned at FirhillA Michael Rose header secured all three points for United in Glasgow as Ian McCalls men kept up their remarkable title challenge.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsMichael Roses header crosses the line to hand Ayr victory \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr Uniteds title bandwaggon kept on rolling in Glasgow as Michael Roses second half header earned a deserved three points for the visitors. Ian McCalls men, who saw two penalty appeals turned down, eventually gained their reward when Rose climbed to bullet home a Declan McDaid corner. It was no more than United deserved for another battling display on the road and keeps them firmly in touch with leaders Ross County at the summit. Heres three things we learned on another big afternoon for the Honest Men: Rose rises to the occasion Hes been immense for Ayr at the back this season but Michael Rose was the hero at the other end today and he climbed to power home Uniteds deserved winner. The former Aberdeen man has formed an impressive defensive partnership with Jamie Adams - and once again the pair were fantastic at Firhill. But Rose proved his threat in the opposition box when rising to bullet home Declan McDaids corner, coming as it did at the end of concerted Ayr pressure. Rose looks to have a bright future in the game and he deservedly gains the headlines today.  Whistler Bobby sends Ayr raving Madden - AGAIN It would be fair to say Ayr boss Ian McCall and ref Bobby Madden arent the greatest of pals. McCall made his feelings on the whistler well known after Ayrs trip to Ibrox earlier this season - and United were on the end of a string of hotly disputed calls here. Madden waved away two first half penalty shouts and angered Ayr with a number of other baffling calls which threatened to send the game past boiling point in the second half.  McCall wins battle of the bosses On a day when all eyes were on the Thistle dugout and Gary Caldwell making his home debut, Ian McCall made yet another triumphantto his old stomping ground. Ayrs wily gaffer made two big calls in starting Craig Moore and Declan McDaid and his men responded in style with another fine performance. McCall is not afraid of the big decisions and appears to be juggling his squad to perfection at the moment, as proven by this display where his team selection and tactics proved spot on.

Scottish Parliament yesterday .Universal Credit was introduced as part of the UK Governments overhaul of the welfare system.Critics say cuts to payments and widespread problems with its implementation have led to many people falling into hardship or dropping out of the benefit system altogether.The introduction of the two-child benefit cap, limiting tax credits and Universal Credit to a familys first two children has also been attacked.And the Tory list MSPs attempt to justy the two-child cap this week was met with anger and disbelief.Ms Ballantyne told Holyrood: \"The two-child limit is about fairness.\"It is fair that people on benefit cannot have as many children as they like while people who work and pay their way and dont claim benefits have to make decisions about the number of children they can have.\"Universal Credit may have its flaws, but the thinking behind the system is sound.\"It is about making it better to be in work than not to be in work.\"MSPs were debating inequality, austerity and poverty when Ms Ballantyne mounted her defence.Nationalist MSP Tom Arthur described her words as one of the most disgraceful speeches Ive ever heard.He said: \"In my two and half years in this parliament, the contribution from Michelle Ballantyne was one of the most disgraceful speeches I have ever heard.\"Six minutes of pompous Victorian moralising, that would have been

amazing.\"We were told that we could sing just one song, but having heard us, we were asked to sing another.\"This happened on the first morning of the trip, and I was afraid that everything  we had planned for the weekend would be an anti-climax. I neednrsquot have worried. Barcelona did us proud.The next major event took place in the beautul old church of Sant Gaieta in the Eixample District of the city, where the priest raises money for an African mission by staging regular quality concerts.A large, very discerning, audience took the choir to its heart, with many of them coming backstage to express their thanks.The following day InChorus travelled to Sabadell, north of Barcelona, where they were introduced to Coral Catasons, a contemporary choir of similar size.The choirs performed a joint concert to a full house, receiving a standing ovation, with some excellent hospitality from the Spanish choir and some hilarious Catalonian entertainment for afters.Friendships were formed on the back of which Coral Catasons has announced its intention to visit Peebles and the wider Scottish Borders next June.The final scheduled event was an hour-long performance on the steps of the magnicent Barcelona Cathedral.Lorna added: \"To stand in such a location singing in the sunshine to a fantastic audience was extraordinary. The choir loved it.\"On the plane to Catalonia - at the suggestion of the pilot - and at other points throughout the trip, the choir took the opportunity to sing whenever and wherever they could, especially in the beautul squares and open spaces of the Gothic Quarter around La Rambla.As the days progressed, whether singing or sight seeing, members were recognised increasingly.Men in kilts are an instant attraction, and this, combined with the gentsrsquo Catalonian coloured bright teeshirts bearing a line in Spanish from lsquoHavanarsquo, a piece from the choirrsquos repertoire, ensured a positive response everywhere.In the course of the few days they were congratulated and spoken to by people from all around the world including South America, the United States, Canada, all over Europe, Russia, India, the Middle East, the Far East and Australia.To cap this there was the warm welcome extended to the choir by the Spanish people.Accompanying the choir through all its derring-do was the InChorus mascot, Singu, a penguin given to the choir by the family of the late Celia Hayton, a much loved choir member.Musical Director, Aly Skidmore, added: ldquoInChorus decided over a year ago that Barcelona would be the perfect city in which to properly celebrate its first decade.\"The culture there embraces all the arts, but music particularly.

The rampant home side completely outplayed the visitors who looked out of sorts and overwhelmed by the occasion.For those who witnessed the second half, what followed was one of the finest and most unlikely comebacks they will ever experience.Claremont blitzed the unsuspecting Pupils from the outset, scoring in their first attack of the match.Before a breath was drawn, a surging run and cross by Claremont’s tall centre-forward was promptly dispatched into the back of the net at the back post.It was a case of backs to the wall for the visitors who, after a number of close shaves, found themselves two behind midway through the first half.This time the damage was self-inflicted, when an innocuous cross from the left was palmed into the path of the incoming striker who scored with ease from close range.The alarm bells now ringing loudly, with  minutes of the half remaining the visitors somehow conjured a goal against the run of play.A breakout by Ryan Deans ended with a fine pass to set up Sary Rhama, whose pace and parting shot almost took the net away.The home side, however, were unrelenting in their efforts and deservedly restored a two-goal cushion with a goal just before the break.A reading of the riot act at half time appeared to have the desired effect as, after a number of changes, both positional and to personnel, the second period produced a whole new ball game.Leading the line from the front, the introduction of Cameron Wylie was the key to the comeback, his unrelenting efforts to close space soon rewarded as his team responded in kind.A quick interchange of passes between Deans and Grumoli brought its reward, leaving the latter free to curl a wonderful shot into the top corner of the net. The comeback was on.Liam Renton joined the act in the th minute of a strange match after a headed clearance met with a flush volley as a superbly struck shot thundered into the net for the equaliser.There was time aplenty for the Pupils to shoot themselves in the foot again, and Claremont regained the initiative when Fraser Wylie mistimed a clearance to send the ball into his own net.At the opposite end – possibly goal of the match.Astothe gesture, a deep free kick from Renton produced another equaliser, the home defence’s attempted clearance rebounding off a fellow team mate and into the net.So came the final moments of the game, with Cameron Wylie again involved.A crunching challenge on Wylie seemed to be an obvious free kick, but the referee waved play on.Gary Grumoli sent an inch perfect pass to the back post, for Ross Brown to score his first team goal and the Pupils# eventual, but by now, deserved winner.In a clf-hanging finish to a game that had everything, Alastair Ferguson produced a wonderful one-handed save to deflect a perfectly struck free kick to safety.Campbeltown Pupils are at home tomorrow with a pm kick off against second-placed Neilston.See posters and social media for further information.A previous celebration for Gary Grumoli and Liam Renton two stars of Saturday#s match. _cpupils_celebration"},{"url":null,"title":"letter perfect bus service","story":"Last week I went to Glasgow, travelling on the .am bus and arrived only  minutes behind schedule despite the Rest and Be Thankful road closure.I was very impressed with West Coast Motors# handling of the situation which must cause transport companies huge logistical problems.Margaret Mathieson,Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"seniors sway at tea dance soiree","story":"Senior citizens and friends were serenaded at the last tea dance of the year.Singer Robert McCallum#s golden oldies got almost everyone dancing at Saturday#s event in Campbeltown#s Lodge St John’s No .At the event organised by the Monday Social Club, guests were also treated to traditional tunes courtesy of Carradale#s Alex MacKinnon and his accordion.It wasn#t just seniors who enjoyed the afternoon, as ten-year-old Hannah Conley, who attended with her granny, Isabel, who turned  on Tuesday, was rarely off the dance floor.The icing on the cake was the copious amounts of home-baking and tea and coffee on offer, making sure everyone who danced the afternoon away remained hydrated.The event raised £ for Monday Social Club funds.For more photographs, see next week#s Courier.Ten-year-old Hannah Conley, right, danced the afternoon away with her granny#s friend Anna Viola. _cteadance"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane october 26 2018","story":"In the Courier, of November  ,  years on from Armistice Day, the Remembrance services were reported with six paragraphs on the front page and no pictures.Perhaps this was because the world seemed a more dangerous place.The Vietnam War was at roughly its mid-point and was to continue for another seven years.Horric pictures, shot war photographers such as Don McCuillin and Tim Page, filled #s daily papers and television news.In the UK The Troubles had just begun in Northern Ireland after a civil rights march, on October , led to widespread rioting.That  report states: #Highland Parish Church was the venue for the main service with contingents of ious armed forces and youth organisations parading there.#Unfortunately, the annual service at the War Memorial on the Esplanade had to be cancelled because of inclement weather and the service was held indoor at Victoria Hall.#Representatives of the RAF, the Royal Navy, the TA, Sea Cadets, Boy Scouts, Girl Guides and Army Cadets marched to the Highland Parish Church where Reverend C.

The remains of the castle are ancient and the oldest part is called Goblin Ha. It is partly underground, and its name means Goblin Hall.According to legend, a wizard named Hugh de Gford made a deal with the Devil nearly  years ago, and inan army of goblins swarmed up from hell and built Yester Castle for him. Goblin Ha is the part of the castle dating from that time and thatrsquos how it got its name.It is said goblins lurk in the shadows of the ruins, and especially in Goblin Ha itself. At sunset, when night falls, they come out of their hiding places and crawl about in the darkness.One autumn day quite recently a dad decided to take his two children on a trip to find Yester Castle. He worked long hours during the week so he kept weekends for his children.His daughter Suzie had just turned  and his son Jake was eight. Jake was mad about Harry Potter and wizards, and when he discovered there was a castle nearby made by goblins for a wizard he begged his dad to take him. Suzie was given the choice to stay at home with her mum, but at the last minute she decided to come.It was sunny when they set off. ldquoA perfect day to explore a castle made by goblins, said the dad jokingly. They parked at the golf course and walked towards the woods.ldquoMaybe the goblins play golf, Suzie joked to her wee brother.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot make fun, they might hear you, he said.They finally reached the edge of the wood and peered into it. Suzie found the bridge over the ravine that led to the ruins but then Jake ran ahead very excited, looking for goblins.It was dficult to imagine what the castle had originally looked like because it was so ruined. Jake said it reminded him of the ancient ruined temple in The Jungle Book movie. But one thing was for sure: it had an eerie atmosphere. As they explored, the dad walked under an archway and suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He turned round and saw something move in the shadows.For a moment they stood absolutely still. Then a bird flew out, giving them a fright. The dad and Suzie burst into laughter.ldquoJust a stupid bird! said Jake, disappointed.After a careful search they found the entrance to Goblin Ha. It was a small entrance leading to a low, dark passageway. Jake bravely led the way, with his sister and dad close behind.A cold and damp atmosphere hit them as soon as they entered the chamber. Although it was dark, two windows above gave just enough light to see.ldquoSo all this was supposed to have been made by goblins  asked Suzie.ldquoYeah, said Jake, who was still getting over the excitement that he was actually in Goblin Ha, ldquoand they came from hell up that stairway. He pointed to the dark steps in the corner.All three stood peering into the dark stairway which plunged deep into the ground.ldquoAccording to the legend, this stairway was made by the Devil after he had done a deal with the wizard and it leads to hell. But itrsquos blocked up now, explained Jake. He looked at his father: ldquoCan we go down dad, please!ldquoSeems a bit dangerous to me son.ldquoAw, come on dad, said Suzie, ldquowe canrsquot come all this way and then not go down the stairway to hell.ldquoVery well, but Irsquoll go first and wersquoll use the torches on our phones, said the dad.Slowly they began to climb down the stairs. The light from their mobiles lit up the old walls and ancient worn steps as they descended. Suzie took photos in the darkness, although the flash wasnrsquot powerful enough to light up everything.Eventually they reached a point where great stones blocked the way so they couldnrsquot go any further. ldquoThey were put there to keep out the goblins, said Jake. His sister was now feeling a bit uneasy: ldquoCan we go now, dad  Itrsquos too spooky down here.ldquoScared of the goblins are we  her wee brother mocked.ldquoYes, letrsquos go back up, said the dad. Jake led the way up to Goblin Ha. ldquoItrsquos time we should be going, wersquove found the place so mission accomplished. Itrsquoll be dark soon, letrsquos go now while therersquos still good day light.So they left the ruins and walked back across the golf course, laughing and talking and admiring the beginnings of a sunset and a full moon in the darkening sky. They were at the car when Suzie realised she didnrsquot have her mobile phone.ldquoIt was in my back pocket, it mustrsquove fallen out, she insisted.ldquoAw no Suzie, it could be anywhere, her dad said, annoyed.ldquoDad, we have to go back to get it, please. I know I had it in Goblin Ha, it might have even fallen out there. The dad wasnrsquot happy but the mobile was expensive and so reluctantly he agreed.They retraced their steps all the way back to the castle. It had only been  minutes since they had left the ruins but the atmosphere in the dim twilight was very dferent.Finally they reached the entrance to Goblin Ha.ldquoYou go first, dad, said both children at the same time.And so the dad put on his torch and entered. His children followed close behind.When they emerged into Goblin Ha it was dark so the dad shone his torch on the ground, searching. ldquoWhere could you have left it  he asked Suzie.ldquoAnywhere, she replied, shrugging her shoulders.They couldnrsquot phone it as there was no reception, so they kept searching.It was Jake who heard it first: a faint sound coming from the dark stairway. He lted his head and looked in its direction but it was too dark to see anything. There it was again, it sounded like breathing.Jake froze in real terror. ldquoDadhellip he whispered, ldquodad, therersquos something there.ldquoStop it you wee bam, said his sister, ldquoyoursquore just trying to spook us. But then she heard it too. It was louder this time, a strange breathing sound. It was definitely coming from the stairway.Intrigued, the dad shone his light down the steps, although the mobilersquos torch wasnrsquot strong enough to completely light up the dark.Then suddenly a pair of red eyes appeared, staring back at him.The dad screamed, making his two children scream as well, and they instinctively ran for the exit. But it was dark and they couldnrsquot see the way.ldquoDad, for Godrsquos sake shine it over here, cried Suzie, now completely terried.The dad shone the torch and they ran through the passageway in a total panic. Once outside there was more light, from the full moon.ldquoWhy did you scream, you scared the hell out of me! Suzie shouted angrily at her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry Suzie, it just gave me a fright, I didnrsquot mean to scare you, he said.ldquoWhat gave you a fright, what did you see dad  asked Jake, who was now scared himself despite his earlier bravado.ldquoNot sure really, I thought I saw, erhellipldquoYes, yes what  asked Suzie stretching out her arms impatiently.The dad hesitated, then said: ldquoWell it looked like eyes.ldquoI am now officially freaked out, said Suzie, ldquoplease letrsquos just get out of here, never mind the sodding phone.ldquoIrsquom sure it was some kind of animal, maybe a fox or even an owl, said her dad, trying to reassure her, ldquobut yes itrsquos too dark now, we should go back to the car and maybe we can come back tomorrow in the light to look for your mobile.Jake was suddenly distracted. He saw something in the passageway.ldquoDadhellip dad, whatever it is, itrsquos coming after us, look!The shadow of some creature was in the passageway, moving towards them.Both Suzie and Jake were now in a state of complete terror and they ran.ldquoNo, no, itrsquos dangerous, therersquos a steep fall there, donrsquot run! called out the dad.The kids stopped just in time. In the moonlight they could see they were standing on the edge of a steep fall. Their dad caught up with them and took their hands. They walked together carefully with hearts racing through the trees towards the bridge that led to the golf course.Behind them, a dark shadow came out of the entrance and crawled into the wood.They were just past the arched wall when they saw the dark shadow move in front of them, blocking the way. The dad shone his torch directly at it, and for a split second he saw it before it vanished into the darkness. He looked shocked.ldquoWhat the hell was that, dad  shrieked Suzie.ldquoI honestly donrsquot know, he saidWhatever it was, it was still in the woods, moving in the darkness. Then it came towards them once again, this time making strange noises.Jake suddenly yelled out: ldquoOur father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, in heaven as it is on earthhellip Whatever it was made a sound like a scream and retreated back into the dark wood towards Goblin Ha. Jake continued the prayer and finished with a loud ldquoamen.ldquoLetrsquos get out of here, said the dad. All three ran in the moonlight out of the shadows of the wood onto the golf course. They kept running until they reached the car park, legs aching and completely breathless.The dad fumbled for his keys while the children stared at the golf course, looking for a moving shadow.Finally the dad found his keys and they were in the car and away as fast as possible.Suzie was the first to speak: ldquoI ask again, what was it ldquoI think the dark was playing tricks on us, said her dad, ldquoit was an animal of some sort.ldquoBut what about that horrible scream  she asked.ldquoFoxes can make a strange screeching noise at night, Suzie, thatrsquos what I think it was, said her dad, trying to reassure her.ldquoIt was a goblin, wasnrsquot it dad  asked Jake.ldquoAye right, replied his sister sarcastically, ldquoyou read too much Harry Potter. And what was all that praying about  That was just weird.ldquoIt was a redcap goblin, said Jake, ldquoyou canrsquot outrun them and the Lordrsquos Prayer is the only thing that will stop them. I had memorised it before our visit, just in case.ldquoHowrsquod you know that  asked SuzieldquoI read about it, said Jake.Suzie was just about to say something when her dad winked at her and interrupted: ldquoWellit was a redcap then the prayer seemed to work. He hoped this would stop them arguing. And it did. Jake smiled and put on his earphones.ldquoIrsquom sure it was a fox, whispered the dad to his daughter, ldquoor maybe a big rat, but just let Jake think it was a goblin.They got home with a story to tell their mum!In a quiet moment, when the children were busy, she asked the dad: ldquoSo what was it you saw He hesitated to answer the question, ashe wouldnrsquot be believed.ldquoTo be honest, I donrsquot know, he said. ldquoI told the kids it was a fox because I didnrsquot want to spook them, but I really canrsquot say.Who knows the truth of it all  If Suziersquos phone is ever found, the photos she took in the dark stairway might reveal what was really hiding in the darkness on that day."},{"url":null,"title":"be-prepared-for-next-beast-from-the-east-says-council-emergency-planner","story":"Severe weather is the biggest risk to people living in East Lothian, according to Sandy Baptie.And he has issued advice ahead of a one-day workshop to help communities prepare for any future emergencies.It includes going back to old-fashioned handsets in a time when more people rely on mobile phones.Mr Baptie, East Lothian Councilrsquos emergency planning, risk and resilience manager, has been visiting community councils and groups in the wake of the lsquoBeast from the Eastrsquo snowstorm, which brought much of the country to a standstill in February and March this year.Heavy snowfalls and strong winds caused chaos on the roads and left many people stranded in their homes.It also saw a surge in community spirit, with tales of people helping neighbours and looking after the more vulnerable people.Now Mr Baptie is hoping that spirit will help all communities prepare a Community Resilience Plan which they can use in case another severe weather front hits the county.And he has issued some advice for people to prepare in their own home for what could happen.He said: ldquoSevere weather is the biggest risk to East Lothian.ldquoBeing prepared for it is important and people can do things themselves, such as keeping an old-fashioned phone in their house in case mobile signal is lost, having a torch to hand in case power goes.ldquoIt is also important to stock up on food when warnings that severe weather is on its way are issued.More than  people are expected to attend the community resilience workshop at The Brunton, Musselburgh, on Saturday.The one-day event, which is being funded by EDF Energy and the Scottish Government, will bring together representatives from community councils, groups and schools.Advice on a range of aspects of drawing up community resilience plans will be available, including ensuring groups who take on responsibility are covered by insurance.It will also inform people of services they can sign up to with energy companies to ensure they receive a phone callpower goes out.North Berwick Community Council, which already has a plan and implemented it successfully during the Beast from the East, will be there to talk about how they did it and what worked.Mr Baptie hopes the event will result in community plans from across the county, with each one appointing a Single Person of Contact or SPOC.He said: ldquoThe idea of a SPOC is that there is one point of contact between each community and the council so we can get information to them and they can let us know what is happening, for examplepower has gone out in one area.ldquoThe plans are about drawing up lists of vulnerable people in the community, finding out who has a x and can get medicine to people or take them to hospital or the doctor.ldquoIt is about being prepared.

many are shown with the results of their physical injuries.: How Danny Boyle will lead Armistice beach memorialsIt includes injured soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan, a dog handler, and a female medic, and the artist, who trained at Glasgow School of Art and travelled widely to capture the portraits, has also portrayed things not often seen in perhaps more staid military portraits.Dog handler Mick McConnell is pictured with his two dogs, for example, and Sub-Lieutenant Michelle Ping has been rendered with her daughter, Ellena Rae, on her knee.The artist said he had been keen to avoid creating traditional military portraits, which tend to feature generals and other high ranking officers - the majority of those shown are in lower ranks.He also interviewed each of them, and tells their stories in text which accompanies the exhibition.The artist said: ldquoI had been thinking about World War One, and the soldiers from that war are dead, but many of the soldiers I spoke to, they had family members who had fought in the war: like surgeons and teachers, being in the army seems to run in families.ldquoThe basic idea, really, of mine was that army portraits tend to be of the high-rankers, the upper crust of the army, but I really wanted to keep this to normal people, to make portraits of them and see what they had to say about being the army, for themselves.: Portraits of World War One figures on Scottish beachesHe added that as his project developed, British Army representatives spoke to him, initially, he believes, nervous about the project and how it might portray the army.Mr McKendrick said: ldquoThe army is a top-to-bottom place, and I think they were worried about the impression that would be given.ldquoBut what struck me was I was dealing with some people who had been gravely wounded, and some who had seen and experienced some horrendous things, but they all had this immense pride, to a man and woman, in being in the army.ldquoI personally didnrsquot have any bias or prejudgement on what I would find.ldquoWhat I found was some outstanding, but very ordinary, people.The artist created the portraits on paper with mixed media, using acrylics and pastels as well as some watercoloursand oil.The exhibition includes an image of Corporal David Timmins, QGM, who lost an eye and suffered multiple injuries in an explosion in Afghanistan in .: How Scotlands beaches will remember war deadOf Corporal David Timmins, McKendrick writes in the book that accompanies the show: ldquoCorporal Timminsrsquo story is indeed many stories.ldquoAmong them, the extraordinary skill and dedication of surgeons and nursing staff, the human ability to survive devastating injuries and a manrsquos unwillingness to admit defeat.ldquoDavidrsquos route to recovery has been hard and it will continue to be so for many years to come.Those depicted have a myriad of military experiences.It includes Sergeant Bert Stone, who was at Monte Cassino, Sergeant Allan McKinlay at Anzio, and Major Mandy Islamwho saw service in Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan.Elizabeth Dent, writing in the book, notes: ldquoTom is capable of creating objects and paintings of great beauty.ldquoHe does not glory war, but in this exhibition of soldiers, he honours the ordinary men and women who do extraordinary things.The artist added: ldquoI would say people will see the show, perhaps they will see a  year old gentleman in a chair and think nothing of it, then they will read that as an -year-old, he parachuted in behind enemy lines.ldquoYou might then look back at the painting, and your view of it may completely change.He noted: ldquoThe show really is a composite, there is a lot of writing in it.: Artist revisits his acclaimed Blitz paintingsMcKendrick was born in Clydebank in .He served an aprenticeship as a lsquoLoftsmanrsquo in John Browns Shipyard before studying at Glasgow School of Art from  to , and has since exhibited widely and awards for his work.His exhibitions include Blitz, Submarine, Rivet Temple, Iron and Heavier Than Air.The artist added: ldquoAll of these dferent stories are of survivors, but they represent millions of untold stories from the First World War to the present day.ldquoThe men and women who look out at us are dignied, determined and stoical. They bear witness to many of the horrors of war but they take pride in having done their duty serving their country.Bailie Denis Agnew of West Dunbartonshire Council said: ldquoIt is a privilege for

Or make up an entirely new word.Of course, men arent having to deal with such indignities. It seems \"man\" is still an inoffensive word. It is \"woman\" that is the issue.

With a list of quotes from the far-right politician, it asked the question: \"Racist, sexist and homophobic or a refreshing break from political correctness \"After an outcry about the way fascist views are being framed as mainstream, the broadcaster retracted the tweet with: \"The intention was to reflect the spectrum of opinion on such statements but the language of the post may not have reflected this accurately.\"Next, to the American broadcaster CNN, which took a potshot at President Donald Trump. The Obfuscater-In-Chief went off on one of his bizarre rants accusing CNN of claiming he had been directly responsible for a bomb sent to its offices by a Trump supporter.CNN released a statement: \"We did say that [you] should understand your words matter. Every single one of them. But so far, you donrsquot seem to get that.\"Sir Philip Green, the owner of Topshop, finds himself emphatically denying charges of sexual harassment and racist abuse of staff. In his  years in business, there has \"Been some banter,\" he said. \"And a bit of humour.\"Ah, the old banter defence. The last bastion of students in Nazi Halloween costumes and ponytail-pulling politicians everywhere.Its hard to argue with the idea that language has power. That words might amount to harassment. That thoughtless statements may incite violence in someone primed to lash out. That giving equal weight to mainstream and extreme political ideologies legitimises hate.So, does the slow erasure of the word \"woman\" mean anything  In order to be inclusive and to prevent causing offence to trans people, the word \"woman\" has become a problem.A national newspaper last week ran a story about womens experience of dealing with period pain at work, but the word \"woman\" was replaced with \"menstruator\". That word is very slowly becoming increasingly used to acknowledge that trans men and non-binary people have periods too.There was a story on the website of another national newspaper this week that managed to tell a y story about periods while completely avoiding using the word \"woman\" or \"girl\", despite the fact the story was about a schoolgirl who was caught short and a male classmate who very kindly helped her.\"Chest feeding\" in place of breast feeding is another inclusive term and a particularly odd one, given that men do have breasts. \"Pregnant people\" is now preferred to \"pregnant women\"The Wellcome Collection, a London museum, was berated last month over its use of the word \"womxn\" to promote a new event aimed at women. How would one even pronounce it  Sounds like bollx.During the summer Cancer Research UK launched a campaign to encourage the uptake of smear tests. It was aimed at \"everyone aged - with a cervix\".Inclusive in a way, but arguably exclusive. Its complex language for, say, people who dont speak English as a first language and for groups where women might not be aware of all the words relating to their biology.One of the arguments in favour of changes to the Gender Recognition Act in Scotland, which would bring into force gender self-ID and remove current bureaucracy for trans people, is that whats in your pants shouldnt matter.Yet, by replacing the word \"woman\" we are doing just that - placing an emphasis on biology and bodily s. Its dehumanising and it is problematic for the very fact that women have fought for recognition and a voice in a male-dominated world thanks to acceptance of \"woman\" as being a political class.We are pleased that women are being recognised, finally, on bank notes. Yet we are still fighting for gains to be made in board rooms, on sports fields, the political sphere and so on.We can only losewe allow the word \"woman\" to be erased in the name of progression.Is this progressive or is a clever trick on the part of the patriarchy  The answer lies in the fact that, as I said, it is not the word \"man\" causing problems. Women have fought ferociously to have the same status, rights and respect as men.Of course, all groups deserve equal rights, protections and dignity and must be afforded those. But there has to be another way to ensure inclusion.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Friday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pm﻿﻿﻿  The walls of Kirkwall#s St Magnus Cathedral were transformed this evening as the building became the canvas for a short film marking the centenary of the end of the First World War.

The project is supported by Orkney Islands Council’s Arts Development team.It will run on a loop eight times from pm each evening between now and Remembrance Day on November .At around .pm each night it will come to a rest on the final image — a tree, made up of the names of Orcadians who died in WWI, in a field of poppies.Glasgow-based specialists Playdead were engaged to create the film and pupils from Glaitness Primary and Kirkwall Grammar schools were involved in the creation of the work.Kevin McCrae, creative director and founder of Playdead, said: “After speaking to local people and school children about what they’d like to see and seeing what we could draw on from archives as well, we thought it would be good to develop a series of sequences which looked at the war and its impacts in Orkney from a range of angles.“Spectators will see snippets of what soldiers would have experienced, but also there are scenes which explore how farmers and school children would have been affected, as well as a look at what propaganda people here would have seen, and images from after the war of how the end of the conflict was celebrated and how it was commemorated.“There are some big technical challenges associated with projecting onto a surface like the St Magnus Cathedral. It’s such an iconic building in the heart of Kirkwall and we wanted to do justice to it # so we have done a lot of work to take into account the uneven surfaces and to choose a colour palette that would really work with the beautul red stone.The Great War: An Orkney Memorial Experience will run for the final time between pm and pm on Remembrance Day,  November.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is not some dry, academic debate. The potential health consequences of ministers failing to heed the advice of their own experts are serious.“I hope the Health Secretary will use her influence, therefore, to persuade her colleague, the Housing Minister, to accept the case for using a Rural Minimum Income Standard to help define fuel poverty in rural and island areas.  This is the only way of ensuring those who need help get the support they need.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now in its seventh consecutive season, the Sanday Sealcam is online once again.A camera has been set up overlooking two small coves in a part of the island that is rarely visited — except by seals, otters, rabbits and birds.Set up with the kind permission of local landowners, the Towrie family, the camera is linked to a radio dish that transmits the signal, by line of sight, to a distant receiving dish, and the apparatus is powered by solar batteries — and this year for the first time, a supplementary wind-generator # at the site.Here, the live action is streamed to the internet and can be watched by anyone who logs on to the sealcam website.Sandra Towrie, Chair of Sanday Development Trust said: “Sanday Development Trust is delighted to work with Triscom as it is a hard task to stream the camera using remote, rural broadband and get high-quality live footage successfully being streamed onto the web. The Sanday sealcam allows visitors a unique opportunity to see Orkney’s amazing wildle up close and personal, and follow the highs and lows of an Orkney seal colony during pupping season from the comfort of their armchair — perfect for those unable to visit the island in person.”In recent years, Northlink Ferries have part-sponsored the Sealcam, while Sanday Development Trust continues to fund repairs, replacements and maintenance of the equipment and the time involved in camera control.Thousands of people, from all over the world, have looked at Sanday Sealcam. From the comfort of your computer-desk, or even your laptop in an armchair by the fire, the website brings you the sights and sounds of seals on an Orkney beach. It’s a particularly impressive atmosphere when the tide is high and the weather rough.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

At the moment I am in touch with an old colleague who has done work like this in the past.\"It would be good to see the bridge reinstated, as it is a worthwhile amenity and opens up the walk around the town giving access to the bird le on the mud flats.\"Every week, the question is asked by somebody, lsquowhen will the bridge be reopenedrsquo and we would love to give them a date but for now all we can do is open a crowdfunding page to seewe can try and make it happen ourselves.\"Similarly, we need to raise funds for a survey on the MacDonald Monument. In order to try and open the to satisfy the Highland Councilrsquos many conditions for safe access.\"These are both long-running issues, whichthey came to fruition, would be assets to the town.\"The community council remains committed to seeing both of these projects through to completion and with the help of Highland Council and the local population we see no reason why this cannot be achieved.\"According to Mr Shepherd the plans are to replace a large part of the bridge with \"old recycled crane boom sections and hopefully, my contact can find some more to help out with the project to replace the old bridge over the canal.\"Fellow member of Dingwall Community Council, George Murray, said: \"There have been so many complaints regarding the bridge being closed that the issue has been constantly on the community council agenda.\"Itrsquos an important feature of the lsquoRound Dingwall walkrsquo and needs to be repaired and reopened.\"We have an area of scenic beauty that the public cannot access without walking along and crossing over the railway tracks.He added: \"Whilst I appreciate that the Highland Council seem to be having trouble funding anything outside of Inverness, this should not be a lsquobridge too farrsquo and we will be looking at all ways to fund the repair which could be helped by the Dingwall Common Good Fundpossible.\"Friday  Nov  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The Highland Council appreciate the work by Network Rail to introduce this innovative solution.\"Despite the reducedof daytime closure windows the road will remain shut each night from pm to am.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism.

I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"no shortage of goals in action packed weekend ","story":"There was loads of football action on Saturday with LK Galaxy claiming a convincing win against Tizers to win the Association Cup.Final score was an incredible -, with no fewer than five goals coming from Jordan Thomason.Meanwhile, the contest for the County Shield was won by Ness at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Friday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

From Dunbar, Izzy has always had a keen interest in languages and studies French and Gaelic at Glasgow University.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows.

The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace process. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8688307.1540985813!/image/image.jpg","title":"raglan street is blooming","story":"People living at Raglan Street in Ballymena are celebrating their recent success in a Northern Ireland wide gardening competition.The competition is run each year by Clanmil Housing to acknowledge and reward those tenants who take a keen interest in keeping the green spaces around their homes looking the very best they can.Tenants from Raglan Street picked up the award for Best Active Older People’s scheme at a special celebration at Girdwood Community Hub in Belfast.Ann McIlhagga, who lives on Raglan Street, said: “We are delighted to have picked up the award for Best Active Older People’s scheme in the Clanmil in Bloom competition.

The De La Salle student will travel to London on Friday and fly out to St Petersburg on Saturday. The preliminaries for the rd FIG Trampoline Gymnastics World Championships take place Wednesday, November  with the finals taking place two days later on Friday, November .Devine came out on top of a high-class field in the senior men’s DMT competition in Birmingham at the end of September to win his first British title and secure his place in the World Championships. His coach, Simon Flannery, was delighted with his performance in Birmingham and is hoping some adjustments to his routines will yield a further improvement in Russia next week. “Each competitor completes two routines and the top eight go through to the final,” stated Flannery.“The routines he did in the preliminaries for the British Championships are the routines he will now in the prelims in Russia. “Those routines would have placed him second in the prelims for last year. “We know he is in around the area he needs to be to make it to the final. “He was brilliant in Birmingham. He had a tough build-up to the Championships. The routines we wanted to do at the Championships weren’t quite there yet, so we had to make a decision not to compete with those. It paid off because he done a modied last routine and he done it really well and won.”He added: “Since then, we have upgraded those routines and he is looking phenomenal. He had a training camp last week with the GB team and he smashed all his classes. “In our sport, it comes down to tenths of points, so every step you take, or wobble, or bend of the arms can cost you. “Every tenth you lose is tripled because the three judges scores are counted.“The last training camp is about fine-tuning the little details to maximise your score.”As British champion, Devine will have high hopes of continuing his rapid rise in the sport by securing a medal. Flannery believes Devine has the ability to progress to next Friday’s finals and is hopeful of another fine showing from the West Belfast prospect. “He is hoping to get into the finals, which is the main thing,” said Flannery.“I think his routines will easily put him into the top five. “We’d love to come away with a medal.“He is excited and a little bit nervous, but he turns that into a real positive. He gets adrenaline from it.” Flannery, who recently relocated Andersonstown Trampoline Club to Mallusk to merge with Flight Gymnastics, also revealed that Devine will be targeting Olympic qualication in the New Year. The -year-old will have a well-earned break from competition after the World Championships in Russia before embarking on a two-year goal to qualy for Tokyo in . “We have got a break after Russia then, next year, the qualication starts for the Olympic Games ,” added the Flight Gymnastic coach. “It starts in February and he has to compete in a run of events over the next two years. Only the top  men and the top  women make the Olympics. “We are working very hard to get him into the top  so he can qualy for the Olympics.“If you take out the Russians and the Chinese, then a lot of dferent counties can make up that top .

It is rare to see so much detail and well written legible letters which gives us a fantastic insight into the Dixon family and Patrick’s le at the front.“Within these letters we see Patrick discuss Irish political developments such as the  conscription crisis, the impact of the Spanish flu pandemic in Ireland and the torpedoing of the RMS Leinsteroff the Irish coast.He also describes his excitement at the signing of the Armistice, in a letter dated th November , and the long wait for demobilisation.Highlights from the collection include a soldiers’pantomime programme for January , emergency issue Francs, a German Disabled War Veteran Fund ticket picked up at the front, and never before published photographs of the front, taken by Patrick himself. Speaking about the origin of the material, Paula added: “We believe Patrick’s sister, Margaret, who became a GP in the Dunmurry area, married a Mr Wynne, who was involved with the Belfast Charitable Society and thus the material deposited in the Society#s attic for safekeeping. This is all very timely as Clton House is hosting an autumn series of historical lectures, including a symposium on th November  to mark the ending of the Great War. Philip Orr, the playwright and historian, and Dr Éamon Phoenix, the historian and broadcaster, will deal with the Irish contribution to the war and its impact on this island. This event will now include an exhibition of the Dixon War Letters, unveiled to the public for the first time. We’d also like to find the descendants of Patrick Dixon and we would like help in tracing members of the Dixon or Wynne families who may be able to shed light on this incredible collection of war letters.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"runners lacing up as daithi keeps inspiring","story":"THIS year’s Gaeltacht Quarter K is set to raise awareness for a very worthy cause.Now in its third year, this year’s event will help to raise awareness for organ donation and the ‘Is Deontóir Mé – Yes I Donate’ campaign which was started by the parents of two-year-old Ballymurphy boy Dáithí Mac Gabhann.Dáithí has now spent  days on the waiting list for a new heart following a diagnosis of hypoplastic heart syndrome.Dáithí was born on October ,  and two days later he travelled to London via air ambulance for surgery.

Fund to tackle impact of Primark fire is short by £.m, says mayor DUP delegates meet Civil Service boss over £bn Budget windfall She said that the session was simply a briefing on new legislation passing through Parliament to allow civil servants to take decisions in the absence of the Executive, but some parties called the gathering a waste of time.Alliance Party leader Naomi Long warned that the relationships between the parties and with Mrs Bradley are now in a worse state than ever.\"This briefing was not just a pointless exercise, but I would argue it was actually counterproductive in that relationships between the parties and indeed with the Secretary of State are possibly now at an all-time low,\" Ms Long said.\"The reality is, the longer this process continues the further we drt from restoration of the institutions.\"She said the parties were now further away than they were when the talks collapsed in February and the gap is growing \"with every day that passes\". Lord Trimble raps Dublin over Brexit talks Ms Long said: \"The responsibility now lies with the Secretary of State to make a decision to convene the talks and to get us back in the room, and put it up to the parties.\"If parties are not willing to participate, then let them be held accountable by the public who are sick to the back teeth of this nonsense.\"Voicing his frustration at the outcome of the meeting, Ulster Unionist Leader Robin Swann MLA called on the Government to reintroduce direct ruleit cannot get political agreement to restore devolution at Stormont. He said: \"I regret to say it, but the meeting was badly organised and badly handled, with no clear purpose or direction.

DUP and Sinn Fein agreement on the basis for talks will never happen. \"The people of Northern Ireland need her to show some backbone, face down the parties causing the blockage. If those parties dont like what a talks process looks like thats up to them.\"DUP MLA Christopher Stalford, who attended along with party colleague Peter Weir, said they were invited to be briefed about the Northern IrelandBill introduced by Mrs Bradley to grant decision-making powers to civil servants.He said: \"This Bill is another symptom of the Sinn Fein boycott of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive. It is far from ideal.\"The Secretary of State should have gone much further in terms of decision-making powers.\"The Bill is not ambitious and it does not deliver good governance for Northern Ireland.\"But said overall blame for the impasse should rest with Sinn Fein and not Mrs Bradley. He said: \"Whilst parties are lining up to blame the Secretary of State, Sinn Fein collapsed devolution and is the only party refusing to form an Executive until certain items on its wish-list are checked off.\"The real problem lies at Connolly House rather than Stormont House.\"The DUP stands ready to enter an Assembly and Executive immediately. We have no preconditions. Its high time Sinn Fein stopped holding Northern Ireland to ransom.\"SDLP Leader Colum Eastwood called the meeting \"a complete and utter waste of time.\"\"It is quite clear that the British Government are totally unprepared to take the necessary next steps to get power-sharing restored,\" he said.\"Today is an embarrassing day for the Secretary of State. Quite simply, it is not her job to wait for a consensus, her job is to kick-start the talks process.\"I think I probably should have stayed in Derry,\"Sinn Fein MLA John ODowd accused the Government of \"treating large sections of this society with utter and complete contempt\".\"We attended this meeting to establishthere was basis for going forward with a rights based society with accountable government for all. Unfortunately that was not the case,\" he said.\"It is quite clear that the British Government is treating large sections of this society with utter and complete contempt.\"Mrs Bradley said it had \"always been clear\" the meeting with the parties was a briefing about her bill and nothing more:\"I have always been clear that this was a briefing for the parties on the bill that will become an Act of Parliament next week so that they can understand what the debates were in parliament last week and this week in the House of Lords, and so they can see now that it is going to be an Act of Parliament in the next few days and what that will mean,\" she said.\"They have to do the right thing, come back into government, and I want to see them do that as soon as possible.\"A UK Government spokesperson confirmed: \"The Secretary of States key priority is the restoration of devolved government at Stormont.\"Following the passage Northern IrelandAct  through Parliament, the Secretary of State was keen to meet the parties at the earliest opportunity to look ahead to implementation of the legislation and next steps.\"Her engagement with the parties, and with the other key stakeholders in Northern Ireland, will continue in the weeks ahead.\""},{"url":null,"title":"uvf tell irish government to tone down britbashing reports","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There are many subjects on which you could say ‘how is this going to work  how is that going to work ’ and the answer is we don’t know yet. “What we’re confident about is that we know what Uefa are looking for, we know we can deliver it and deliver it in a compelling way. “Our execution in both countries in terms of tournaments like this is good, so I think in a post-Brexit world we can deliver.”The bid has been described as “historic” as it is the first joint bid by the FAI and IFA. The European Under- Championships is the second biggest football tournament after the Uefa Euros.A formal bid will be put together next year, with the decision expected to be made in .Mr Nelson also moved to quell rumours of tension between the organisations after Northern Ireland manager Michael O’Neill accused the FAI of targeting players from a nationalist background to switch allegiances to play for the Republic of Ireland.Northern Ireland-born James McClean, Shane Duffy and Darron Gibson all play for the Republic. Mr Nelson said: “We know that players have a choice, and we accept that players have a choice, and our job here in Northern Ireland is to make a pathway that is the best it can be and to encourage players to play for Northern Ireland and wear a green shirt.“That’s what I’m focused on on a daily basis. In terms of our overall relationship with the FAI, I think we have a good relationship. “I have known Johnfor nine-and-a-half years and we’ve got on well. We speak regularly at Uefa meetings and I’ve got no doubt that between us and the two associations we’ll put together a really good bid and give Uefa a lot to think about in terms of hosting this tournament.”"},{"url":null,"title":"fresh brexit deal hope with offer of border compromise","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This would be a major step forward in negotiations but EU negotiators are anxious to maintain the integrity of the custom union and are eager to ensure the UK is not given an advantage over remaining member states on trade.The proposed fall back customs arrangement or what is known as the backstop would remain in place until the EU and the UK agree a post-Brexit trade deal. However, Brexiteers fear the deal would tie Britain indefinitely to the EU.Meanwhile, a British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference will be held in Dublin today. The UK Government will be represented at the event by Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Karen Bradley, who will meet Tanaiste Simon Coveney and Irish Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan.The group will discuss efforts to restore the Stormont institutions along with talks on security cooperation on both sides of the border. Officially, Brexit is not a topic for discussion. However, it is likely ministers will use the opportunity to discuss the negotiations with their Irish counterparts.Last night, Mr Coveney said the talks \"demonstrates that, despite the current challenges, both the Irish and UK governments are committed to developing the relationship between our countries and looking at ways to maintain and deepen our engagement\"."},{"url":null,"title":"cattle farmer discovers ingenious way to herd his cows","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

entertain customers at the self-service checkouts at the Poundland store in Waterloo Place, where shoppers have been receiving automated assistance from a number of unexpected voices.Last month the

destination.However, another customer, Sean Gallagher, said Dracula was ‘doing my head in’ and warned thathe’s not careful ‘I’ll get the garlic out to him’.It is a feature Poundland has introduced in

This is particularly worrying as I remain unconvinced that the current site can accommodate an extra  or  students, without this having a detrimental effect on their wellbeing and the quality of teaching.ldquoI also have signicant concerns about the impact the single site option would have on traffic in the Saul Road area, given the congestion issues and poor infrastructure already in the town.He said he was ldquoworried about the impact that moving teachers and pupils, which he argued would be inevitable in the transitional phase, would have on timetabling.Cllr Brown said he was ldquoslightly more enthusiastic about a two-school option, though he claimed there was ldquostill a lack of clarity from CCMS about how this would work in practice.He added: ldquoI hope the CCMS can produce more detail on this during the post-consultation stage. Officials have informed us that they hope to implement this amalgamation as early as September .ldquoIf that is the case, much work needs to be done to assuage the concerns of parents, secure long term capital funding mdash and potentially a new site mdash and ensure the inevitable challenges occurring during the transitional period do not become permanent fixtures of any new school.Mr Lyttle said that while Alliance was strongly opposed to academic selection and believed in the need for integration and rationalisation of schools across the province, ldquothese changes must always be made while putting the wellbeing and educational outcomes of children first.He added: ldquoThere does appear to be practical concerns with this proposal, particularly regarding implementation which will need to be addressedany amalgamation is to be delivered in a way that will benefit all pupils.ldquoIt is vital that the concerns of parents and other stakeholders are considered and the change management process is handled in a way which delivers for everyone in the community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Annsborough school forms community forum group  ","story":"A NEW community engagement forum has been launched at Annsborough Integrated Primary School.This exciting new development will involve parents, governors, staff and past pupils working with officers from the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education, supported by investment from the Integrated Education Fund.Speaking at the launch last Thursday, Lynda Brown, school principal, said she was pleased at the investment and support being offered by NICIE and the IEF.ldquoThere is a great buzz in the school tonight and itrsquos lovely to see so many parents, governors and families attending from within our local community, she remarked.Ms Brown welcomed Tina Merron, Chief Executive Officer of the IEF, Roisin Marshall, CEO of NICIE, and Denise Morgan, Senior Development Officer with NICIE.She said the school community looked forward to working with them to build on the Integrated education being offered at Annsborough IPS.ldquoWe are keen to work with our local community to ensure that integrated provision is available for all who desire it in future, she added.Ms Marshall said she was ldquodelighted to be at the school to discuss the future growth of integrated education in the area.She remarked: ldquoItrsquos always really nice to get the chance to meet people who are committed to working together for their local communities to ensure that children and adults can have opportunities to work together under one roof mdash Protestant,Catholic, other faiths and none.

Little was seen of Ards attack in the first half, but with  minutes gone Nathan McShane had to be alert to head an in-swinging corner from Brian Cabraley off the line.McGrady, Branagan and Telford continued to give the Ards defence plenty to think about and with  minutes gone Downpatrick made it -. Branagan worked his way into a good position on the right and fired over a tempting cross that flew into the top left hand corner of the net, giving the visiting goalkeeper no chance.Downpatrick went in at the break, worthy of their three-goal advantage, but they were unable to kick on from there in the second half.Ards were the more aggressive after the break and Downpatrick were put under a certain amount of pressure, but Anthony Doherty, Conor Moore, Nathan McShane and Caolan Logue all defended superbly and provided resolute cover to captain Kieran Gordon in goal.Gordon was only beaten once and that was in the th minute when McCleary tucked away a cross from Dunlop in a clever move.Ards continued to push and probe, but a hard-working Downpatrick side refused to give way and thoroughly deserved their first three points of the season.Downpatrick FC: K Gordon, C Logue, N McShane, C Moore, A Doherty, J Branagan, C McGrady, Adrian McCoubrey, M McGarritty, Andrew McCoubrey, P Telford.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world. Moreover the UK is a signicant influencer throughout the world and a society that is a leader in freedom of democracy.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We will be investing in people and training over a long-term period to address customer feedback and drive innovation, and we look forward to partnering with Belfast International Airport,” a spokesperson for Wilson James said.Wilson James was chosen by the airport as its preferred supplier for security services following a tender process.It has taken over the role from ICTS, which held the contract for over  years.ICTS said it had provided an “excellent service” and claimed the inadequate service provided to customers over the summer months was beyond its control.The News Letter asked Belfast International Airport for comment about the steps it is taking in a bid to reduce hold-ups at security and improve the flow of passengers through the airport.Responding, a spokesperson said: “We welcome Wilson James to Belfast International Airport and we are looking forward to working in partnership in a joint commitment to optimise the passenger experience through the airport.” and Belfast Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey talk to the media after the City Hall meeting\"   and Belfast Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey talk to the media after the City Hall meeting\"  Primark fire: Karen Bradley meets businesses at city hall Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Lord Trimble said the Irish side in the Brexit negotiations is undermining the Good Friday Agreement He claimed that the Brexit process could result in Northern Ireland ending up as part of an “effective EU protectorate”.The former Ulster Unionist Party leader, now a Conservative peer, said in a foreword to a think tank report that the achievements of the Good Friday Agreement were being put at risk.In the report, produced by the centre-right Policy Exchange, Lord Trimble said: “It is clear to me that the Irish side in the Brexit negotiations is undermining the  Good Friday Agreement, riding roughshod over its terms and violating its spirit. “The report said the European Union and Irish demands “go well beyond the avoidance of a hard border”.Brexit talks have reached an impasse over the EU’s “backstop” plan which would see Northern Ireland effectively remaining in the customs union and single market unless alternative arrangements were found to prevent a hard border.Lord Trimble said: “There is a genuine risk that Northern Ireland will end up as part of an effective EU protectorate, without the say-so of the Northern Ireland Assembly.“This would be an appalling breach of the principle of consent, which runs through theagreement.”The Policy Exchange report suggested that “one possible way out of the current impasse is for both sides to sign a declaration that future trade talks ... will include an ‘Ireland chapter’ in which both sides undertake to use their best efforts to ensure an invisible border” and preserve existing measures of co-operation.The report was written by Graham Gudgin, who was an aide to Lord Trimble as first minister, and Ray Bassett, who was on the Irish talks team during the Good Friday Agreement negotiations.They said: “Following the principles of the Good Friday Agreement should be at the heart of both UK and EU approaches to agreeing future co-operation over the Irish border.“It is currently Theresa May’s stance which is most closely aligned to those principles - while the EU has fundamentally misinterpreted the principle of consent which underpins them.Stormont talks: All-party meeting ‘an utter waste of time’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“The current impasse could be resolvedboth sides agree that in future trade talks both sides undertake to use their best efforts to ensure an invisible border and to preserve all existing measures of cross-border cooperation agreed under the auspices of the Good Friday Agreement.”try catch     .               ..

In  he was jailed in the Republic for RIRA membership.   Martina Anderson, Sinn Feins MEP is lobbying against the extradition of Liam Campbell to Lithuania His brother Michael was jailed in Lithuania in  for trying to buy a large haul of weapons for the RIRA. Liam has been facing extradition by Irish courts to Lithuania to face charges of involvement in the same plot and has up until now been backed by Republican Sinn Fein.But now Sinn Féin MEP Martina Anderson has written to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar calling on him “to protect the human rights” of Mr Campbell. Ms Anderson said: “I met with the family of Liam Campbell who is currently facing extradition to Lithuania about their concerns over the implications for his human rights. “The Supreme Court already ruled against the extradition of Liam Campbell to Lithuania as it found that prison conditions there could breach his right to freedom from torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It is utter hypocrisy for Sinn Fein to demand the pursuit of British soldiers through the courts, whilst at the same time intervening to demand that terror suspects be given a free pass“There is a concern that,extradited, he could face a y period in detention before his case comes to trial in conditions that have been criticised by the UN’s Committee on Torture.” “I have now written to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar expressing my concern about Liam Campbell’s case and asking him to meet me as a matter of urgency to discuss it.”She has also written to the EU’s Commissioner for Human Rights, she said.But DUP East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson noted he had been found liable for the Omagh bombing.    Real IRA member Liam Campbell pictured at the High Court in  where he was appearing in connection with the Omagh bomb. Photo: Niall Carson PA Wire “He is wanted as a result of allegations that he was trying to buy large amounts of arms and explosives on behalf of the Real IRA in Lithuania,” he said. “It comes as no surprise that same party who continue to glory IRA terrorists is calling for Mr Campbell’s freedom. Whilst Campbell clings to human rights laws today, victims today will ask what about the human rights of the maimed and murdered in Omagh in .”UUP Justice spokesman Doug Beattie said it is “perhaps hardly surprising that a convicted bomber such as Martina Anderson should come to the aid of someone found liable for the Omagh bombing in a civil trial”. He added: “It is utter hypocrisy for Sinn Fein to demand the pursuit of British soldiers through the courts, whilst at the same time intervening to demand that terror suspects be given a free pass.” Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Asked to explain why it was intervening in the case now, Sinn Fein pointed to Ms Anderson’s statement.Former IRA prisoner turned historian and journalist, Anthony McIntyre, said Sinn Fein has lobbied for dissident republicans before.“It is a no cost approach and has the potential to take the sharp edge out of some dissident criticism of them,” he added.try catch     .               ..

Secretary of State Karen Bradley But the parties emerged after just  minutes to deliver scathing criticism of Karen Bradley’s handling of the process.Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann said the meeting had been a box-ticking exercise, and labelled it “badly briefed and badly advised”.He said Ms Bradley must now either take “ownership of the process”, or introduce direct rule for Northern Ireland from Westminster.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood described the meeting as a “complete and utter waste of time”.“It is quite clear that the British Government are totally unprepared to take the necessary next steps to get powersharing restored.“Today is an embarrassing day for the Secretary of State. Quite simply, it is not her job to wait for a ‘consensus’, her job, alongside the Tanaiste, is to kickstart the talks process.”Alliance leader Naomi Long said the restoration of devolution was now further away than it had been when talks collapsed in February.Branding the briefing “counter-productive”, she added: “I think relationships between parties, and indeed the secretary of state, are possibly now at an all-time low.”The Sinn Fein delegation gave a short statement to the media after the meeting, before leaving without taking questions.Sinn Fein MLA John O’Dowd accused the government of “treating large sections of this society with utter and complete contempt”.The DUP has not yet given a reaction to the meeting.Pat McGibbon is named a ‘Point of Light’ for his work Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Speaking ahead of the meeting, Mrs Bradley said she intended to brief the parties on the Northern IrelandBill, which is intended to allow time and space for political parties to agree ato powersharing government.She added: “I want to get those parties in a room together and really go through with them how this act will deliver for them.“But they have to do the right thing, come back into government, and I want to see them do that as soon as possible.”Devolved government at Stormont has been mothballed since January  following a breakdown in relations between the DUP and Sinn Fein.Numerous attempts at talks to agree to theof the Executive have ended in failure.try catch     .               ..

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here.

It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Birches Primary School Eco Team A new Eco Team launched the special video entitled ‘Our Footpath Dilemma’ which highlighted the dangers pupils face.In a delightful storytelling format, the pupils have been photographed at ious parts of the road leading up to the school.Clever graphics and simple story telling gets across the dficulties faced by pupils, young and very young as well as their parents and staff.It portrays how the footpath starts to disappear not far from the school building. And their simple demand is to have a proper footpath to make it safe for everyone to walk to school.A private development had recently built a short footpath along part of the route. This made it safer for part of the route.Unfortunately it wasn’t long until the new footpath stopped. This was the unsafe route left for the children.The pupils had to walk in single file on the road and had to be supervised by an adult.Now the Eco Team are spearheading a campaign. They asked: “Can the government turn their frowns upside down and give them the footpath they so desperately need ”Backing their campaign is Lord Mayor Julie Flaherty who spent the morning with her Ulster Unionist colleague MLA Doug Beattie at the school to hear their desperate plea for a foopath.She said: “I feel very proud of the pupils who have a strong community spirit and great campaigners!“They have shown a great deal of determination and perseverance.

Acting as a warning, the signs will highlight to thoughtless dog owners that this behaviour does not go unnoticed even in the darker mornings and evenings at this time of year. With wardens continuing to patrol these areas, as well as issuing fines and investigating complaints, council is committed to making the borough a cleaner place.“We acknowledge that the majority of dog owners do act responsibly when out and about in the borough but there are still a few who don’t take care and these are the iniduals we are targeting,” commented the Chair of Environmental Services, Councillor Keith Haughian.“It is important for irresponsible dog owners to realise this offensive littering is not acceptable.“With this campaign and council’s other proactive initiatives we are seeing more and more incidents being reported by council staff and residents alike. And I would urge everyone to continue to report any offences to our environmental health department.” Through a combination of education and enforcement methods, ABC Council is taking a very proactive approach to dog fouling. In addition to its recent watching eyes campaign, council also encourages people to take the pledge to clean up after their dog through its ‘green dog walkers’ scheme. With armbands acting as a non-confrontational and friendly reminder to other dog walkers to clean up after their pet, green dog walkers also carry extra doggie bags for dog walkers who may need them.An £ fixed penalty fine will be issued for anyone detected not cleaning up after their dog.

You should feel enormously proud of how your football coaching programmes are helping hundreds of young people in Northern Ireland to improve their mental wellbeing.”Pat said: “I’m privileged to receive this volunteering award. I see first-hand each day the valuable efforts of our own volunteers at ‘Train B SMART’ and in the area of promoting positive mental health, volunteers play a hugely valuable role in giving back to local and wider community.”Pat is the ,th winner of the Points of Light award, which has been developed in partnership with the hugely successful Points of Light programme in the USA. Over , Points of Light have been awarded in the USA, and former Presidents have publicly supported the partnership with Points of Light UK.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business.

It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £.

Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast.

Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium , said: \"This is terric news for Primark and for the retail hub of Belfast City Centre. Now that planning has been granted they can start the work to bring down the facade and put up the protection that will allow the cordon to reduce and for stores within the cordon to open. “This will be a le line for those traders in the cordon and those without who have seen their footfall drop by over %.
