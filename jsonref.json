This is up slightly on the 16.51mbps recorded in last year\u0027s survey, which saw the UK in 31st.The fastest broadband speeds are in Singapore, which is renowned as a global technology hub. Its average figure is over three times faster than in this country, at 60.39mbps.Second place goes to Sweden, ahead of Denmark and Norway. Perhaps surprisingly, Romania comes fifth in the league at 38.6mbps, which is more than twice the speed achieved in Britain. Other poorer countries where speeds are well ahead of the UK\u0027s include Slovakia, Czech Republic, Slovenia and Andorra.The data was collected by M-Lab, a partnership between Google, Princeton University and the Open Technology Institute in Washington.It was compiled by Cable, which compares broadband speeds and services. The figures show the average global broadband speed rose from 7.4mbps last May to 9.1mbps this year – an increase of 23 per cent.By comparison, the rise in UK average speeds was just 12 per cent.          Britain has slipped four places in the world broadband speed league, leaving its network lagging well behind the likes of Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary and RomaniaThe key to achieving superfast access to the internet is a network of fibre-optic cables direct to homes and businesses – known as fibre to the premises (FTTP). This could replace Britain\u0027s old-fashioned copper wire telephone system, parts of which are more than 100 years old.At present, just 560,000 premises in the UK have FTTP connections. There are plans to reach 3million by the end of 2020 under upgrades run by BT subsidiary Openreach.Dan Howdle, consumer telecoms analyst at Cable, described the UK\u0027s position in the global league as \u0027sad\u0027.He said: \u0027Compared to many other countries, the UK has simply come too late to a full fibre solution. Despite plans to roll out FTTP to homes across the next decade or so, the UK is likely to fall further behind while we wait.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/09/00/4E0C253900000578-5931979-image-a-2_1531094195615.jpg","title":"Great British Bake winner Nadiya Hussain reveals eats one meal day","story":"    Nadiya Hussain (pictured) said it is \u0027really important\u0027 families sit down and eat together at least once a week.Speaking about how she stops herself piling on the pounds, the 33-year-old TV cook said: \u0027On a day when I\u0027m not working I only have one meal a day.

I like that she\u0027s still given such a classic look a contemporary twist, by wearing the bun to the side, rather than in the middle\u0027\u0027Going back to the bun is a step away from the more casual low ponytail she sported yesterday, but as that was more of a private family occasion, perhaps she felt comfortable enough to try something new – today is a day for a tried-and-trusted look that she knows will photograph well.\u0027Meghan is known for wearing her hair in a looser and more relaxed style, but her hair today is much sleeker and more elegant, with a very tight ballerina-style knot in place of her usual messy bun.\u0027 Jason added: \u0027It\u0027s a sophisticated update on the look, ideal for such a formal occasion. I like that she\u0027s still given such a classic look a contemporary twist, by wearing the bun to the side, rather than in the middle of her head.\u0027This look also shows the neckline of her dress beautifully she clearly likes the combination of a bateau neckline, a fascinator and an up \u0027do. All three works together beautifully and it\u0027s a combination that looks fantastic, so I think it\u0027s safe to say this won\u0027t be the last time we see this look on Meghan.\u0027             The Duchess of Sussex was all smiles as she arrived at the event. To mark the RAF\u0027s centenary year, special events, activities and other initiatives at local, regional and national levels will run from April to the end of September 2018This year marks the centenary of the  Royal Air Force – the world\u0027s first independent air force – which was founded on 1 April 1918, independent of the British Army and Royal Navy.For one hundred years the RAF has defended the skies of Britain, preventing conflicts, delivering aid and combating cyber threats while working in partnership with other services.These include Operation Ruman – the UK\u0027s humanitarian assistance operation in the aftermath of hurricane Irma which hit the Caribbean in September 2017 – and the RAF\u0027s Quick Reaction Alert Typhoon Aircraft, providing a UK air defence capability 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.Today, the RAF is engaged on some 13 missions across 26 countries and is heavily committed on operations both at home and abroad.             The royals spent time speaking to RAF officials and members of the clergy before taking their seats in the church.

They also lack a dot in the centre of their spots, which is the mark of a jaguar.           The leopard is lazing in the branches of this tree, which is one of the animal\u0027s favoured hang-outs, as it keeps it out of the way of much larger predators that patrol the ground below          Even standing up in the tree, the leopard is hard to see (centre). The cats will often drag their prey into trees to stop it being stolen by lions and other large predators          Leopards are relatively common across Kenya but particular concentrations can be found inside the Maasai Mara and Samburu National ReservesIt is unlikely that the two species would be confused in the wild, however, as they do not share a habitat.Leopards live mostly across southern parts of Africa and in scattered communities across Asia, Pakistan and Malaysia, while jaguars live in the Americas.Leopards can be spotted across Kenya but there are particular concentrations in the Maasai Mara and Samburu National Reserves.As with many of Africa\u0027s largest predators, their numbers increase dramatically around wildebeest migration season as they follow the herd, hoping to pick off stragglers.Igor Gerlach has been a photographer since 1974 and began taking pictures of wildlife in 1976.

Meghan unveils a twist on her go-to style as she arrives in Ireland with a side bun and centre partingBy SIOFRA BRENNAN FOR MAILONLINE She\u0027s recently abandoned her beloved messy bun in favour of a more sleek and formal updo, and today the Duchess of Sussex debuted a new twist on the look.Stepping off the place in Dublin for her first official overseas visit with Harry, Meghan showed off a neat side bun with a side parting.It was a departure from the more severe style she\u0027s worn on several occasions, with hair swept to the back of her head with her hair parted down the middle.  The Duchess wore her hair in a neat updo with a side parting, lending a less severe look to the formal style. She wore her hair in swept back bun with a centre parting to a reception at Marlborough House in London last week Celebrity hairdresser James Johnson told Femail: \u0027The changing of a parting can alter your whole style, instantly.\u0027By keeping the side bun low and opposite, she\u0027s kept the symmetry in her look. This helps keep the over-style elegant, yet with a slight twist, making the hair a focal point.\u0027By keeping the hair balanced Meghans created a formal, more structured style, ideal for any royal appearance.\u0027Switching up the parting can create more dimension for any look, perfect for a plain outfit like Meghan has on here, giving the whole look more personality.   She ditched the messy bun she used to favour, seen here on a visit to Northern Ireland in March (left). But Meghan did mix things up today with a side parting and side bun The Duchess also showed off her prowess at literal dressing, wearing a top and pencil skirt by Givenchy in forest green, in a nod to the colour closely associated with the Emerald Isle.And she carried a £475 tan tote bag by Strathberry, the small Scottish brand whose designs Meghan has previously caused to sell out.This engagement is likely to be of particular interest to the Duchess, who has been outspoken on the topic of female empowerment.It\u0027s been a busy time for the newlyweds who kicked off the week by attending Prince Louis\u0027 christening at St James\u0027s Palace on Monday.Earlier today, they joined fellow members of the royal family for service to mark 100 years of the RAF at Westminster Abbey, followed by a flypast at Buckingham Palace.  Finding her royal feet! Meghan puts on a confident display on the Buckingham Palace balcony one month after her nervous debut at Trooping the ColourShe\u0027s less than two months into her role as the Duchess of Sussex, but today Meghan Markle proved she\u0027s finding her feet during celebrations for the RAF Centenary.The former Suits star looked poised and confident as she joined the royal family on the balcony at Buckingham Palace for the flypast, which saw the largest concentration of military aircraft in recent memory form in the skies above London to commemorate the milestone.The Queen, 92, looked up in wonder at the aeronautical display, which celebrated the history of the RAF and featured the return of Second World War aircraft including the Spitfires and Lancaster bombers, and followed a service of thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey earlier today.          The Duchess of Sussex showed off her new confidence today as she stood in pride of place alongside the Queen on the Buckingham Palace balcony for the RAF centenary celebrations           The former Suits star seemed nervous during her Buckingham Palace debut at Trooping the Colour exactly a month ago           Meghan looked at ease as she smiled warmly at her new husband Prince Harry           Prince George, four, and Princess Charlotte, three, were allowed to watch the spectacle from a window of the palace          The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who yesterday christened their son Louis, appeared in excellent spirits on the balconyShe was joined on the balcony by her sons, Prince Charles and Prince Andrew, the Duchess of Cornwall and the \u0027Fab Four\u0027: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.But tellingly, it was the Duchess stood in pride of place alongside Her Majesty who is these days usually flanked by one of her sons in the absence of the Duke of Edinburgh.It was a sharp contrast with Meghan\u0027s balcony debut at Trooping the Colour exactly one month ago on 10th June, when the retired actress was seen looking to her husband for reassurance and nervously fidgeted with her hair.And she did her best to blend into the background, standing behind the Duchess of Cambridge and sticking close to Harry\u0027s side.

I like that she\u0027s still given such a classic look a contemporary twist, by wearing the bun to the side, rather than in the middle\u0027\u0027Going back to the bun is a step away from the more casual low ponytail she sported yesterday, but as that was more of a private family occasion, perhaps she felt comfortable enough to try something new – today is a day for a tried-and-trusted look that she knows will photograph well.\u0027Meghan is known for wearing her hair in a looser and more relaxed style, but her hair today is much sleeker and more elegant, with a very tight ballerina-style knot in place of her usual messy bun.\u0027 Jason added: \u0027It\u0027s a sophisticated update on the look, ideal for such a formal occasion. I like that she\u0027s still given such a classic look a contemporary twist, by wearing the bun to the side, rather than in the middle of her head.\u0027This look also shows the neckline of her dress beautifully she clearly likes the combination of a bateau neckline, a fascinator and an up \u0027do. All three works together beautifully and it\u0027s a combination that looks fantastic, so I think it\u0027s safe to say this won\u0027t be the last time we see this look on Meghan.\u0027             The Duchess of Sussex was all smiles as she arrived at the event. To mark the RAF\u0027s centenary year, special events, activities and other initiatives at local, regional and national levels will run from April to the end of September 2018This year marks the centenary of the  Royal Air Force – the world\u0027s first independent air force – which was founded on 1 April 1918, independent of the British Army and Royal Navy.For one hundred years the RAF has defended the skies of Britain, preventing conflicts, delivering aid and combating cyber threats while working in partnership with other services.These include Operation Ruman – the UK\u0027s humanitarian assistance operation in the aftermath of hurricane Irma which hit the Caribbean in September 2017 – and the RAF\u0027s Quick Reaction Alert Typhoon Aircraft, providing a UK air defence capability 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.Today, the RAF is engaged on some 13 missions across 26 countries and is heavily committed on operations both at home and abroad.             The royals spent time speaking to RAF officials and members of the clergy before taking their seats in the church.

Meghan unveils a twist on her go-to style as she arrives in Ireland with a side bun and centre partingBy SIOFRA BRENNAN FOR MAILONLINE She\u0027s recently abandoned her beloved messy bun in favour of a more sleek and formal updo, and today the Duchess of Sussex debuted a new twist on the look.Stepping off the place in Dublin for her first official overseas visit with Harry, Meghan showed off a neat side bun with a side parting.It was a departure from the more severe style she\u0027s worn on several occasions, with hair swept to the back of her head with her hair parted down the middle.  The Duchess wore her hair in a neat updo with a side parting, lending a less severe look to the formal style. She wore her hair in swept back bun with a centre parting to a reception at Marlborough House in London last week Celebrity hairdresser James Johnson told Femail: \u0027The changing of a parting can alter your whole style, instantly.\u0027By keeping the side bun low and opposite, she\u0027s kept the symmetry in her look. This helps keep the over-style elegant, yet with a slight twist, making the hair a focal point.\u0027By keeping the hair balanced Meghans created a formal, more structured style, ideal for any royal appearance.\u0027Switching up the parting can create more dimension for any look, perfect for a plain outfit like Meghan has on here, giving the whole look more personality.   She ditched the messy bun she used to favour, seen here on a visit to Northern Ireland in March (left). But Meghan did mix things up today with a side parting and side bun The Duchess also showed off her prowess at literal dressing, wearing a top and pencil skirt by Givenchy in forest green, in a nod to the colour closely associated with the Emerald Isle.And she carried a £475 tan tote bag by Strathberry, the small Scottish brand whose designs Meghan has previously caused to sell out.This engagement is likely to be of particular interest to the Duchess, who has been outspoken on the topic of female empowerment.It\u0027s been a busy time for the newlyweds who kicked off the week by attending Prince Louis\u0027 christening at St James\u0027s Palace on Monday.Earlier today, they joined fellow members of the royal family for service to mark 100 years of the RAF at Westminster Abbey, followed by a flypast at Buckingham Palace.  Finding her royal feet! Meghan puts on a confident display on the Buckingham Palace balcony one month after her nervous debut at Trooping the ColourShe\u0027s less than two months into her role as the Duchess of Sussex, but today Meghan Markle proved she\u0027s finding her feet during celebrations for the RAF Centenary.The former Suits star looked poised and confident as she joined the royal family on the balcony at Buckingham Palace for the flypast, which saw the largest concentration of military aircraft in recent memory form in the skies above London to commemorate the milestone.The Queen, 92, looked up in wonder at the aeronautical display, which celebrated the history of the RAF and featured the return of Second World War aircraft including the Spitfires and Lancaster bombers, and followed a service of thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey earlier today.          The Duchess of Sussex showed off her new confidence today as she stood in pride of place alongside the Queen on the Buckingham Palace balcony for the RAF centenary celebrations           The former Suits star seemed nervous during her Buckingham Palace debut at Trooping the Colour exactly a month ago           Meghan looked at ease as she smiled warmly at her new husband Prince Harry           Prince George, four, and Princess Charlotte, three, were allowed to watch the spectacle from a window of the palace          The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who yesterday christened their son Louis, appeared in excellent spirits on the balconyShe was joined on the balcony by her sons, Prince Charles and Prince Andrew, the Duchess of Cornwall and the \u0027Fab Four\u0027: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.But tellingly, it was the Duchess stood in pride of place alongside Her Majesty who is these days usually flanked by one of her sons in the absence of the Duke of Edinburgh.It was a sharp contrast with Meghan\u0027s balcony debut at Trooping the Colour exactly one month ago on 10th June, when the retired actress was seen looking to her husband for reassurance and nervously fidgeted with her hair.And she did her best to blend into the background, standing behind the Duchess of Cambridge and sticking close to Harry\u0027s side.

Of the 90 exhibitions that fill the city’s museums and cultural spaces, five core shows have been selected and curated by the photographer Cristina de Middel, best known for her Afronaughts series, a playful reimagining of Zambia’s short-lived 1960s space mission. In Middel’s world, play isn’t a time-wasting, puerile distraction but an essential part of creativity. It is an invitation to stop and think differently. For this show of works by Magnum photographers, Middel and her co-curator Martin Parr searched for the word “players” in the Magnum archive. The resulting images show an unexpected side of the photography agency, bringing up questions about the definition of play and how it pervades everyday life, even in times of hardship.Marking 250 years of the modern circus, this exhibition explores the spectacle and thrill of the art form’s golden age, drawing from the vast collections within the Archive of Modern Conflict. While images of elephants standing on their hind legs and lions jumping through hoops are troubling from a contemporary perspective, they stand as a reminder of how differently joy has been experienced in the past. The show traces the trajectory of the spectacular, from human cannonballs to the nuclear tests in the 1950s. Here, Middel has chosen photographers who play with notions of time, place and scientific reason in unexpected ways. AnaHell’s absurdist series Secret Friends features people in multiple locations around the world, neatly bending their bodies forward to expose their backs. A hastily drawn face and a wig instantly transforms them into comic potato-like caricatures of the everyman.A comprehensive retrospective – and the 2018 PhotoEspaña award – celebrates Nigerian photographer Samuel Fosso’s exploration of identity, gender and colonialism in the African diaspora. The exhibition title references his own extraordinary journey from his childhood in Nigeria via Cameroon to the Central African Republic where he fled as a refugee after losing his parents in the civil war. Still a teenager, he became a photographer’s assistant before going on to run his own portrait studio. Fosso’s sardonic humour shines in his early experimental work and his later stylised recreations of black photo icons.

Purportedly drawn by Christopher Robin himself, the map is littered with spelling errors – “nice for picnicks” and “100 aker wood” – and is captioned “Drawn by Me and Mr Shepard helpd”.The London auction house Sotheby’s had estimated its value at between £100,000 and £150,000.“We’re extremely pleased, obviously,” said Philip Errington, Sotheby’s senior specialist in the book department, who said there had been significant international bidding. “It reflects the fact that people fall in love with the works of AA Milne and EH Shepard. The map is part of the defining world of Winnie-the-Pooh. However you approach Pooh, whether it was through a book or a Disney cartoon, the map is your way in. It is the first thing you encounter. It has a resonance.”Shepard illustrations are not rare at auction, according to Errington, with the first sold by Shepard himself in the 1920s. “They are out there and do well on the market. But the important thing is that this hasn’t been on the market for 50 years. There was particular desirability because it hasn’t been seen for so long,” he said.The previous record for a book illustration was also held by Shepard: Poohsticks Bridge, an ink drawing of Christopher Robin and his bear playing their favourite game, which featured in AA Milne’s book The House at Pooh Corner, was sold by Sotheby’s for £314,500 in 2014. The 1928 drawing had also been held in a private collection, for 40 years. Before that, a 1890s watercolour illustration by Beatrix Potter, the creator of Peter Rabbit, held the record after selling in 2008 for £289,250.This was the third time Shepard’s original map had been sold by Sotheby’s, after it fetched £650 in 1968 and then £1,700 in 1970. “So we look forward to seeing it again in another 50 years,” Errington said.Four other original Winnie-the-Pooh illustrations were also sold at the auction on Tuesday. The five drawings sold for a combined total of £917,500, including buyer’s premium. Experts had estimated the five would sell for £310,000-£440,000.

He said the retailer is in the first phase of a five-year turnaround that involves first getting the company to acknowledge the serial management failings that have resulted in years of falling clothing sales and declining profits.“We have old stores in locations where people are not spending anymore and it’s a drag on our performance,” Norman said. “We are grasping a nettle that should have been grasped many, many years ago. We have said it’s going to be 100 stores but I can’t tell you that it’s going to end there. We have got to get to the point where we have a modern estate and we have to go through the pain barrier to get there.”Norman’s comments came as Poundworld, the discount retailer that went into administration last month, said 25 shops would shut by the weekend, with the loss of nearly 250 jobs. The closures come after administrators at Deloitte failed to find a buyer for the whole business, which employs more than 5,000 people in 335 stores across the UK.Poundworld is one of a string of retailers and restaurant chains that have collapsed or shrunk against a backdrop of higher costs and the consumer spending squeeze that is also making life difficult for M\u0026ampS.Steve Rowe, M\u0026ampS’s chief executive of two years, said: “It was not a great year. We exceeded the expectations of the City but didn’t do so in a way I can be pleased or proud of.”A rare bright spot amid the gloom was the success of M\u0026ampS’s longstanding role as the official tailor of the England football team and purveyor of Gareth Southgate’s now legendary waistcoat, which has become a social media sensation. “We’re proud to be supporting England and the boys as they progress through the World Cup,” Rowe said. “I finish here because of the relevance of the transformation of the England football team and the hard work that’s gone into changing something we didn’t rate … we are committed to continue the transformation of your business and to make M\u0026ampS special again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/384b0f3298dd6e9624edba4385849dd1b79ad8e8/0_165_3654_2192/master/3654.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b11da0f37eb8eb7c52825de8687d3a1","title":"uk economy gets kick from world cup heatwave","story":"Bank of England says England win can help Britain recover from Brexit-induced slowdownEngland’s World Cup success combined with the heatwave is helping the UK economy recover from the slowdown triggered by the Brexit vote and heavy snowfall earlier this year, according to economists.Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, believes winning the trophy in Moscow at the weekend would be an “unadulterated, unalloyed good” for the whole of the British economy. England fans are expected to buy as many as 10m additional pints of beer as Gareth Southgate’s men face Croatia on Wednesday, with an estimated boost for the economy worth as much as £30m. According to the British Beer and Pub Association, the taxman is likely to cheer along as well thanks to an additional windfall worth £4.5m from beer duties. John Lewis also reckons England’s success has helped champagne sales to fizz. Consumer spending in pubs surged by a third on the day of England’s opening match of the World Cup against Tunisia, according to Barclaycard.Mark Gregory, the chief economist at consultancy EY, said: “Retail sales are on an upward trend. You might see spending on food, drink and things like replica kit – thanks to the feelgood factor and parties – continue over the next few months.”Although there are benefits, there are also drawbacks from footballing success. Some retailers will benefit more than others, as higher beer and barbecue sales erode the spending power of consumers for purchases of other goods.Back in 1966, when England won the World Cup, the UK was one year away from the then prime minister, Harold Wilson, devaluing the pound amid weak economic growth and a ballooning trade deficit.The picture could be much the same today, despite the sugar rush from the success on the football pitch, as Britain prepares to leave the EU.John Hawksworth, the chief economist at PwC, said: “I don’t think any of it really affects the underlying trend in the economy. The bigger issues are what really determines the underlying trend in terms of productivity growth, Brexit and what’s happening in the global economy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8bba44a06b813ac592403da51df4724e62634c3/0_282_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51c335f84d4ea8803ff13dcc35164356","title":"who owns the space under cities the attempt to map the ground beneath our feet","story":"The space under cities is getting busier – from transport excavations to billionaire’s mega-basements. So how to keep track of what’s down there?Just over a year ago I was sent a photograph of a tunnel-boring machine in a dirt lot in Los Angeles. The caption read: “Elon Musk is about to start digging.”The message was from Wayne Chambliss, a geographer in southern California, who tends to be prescient in such matters – and indeed, Musk’s freshly minted Boring Company soon set its machine loose, ripping through the subsurface soil under the SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne to create a short tunnel. This pet project – to test a private mass-transit system based on Hyperloop technology that would magnetically propel small pods and cars through LA’s underbelly – has now become a serious challenge to the famously traffic-snarled city’s failure to create viable public transit. The company’s website suggests “roads must go 3D” and Musk has stated “in theory, you could have hundreds of levels of tunnel” as more thoroughfares are required. As so often with Musk’s projects, the company is treating subterranean space as a tabula rasa – or in this case, tubula rasa – to be played in for profit. Indeed, in most major cities, just as you can’t expect commercial planes to stop flying over your house through aerial highways, you also can’t prevent public transport routes being dug out underneath it. Outside Melbourne, Australia, for example, the government is currently preparing to bore underneath 260 properties – including more than 100 homes – to build a road tunnel. Homeowners received a letter explaining that their “sub-stratum” land was being sequestered – without compensation. In London, a city with 150 years of trenching, digging and boring to its name, the chaos is reaching new depths. According to Newcastle University’s Global Urban Research Unit, more than 4,600 basements have been granted planning permission in the last decade – in just seven of London’s 32 boroughs. The space under London is now getting so busy that the Ordnance Survey, Future Cities Catapult and the British Geological Survey have joined forces to create a new initiative called Project Iceberg, which will attempt to aggregate cities’ subterranean data. In London it will include transport tunnel information, geological records and maps of 1.5m km (0.9m miles) of underground utilities and four million kilometres of telecommunications lines.Los Angeles does not have the same degree of vertical complication as a much older city like London, and the city council seems to be tentatively backing Musk’s new private transit tunnels. But Musk’s vision of underground dominance presents us with another thorny problem: what complications arise from passing the underground into the hands of private industry? And should the state be allowed to cede subterranean land to a billionaire to build a private transport system?Historically, the foundation of property law in the US and UK was enshrined in the Latin phrase “Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos” – which roughly translates as: “Whoever owns the soil, holds title up to the heavens and down to the depths of hell.”Subterranean scholar Dr Marilu Melo of the University of Sydney explains that not all countries behave this way. In Mexico, for example, “property rights are effectively superficial, they do not extend volumetrically into the earth,” she says.Even in places that have traditionally been ardent defenders of private property, however, once human beings took to the air and started tunnelling underground, the old heaven to hell ideal began to require caveats. In Australia, although pre-1891 land titles went “to the centre of the Earth”, those issued after 1891 extend down just 15 metres (49 feet). The new Melbourne tunnels will edge right up to this legal vertical limit.“Land prices tend to force private construction downwards, especially where there are planning limits on upward expansion,” says the Ordnance Survey’s Rollo Home.There has been a growing concern in London over “iceberg architecture”, where the volume of subterranean expansions can quickly eclipse the “host” architecture in size. The Newcastle researchers separate the London basements it studied into what sounds like fast-food drink sizes: “standard”, “large” and “mega”. In the “mega” category, they found that on average owners pulled almost 1,700 cubic metres of dirt from under their houses. Many of the basements contained cinemas, gymnasiums, pools, wine cellars and panic rooms. One even included plans for a subterranean beach with an accompanying waterfall. Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster councils have now taken steps to curb the maximum depth of such projects. The Ordnance Survey has suggested that £5.5bn ($7bn) is spent every year on exploratory excavation just to figure out what’s underground, and according to a 2013 Mayor of London report, £150m of damage is done every year to underground utilities because of a lack of information. Underground urban planning of an extension of a tube line, for instance, requires knowledge of where sewer and water systems, electricity and utility tunnels, bunkers, foundations, basements, cellars, vaults, passageways, archaeological remains, data centres, basements, and other transport tunnels are located. Most cities have a “dial before you dig” hotline because there is no central holding place for data about underground space. Enter Project Iceberg. The goal is to serve as a repository for data on all of these underground elements, from which a comprehensive visualisation can be built. The resulting map would need to be an all-inclusive spatial database, but how volumetric cartography might look is not yet imagined. It could perhaps be something like Bruno Imbrizi’s real-time 3D tube map that went viral in 2013. Or the framework could feed an augmented reality engine, so that aiming a phone camera at the ground would reveal what is underneath. Singapore, Helsinki and Hong Kong are model cities for developing underground masterplans – and it is no coincidence that tightly controlled and regulated cities hold better data in this regard. Private developers digging and burrowing into cities like Los Angeles and London make this immensely more complicated – as does the need for secrecy on many underground projects. The underground is, after all, where we hide things. When Westminster tube station was built, much of it had to be “planned by omission”, a guide told me. Engineers would submit plans and the government would send them back with suggestions for different routes – refusing to explain why. Land registry data later confirmed what anti-secrecy journalists like Duncan Campbell had suspected all along: the existence of a network of covert tunnels connecting government buildings in Westminster. The government, in short, wasted loads of public money denying the existence of something that it had secretly spent a great deal of public money building in the first place. Further clandestine excavations spring to mind: tunnels under borders used to smuggle people and contraband shipping containers stockpiled with food buried in the wee hours by doomsday preppers. Given London’s history of furtive diggers – like William Lyttle, the Mole Man of Hackney, who burrowed under his house for 40 years – it doesn’t seem a stretch to imagine a TfL boring machine punching through the side of a fallout shelter dug without permission. Although it is an open project, Iceberg researchers have suggested creating a hidden vault layer in the 3D map, where secret data could be locked away from general view. Yet as was clear in the Westminster example, the absence of data is data in a comprehensive archive. Given this, both governments and criminals who wish to keep their underground infrastructure under wraps may find it difficult to do so in the coming age of volumetric transparency. We have little virtual privacy left within decades, all spatial privacy may evaporate, too.The US government has been trying to map the subsurface of the Earth from outer space, by measuring differences in the gravity field at the Earth’s surface. An Air Force project undertaken more than 20 years ago on a tunnel in Texas was able to capture “reasonably accurate readings of the tunnel’s size, shape, variable depth, and orientation”, as Chambliss told attendees of the recent annual American Association of Geographers conference in New Orleans. This could soon enable a planetary-scale survey of the underground, revealing new tunnels, bunkers, silos, and compounds. His recommendation to the assembled geographers: “Dig now.”Many are. In Sweden, which already has 65,000 known shelters for a population of just under 10 million people, the government has begun building new bunkers. Seoul in South Korea has more than 3,000 large public shelters. In the plains of Kansas, I recently visited two cold war-era Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) silos being redeveloped into “Survival Condos for the wealthy. Meanwhile, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) is currently funding a “subterranean challenge”, soliciting bids for techniques to enhance “situational awareness” of global underground spaces, with a $2m prize. The challenge is to create machines that can make their way through tunnel systems, urban undergrounds and natural caves. Robots will need to climb, crawl, squeeze and sense their way through these environments, with an eye towards future use in dangerous or hostile underground environments that human bodies can’t access. These robots will effectively become our subterranean avatars, and their deployment will mean that there really is nowhere left to hide.“If we are to take control of the subsurface, we need to have an holistic view of the subsurface,” says Home. But who is to wield that control? For almost 200 years – since Marc Brunel’s invention of the tunnelling shield, which protects workers as they inch forward during excavation – human beings have almost exclusively excavated using money from the public purse. Only two years ago, for example, more than £9bn of public money was used in Switzerland to tunnel 35 miles through the Alps, down to depths of almost 2.4km.Underground has long been a space of public investment, communal infrastructure, exploration and, when required, secret assembly. In many ways subterranean environs have been more democratic than the surface of the Earth, as depicted in Gabriel Tarde’s 1896 utopian novel The Underground Man, in which in which people not only survive but thrive after a “fortunate disaster” forces human kind to burrow. But as we rush to render our underground world in three dimensions, increasingly it appears we are backing – tacitly or otherwise – private ownership and comprehensive surveillance. The mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, has just handed Musk’s Boring Company a contract to build a Hyperloop to shuttle people from O’Hare International Airport to the city centre. Although Musk’s company will build the tunnel, the city will own it and lease it back to Musk for use, and Musk has also stated that (unlike in Melbourne) no land will be seized to build it. Both sound like good caveats, but neither dilute the fact that this will be a private, for-profit, transport system – not public transport.Just like our drone-filled skies, the undergrounds of the future appear to be just another territory for the rich and powerful to colonise the rich and powerful , a process that may replicate and compound the inequalities of the present. This may be cause enough to throw a wrench into Musk’s tunnel-boring machines. Metaphorically speaking, of course.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, or explore our archive"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddaa7ee379b24633e7dbc375b8454e7852265a44/0_128_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb15f4fd726e2ee82c24d224c45e8b23","title":"brett kavanaugh nomination victory originalists","story":"Donald Trump’s court pick belongs to a group of conservative legal thinkers who believe in a strict, textual interpretation of the constitution. That’s troublingEd Meese was the cherry on top.The 86-year-old former attorney general was one of the first dignitaries Donald Trump trotted out at his carefully orchestrated, prime-time roll-out of Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the US supreme court. Meese, Ronald Reagan’s right-hand man from California, is the godfather of “original intent”, the crackpot, rightwing legal theory that will, if Kavanaugh is confirmed, be enshrined for decades to come. For the first time since Reagan began stacking the court with originalists like the late justice Antonin Scalia, they will, if Kavanaugh is confirmed, have a solid, unbending court majority. Kavanaugh’s nomination, no surprise, is a huge victory for the originalists, conservative legal thinkers who believe in a strict, textual interpretation of the constitution. They believe in adhering to the intent of framers of the constitution, white men whose outlook reflected 18th-century realities and whose thinking the originalists believe they have a unique ability to ine.Various mainstream legal scholars, including Harvard’s Cass Sunstein, have shredded the originalist approach, showing how so-called strict construction of the constitution can be used to justify horrifying, retrograde acts like banning contraceptives, discrimination against women and blacks and to nullify environmental protections. Originalism animates Kavanaugh’s legal career and infuses his 300 legal opinions. It isn’t conservative or principled, as Kavanaugh’s champions argue. It’s radical and retrograde. That’s why rightwing nuts like Sean Hannity, who was reported to have preferred another candidate, Amy Coney Barrett, were doing cartwheels for Kavanugh after Trump’s announcement.Originalists often turn out to be hypocrites. They pose as conservative defenders of the constitution and then move in wild, new directions. That was manifest when Kenneth Starr, Kavanaugh’s old boss, overreached and tried to impeach former president Bill Clinton over a lurid affair with a White House intern.  In poring over Kavanaugh’s record, more needs to be known about where he stood on former president George W Bush’s radical, post-911 restrictions on civil liberties, the cornerstone of the constitution. How did this young originalist justify overzealous policies like torture and rendition when he was Bush’s staff secretary? Surely, the framers were frowning. Of course, originalists are especially untrustworthy when it comes to women’s rights, since the framers were noticeably silent in granting distaff power. There have been glowing accounts of Kavanugh’s clerkship for Justice Anthony Kennedy, but little said about his sojourn in the chambers of Judge Alex Kozinski of California, whose rampant sexual harassment of women forced his abrupt retirement last year. Roe v Wade is anathema to most originalists. Expected staunch opposition from women’s groups and possible defections from Republican senators like Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins help explain Monday night’s White House paeans to Kavanugh’s mother, wife, daughters and the women’s basketball team he coaches. According to Adam Liptak, the always-wise New York Times correspondent who covers the court, Kavanaugh “has written countless decisions applauded by conservatives on topics including the second amendment, religious freedom, the campaign finance. But they have particularly welcomed his vigorous opinions hostile to administrative agencies, a central concern of the modern conservative legal movement.” A dissent that surely must have comforted Trump as he reportedly tossed and turned over who to pick was one in which Kavanaugh attacked the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and promoted the notion of an all-powerful presidency.“To prevent tyranny and protect inidual liberty, the framers of the constitution separated the legislative, executive and judicial powers of the new national government,” Kavanaugh wrote. “To further safeguard liberty, the framers insisted upon accountability for the exercise of executive power. The framers lodged full responsibility for the executive power in a president of the United States, who is elected by and accountable to the people.” Another source of comfort was surely that Kavanaugh, departing from his past work for Starr, amended his views in a 2009 article and decided presidents should not be distracted from doing their jobs by pesky legal prosecutions.From the get-go, I figured Kavanaugh would be Trump’s pick. His perfect macho looks, his perfect academic pedigrees, his full backing from the Federalist Society all lined up. Best of all, he once mouthed the word bitch as he looked at Hillary Clinton on TV, according to David Brock.For Trump, that certainly must have been the cherry on top."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0afc1a67f40ba302e3dd3a58ed58c366b894efbf/0_294_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e22d2d333e4d3847997c415af9c7c1f1","title":"eu europe theresa may brexit red lines ministers","story":"The EU’s initial reaction to the Chequers plan is polite, but negative. The prime minister will have to make further concessions before it is acceptedThe EU is shedding few tears over the departures of the Brexit secretary, David Davis, and the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. The European commission’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, found Davis’s bluffness and tendency to skate over details irritating. Many EU ministers despised Johnson, viewing him as a self-obsessed showman whose dishonesty had helped to deliver Brexit.The EU has long considered Theresa May’s key Brexit official, Olly Robbins, as her main representative – Davis had spent only four hours with Barnier since the start of this year. The commission had become increasingly frustrated with May’s inability to define a UK plan and to take on the hard-Brexit ministers. Now the Chequers agreement and the cabinet resignations show that she has found some mettle.This has boosted her credibility with the EU, which is fortunate, because its initial reaction to the Chequers plan, though polite, is negative. It views the “facilitated customs arrangement” (FCA) – the complex, hi-tech scheme for the UK to collect customs dues on behalf of the EU – as unworkable. It would have helped if May had spelt out what must be her intention, which is to keep the UK in a customs union until the FCA works (if it ever does). More importantly, the EU dislikes the idea of the British staying in the single market for goods, even though they would be “rule-takers” – signing up not only to current rules but also to future laws, without having a vote on them.May’s point is that the single market for goods would – if combined with satisfactory customs and VAT arrangements – obviate the need for checks on the intra-Irish border, as well as avoid disruption of manufacturing supply chains. Service companies would have to cope with poorer access to EU markets, but she thinks the UK financial services industry is too big and important to be a rule-taker. May is probably right to believe that her plan is the least-bad model for the UK economy that might work politically.But she will struggle to persuade the EU to grant free movement of goods without the UK also signing up to the remaining “four freedoms” – of services, capital and labour. EU leaders consider the four freedoms inisible: if the UK could “cherrypick” parts of the single market without accepting free movement of people, other states, inside or outside the EU, could ask for similar deals. And that would undermine the strength and cohesion of the EU’s institutions.Johnson\u0026nbspsays in a long-awaited statement\u0026nbspthat \u0027after a huge amount of heartache\u0027 he will​ back the leave campaign. In January, David Cameron had announced ministers could campaign on either side, and despite being a backbencher, Johnson\u0027s view was seen as influential.Johnson campaigns around the UK, posing with the now infamous bus saying leaving the EU would provide the NHS with an extra £350m a week – a\u0026nbspclaim later condemned\u0026nbspas a misuse of statistics.After Cameron quits, Johnson\u0026nbspannounces he will contest\u0026nbspthe Conservative leadership, pitching himself as a unifier. In a surprise twist, Michael Gove\u0026nbspsays he will also stand, warning that Johnson cannot provide the leadership needed. This\u0026nbspprompts Johnson\u0026nbspto use the launch of his leadership bid to say he will no longer stand.Theresa May, who took over the leadership unopposed, appoints Johnson as foreign secretary.Labour MPs call for Johnson to step down after\u0026nbsphe wrongly states that\u0026nbspNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who was jailed in Iran, was \u0027teaching people journalism\u0027 – something both her family and her employer said was untrue, and was used by Iranian officials to justify her detention.Johnson is among 29 ministers who discuss May’s plan for Brexit at Chequers. He\u0026nbspagrees to her proposals, though it is later reported he had initial doubts.After vanishing for several hours,\u0026nbspJohnson resigns.\u0026nbspThe EU worries that the UK is asking for something close to the Swiss model. Switzerland is in the single market for goods, but not services – which Brussels dislikes because the European court of justice cannot enforce the rulebook on the Swiss.Commission officials add that these days, goods and services cannot be disentangled much of the value of a good comes from related services (such as the design, marketing and financing of a car). And if the UK were free to undercut EU standards on services, it could distort the level playing field for goods. But the Chequers plan seeks to meet concerns about the playing field by promising to maintain EU social, environmental and consumer standards and to respect its state aid rules.Some continental companies, such as those making cars and aeroplanes, are more open to the UK plan than the commission. So are some governments, including those in central Europe that fear the geostrategic consequences of a Europe weakened by a hard Brexit. Yet so far there is little evidence of Britain’s friends seeking to soften the hard line set by the commission and many member states. Indeed in the commission and in Paris some officials say that they are relaxed about the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, believing the costs acceptable.May’s strongest argument is that only her plan can ensure there is no hard border between the two parts of Ireland. The commission’s line is that a Canada-style free trade agreement for the UK, combined with Northern Ireland staying in a customs and regulatory union with the EU, would deliver the same outcome. But May and many other British politicians believe that that scheme, involving checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea, would challenge the UK’s constitutional integrity.Barnier says that if the UK’s red lines alter, the EU’s offer could change. But May would have to make substantial concessions before the Chequers plan became viable. She would need to commit to a customs union until some hi-tech alternative became viable. That would mean a stringent mechanism for following new EU rules and a significant role for the European court.May has indicated flexibility on all three points. But she would find it harder to cede on payments to the EU and free movement of labour (both of which Norway and Switzerland accept as the price for market access). There are probably ways of fudging the money issue, but free movement will be much harder. The EU shows no signs of wanting to restrict free movement of workers within its single market.And May’s dilemma is that the paler her red lines become, the greater the risk of losing more ministers.• Charles Grant is director of the Centre for European Reform"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0af18644225f1acb8923b110408d1a884c399c0c/0_91_4892_2935/master/4892.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0deebf057d075d1fab9c31d9a067b06e","title":"the guardian view on the nato summit europe must come together","story":"James Comey, the former FBI director, said of Donald Trump that he bore more resemblance to a mob boss than a democratic politician. In Mr Comey’s experience Mr Trump was a leader who demanded loyalty oaths, wanted absolute control, traded in lies and insisted on an us-versus-them worldview. Unfortunately these traits\u0026nbspwill undoubtedly be on display when the US president arrives at the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation summit in Brussels tomorrow.It is these kinds of actions that make Mr Trump so dangerous. The Nato alliance has helped mould the modern world and ushered in a democratic, liberal world order characterised by open trade and open societies, which after the collapse of the Soviet Union needed only to be lightly defended. This in turn contributed greatly to American peace and prosperity. A perception that the burdens are unequally shared is not new. It is almost as old as the alliance itself. Barack Obama worried that other nations did not act for themselves, waiting instead for Washington to lead. Mr Obama could be criticised for sermonising, but he was being straight. He saw that the defence of the multilateral rules-based order against jihadist terror, Russian adventurism and Chinese intimidation was essential. But it required other nations to shoulder their responsibilities. This seems fair. By contrast Mr Trump wrongly sees the US being disadvantaged, not advantaged, by the current global order. His tactics are to tear down this order rather than build it up.Nato’s top brass will have their work cut out. The US president prefers the argument of power to the power of argument. He thinks little of humiliating allies over the Iran nuclear deal or snubbing them over the Paris climate change pact or infuriating them with tariffs. This could lead to anarchy, as nations conclude that they are freer to act with impunity. With rising powers such as China, it might end in confrontation. The US president’s description of Nato as being “as bad as Nafta” at the last G7 summit is not a good sign.

But we want to go further. We want every young person leaving primary school to be fluent in reading and fluent in arithmetic,” the minister said.Gibb said schools should take responsibility to avoid making the tests a stressful experience for their pupils, despite the high stakes involved.“We trust schools not to put undue pressure on young people. These are not tests that lead to qualifications for the children themselves,” he said.“Sats were introduced in 1990 to hold schools to account. That’s the purpose of them. It’s that holding schools to account that helps drive up standards across the board.“Parents expect schools to test children. But we do not expect schools to put pressure on young people when they are taking Sats. The heads I meet, who are running very good primary schools, say: ‘We would not dream of putting pressure on our young people’. Sometimes pupils don’t even realise they are taking tests.“It’s effective teaching over the period of primary which will deliver the results. Putting undue pressure on pupils will not deliver the kind of results that our accountability system is demanding.”Julie McCulloch, the director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said schools should be congratulated on their results but she remained concerned over reports of children crying and having nightmares about the tests.“Schools do their best to protect their pupils from stress and anxiety, but action is clearly needed to reduce the pressure of the current system.“The problem is not the tests themselves but the fact that they are used as the main way of judging primary schools and the stakes are extremely high,” McCulloch said.ASCL and other teaching unions have lobbied the Department for Education (DfE) and Ofsted to give less weight to the assessments when judging schools. The National Association of Head Teachers said any direct comparisons with previous years’ tests was not possible because of significant changes to the assessment of writing this year, after protests that the previous system was unfair. “No single piece of data should ever be used to make a judgment about a school or a child. We recommend that performance data should be looked at over a three year period and we have assurances from the secretary of state that data will be used more fairly,” said Paul Whiteman, the NAHT’s general secretary. Gibb said that Damian Hinds, the education secretary, had made it clear he wanted an accountability system that was “proportionate”. “We don’t want an accountability system that’s akin to being a football manager but we do expect high standards in our schools,” Gibb said.The DfE has said it will scrap national assessments at key stage one – for six- and seven-year-olds – in exchange for a new assessment when children enter full-time schooling in reception classes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b5853b66aa8d5622a6c54f1e806601a72e3b1d4/0_0_1200_675/master/1200.jpg?w=880\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd9d019665cd059d8334958aa52c55c7 880w","title":"high fashion cycling sunglasses kim kardashian princess anne bella hadid performance shades","story":"Cycling’s sartorial reinvention is nothing new. Brands such as Rapha, CHPT3, Pas Normal Studios, Isadore and MAAP have offered style-conscious cyclists an alternative to poorly fitted fluro gear for a decade. The fashion world has paid attention too, with Moschino taking cycling style to the catwalk in 2015, and caps becoming essential wear for Williamsburg’s hipsters. But recently, a specific piece of cycling apparel has become co-opted by the fashion crowd: sunglasses.At men’s fashion week last month in Paris, Bella Hadid, Rita Ora and Kim Kardashian were spotted in high-end performance sunglasses: Hadid in Heron Preston x Nike Visions, Ora in Oakley Jawbreakers (as worn by Mark Cavendish) and Kardashian in Alpinas. Vetements – one of the most influential brands in the world – put them on models on the catwalk. Stella McCartney makes Turbo Wrap sunglasses that would be at home on Mont Ventoux. American Vogue has even started running editorials on them.“It’s bizarre,” says cycling journalist Stuart Clapp, who edits Rouleur’s apparel section. “Princess Anne wore some to the royal wedding. It’s like a 90s throwback thing. In cycling terms, you wear cycling sunglasses when you’re on the bike, but no one wants to wear them off it. Not even when you’re in\u0026nbspthe cafe.”But perhaps it’s not that strange. Brands such as Off-White have been designing cycling shorts for a while and, as the ’s fashion editor Hannah Marriott tells me, “they go with the ironic ugly trainer vibe permeating fashion. They’ve never really been fashionable before so they make early adopters feel a bit clever on Instagram.”Cycling sunglasses have had some distinct eras. In the early pre-war years, riders would don the kind of goggles you would expect to see in a cockpit rather than in the peloton. In the 50s and 60s, innovators such as Fausto Coppi and Britain’s most stylish cyclist, Tom Simpson, began wearing aviators. But it was the 80s and the introduction of Oakley that broke the mould.The story goes that when American pro-cyclist Greg LeMond wanted a pair of performance glasses, Oakley, until then mostly known as a motocross brand, delivered the Factory Pilots: huge yet minimalist wraparound glasses, which provided protection from flies and grit flicked up from the road, as well as the sun. Their ungainly aesthetic caused ripples of laughter in the peloton at first, but became must-haves among pros soon after.In the 90s, Oakley’s dominance was challenged by Briko’s extreme big-and-bold styles, worn by the late, great Italian Marco Pantani.It is exactly these large styles that are being embraced by the fashion crowd now: the Alba Optics I try out engulf your entire field of vision.They are most in demand with cyclists who want to make a statement, according to Clapp. “Cycling had that thing with the statement socks,” he says. “You had\u0026nbspto have really lairy socks. Now\u0026nbspit’s all about wearing sunglasses\u0026nbspand them being outrageous.” No wonder fashion’s front row are road-testing them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2255735cd753e8026173b6799adccde465b9e7a9/0_184_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11b7dfa0e9cbb3f27379afb6fff97535","title":"arsenal complete 265m signing of uruguay midfielder lucas torreira","story":"Arsenal have made their fourth signing this summer under new manager Unai Emery by completing a €30m (£26.5m) deal for Sampdoria’s Uruguayan defensive midfielder Lucas Torreira.The 22-year-old, who passed a medical at the club’s London Colney training complex on Tuesday, will not, though, be joining up with the Arsenal squad until early August having featured in all five matches of Uruguay’s run to the World Cup quarter-finals. “In Lucas Torreira, we have signed a young player who is a very bright talent in the game,” Emery told Arsenal’s official website. “A midfielder with great quality, I have enjoyed watching his performances for Sampdoria in the past two seasons, and we all saw him do very well for Uruguay in the World Cup.

The World Cup’s an indubitable reminder, if anyone needed it, that England is a football country that plays at other games.Which channel is Croatia v England on? ITV, from 6pm. Emmerdale, Coronation Street and Paul O’Grady’s Animal Orphans have all been shifted from the schedule, it’s that big a deal.

Well, England did win the World Cup that Saturday.The match only just made the front page, in a single column down the left-hand side, all about how the players would share a £22,000 bonus despite the Wilson government’s wage freeze. The lead story was the latest development in the Nigeria coup d’état. Skip ahead a generation to 5 July, 1990, and England’s defeat by Germany in the semi-finals shared the top billing with a story about the poll tax. Inside, the match coverage filled a single page, the same as Goran Ivanisevic’s run to the Wimbledon semi-finals and only a little more than the news that Phil DeFreitas wasn’t going to play the third Test against New Zealand.A generation on again, and England’s World Cup run has become so utterly irresistible that other sports are contorting their schedules just so everyone involved can get it all over with in time for kick-off. There were emergency committee meetings in the cricket leagues last week to rush through agreements about early starts and extended tea-breaks for last Saturday’s matches.Gloucestershire and Kent have brought T20 game forward to 3pm.

It seems that scared the club into making one concession.It is now going to allow fans to watch the game on their mobile phones.

It is time to think the delightfully thinkable.As England’s footballers prepare for the epic final knockings of Russia 2018 there is already a feeling of wider forces at work, of spectating on a small but significant peg in the shared cultural history.The players will return in glory whatever the bounce of the ball against a high-class but tiring Croatia. A semi-final is a spectacular achievement in itself. On the other hand we have the nuclear option. This England team is more than capable of winning two more matches from here and becoming unexpected but deliriously received world champions.At which point it is perhaps time to think a few slightly less thinkable things about victory and medals and what sport is ultimately for.What would England winning the World Cup really mean? To use a classic press conference formula: what message would this send out? Or if you really want to know where this is going, what would it mean for England – the Fat Man of Europe land of under-geared school sport and falling participation but a place where professional football is brilliantly managed – to win the World Cup?And yes, everyone knows this is not the moment for this, that it is instead the moment for cheers and beers in the air, for sucking the sweetness from the spectacle. As indeed we will. As a wise man once said, I’m happy for you, Imma let you finish.But there is also a disjunct that will be felt by many. On one hand elite English football is as well-run and managed as it ever has been. The Premier League is a wonderful product. By the end of the week England could have world champions at senior, under-20 and under-17 level. The people responsible – the coaches, players, parents, those who have helped through the levels – are an inspiration.But this is also a split sporting universe, a place where a World Cup win should not be seen as an end point or as proof of good health in all other areas.What is the value of a medal? It is a question familiar to anyone who has studied the last six years of Olympic “legacy”. Great Britain basically won the Olympics in 2012 and 2016. Look at the medal table. One anomalously small, quite unhealthy nation occupies second and third place, wedged in between the super states.The athletes and coaches and funding bodies played this beautifully. Their medals are a profound achievement. But they have very little to do with the everyday sporting experience of the British people. Outsiders looking at “Team GB” in action might have thought, wow, this country really does have a wonderfully thrusting and healthy outdoor culture, so many people taking part, such a vibrant wealth of grassroots rowing and pommel-horsing.In reality we are more than ever a nation of sedentary sofa-bound consumers. Take your pick of the culprits: lack of facilities, inactive parenting, selling-off of playing fields and the scandalous death of sport in state schools.Either way there are fewer people participating in sport now than there were before the 2012 Games.This is not football’s fault. Football does not drive bad diet and an indolent culture. Plus of course football is not the government, or Sport UK, or your parents. It is a business responsible only to its employees and shareholders.And yet it isn’t, is it? Look at the happiness England’s success thus far has brought. Look at the energy here, the goodwill. This passion has been exploited brilliantly by football’s commercial arms. But it needs to be fed too.But there is good news too. The Football Association is aware of this. The plan to sell Wembley to fund grassroots football is so wonderfully sensible it still inspires a double take, although it is vital this is done properly.At the same time the women’s grassroots game is flourishing, or in other words taking up a shameful amount of slack. The Premier League is also stepping up, committed to doubling its grassroots investment to £100m a year. This trickle down will have some effect.But what is striking is how entirely unrelated this is to the professional game. We have a distinct two-tier system here. The current England team reflects the successful Team GB methodology, with a similar set of processes to those used in elite rowing and cycling.Pluck out the right kind of malleable talent. Then create a kind of uber-culture with its own sealed space. Even Gareth Southgate’s selection reflects this. The players are athletic, young and intelligent. Nobody smokes or booze-binges. Nobody is a difficult physical type. Within this, England have sweated those dear old marginal gains, engineered a genuine team culture, become supremely well organised.It is brilliant work, tribute to the skill and thoroughness of the manager. But it is a self-contained achievement, one that reflects also the culture of the Premier League academy system. This is a micromanaged world, with talented kids extracted as young as five and kept distinct, nourished and coached away from schools and clubs where habits are bad, pitches are poor, coaching dad-level.The success of England’s junior teams suggests the academies are getting something seriously right. And good luck to them. But when it comes to World Cups and shared glory it is worth recognising this system is not an expression of national good health, some vital piece of municipal planning or political will. It has nothing to do with football your children will play, the access they will get to facilities, the camaraderie and pleasure and good health these things can bring.This is not, for example, Iceland, where TV revenues went into building an all-weather pitch in every school and into the building of indoor arenas where local people get to use the same professional facilities, a genuine shared national success. For England, reaching a World Cup final would mark this year and this giddy, fun summer in the popular culture for ever. Probably we are already there with a semi-final. Hug your neighbour. Give thanks for Lord Gareth and his coat of the waist. But there is also a chance here to use all that energy and pride and unity in other ways.There will be no shortage of people looking to borrow the glow of England’s success. Political capital will be sought. The value of the product will be boosted. Yet more money and interest will gush in. Does elite football really need a new car or a larger mansion?How refreshing if some wider idend could be reaped, with a little extra provision to help protect our green spaces, fit out our rundown parks, to cut ticket prices for younger fans to see these England players in the flesh, to rejuvenate the greybeard support.Most of all, those in power could do something about school sport, reinserting it into the day, training PE teachers, giving the girls and boys inspired by seeing this on their television a nudge that they can get out there and do it too.Recent history offers us a guide. Great Britain won the Olympics in 2012 and 2016, then lost them in the years that followed. With this World Cup England has a chance not just to win the war, but also the peace that follows."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/847ca46d291732f419e0f450c650a25febaa8097/0_63_2456_1474/master/2456.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90921ae6daa67631ea9cd573a8d80910","title":"no expense spared as england prepares for world cup","story":"From private jets to M\u0026ampS waistcoats, open mosques to closed supermarkets, football fever grips the nationEngland fans are taking trains, planes and automobiles – often at exorbitant cost – in a desperate bid to get to Russia in time to see England play in the semi-final of the World Cup against Croatia, and maybe even the final on Sunday. The Football Association is expecting more than 10,000 fans to make the 3,600-mile trip to Moscow for Wednesday’s game.Some, like England fan Karan Rai who booked a single flight to Moscow just before the England-Sweden game kicked off, only have a one-way ticket.“I still have no idea how I will get home yet, but all this is worth it,” he told the . “I am confident next week I will be in Trafalgar Square for the trophy parade and an unveiling of a statue of Lord Southgate in his waistcoat outside Westminster.

I haven’t slept properly since I got my ticket yesterday, as I have been filled with excitement,” he said. “I think since Brexit we have such a ided nation and an England victory could really unite the nation.”Hyde Park in London is set to host the biggest London screening of a football match since Euro 96, with up to 30,000 football fans expected to pour in to the park to watch England’s semi-final against Croatia.Reading the mood of the nation, the British Summer Time (BST) festival being held at the park has postponed planned events to allow the free screening to take place on Wednesday. Its website crashed under the weight of demand on Monday as tens of thousands applied for tickets to watch the game on a giant 94m x 11m (308ft x 36ft) screen.The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said he hoped Londoners of “all ages and backgrounds” would come together to cheer the team on.In Manchester fans will gather at the Castlefield Bowl but some fans were criticised for snapping up the free tickets and them attempting to sell them for £80 each. Albert Hall will open its doors for a free screening at 5pm, while Victoria Warehouse, near the Manchester United ground, is opening its doors to 3,500, flogging tickets from between £4 and £11.25.Will anyone spare a thought for the organisers of long-planned events that just happen to have coincided with England games? Since England beat Sweden, events up and down the country have been cancelled because of a clash with the semi-final. Birmingham’s mayor, Andy Street, cancelled an official event, saying that football coming home was more important. The mayor’s “Ask Andy” evening was due to take place at 7pm on Wednesday in Wolverhampton, but sensing a low turnout, the mayor announced on Twitter that it would be rescheduled.And while England may be a sporting-mad nation, football training sessions and matches have been cancelled in many places. The Swindon Speedway team postponed Wednesday’s meeting against Leicester, and Yorkshire County Cricket Club’s fixture against Derbyshire has been rescheduled.One British stalwart is refusing to bow to pressure, however. The All England Lawn Tennis \u0026amp Croquet Club confirmed that the Wimbledon men’s singles final, scheduled for 2pm on Sunday, will not be moved even if England reach the World Cup final on the same afternoon.In Liverpool a mosque has opened its doors to worshippers and non-denominational football fans alike, showing all the games on a big screen as part of a community integration push. The Abdullah Quilliam Mosque is now gearing up for the biggest game so far with a barbecue and soft drinks. “This is the first time any mosque has screened the World Cup”, said its chief executive, Mumin Khan. “We are delighted to host the World Cup, the mosque welcomes people of all walks of life and football brings people together and this encourages community cohesion.”While the atmosphere has been very family friendly, the atmosphere among fans has been electric, said Khan. “It has been a success and there was a real sense of change in helping people feel like they can walk into a mosque. It is a positive gateway for challenging negative perceptions about Islam.”Londoners Adam Burns, Kevin Masters, Paco López and Rasmus Otto have watched games with people from 32 different nations during this World Cup in a bid to experience the full cultural wealth of the capital, but when England take to the field for the semi-final against Croatia on Wednesday they are looking forward to watching it among England fans.The foursome – two Brits, a Spaniard and a Dane – will either watch the game with 30,000 other football-crazy fans at Hyde Park or, if it can be arranged, with older fans in an old people’s home who remember England’s triumph in the 1966 World Cup.“It’s been an amazing experience and we’ve shown that the World Cup really does transcend nations,” says Burns, who has taken a five-week break from work to complete the task with his friends. “We have such incredible experiences, but as an England fan we might only get to see a semi-final once in our lifetime so we want to be among England fans.”Since England beat Sweden to make it to their first World Cup semi-final for 28 years, and deranged optimism gripped the nation, die-hard fans have been flocking in increasing numbers to tattoo parlours. Because nothing says “this will definitely not jinx England’s World Cup progression” like having the words “It’s coming home” permanently tattooed on your skin.One 30-year-old has gone one step further, having the words “World Cup Winners 2018” inked along his thigh along with the face of Harry Kane, all before a single ball is kicked in the first hurdle England face, reported the Daily Mirror. Rather than face mass walkouts and claims of sickness among staff members desperate to watch the football, several supermarkets have already announced that they will close their doors early if England make it through to the World Cup final.Iceland will close at 2pm on Sunday, while Aldi and Lidl – “the official supermarket of the England team” – will shut at 3pm, if England make it that far.Lidl’s UK chief executive, Christian Härtnagel, said: “We absolutely believe it’s coming home, which is why we are planning to close stores an hour early, and take part in what we hope will become a day of national celebration.”Aldi’s UK chief executive, Giles Hurley, similarly hopes to allow staff “time to finish work and get home to watch the match, just like everyone else.”Some lucky – and decidedly well-heeled – England fans have decided they are going to travel to the World Cup in style. According to private jet companies, groups of friends and family members are clubbing together to meet the cost of a private charter – estimated to cost between £45,000 and £50,000 for a return flight on a nine-seater aircraft. Those lucky few are travelling “in VIP style for this once-in-a-lifetime experience”, said PrivateFly.We already know that Gareth Southgate, as well as harbouring all the hopes and dreams of a nation, is now the style icon of the majority of sartorially savvy England fans. Waistcoat sales have gone through the roof, with demand so high that Marks \u0026amp Spencer, which sells the official England waistcoat sported by Southgate for £65, has sold out of all sizes except XXL online, with the retailer desperately attempting to restock before the big game. Showing dedication to their fashion choices and their leader, England fans have taken to wearing their waistcoats – official or otherwise – while making the long trip to Russia. Whether they are still wearing them on the flight home remains to be seen. The Lightning Seeds and David Baddiel and Frank Skinner’s England anthem, Three Lions, has undeniably been the anthem of England fans during this World Cup – and even George Ezra is hoping that the song’s resurgence will see it rise as gloriously as a Harry Maguire header to the top of the charts.The singer, who has topped the charts for the past two weeks, tweeted fans this week, urging them to knock him off the top spot to help get Three Lions once again to No 1. Why? “Because it’s coming home,” said Ezra. If the renaissance of “it’s coming home” has been immortalised in tattoos, social media memes, PR stunts, singles sales and Google searches, one enterprising athlete found a unique way of declaring his belief: by marking the Earth itself. Well, sort of. Felix Gott, an enthusiastic runner from London, used his GPS device and tracked his route on sporting social network Strava to spell out those three little words – in admittedly clumsy style – on the streets of the capital."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4606ff04d4bcdc5039918f2268b8b86bf4a46ff0/0_348_5220_3132/master/5220.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f91a8a64032cbd6c972d5e36cc9a76b6","title":"parliament future world cups free to air tv","story":"If the home nations submit a bid to host the 2030 World Cup, the government must not bow to pressure from Fifa and amend its laws protecting the tournament’s TV rights from being sold to the highest bidder, parliament will be told on Wednesday.Just hours before England take on Croatia in the World Cup semi-final there will be an adjournment debate in parliament to discuss listed sporting events, those protected for free-to-air television. After the doomed bid for the 2018 World Cup, it emerged that the government had indicated it was prepared to kowtow to Fifa and pledge there would be no restrictions on TV coverage of the tournament.This was despite an inquiry led by the former FA executive director David Davies into listed events which recommended the entire World Cup be protected by legislation for free-to-air broadcasting. TV audiences on BBC and ITV for this World Cup have been enormous with England’s quarter-final victory over Sweden watched by almost 20m on the BBC and the last-16 match against Colombia, screened on ITV and reaching 24m viewers at its peak during the penalty shootout.The backbench Labour MP John Grogan will argue that the World Cup must remain protected by the listed events legislation which dates back to the 1950s. “This is a British success story which we must preserve for future generations so that they too can be inspired by the very best in the world of sport,” he said.Over the next 12 months the FA will consider whether to submit a bid for the 2030 tournament and there is the possibility it could also join forces with the football associations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to submit a united bid.Grogan will also use the parliamentary debate to suggest that the World Cups for women in football, rugby and cricket should be added to the list of protected events to recognise their increased popularity among the public. It is currently only the male World Cups in those sports which fall under the government legislation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7ee03c4e9108dd0490c25ccc3eacad8cbe47689/0_87_4496_2698/master/4496.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=263c655ae9f3ee1417d680103ff2b4b7","title":"psychology england football team change your life pippa grange","story":"England players seem happier and more grounded – and much of the credit goes to psychologist Pippa Grange. What can the team’s approach teach us all about facing fear and failure?This week, the England midfielder Dele Alli was asked if he was nervous about the big tests up ahead: first, of course, the team’s semi-final against Croatia on Wednesday. “Excited, not nervous,” he replied. His apparent happiness and confidence reflected an England team that seems transformed from previous incarnations. Where once it was stuffed with entitled, surly stars, burdened with the weight of history and the pressure of expectations, it now comes across as a hungry, humble team, playing with lightness and joy.“We’ve spoken to the players about writing their own stories,” said the manager, Gareth Southgate, after the team beat Colombia in an unprecedentedly victorious (for England) penalty shootout. “Tonight they showed they don’t have to conform to what’s gone before. They have created their own history … We always have to believe in what is possible in life and not be hindered by history or expectations.”The team appears in a better place psychologically than it has for generations. Much of the credit has gone to Southgate, but also to Pippa Grange, the team psychologist, who has been working behind the scenes. “She’s an amazing person,” Alli said on Monday. “Everyone listens to her when she talks.”Grange was appointed by the FA as its head of people and team development in November last year, given the job of building resilience while confronting the pressures and psychodramas faced by previous England squads. The FA has said it searched globally for the right person for the job, but Grange, like most of the young players, isn’t an obvious superstar in her field there is no self-promoting social media presence or bestselling self-development books.She wrote in 2013 that being a woman in a male team environment “is a constant navigation, for everyone. I have no interest in being one of the lads and I don’t quite fit in the ‘nurturing mother figure’ category in terms of the leadership work I do. I would be professionally ineffective if I remained in the background, psychologically safe with minimal voice, and I am not here to be the centre of attention as some form of entertainment. I don’t want to be completely separate because that would make me inaccessible and probably be a lonely place to operate from.”The midfielder Eric Dier said: “I think a lot of the work that we’ve done with her has been prior to the tournament starting, over the last six or seven months.” This has reportedly included getting the players to sit down together in small groups to share their life experiences and anxieties, and to reveal intimate truths about their character and what drives them. The point, Southgate has said, is to build trust, “making them closer, with a better understanding of each other”.The England football team has focused on the mental side of the game before, most prominently with the psychiatrist Steve Peters, who was recruited before the 2014 World Cup. What is new is the extent to which psychology has been embraced (prior to Grange’s appointment, the performance consultancy Lane 4 was working with the FA on psychological tactics). Access to Peters, it was reported, was offered to the players only if they felt they needed it – and not many would have admitted to wanting help.“The whole group must buy into the idea that the sports psychologist has come with a specific set of skills and practices that are really worthwhile,” says Andy Lane, the professor of sport and learning at the University of Wolverhampton. “A recent turnaround in professional soccer is the preparedness to use sports science in an integrated way. It’s that acceptance by the whole group that gives one professional the chance to be effective.” Much of that culture shift will have been down to Southgate, who has shown his support for Grange, whom he clearly respects. “She is a strong and important addition to the team,” the manager said in May.Grange is a fan of inspirational quotes, from Oscar Wilde to Nelson Mandela to Michael Jordan some adorn the training gym walls (“Success isn’t given, it’s earned,” reads one). She is also said to encourage the players to get off their phones and play games with each other – including one in the hotel pool with inflatable unicorns after the win against Tunisia in the group stages and she is said to dislike social media, which she expects the players to use wisely. Southgate hasn’t banned social media – unlike previous managers, he hasn’t appeared to ban anything – but has apparently taken Grange’s thoughts on board. While he acknowledged it was good for the players to engage with fans, he added: “Personally, I’m not sure there’s value to reading comments that come in. It comes back to: what creates pressure, or what creates misery in your life?”Michael Caulfield, a sport psychologist and the co-director of the consultancy Sporting Edge, says Southgate, with whom he worked at Middlesbrough, has a leadership style “built on incredible levels of trust between him and his players and staff. He was determined to convince the team there was nothing to fear from playing in the World Cup for England, whereas in the past people were nervous or fearful. He was determined to change that mindset from one of fear to one of adventure. That’s the biggest thing he’s done.”When someone is under a moment of extreme pressure, using a tactic such as mental cues can be helpful, says Kate Hays, the head of psychology at the English Institute of Sport. “People will have cue words that will bring them back into focus on the task at hand – for some, they could be emotional cues for others, it could be technically focused. It’s just one or two words that can get people to focus on the right thing.”Southgate, who has experienced his own disappointments – that missed penalty at the semi-finals of Euro 96, and his managerial career at Middlesbrough ending in relegation – has said as much: “I have learned from things that have gone wrong and had to pick myself up … Because of those failures, I feel it gives you the freedom of being able to say, ‘How might we be the best possible team?’ and not be afraid of what goes wrong – because whatever goes wrong we can deal with, as I have lived through it.”Grange has no fear of failure either. She has written: “I’d like to turn this unhealthy preoccupation with success on its head and put it on the record that I think failure is really useful. For without failure we cannot progress longer, higher or faster. It’s a funny paradox – our successes are achieved through trying, and trying most often ends in failure. Every day in our general lives and our sporting lives we will win some and lose some it’s just part of the way life should be. It could be missing out on a promotion, being pipped at the line in a running race or bombing out in an exam – it doesn’t matter – the important lesson is to learn from our failures, reassess, rethink, move forward (sometimes in a different direction) and keep those dreams and goals alive.”Kevin George, the author of Soccology, who works with clubs and coaches on performance, also says that respecting the inidual qualities and personalities of your players (or your employees) is key. “To instil confidence in one player might be to give them freedom, so they know you trust them,” he says. “For somebody else, it might be a lot of praise. For a group of people, you have to tap into who they are inidually, but as a group, give them the belief that you trust them.” Singling people out for praise in a group setting can be tricky, he adds. “People can think: ‘That person’s a favourite, I’m not a favourite.’ It is tough.” Southgate doesn’t play favourites everyone feels as if they have a chance.The era of hard-talking, tyrannical managers is over – both on and off the pitch. “Football, which I love and work in, is really bad at talking,” says Caulfield. “It does instructing and telling off but it doesn’t do talking and listening and empathy that well. It sounds a bit fluffy but that’s the world in which we now live, and the world in which these players have grown up.” Southgate, he says, realised early in his coaching career that instilling fear wasn’t going to work. “We all need a telling-off now and then – and he’s good at that, by the way – but you’ll get far more from putting your faith in people than you will anything else. People had this lazy opinion that he’s too ‘nice’ and they see kindness as weakness, but it’s the most unbelievable strength if you use it in the right way.”As for nerves, it is a mistake to think it is essential or even desirable to eliminate them – from sport or from life. Caulfield says they can be “wonderful. They keep you alive and make you realise something important is about to happen. If you discuss what the nerves mean to you and how you deal with them, then they don’t become a threat to you. They become this wonderful cortisol that runs through your veins and you deal with the problem, and then you rest afterwards.” With or without an inflatable unicorn.• Don’t fear failure. “Part of what it takes to be courageous is overcoming the constant battle between the desire for what we want and the fear of failure. Most of us don’t expose ourselves because we are fearful,” writes Grange.• Reframe emotions: you’re not “nervous”, you’re “excited” a penalty shootoutjob interviewimportant speech is not something to dread, it’s an “opportunity”.• Positive thinking is unhelpful if you’re simply fantasising about achieving an Oscarthe World Cupa fuller social life. Instead, focus – positively – on the steps that could get you to your goal.• Treat your employeeschildrencustomers as iniduals rather than a homogenous group. Different approaches will work for different people.• Kindness, listening and empathy will take you further than barking orders. Use praise to motivate people."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/270636652b6f9c40263721543b21e9a17180aadc/0_186_969_582/master/969.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccb08caa203c214cf971b51345757fe9","title":"scotland england world cup rivalry","story":"There is a beautiful irony attached to Scotland’s star of this World Cup emerging from a commentary box. Ally McCoist – naturally warm, naturally quick-witted – would always be a television success. So many of his colleagues in Russia, whether through launching into “we”, “our” and “us” vernacular or displaying a brand of jingoism typically reserved for royal weddings, have had Scots contemplating violence towards television sets. You’d be far more inclined to discover ill-will towards Ian Wright and Martin Keown in Edinburgh than would be the case for Gareth Southgate.McCoist caused something of a ripple on Saturday with the on-air admission that he was roaring in approval as England saw off Sweden. This triggers polarised opinions, as so vehemently stated on social media either McCoist was somehow disloyal to a nation he represented 61 times or his backing of fellow union members was to be celebrated. “Made me want to puke,” was one especially profound Twitter response. Nicola Sturgeon’s earlier and public praise for Southgate’s men also raised eyebrows but was simple to decode it would never be sensible for the leader of the Scottish National Party, and the country’s first minister, to appear anti-English.That political backdrop, with the independence debate a Scottish constant, is impossible to ignore as England maraud across Russia. This isn’t a new phenomenon, with Scotland’s abject showing at the 1978 World Cup widely cited as key to a failed bid for devolution the following year.Since 1998 Scotland have not featured in a major tournament. The intervening years have been interspersed with a guaranteed source of amusement as attached to watching England stumble. Scorn is bestowed on anyone who admits this element of enjoyment, just as Andy Murray after his “anyone but England” moment. In reality, and as long as kept within the confines of human decency, such rivalry actually defines and drives football. It is more intense towards bigger or more successful teams, such as England. By the same token, Celtic’s fans won’t be giddy with excitement as Steven Gerrard embarks on a European campaign with Rangers this week nobody would or should expect anything less.The insistence that Scottish fans must support England is offensive. In the quaint words of Irvine Welsh: “This is the sort of shite talked by armchair wankers who tune into big tournaments but don’t understand footballing rivalries having never attended a game.” The writer added: “The culture is bigger than some overpaid pricks kicking a ball around on telly. Ask West Ham and Millwall fans, whose clubs are rarely in the same league.”That great barometer of the Scottish mood, the public house, supplies mixed evidence. In some, cheering for England has been commonplace. In others, replica shirts of Tunisia, Panama, Belgium, Colombia or Sweden told their own story. Middle ground supplies truth. The majority of Scots seem indifferent towards the potential of England success rather than consumed by it.For all Scotland has a significant English population and the countries have plenty in common, a football link exists only via the broadcast outlets now causing ire north of the border. England’s players are way beyond the fiscal capabilities of Scotland’s biggest clubs, just as the Scottish national team stopped being a competitive threat to the best sides in Europe many moons ago.A silver lining resonates in history. In 1967, Scotland laid claim to the title of unofficial champions of the world after a 3-2 success at Wembley. Should England take delivery of the World Cup trophy once more on Sunday, they should expect a fixture call from Glasgow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a44c24413a3af07f3bc5bfefb6731d82729e88f/0_29_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea9990eca3019e088787387a9538b5a2","title":"why the nation fell for gareth southgate","story":"Pick a moment. There have been so many from which to choose in this unexpectedly joyous World Cup. Harry Kane’s stoppage-time winner against Tunisia. Jordan Pickford’s penalty save against Colombia. Eric Dier’s winning shootout spot kick moments later. Harry Maguire’s towering header in the quarter-final. Kyle Walker and Jesse Lingard dancing like idiots in front of the fans.But there is one that sticks out above all others. One so iconic it could be eclipsed only by Kane lifting the trophy in Moscow on Sunday. It came after England had just won its first ever penalty shootout in a World Cup. Having congratulated his own players, the England manager, Gareth Southgate, took the time to seek out Mateus Uribe, the Colombian player whose miss had set up the victory, and put an arm round him in consolation.This wasn’t just a random act of sensitivity and compassion – though these qualities are sufficiently uncommon, not just in English football but football the world over, to have made them remarkable in themselves. It was one of empathy. It was Southgate’s missed penalty against Germany that had been England’s downfall in the 1996 European Championship. He knew what it felt like to be the man to dash a nation’s dreams. To have been the man who ended up as the fall guy in a Pizza Hut advert. His arm round Uribe’s shoulder wasn’t a casual, passing gesture: it was one that spoke of a deep personal understanding.Even more than that, though, it was a moment of grace. Life is a messy business that offers few obvious chances at redemption. Failures and disappointments are generally rewritten or absorbed into lives that somehow muddle on as best they can. Southgate was granted a Hollywood sense of closure. The opportunity to channel his own experience of despair into one of triumph for his team, in front of a global audience of roughly a billion people. From zero to hero.As Dier’s penalty went in, England went noisily bonkers. What the country had learned from the 22 years of pain since last winning a penalty shootout (against Spain in Euro 96) was that the right reaction was to shout loudly, get pissed or drive around the streets leaning on the horn. What Southgate had learned from the whole experience was a basic sense of decency. That night he showed a nation how to behave. Small wonder that the few remaining people who weren’t already a bit in love with the England manager collapsed happily into his embrace at that moment.It was never intended to be this way, though. After all, it had been Sam Allardyce entrusted with the job of England manager after the country’s disastrous showing in the 2016 Euros. Then he was accused of offering businessmen advice on how to “get around” the rules on players’ transfers and using his role for financial advantage – Allardyce continues to deny the allegations. Given England’s performance in Russia, we should profoundly thank the Daily  for the investigation. Southgate, in charge of the England Under-21 team at the time, was a hastily appointed replacement and dismissively referred to as the “caretaker manager”.No one expected much of Southgate. Not even the Football Association, whose chairman Greg Dyke said in 2016 that English football was in such a desperate state that no one should dream of any real success until the 2022 World Cup, at the earliest. Southgate, notorious for missing a penalty and being sacked as manager of Middlesbrough, was just there as a stopgap. Expendable collateral damage in the seemingly futile search for English football’s lost soul.Even in the runup to this World Cup, the expectations remained at rock bottom. Normally in the buildup to a major tournament, the media quickly reaches fever pitch with unrealistic hype about how the team could finally end X years of hurt, only for the headlines to become increasingly bitter – with the manager and players turned into laughing stocks when the dreams go unrealised.This time, nothing. Nada. It was almost as if everyone was fed up with football. The manner in which Russia had become the host nation still stank, fans were advised to stay away due to threats of violence and Putin’s repressive regime and no one – even in jest – seriously expected England to have a prayer. After decades of lost hope, pragmatic despair had set in. This was a tournament to which we already knew the ending. England would do well to make it out of the group stages. And, if they did, they would lose on penalties in the first round of the knockout matches. It was written in the stars.All of which suited Southgate just fine. He had never been one of the headline-grabbing egomaniacs who have dominated football for much of the past 30 years. He knows there is more to life than the game and has created the space for himself to spend plenty of time with his wife, Alison, and their two children, Mia and Flynn. So, he was more than happy to slip under the radar and set about creating a team in his own image.In the past, England has seemed like a team in name only. A two-tier collection of so-called stars, such as David Beckham and Wayne Rooney, with random iniduals making up the numbers. No wonder they struggled. Southgate has made a virtue of a necessity – England is, thankfully, completely out of big-ego players right now – and picked a squad where Harry Kane is the only player to even be the biggest name at his Premier League club. And even he looks like someone who is simply thrilled to be part of the England setup and not someone who is doing his country a favour.Southgate is blessed with the rare gift – in football, especially – of emotional intelligence. That is what makes him emblematic of a modern, outward-looking man. He trusts his players. He encourages them to take responsibility for their own actions. He helps them to tell their own stories. To be known both to themselves and those around them.All year, left-back Danny Rose has been suffering from a depression which he had kept to himself after picking up an injury: Southgate helped him come to terms with it by going public (“England has been my salvation and I can’t thank the manager and the medical staff enough,” he told the press). It was as close to therapy as football gets. By acknowledging the possibility of failure, he has made success more likely. The ball of fear that had hung heavily over the English game has been lifted.Better still, Southgate leads by example. He doesn’t just talk the talk, he walks the walk. He believes in the importance of family and encouraged Fabian Delph to return home for the birth of his child. The player missed the team’s winning match against Colombia, but was back in time to come on as a subsitute in Saturday’s quarter-final against Sweden. A World Cup may come around again, but to be present at the birth of your child is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Southgate is an open book and takes responsibility for his own actions. Previous managers might have thrown a strop and blamed somebody else when a sheet of paper, which appeared to contain some tactical notes, found its way into the hands of the press before the Panama game. Southgate took the hit, said the media were just doing their job and moved on. What could have slipped into the familiar them-and-us siege mentality between the players and the outside world was instead instantly defused.Everyone in the squad knows their place and understands their role within it. Fielding a near-second-strength team for the group match against Belgium was an act of insight and inspiration. Not because losing guaranteed England a place in what looked to be the easier side of the draw, but because it offered clarity to the rest of the squad. They knew they had been given a chance to make their claim for a place in the regular starting 11, but they hadn’t been good enough to take it. Southgate had demonstrated his even-handedness and that he didn’t have favourites. Too often in tournaments, the reserve players can become disaffected and undermine the unity of the whole squad. Now, there is a genuine sense of togetherness. Success may breed its own success, but it was Southgate who lit the spark.And it’s not just a team that Southgate has inspired. It is England as a whole. At a time when the cabinet is fighting like rats in a sack, and trust in the political class to act in the best interests of the country rather than their own party is at an all-time low, Southgate has shown what it is to have integrity. To stand up and be counted.When a large number of people in the country are obsessed with who is cheating on whom on Love Island, he has demonstrated that you can act with humanity and decency towards others. He has shown us who we could be. A better us. A nation that can look triumph and disaster in the face and treat them both the same. (Though also a nation that is getting decidedly used to dealing with the triumph and would rather not have to think of the disaster for a while yet, thanks.) Football may be coming home, but Gareth and his team get to stay in Russia for another week yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/459c9af25a9295f64c0f8ed10a02dd4cbf3cb352/189_94_3068_1841/master/3068.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98ad67b5239b411afe62092795534579","title":"world cup jamboree change moscow laissez faire attitude","story":"‘The celebrating has finished,” said a Russian police officer, curtly, to a drunk reveller who was trying to make his way to the bars of Nikolskaya Street through a police barricade in the early hours of Tuesday. “We have an order not to let anyone pass.”Just as thousands of England fans arrive in Moscow, the city’s long World Cup party seems to be winding down. With only two games left in Moscow – England’s semi-final against Croatia on Wednesday and the final on Sunday – most of the hundreds of thousands of fans who were based in the city or passing through for a few days, have left the country.Nikolskaya, the pedestrianised street that runs between Red Square and Lubyanka Square, home of the headquarters of the KGB, now the FSB, has been the unofficial party hub of the World Cup. The street events have been the heart of a city and country that has met hundreds of thousands of visiting fans with a warm welcome, for the period of the tournament at least.On any given night during the first two weeks, large groups of fans could be found drinking, dancing and singing in the street, which was often tightly packed. The atmosphere was mainly jovial and policing was minimal. People bought food and drink from shops and cafes, and there were some enterprising Brazilians who sold cans of beer out of rucksacks. All of this was ignored by police, despite that fact drinking in public is illegal in Russia.Despite the police officer’s curt admonishment, there was still drinking and merriment on Nikolskaya on Monday night, it was just that police had sealed off all the exits but one, and people had to take long detours to get on to the street. The party street still has some life in it yet but there is no doubting the mood is very different to the ecstatic evenings of the early part of the tournament.Gone, are the cosmopolitan masses from across the globe. This World Cup has been notable for the huge numbers of visitors from North and South America, with tens of thousands of Peruvians, Colombians, Mexicans, Argentinians and Brazilians all making the journey.It was they, rather than European fans, who gave Nikolskaya its atmosphere, along with surprisingly large travelling contingents of Morocco and Tunisia fans, as well as a sprinkling of Panamanians and Costa Ricans. They all brought flags, costumes and in many cases music to Nikolskaya Street, which resembled a carnival of nations most nights. With the semi-finals an all-European affair, most of these fans have gone home.On Tuesday morning, there were occasional echoes of how it had been before: a group of around 20 Argentinians singing and dancing, a few Moroccans with a drum, a smattering of England fans, and hundreds of Russians, strolling and drinking. But the street now feels like a once-popular nightclub that has stayed open for a bit too long.Shortly after 1am a fight broke out on the street as three men assaulted a fourth. Police intervened and marched off the offenders, while medics appeared and treated the victim’s bleeding head. After about 20 minutes he walked off with police accompaniment, a large slick of blood remaining on the pavement. All involved were Russian.At one bar close to the Red Square end of Nikolskaya, a group of around 20 England fans were drinking, with occasional chants of “It’s Coming Home” emerging from inside. Outside, they discussed their strategy for the next few days. Most had already got hold of semi-final tickets but were wary of laying down well in excess of £1,000 apiece for tickets for Sunday’s final until they knew England would definitely be there.In the coming days, Nikolskaya is likely to be the hub for England fans, either celebrating a win on Wednesdayand their first World Cup final since 1966, or drowning their sorrows.After that, the question remains of whether the World Cup will change Moscow for ever, or whether things will go back to normal when it leaves town. In a video that went viral from earlier in the tournament, a man approached a police officer on the street and asked him whether it would be possible to drink and party in the streets like this when there was no World Cup on.“If you’re a foreigner, yes, they’re allowed everything. For Russians, no,” said the officer, only half-jokingly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/394208c73f62175435a748e76bb18df0f61ccfb4/5_253_2521_1512/master/2521.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac879df37d69e5ca3792cbac04cf3637","title":"world cup semi final regrets trevor steven england 1990","story":"Until Wednesday night’s game in Moscow, only 23 Englishmen have ever played in a World Cup semi-final. Trevor Steven was one of the dozen who did so in Turin in 1990Trevor Steven is one of only 23 Englishmen to play in a World Cup semi-final and he paints a vivid picture of what Gareth Southgate’s side can expect against Croatia in Moscow on Wednesday night.“It’s like an out-of-body experience,” says Steven, who faced West Germany at Italia 90 on 4 July in Turin. Bobby Robson’s men drew 1-1 but after extra time suffered the heartache of defeat on penalties to begin a dire sequence of three such exits in four World Cups, as England’s 1998 and 2006 tournaments ended this way.Southgate’s side broke the hoodoo in their last-16 win against Colombia and they are only the third England team to reach the last four of the tournament, with Sir Alf Ramsey’s 1966 victors the sole finalists.Steven says: “It’s an opportunity to reach a World Cup final, a dream for a football player. Everybody wanted to play, be a starter. Training was very intense, we had to try and treat it like another match but its very difficult to do that.”So, too, for Southgate’s team who will breach a 28-year gap to Robson’s vintage when walking out at the Luzhniki Stadium. Their five‑game run to this stage has taken in 2-1 and 6-1 wins against Tunisia and Panama respectively, plus a 1-0 defeat against Belgium in Group G. After a 1-1 draw, Colombia were defeated 4-3 on penalties. Then, in England’s finest display, Sweden were downed 2-0 to set-up the semi‑final with Croatia.To reach their semi-final Robson’s team drew 1-1 with Republic of Ireland and 0-0 with the Netherlands before beating Egypt 1-0 to top Group F. Belgium were dispatched 1-0 in the last 16, before Cameroon were knocked out 3-2 – both of these ties won in extra time.“Yet the mood was absolutely fantastic – a togetherness, just like the team has today, we were a more experienced group of players than the current group so that probably helped us. This group, though, they don’t have any fear at all which is great.”Beasant highlights the potency of team spirit by referring to his time at Wimbledon, during which Liverpool were defeated in the 1988 FA Cup final and the team was branded the Crazy Gang.England faced West Germany at the now demolished Stadio delle Alpi. “It was huge, absolutely huge,” says Steven. “We had lots of family over – everybody wanted to be there. The atmosphere was electric. They were favourites to beat us because of the record books, plus they had such a strong side.“It’s an unbelievable experience to have the three lions on the shirt and represent your country – the whole country, the whole world, is watching. But you have to put all of those things to the back of your head, try and attain your personal levels.”Franz Beckenbauer’s team were led by Lothar Matthäus and featured Jürgen Klinsmann. Andreas Brehme’s deflected 60th-minute free-kick beat Peter Shilton before Gary Lineker’s equaliser 10 minutes from the end forced extra time and then the shootout.The misses by Stuart Pearce and Chris Waddle became embedded in English football conscience, a spectre that hovered until Eric Dier beat Colombia’s David Ospina at the Spartak Stadium last week for England’s first World Cup shootout victory.Steven, a career penalty taker, offers insight into what any player required to take one on Wednesday may go through. “The takers were guys who started,” says Steven of Lineker, Peter Beardsley, David Platt, Pearce and Waddle. “I was getting to the point where it could have been me next – Bobby had not made up his mind.“It was: ‘Oh God, this is such a pressurised situation, it could be you next up to that penalty spot – will I walk there or will I jog?’ It was surreal watching the guys one by one taking the penalties. I felt for them. You just don’t want to be the one who let’s their team down, their country. Anybody can miss.”Steven recalls the feeling of defeat. “On the field, absolute devastation emotionally,” he says. “We felt so badly for who’d not scored. I don’t know how they must’ve felt to have that forever around their necks. When we got back into the dressing room, it was heartache, everybody consoling each other.“But what can you do? It’s gone? The moment has gone, you can’t get it back. It’s difficult to put a jar on the emotions – we were so proud of what we’d done and yet one of the biggest regrets you can have as a player is not getting to the final. We could’ve won it, and that would have been life-changing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dba6e87bad7269df3ab3338da2928f19063019cc/0_118_3488_2092/master/3488.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca1c5d258458e948e6e4fa5d01436f32","title":"england into semi finals croatia end russias run world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss England’s quarter-final win, Croatia’s punishing victory over hosts Russia, Cristiano Ronaldo transfer machinations, Croydon bus stops and baby choices"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56f4c29e2ecb9a410973e86c62fb1f141b09e38e/31_108_2608_1565/master/2608.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21570088636c8c45357b3a67dbf12c0b","title":"england hopes 2018 world cup russia","story":"There is admiration for Gareth Southgate and his team across the globe but most experts do not see them going on to win the World Cup in RussiaIn the last 25 days we learnt that this World Cup is like Eric Cantona crossed with Mario Balotelli crossed with a 1970s Mick Jagger. It is disrespectful to authority. Unpredictable. Maybe the craziest tournament, ever. Being a football expert, I thought England were too young, too unexperienced, too predictable in their 3-5-2 lineup to do well in Russia. So I bet against them in their games against Colombia and Sweden (the later no doubt influenced by an Italy-playoff complex) and watched on as I got both predictions completely wrong.To the delight of every English fan, I am not going to change my policy ahead of the semi-final. I know Harry Kane is the best striker in the competition, Dele Alli a shining star and Jordan Pickford an underrated keeper, but I admire Ivan Rakitic and Luka Modric too much not to think Croatia are slight favourite. So, can England win the World Cup? Sure they can. Will they win the World Cup? Probably not. Next to the other three teams in the semi-finals, England cannot compare in terms of technical ability, control, experience and attacking flair. Instead they are well organised, tough to beat, competitive and certainly one of the best around for scoring goals on set pieces. They are also learning fast for a such a young squad and now know now they can win games on penalties, which could prove useful against Croatia.However, the easy part is over for England – their only real test so far has been Colombia – and the question now is whether or not, with the heat well and truly on, they can beat Croatia and go all the way. My answer? Probably not. I predict a France versus Croatia final.England impressed me even before this World Cup with their success at Under-17, Under-19 and Under-20 level, so much so, in fact, that I flew to St George’s Park to discover the secret to the country’s success. The former Germany and Liverpool midfielder Didi Hamann accompanied me and after the trip we both felt strongly that something special was happening in the country. England have strong, young players who play refreshing football and, in that sense, the squad reminds me a little of Germany’s at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. They too reached the semi-finals before losing against Spain, the eventual winners. England face Croatia, a team also full of experience, so it will not be easy, but England have four things to their advantages: they showed against Colombia that they can win a penalty shootout they showed against Sweden that they can win in a routine, professional manner they have the best striker in the world in Harry Kane and they have a really impressive goalkeeper. So they could go all the way.England’s success in Russia might look like chance to some, but it is not. Gareth Southgate has clearly worked hard to build a team that has a well-organised and structured defence a midfield that is based more on work than creativity and a forward line which is fantastically efficient. It is a young team that still finds it hard to be patient with the ball but make up for that with very good work on set plays and has a big advantage over Croatia: their legs. After two consecutive periods of extra time, will Zlatko Dalic’s men be able to keep up with the pace of the young Englishmen? It’s very possible they will not be and tThat is why England could well get to the World Cup final and well go on to win it. Juan I Irigoyen (El Pais)England have a great chance of winning the World Cup – in four years’ time. Gareth Southgate has made a lot of progress as head coach, developing an exciting team that is enjoyable to watch and quite Brazilian in their style a gifted goalkeeper, attacking full-backs, a classic defensive midfielder, a pair of strong wingers, and a player in Raheem Sterling who has the talent to represent the Seleção right now.But England have also shown during this tournament that they can be really nervous in their play, holding onto the ball for too long and not passing confidently. They have also engaged in acts of simulation that would make even Neymar embarrassed.That is England’s problem – they lack conviction in their style of play and this is why I can’t see them winning the World Cup this year. But if they stay on the path they have been travelling under Southgate they can definitely do so in Qatar in 2022.When it comes to England and sports you close your eyes, remember the smell of humid grass and remember it is the nation where football was born. It is also a nation that has gone 52 years without winning the World Cup and is desperate do so again. Can they do so in 2018? Well nothing lasts forever, not even droughts. Years of watching great players perform in the Premier League have clearly had an affect on the national team with the most clear one being that England no longer play like they used to. The current team is more interesting and dynamic, and in that sense they have betrayed themselves, as Spain did a decade ago.The players also appear to be mentally stronger and it could be that more than anything else that carries them past a strong Croatia team and into the final."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/350df5d2f4bf8c23f6d6515fe3e3cb1cf211a97f/109_0_4092_2456/master/4092.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e59fd2cd61a8df337ec9825878f1d4cf","title":"france belgium world cup 2018 semi finals live","story":"77 min: Mertens overhits a cross from the right. 75 min: Hazard jinks past Giroud in his own half and skedaddles forward, eventually picking out Mertens on the right. His crossing options are closed down so he recycles possession. Belgium eventually work it to De Bruyne at the edge of the box. With a dextrous shuffle he makes space for a shot ... and then sends the ball skyward. Oh well.73 min: The way France are protecting their lead is impressive. They’re extremely solid and efficient, all working hard and methodically. Belgium are struggling to find any openings and, at this point, are more likely to concede again on the counter.71 min: Alderwerield becomes the second Belgian booked for bringing down Matuidi to abort a counter-attack.69 min: Mertens curls over another cross from the right - he’s become the most likely source of an equaliser for Belgium. But France deal with his latest delivery well.67 min: For the second time in a couple of minutes De Bruyne gives the ball away: his eagerness for Belgium to get back into the game had rendered his passing a tad desperate. France have been the more accomplished side since half-time. And on that note, Giroud has just tonked a shot 20 yards over the bar after a perfect tee-up by Griezmann.65 min: Mertens cross again from the right. Fellaini beats Umtiti to it but heads a yard wide from 12 yards. 65 min: Mertens cross from the right. Lloris punches it away.63 min: Chadli wins a corner. Then takes it. It’s awful. Cleared at the near post, it allows France to tip forward on the counter-attack. Hazard decides to curtail it by tugging back Matuidi. A deserved yellow card is shown.61 min: Mertens’ first touch is a cross from the byline, heading away in extremis by Varane. De Bruyne tries to smash the dropping ball into the net from 16 yards but he’s under pressure and doesn’t catch his volley well. 59 min: France are in the groove now and beginning to torment Belgium with lordly keep-ball and the occasional sharp thrust. Martinez needs to make a change.56 min: Mbappe zooms down the right and then feeds Matuidi, whose shot is blocked at the edge of the area. France regain possession and build anew. Then Mbappe plays in Giround with an outrageous backheeled pass. Dembéle blocks the striker’s shot. Mbappé is on fire!54 min: Freekick to France at the left-hand corner of the box. Griezmann clips it in. Kompany heads it away.51 min: It should be noted that France won their corner following a sharp run by Matuidi, who fed Giroud, who did well to make room for a shot that was deflected behind for a corner. After that, it was just a question of Umtiti timing his run and jump and nodding into the net.Umtiti heads in at the near post from a corner by Griezmann. He outjumped Fellaini, if you don’t mind!50 min: Ominous pressure from Belgium following a move initiated by Alderweireled, who is stepping more often into midfield. In the end Chadli’s attempted cross to Fellaini is misdirected. Chaldi’s crossing has been inadeqate all game so far.48 min: Witsel sends a deep cross from the right towards Lukaku, who beats Varane to it but heads over rom eight yards! That was a decent chance and Lukaku should have done better.47 min: A barnstorming run by Mbappe takes France to the edge of the Belgian area before Alderwerield stretches out a leg to nick the ball away from the lightning youngster.46 min: The boys are back, as Dropkick Murphys famously sang, and they’re looking for a breakthrough. Neither manager has seen fit to change their lineup yet. “Looking at the season and this tournament I think De Bruyne should make it to the Ballon D’Or three-man shortlist and Modric too,” chirps Anded. Are we to take it for granted that the third name is Dejan Lovren? It’s on a knife-edge. De Bruyne and, particularly, Hazard have fizzed with menace, while France have been cautious, as expected, but threatened on the counter-attack, where their speed - especially Mbappe - could damage France at any moment.45+1 min: De Bruyne curls in a delivery from the right. Umtiti attempts to cut it out but succeeds only in erting it towards Lukaku, who is too surprised to be able to take full advantage. The ball bounces off the striker and dribbles wide. 45 min: There will be least one more minute before the break.43 min: Griezmann curls the freekick into the wall. There was a touch of inevitability about that. 42 min: Pogba is pulled back by Demblé, giving France a freekick in a dangerous position. It’s about 25 yards, towards the right-hand side of the box. Courtois erects a four-man wall...40 min: Lukaku comes deep and to the left in an attempt to get into the game. He gets the ball but winds up passing it backwards. Belgium stroke the ball around a bit before Matuidi makes another interception in midfield. He’s had a storming game so far.38 min: Dembelé plays a slack pass straight to Kanté. France tear forward again. Mbappé sips a pass in to Pavard, who finds himself one-on-one with Courtois. He aims for the far corner but the keeper gets a crucial touch to the low shot with his foot! Corner to France.36 min: France have got the upperhand in the last few minutes. They nearly opened up Belgium again now after Matuidi launched a counter-attack from deep in his own half. But it broke down when it came to Giroud. He has been more involved than Lukaku - who has been well guarded by Varane and Umtiti - but his touch has been off so far. If it continues like that, Mbappé should be redeployed through the middle.34 min: Griezmann curls a splendid ball over Vertonghen and into the path off Mbappé, who calmly sidefoots it across goal to Giroud ... who provides a perfect contract to that suave buildup by falling over and donking the ball miles wide like an oaf. 33 min: Greizmann creates spaces for a shot with a dinky feint past Witsel at the left-hand corner of the Belgian box. But then he wellies his shot into the stands, where, by the way, the atmosphere has been surprisingly sedate for a World Cup semi-final.32 min: Hazards beats three players down the left before cutting into the box ... and running the ball out of play. 31 min: Griezmann takes the freekick short to Pavard, who crosses into the area from the right. Giroud has to lean backwards and twist his neck in an inventive way to guide a header close to the target. It drops a yard wide of the post. 30 min: France enjoy a spell of possession, which ends with Vertonghen knocking over Mbappé and getting told off by the ref. France have a freekick about 35 yards out and central.28 min: Hazard nudges the ball to De Bruyne wide on the left. De Bruyne ks a wonderful low cross into the danger zone. Umtiti excels to sweep it away from right in front of his own goal.27 min: When Belgium have the ball - which is most of the time - they play with a back three, Chadli pushing up to serve as a winger (while Mbappé and Griezmann act as defensive midfielders for France).25 min: Griezmann sends over an outswinging corner. Fellaini stoops to nod away at the near post. 23 min: Umtiti goes long for Giroud ... too long. France aren’t pretending to try outplaying Belgium here, they’re all set-up for the smash-’n’-grab.22 min: Giroud only gets a couple of hairs to an attempted clearance from the corner. The ball drops behind Alderwerield, who swivels and shoots from 14 yards. Lloris hurls himself across goal to tip the ball around the post. Superb save! 21 min: More prolonged probing by Belgium. De Bruyne eventually tries to pick out Fellaini in the middle, but Varane gets his head in the way again to concede another corner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5327f3b40c05446e9f3aa45876d31a3e98d8f1b7/1064_1133_910_546/master/910.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b64651ec831d36f57f97614464468454","title":"david squires on england croatia and the world cup semi finals","story":"As Russia 2018 reaches the last four, our cartoonist looks at whether football really will be coming home"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/850496202e143d653932adaf09685e47c2857d37/0_111_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67b90fb6d252debb2ea5cae07ad4c589","title":"bald tattoo scalp micropigmentation","story":" Advocates of ‘scalp micropigmentation’, a non-invasive treatment for people who are balding, say it has helped them regain confidenceWhile the Washington native still occasionally wears his beloved green and navy Seattle Mariners cap, he no longer feels uncomfortable taking it off or “getting a little sun on his head”. He also doesn’t need to throw on a beanie just to get the mail. In fact, sometimes when he goes out he doesn’t bring a hat at all.That’s because three months ago Russell underwent scalp micropigmentation, a cosmetic hair loss solution that started in England and is on the rise in the United States. Scalp micropigmentation is a non-invasive treatment for people who are balding, thinning or have receding hair. Using a specialized pigment and a digital permanent makeup machine equipped with a microneedle, scalp micropigmentation practitioners penetrate the skin and create tiny follicles in the scalp, essentially producing little dots to mimic the look of stubble. It’s a condition that Iulo knows all too well he, too, suffered hair loss at an early age before eventually finding solace in scalp micropigmentation. Iulo empathizes with his clients because he knows how one’s self-confidence tends to disappear with one’s hair. In the four years since opening his clinic, Iulo has had many conversations with men about their deepest insecurities.Iulo even recalls one man who, despite being religious, wouldn’t go to church. “He didn’t want people staring at his bald head,” Iulo says. “Hair can affect someone’s life in little ways, but it can really add up.”Hiding his hair loss was always a painstaking and time-consuming endeavour for Eric D’Appolonia, a 31-year-old New Jerseyan who received scalp micropigmentation in 2015. No matter where he was going, D’Appolonia took at least an hour to get ready, spending 45 of those minutes trying to make it look like he had more hair than he actually did. He used Caboki – a shake-on concealer made of plant-based fibers that cling to and fill in a person’s hair, plus hair sprays, glues and a hair dryer to put each hair in the perfect spot, making a mess of the bathroom in the process. Before leaving, he would ask his now wife: “Is the Caboki showing?” D’Appolonia avoided any activity where he might sweat too much, for fear the black ink from the Caboki would start dripping down his face. He says there were not only social but professional challenges as well: D’Appolonia is a physical education teacher. “It was constant that I’d have to run to the bathroom to make sure black stuff wasn’t all on my forehead.” D’Appolonia was about 18 when he started losing his hair. His once thick hair was transforming into what his friend coined a “mansion-head”: two entrances in the front, where the hairline was receding into a peninsula shape, and a pool at the back, where the hair was vanishing from his crown. “I know it sounds vain, but I didn’t feel as attractive, and I was losing a lot of confidence based on that,” D’Appolonia says. He didn’t talk about his struggle much with his friends or his family because he was a master at hiding it, he says, no one really knew what he was dealing with. Once while on a vacation at Hershey Park with his now in-laws, D’Appolonia and his wife left the park early so he could get ready for dinner without her family seeing his routine. D’Appolonia and Derek Russell both acknowledge that some might consider their actions vain or shallow, but both men say that’s not the point. Getting the procedure isn’t about what people think, they say – it’s about what makes them feel good.“The majority of the population is taking action to feel good about themselves, even if that means buying an outfit they think will look better,” D’Appolonia says. Still, the procedure isn’t for everyone. “I didn’t try to fight it in the beginning,” says 28-year-old Vinny Gallo, who starting completely shaving his head after he began to go bald almost a decade ago.When a friend underwent scalp micropigmentation last fall, Gallo tossed around the idea of getting the procedure done. As of now, he has decided not to being bald doesn’t bother him that much. In fact, he doesn’t think his shorn head looks that bad on him. It hasn’t limited his dating life in any way, he notes. Ultimately, though, Gallo wonders whether, for some people, it’s about more than the scalp micropigmentation.

Read about our favourite 10 and subscribe to the playlistby  Ben Beaumont-Thomas and  Laura SnapesDue in part to some much-lampooned blanket promotion by Spotify, but mostly to his sheer pan-demographic popularity, the new Drake album Scorpion is one of the year’s biggest cultural events, coming at the height of his fame – and his infamy, having sired a child with a woman, he says on the album, he only met twice. As well as this fresh drama, Scorpion shuttles between the standard Drake poles of confected beef, self-aggrandisement and light-hearted croonery like all his albums, it’s too long but still contains plenty of future best-of material. In My Feelings is a highlight – some might see this and his other takes on New Orleans bounce (Child’s Play, Nice For What etc) as defanging the sharp attack of the style, but he cleverly pairs its propulsion with a much more romantic mood. It’ll have you dancing around in a pale pink tracksuit in no time.This month saw another two drops from the rapper’s upcoming album Queen, which she has been talking up as her greatest yet. The big single Bed, reuniting her with Ariana Grande, is a little underwhelming compared with their great ode to cervical bruising, Side to Side, but Rich Sex is richly satisfying. While Minaj is always remarkably on point at speed, it’s her slower flows, where she lets each word roll round her lips and slope off her tongue, that are among her best (think Beez in the Trap), and this is a classic example. Lil Wayne also turns up with a gross but gorgeously elastic guest verse.Adopting someone else’s persona in pop is tricky to pull off: unlike film and literature, you don’t see the narrative devices and simply have to trust what you hear. Sometimes it’s awful – see Lil Dicky – but sometimes, as on Ebony Bones’ first single in three years, it’s bold and daring. No Black in the Union Jack focuses on the overt racism and xenophobia legitimised by Brexit. It samples Enoch Powell’s “rivers of blood” speech and the sound of two neighbours laughing as they exchange racist epithets, while Bones adopts the racists’ mindset in her own lyrics: “Red, white and blue  Let ‘em in to smash the system now the country is screwed,” she raps coolly over a stark, looped beat that clatters and glowers. It’s not quite the British answer to Childish Gambino’s This Is America, but it’s close.Blawan has been a UK techno hero for years now – tracks like 2012’s wildly catchy Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage? showcased his talent for pounding kicks and nagging melody, while his most famous moment remains his Brandy-sampling funky house cut Getting Me Down. He’s finally released his debut album Wet Will Always Dry: masterful minimal techno in the Nina Kraviz or Radio Slave mould, where unceasing 44 hauteur is brightened with mischievous licks. Tasser is a highlight: the core drum programming ticks along like a Roomba, but is menaced again and again by a magnificently amorphous cloud of static.When every X Factor contestant and their dog can do a full-tilt Whitney warble, there’s something even more impressive about the kind of singer who keeps their melisma skill hidden, playing it as their ace. To wit, LA synthpop artist Miya Folick’s latest single, where a soaring falsetto high enough to tickle God’s beard bursts unexpectedly from her brow-furrowed verses about feeling a bit drab. It takes Stock Image from subtle greys to blazing colour, while the tense euphoria of the drum machine earns its comparisons to peak Robyn.Another great discovery from the Awesome Tapes from Africa label, which has previously brought us Hailu Mergia, Ata Kak and more, Jess Sah Bi \u0026amp Peter One are a fairly unlikely proposition. A political cartoonist and a history teacher from the Ivory Coast, they made twanging country music from slide guitar, peppy strumming, and yearning vocals in three languages. They got stadium-level massive following the release of their 1985 debut, Our Garden Needs Its Flowers, and ended up moving to the US. Currently working on music separately, there are reunion plans for later this year once the album is back out.This Swedish classic rock band, now 10 years and four albums deep, are utterly, brilliantly preposterous. Powered by the same combination of riffs, synths and peacocking used by their compatriots Europe, and with a fixation on outer space, their tightly harmonised oeuvre begs to be hollered wearing a wolf’s pelt while riding a hoverboard. Speedwagon is glorious, nodding to its AOR namesake as well as Thin Lizzy, ELO, Hall and Oates, Bon Jovi and every glam metal band ever, all condensed into a hyper-melodic ball of hair and chrome. Rock song of the year?Still bashing out existential freakouts set to bourgeois garage rock, Interpol retain their uniquely anxious energy on their first new track in four years. The major label sheen that left some of their albums feeling genuinely empty rather than performatively so has gone, thankfully replaced with blown-out drums and scuzzy rhythm guitar Daniel Kessler’s pealing lead could have come from Obstacle 2 on their debut. As ever Paul Banks’s voice, delivering poetry that seems to yearn for sexual and spiritual uplift, is the last word in seedy NY cool.The Duluth trio aren’t short of menace at the best of times, but they’ve never exuded such a sickly, shuddering spirit as on the three taster tracks from their forthcoming 12th album, Double Negative. Dancing and Blood is the most song-like of these corrosive, ambient oozes: a beat that sounds like heavy steps through coal dust suggests total desolation, while tiny synth flickers conjure images of an abandoned building that still shudders with electric current. It is phenomenally chilling (and reminiscent of Burial at his most haunting) not least thanks to Mimi Parker’s unforgiving judgments echoing through the murk: “All that you gave wasn’t enough.” Highly recommended that you chase this with strawberry ice cream and a Love Island binge. One of last year’s most fascinating reissues was a collection of 1970s and 80s work by Carl Stone, an American electronic composer, touring the UK this week, who timestretches samples and live instrumentation into glitchy burbles or transcendent ambient passages. Just as his peer Laurie Spiegel accidentally invented techno around the same time as the earliest midwest electronic dance music, Stone was understanding the collaged power of sampling at the same time hip-hop was doing so in a completely different way. Now there’s a new compilation of four of his 80s and 90s pieces – all are amazing, but Mae Yao is almost unbearably beautiful. Over 23 minutes, what starts as choppy gamelan glitching gets smoothed out by a wondrous set of quavering, manipulated tones. Is it a voice, an instrument, the wind? The point is that Stone uncouples it from recognisable timbre, leaving it as pure, contextless sound – a staggering announcement of the universality of beauty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d5da4e881e28bb10ea993cdecb063d148022e1f/693_754_4307_2584/master/4307.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b6d6ff27dc7341f47111be83b1c38e4","title":"the staggering rise of indias super rich","story":"India’s new billionaires have accumulated more money, more quickly, than plutocrats in almost any country in history. By  James CrabtreeOn 3 May, at around 4.45pm, a short, trim Indian man walked quickly down\u0026nbspLondon’s Old Compton Street, his head bowed as if trying not to be seen. From his seat by the window of\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspnearby noodle bar, Anuvab Pal recognised him instantly. “He is tiny, and his face had been all over every newspaper in India,” Pal recalled. “I knew it was him.”Few in Britain would have given the passing figure a\u0026nbspsecond look. And that, in a way, was the point. The man pacing through Soho on that Wednesday night was\u0026nbspNirav Modi: Indian jeweller, billionaire and international fugitive.In February, Modi had fled his home country after an\u0026nbspalleged $1.8bn fraud case in which the tycoon was accused of abusing a system that allowed his business to obtain cash advances illegally from one of India’s largest banks. Since then, his whereabouts had been a mystery. Indian newspapers speculated that he might be holed up in Hong Kong or New York. Indian courts issued warrants for his arrest, and the police tried, ineffectually, to track him down.It was only by chance that Pal spotted him. A standup comic normally based in Mumbai, he happened to be in London for a run of gigs. “My ritual was to go to the same noodle bar, have a meal, and then head to the theatre,” Pal said. “I\u0026nbspalways sat by the window. And then suddenly Modi\u0026nbspwalks past. He was unshaven, and had those Apple\u0026nbspearphones, the wireless ones. He looked like he\u0026nbspwas in\u0026nbspa\u0026nbsphurry.”It was another month before the press finally caught up with Modi, as reports of his whereabouts emerged in\u0026nbspJune, along with the suggestion that he was planning to\u0026nbspclaim political asylum in the UK. (Modi denies wrongdoing, and did not respond to requests for comment.) In the process, Modi also gained entry into one of London’s more notorious fraternities: the small club of Indian billionaires who seem to end up in the British capital following scandals back at home.The most prominent among these émigré moguls is\u0026nbspIndia’s “King of Good Times”, Vijay Mallya, the one-time aviation magnate and brewer, who transformed Kingfisher beer into a global brand. A few years ago, Mallya was one of India’s most celebrated industrialists, famous for his mullet haircut and flamboyant lifestyle. But in early 2016, Indian authorities filed charges relating to the collapse of his Kingfisher airline, which\u0026nbspwent bust in spectacular fashion in 2012, leaving behind mountainous debts and irate, unpaid staff. And so, facing allegations of financial irregularities and of refusing to repay outstanding loans, Mallya quietly boarded a plane for Britain, too.Like Modi, Mallya denies wrongdoing. Last month he\u0026nbspreleased a long statement accusing India’s government of conducting a witch-hunt against him. And to the extent that this claim has some merit, it is because Indian prime minister Narendra Modi (no relation to Nirav Modi) has of late been under great pressure to bring supposedly errant tycoons such as\u0026nbspMallya to book.Men like Mallya and Modi were members of India’s expanding billionaire class, of whom there are now 119 members, according to Forbes magazine. Last year their collective worth amounted to $440bn – more than in any other country, bar the US and China. By contrast, the average person in India earns barely $1,700 a year. Given its early stage of economic development, India’s new hyper-wealthy elite have accumulated more money, more quickly, than their plutocratic peers in almost any\u0026nbspcountry in history.Narendra Modi won an overwhelming election victory in 2014, having promised to put a stop to the spate of corruption scandals that had dogged India for\u0026nbspmuch of the previous decade. Many involved prominent industrialists – some directly accused of corruption, while others had simply mismanaged their\u0026nbspfinances and miraculously managed to escape the\u0026nbspconsequences. Voters turned to Narendra Modi, the\u0026nbspself-described son of a poor tea-seller, hoping he\u0026nbspwould deliver a new era of clean governance and rapid growth, ridding India of a growing reputation for\u0026nbspcrony capitalism.Narendra Modi pledged to end a situation in which the country’s ultra-wealthy – sometimes called “Bollygarchs” – appeared to live by one set of rules, while India’s 1.3 billion people operated by another. Yet\u0026nbspas they continue to hide out in cities like London, men like Mallya and Nirav Modi have come to be seen as representing the failure of that pledge the Indian authorities “have a\u0026nbsplong road ahead”, as one headline put it in the Hindustan Times last year, referring to a “long and arduous” future extradition process in Mallya’s case.And as Narendra Modi gears up for a tough re-election battle next year, he is fighting the perception that India is unable to bring such men to heel, and that it has been powerless to respond to the rise of this new moneyed elite and the scandals that have come with them. “This ongoing battle to get India’s\u0026nbspbig tycoons to play by the rules is one of the biggest challenges we face,” says Reuben Abraham, chief executive of the IDFC Institute, a Mumbai-based thinktank. “Getting it right is central to India’s economic\u0026nbspand political future.” India has long been a stratified society, marked by\u0026nbspisions of caste, race and religion. Prior to the country winning independence in 1947, its people were\u0026nbspsubjugated by imperial British administrators and myriad maharajas, and the feudal regional monarchies over which they presided. Even afterwards, India remained a grimly poor country, as its socialist leadership fashioned a notably inefficient state-planned economic model, closed off almost entirely from global trade. Over time, India grew more equal, if only in the\u0026nbsplimited sense that its elite remained poor by the standards of the industrialised west.But no longer: the last three decades have seen an extraordinary explosion of wealth at the top of Indian society. In the mid-1990s, just two Indians featured in the annual Forbes billionaire list, racking up around $3bn between them. But against a backdrop of the gradual economic re-opening that began in 1991, this has quickly changed. By 2016, India had 84 entries on the Forbes billionaire list. Its economy was then worth around $2.3tn, according to the World Bank. China reached that\u0026nbsplevel of GDP in 2006, but with just 10 billionaires to\u0026nbspshow for it. At the same stage of development, India had created eight times as many.In part, this wealth is to be welcomed. This year India will be the world’s fastest-growing major economy. During the last two decades, it has grown more quickly than at any point its history, a record of economic expansion that helped to lift hundreds of millions out of\u0026nbsppoverty.Put another way, India has created a model of development in which the proceeds of growth flow unusually quickly to the very top. Yet perhaps because Indian society has long been deeply stratified, this dramatic increase in inequality has not received as much\u0026nbspglobal attention as it deserves. For nearly a century\u0026nbspprior to independence, India was governed by\u0026nbspthe British Raj – a term taken from the Sanskrit rājya, meaning “rule”. For half a century after 1947, a system dominated by pernickety industrial rules emerged, often\u0026nbspknown as the Licence-Permit-Quota Raj, or Licence\u0026nbspRaj for short. Now a system has grown in their\u0026nbspplace once again: the billionaire Raj.The rise of India’s super-rich – the first and most obvious manifestation of the billionaire Raj – was propelled by domestic economic reforms. Starting slowly\u0026nbspin the 1980s, and then more dramatically against\u0026nbspthe backdrop of a wrenching financial crisis in\u0026nbsp1991, India\u0026nbspdismantled the dusty stockade of rules and\u0026nbsptariffs that made up the Licence Raj. Companies that had been cosseted under the old regime were cleared out\u0026nbspvia a mix of deregulation, foreign investment and heightened competition. In sector after sector, from airlines and banks to steel and telecoms, the ranks of India’s tycoons\u0026nbspbegan to swell.Nothing symbolises the power of this billionaire class more starkly than Antilia, the residential skyscraper built\u0026nbspin Mumbai by Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest man. Rising 173 metres above India’s financial capital, the steel-and-glass tower is rumoured to have cost more than $1bn to build, looming over a\u0026nbspcity\u0026nbspin which half the population still live in slums.Ambani owns Reliance Industries, an empire with interests stretching from petrochemicals to\u0026nbsptelecoms. (His father, Dhirubhai, from whom he inherited his company, was one of the main beneficiaries of the economic reforms of the 1980s.) At Antilia, Ambani entertains guests in a grand, chandeliered ballroom that takes up most of building’s ground floor. There are six storeys of parking for the family’s car collection, while the tower’s higher levels feature opulent apartments and hanging gardens. Further down, in sub-basement 2, the Ambanis keep a recreational floor, which includes an indoor football pitch. Antilia became an instant landmark upon its completion in 2010. The city had long been a place of stark isions, yet the Ambani’s home almost seemed to magnify this segregation. (A spokesman for\u0026nbspReliance did not respond to a request for comment.)Unsurprisingly, some feel resentful. “You walk around\u0026nbspthe streets of this city, and the rage at Antilia has\u0026nbspto be heard to be believed,” Meera Sanyal, a former international banker turned local anti-corruption campaigner, told me in 2014. Six years before that, in 2008, as the scale of India’s billionaire fortunes were becoming clear, Raghuram Rajan – an economist who would later become the head of India’s central bank – asked an even more pointed question about his country’s\u0026nbsptycoon class: “If Russia is an oligarchy, how\u0026nbsplong can we resist calling India one?”In spring 2017, I met Mallya at his London home, a\u0026nbspGrade I-listed town house a short walk from Baker Street tube station. A variety of Rolls-Royces and Bentleys were parked along the mews at the rear, alongside a fat silver Maybach with the number plate VJM 1, which idled outside Mallya’s back door. Inside, he\u0026nbspsheltered behind a grand wooden table, a gold lighter and two mobile phones lined up in front of him. At one point I asked to be excused to visit the toilet. A flunky ushered me into a golden bathroom, with a shiny gold seat to match its golden taps and loo-roll holder. The fluffy hand towels were white, but each one came embossed with\u0026nbspthe letters “VJM” in gold thread.On the surface, Mallya still seemed every bit the ebullient tycoon of old: a bulky man in a red polo shirt, with gold bracelets on each wrist and a chunky diamond ear stud. But by then he had been stuck in Britain for more than a year, and grew downbeat as the afternoon wound on and our conversation turned to his business troubles and the state of his homeland. “India has corruption running in its veins,” he said with a sigh. “And that’s not something one is going to change overnight.”With his shoulder-length hair and taste for bling, Mallya had long honed an image as the most piratical of India’s generation of entrepreneurs. A specially kitted-out Boeing 727, its bar well-stocked with his own Kingfisher beer, whisked him between parties and business meetings – a distinction that was, in any case, often hazy. “It was all a bit ridiculous,” one ex-board member at a Mallya company told me.Now marooned in London, Mallya had plenty of time to ponder his missteps. Once a member of the Rajya Sabha, the Indian upper house of parliament, his diplomatic passport has been cancelled. As a long-time UK resident, he was permitted to stay in the country, but\u0026nbspwithout travel documents he was unable to travel, curtailing his notorious jetsetting lifestyle almost entirely. Earlier this month, a UK court issued an order allowing authorities trying to recover debts to enter his\u0026nbspvarious British properties.In his pomp, Mallya seemed to represent a new India. In a country whose old commercial elite had been dominated by cautious, discreet industrialists, Mallya was different: rich, powerful and not inclined to hide it. Not all of India’s pioneers behaved in this way – its software and IT billionaires, for instance, were typically less flamboyant figures. But while Mallya continues to\u0026nbspdeny that he did anything wrong, he admits that he\u0026nbsphas become what he calls the “poster boy” for a moment of public anger against India’s rich, as many newly wealthy business figures found themselves mired\u0026nbspin allegations of wrongdoing.India’s old system created fertile ground for corruption, forcing citizens and businesses alike to pay\u0026nbspmyriad bribes for basic state services. But these humdrum problems were trivial compared with the grand scandals that emerged during the 2000s. Assets worth billions were gifted under the table to big\u0026nbsptycoons by senior politicians and bureaucrats in what\u0026nbspbecame known as the “season of scams”. Giant kickbacks helped businesses acquire land, bypass environmental rules and\u0026nbspwin infrastructure contracts. Headlines filled up with fresh outrages, from fraudulent public housing schemes to dodgy road-building projects.Many of those who backed India’s economic reforms hoped that a more free-market economy would lead to more honest government. Instead, crony capitalism infiltrated almost every area of national life. Hundreds of\u0026nbspbillions of dollars were siphoned away, according to some estimates, by a shadowy alliance of colluding politicians and business tycoons. India’s old system of\u0026nbspretail corruption went wholesale.Many politicians also became astoundingly rich, and would have made the Forbes list had their holdings not been hidden carefully in shell companies and foreign banks. Rapid economic growth increased the value of political power, and what could be extracted from it. Political parties had to raise more money, to fight elections and fund the patronage that kept them in\u0026nbspoffice. One estimate suggested that India’s 2014 election\u0026nbspcost close to $5bn, a huge increase over the cheap and cheerful polls of the pre-liberalisation era. Election experts believe most of this money is brought in\u0026nbspillegally from favoured tycoons, in exchange for unknown future favours.Politicians spend the money to fund campaigns, but\u0026nbspalso on handing out favours, jobs and cash to constituents. “It’s sort of an unholy nexus,” as Raghuram Rajan put it to me during his tenure as head of India’s central bank. “Poor public services? Politician fills the\u0026nbspgap politician gets the resources from the businessman politician gets re-elected by the electorate\u0026nbspfor whom he’s filling the gap.”This nexus between business and politics lies at the heart of the third problem of India’s billionaire Raj, namely the boom-and-bust cycle of its industrial economy. In recent decades, China went on the largest infrastructure building spree in history, but almost all of it was delivered by state-backed companies. By contrast, India’s mid-2000s boom was dominated almost exclusively by its private-sector tycoons, giving the industrialists and the conglomerates they run a position of outsized importance in India’s economic development.Bollygarchs borrowed huge sums from state-backed banks and invested with gleeful abandon, in one of the largest deployments of private capital since America built its railroad network 150 years earlier. But when India’s good times came to an end after the global financial crisis, the tycoons’ hubris was exposed, leaving their businesses over-stretched and struggling to repay their debts. In 2017, 10 years on from the crisis, India’s banks were still left holding at least $150bn of bad assets.Since taking office, Narendra Modi has tried, often ineffectually, to fix this corporate- and bank-debt crisis, alongside the related problems of cronyism and the super-rich that contributed to it. Watching developments such as these, some argue that the power of India’s tycoon class is fading. Yet India’s ultra-wealthy are still\u0026nbspthriving, while its ranks of billionaires keep swelling,\u0026nbspand will continue to do so.There is every reason to believe that on its current course, the country’s the gap between rich and poor will\u0026nbspwiden, too. Perversely, the closer India comes to its achieving its ambitions of Chinese-style double-digit levels of economic growth, the faster this will happen. On most measures, it should already be ranked alongside South Africa and Brazil as one of the world’s least-equal countries. Even more importantly, poor countries that start off with high levels of inequality often struggle to reverse that trend as they grow richer.Many experts believe India needs to act. “The main danger with extreme inequality is that if you don’t solve this through peaceful and democratic institutions then it will be solved in other ways … and that’s extremely frightening,” as French economist Thomas Piketty has said of India’s future, pointing to likely rising future tensions between the wealthy and the rest.India is now entering a new phase of development, as\u0026nbspit tries to follow Asian economies such as South Korea and Malaysia out of poverty and towards full “middle-income” status. There is no reason this cannot happen. But as we’ve seen in Latin America, the economies with the widest social ides have tended to be the\u0026nbspones that are most likely to get stuck in the “middle-income trap”, achieving moderate prosperity but failing to become rich. The more successful countries of east Asia, by contrast, grew prosperous while managing to stay egalitarian, partly by building basic social safety nets and ensuring that their wealthiest citizens paid their taxes. Of the two models, it seems clear which India should want to follow.Much the same is true of corruption. India’s old system of cronyism, with its political favours and risk-free bank loans, has came under intense scrutiny, but\u0026nbspthe battle against corruption is at best half-won. Kickbacks still dominate swathes of public life, from land purchase to municipal contracts. State and city governments are just as venal as ever. Surveys report that India remains Asia’s most bribe-ridden nation. “For\u0026nbspany society to lift itself out of absolute poverty, it needs to build three critical state institutions: taxation, law and security,” according to the economist Paul Collier. All three in India – the revenue service, the lower levels of the judiciary and the police – still suffer endemic corruption. Perhaps most importantly, the country’s under-the-table political funding system remains largely untouched.Progress in fixing India’s problems of corporate and bank debt has also been frustratingly slow. Modi has introduced some important measures, including a new bankruptcy law and a series of bank recapitalisations. But more radical options have been ignored, notably the\u0026nbspprivatisation of struggling public-sector lenders.India’s own Gilded Age is different in many ways, but it shares at least one characteristic – namely, that such a\u0026nbspperiod of early industrialisation is also a time of rapid political and economic change, in which it should be possible to invoke what the philosopher Richard Rorty once called the “romance of a national future”, the sense of hope that infuses powers on the rise.India is set to grow in economic might throughout this century, as America did during the 19th. By some accounts, it has already overtaken China as the world’s most populous nation in others, the baton will pass during the next decade or two. Whatever the case, the fate of a large slice of humanity depends on India getting its economic model right. Meanwhile, as democracy falters in the west, so its future in India has never been more critical. To make this transition, India’s billionaire Raj must become a passing phase, not a permanent condition. India’s ambition to lead the second half of the\u0026nbsp“Asian century” – and the world’s hopes for a fairer and more democratic future – depend on getting this transition right.

But he warned: “We need clarity for these negotiations to move forward for the time is very short.”Barnier said he had never been shown how Brexit provided added value when the world faced challenges from terrorism and climate change to migration, poverty and financial instability.“It will be clear, crystal clear at the end of this negotiation that the best situation, the best relationship with the EU, will be to remain a member,” he said.Barnier added: “No deal is the worst solution for everybody. It would be a huge economic problem for the UK and also for the EU. I’m not working for that deal, I’m working for a deal.”Barnier’s comments come after days of upheaval in the UK, since Theresa May’s attempt to bind her cabinet to an agreed approach to the Brexit negotiations triggered the resignations of the Brexit secretary, David Davis, and foreign secretary, Boris Johnson.Johnson used his resignation letter on Monday to claim that the UK was “headed for the status of a colony” under May’s soft Brexit plans, which would keep closer ties to the European Union than hardline Conservatives want.Asked if May’s weakened position put negotiations at risk, Barnier said: “To be sincere, I don’t want to make any comment on domestic and national policy in the UK. I have met many people with different views. I have listened to everyone and will continue to do so.

The EU is ready to start negotiating on free trade and customs agreements with the UK, he said.“If it is well understood, these principles, which are the foundation of our union, we would start a constructive discussion, with the UK on two aspects of the negotiation, a free trade agreement and a customs arrangement. The solution will, however, have to be workable and realistic, it should not lead to red tape and cost for citizens and businesses.”A draft withdrawal agreement was signed in March, with several areas signed off including the Brexit bill most but not all issues relating to EU citizens and some issues relating to Ireland, including the common travel area. The UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019. There is an October deadline to reach a withdrawal agreement and the latest round of negotiations is due to take place next week – with the new Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, replacing Davis at the table.May is facing the risk of a confidence vote from rebellious Conservative MPs and the mood of political chaos will be further complicated by the arrival of Donald Trump in the UK on Thursday for a visit which will be punctuated by protests.Leaving the White House on Tuesday for his flight to Europe, Trump described Johnson as “a good friend” and said the UK was “in somewhat turmoil”.Trump is almost entirely avoiding London during his trip, which will include a Windsor Castle meeting with the Queen and talks with May at the Chequers retreat where, last week, she failed to unite her cabinet around her Brexit plan.During a trip to Scotland in 2016, Trump hailed the Brexit vote as a “great thing” and said the people of the UK had “taken back their country”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe73444d5fb214c7d4c5c83984dc432ee6743cd6/0_120_2980_1788/master/2980.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10d20e607833adf24478746a69b21399","title":"england women cricket odi series win new zealand derby","story":"England have sealed a series win over New Zealand after an impressive display at Derby.The tourists, who lost by 142 runs in Saturday’s opener at Headingley, struggled to chase down England’s total of 241 and were skittled for 118.Tammy Beaumont (67) and Natalie Sciver’s 54 led the way as England posted the target after being bowled out in 48 overs.New Zealand’s reply never really got going and three wickets apiece for Katie George and Sophie Ecclestone sealed a 123-run victory.Raf Nicholson’s report to follow"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c79aca8f085eb341ef409641d31854fc134ef465/0_360_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d62b16e9f7c99f8254642060b04a424","title":"fernando gaviria wins tour de france stage four cycling","story":"Fernando Gaviria took his second stage win in the 2018 Tour de France, winning stage four from La\u0026nbspBaule to Sarzeau on the Golfe de Morbihan in Brittany, outsprinting Peter Sagan and André Greipel at the climax of a dead‑straight 4km approach to the line.But a pile‑up 5km from the finish split the bunch and left Rigoberto Urán, second overall in the Tour last year, frantically chasing with his teammates, although Gaviria’s compatriot did eventually rejoin the main field.The day’s breakaway of four riders – the Frenchmen Jérôme Cousin and Anthony Perez, and Dimitri Claeys and Guillaume Van Keirsbulck, both Belgians – mirrored the nationalities in the first World Cup semi-final. But as the quartet closed on the finish line in Sarzeau, home town of the UCI president, David Lappartient, their chances of bringing a stage win home looked doomed.That was until, 50km from the finish, a crash in the pursuing peloton stalled their effort and allowed the quartet to move further ahead once more. But once the Quickstep team of Gaviria, first yellow jersey of the 2018 Tour after his stage one win, moved to the front of the field and picked up the pace, their chances of staying away were over.The sledging continued between the Team Sky principal, Dave Brailsford, and Lappartient – who is the Sarzeau town mayor. Asked to respond to Brailsford’s comments, in the aftermath of the Chris Froome salbutamol case, that Lappartient had the mentality of a small-town French mayor,” the Frenchman initially said he “didn’t really want to reply” but then warmed to the task.“Doesn’t he realise that it takes mayors taking stages of the Tour de France for such great events to take place?

Any violations of the new rules would result in fines against teams.The NFLPA claims the policy, which was installed without consultion with the union, is inconsistent with the collective bargaining agreement and infringes on players’ rights.The union said Tuesday it has proposed having its executive committee talking to the NFL instead of proceeding with litigation. The union said the NFL has agreed to those discussions.An NFL spokesperson said the league is “reviewing the matter” in response to a request for comment from the .Dozens of NFL players have knelt during the anthem over the past two seasons in protest against social injustice in the United States. Critics of the protests, including Donald Trump, believed them to be unpatriotic. Trump called players who knelt “sons of bitches” last year.Trump’s comments sparked a national conversation about patriotism and the nation’s symbols and the use of peaceful protest. The president said in a May interview with Fox \u0026amp Friends, recorded moments after the NFL announced the new guidelines, that he thought “the people” pushed for the new policy.“This was not me,” Trump said. “I brought it out. I think the people pushed it forward. This country’s very smart. We have very smart people. You know, that’s something ideally could have been taken care of when it first started, it would have been a lot easier, but if they did that, they did the right thing.”Vice president Mike Pence wasted no time claiming the NFL’s decision as a victory for the administration, posting a screenshot of a news story on Twitter shortly after the announcement with the caption: #Winning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b794827b3187e079b25bfda8598444b34d76858/187_0_5625_3375/master/5625.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b54ac34cab3a15fbac75d59a61cd46b","title":"microsoft launches smaller cheaper surface go to rival the ipad","story":"New 10in Windows 10 tablet is half the cost of Surface Pro, aimed at Apple’s iPad and Google’s Chromebooks but running OfficeMicrosoft has unveiled its direct challenge to Apple’s iPad, the cheaper, smaller and lighter Surface Go 2-in-1 Windows 10 tablet.The Surface Go resembles other models of Microsoft’s successful Surface tablet range, but has a smaller 10in screen, is 8.3mm thick and only weighs 522g. But the biggest difference is the price: the Surface Go starts at £380 in the UK and $399 in the US, which is half the price of the cheapest Surface Pro tablet.Panos Panay, chief product officer for Microsoft, said: “Surface Go is small and mighty, giving you the performance you need to be productive.“When we designed this device, we had to ask ourselves what people want and need from a 10” Surface. The answers seem obvious – lightweight, productive, and accessible to more people.”Unlike the more powerful Surface Pro tablet, the Surface Go has Intel’s seventh-generation Intel Pentium Gold, which Microsoft says balances power consumption with performance, for a battery life of nine hours.The Surface Go has Microsoft’s high-resolution PixelSense screen technology, including support for the Surface Pen stylus, with its full 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity and very low latency. The tablet also has its own version of the detachable keyboard from the Surface Pro, and the built-in kickstand that supports up to 165-degrees of angle.The new tablet is also the first to have both USB-C and Microsoft’s Surface Connector, following the introduction of USB-C to the Surface Book 2 in December. The Surface Go also has a microSD card slot, a headphone socket and Microsoft’s Windows Hello facial recognition camera for unlocking the device. It runs in Windows 10 S mode out of the box but can be switched to regular Windows 10 at any time.While questions remain around customer demand for a lower-power Windows machine from Microsoft, experts were broadly positive about the introduction of a cheaper Surface device, saying that it made Microsoft’s offerings more competitive with Apple’s iPad and Google’s Chromebooks, which have found success in the education market.“Microsoft is getting more aggressive with the Surface portfolio. It’s a logical move to make the Surface concept more accessible,” said Geoff Blaber, from CCS Insight. “There is a question mark on power and performance relative to the iPad. The Surface Go is a prime candidate for Arm-based chips from Qualcomm to provide an experience much closer to iPad in terms of battery life. While this design cycle missed that opportunity I’d fully expect future products to go down that road.” “The Surface Go is an excellent proposition. ‘Built for Office 365’ is a nice way of saying - it is not your mainstream laptop (and it shouldn’t be),” said Rushabh Doshi, mobility analyst at Canalys. “Definitely gunning for the value-conscious iPad Pro aspirers. And will be interesting to see if it can make a dent in education.”The Surface Go will be able to pre-order with either 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage or 8GB and 128GB from today in the UK, US and several other countries shipping on 6 August. A version with 4G LTE broadband will be available later in the year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/856284cf29c77f652dfc7554a03585851b9c8c79/0_52_2040_1224/master/2040.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d316911a0b6ea34f18768cfcb79d7dd","title":"bold as bauhaus how the legendary schools lost typefaces were recreated in pictures","story":"Experts have trawled the archives at the renowned German school of design, to create a series of fonts from fragments of typeface treasures by original Bauhaus students.

Yes, the show goes down easier with a healthy pour. But maybe not one memorialized with the white bonnet and “Of-insert-husband’s-name” formulations that viewers associate with torture and tyranny. Offred, played by Elisabeth Moss, is imagined as a pinot noir “so beguiling it seems almost forbidden to taste”. This is egregious on many levels, the first being that the grape from which pinot noir is cultivated is known for being thin-skinned, which is how someone who has never seen or read The Handmaid’s Tale would describe Offred. The description refers to both the wine and Offred as “seductive” before stating: “It’s useless to resist the wine’s smooth and appealingly earthy profile, so you may as well give in.” I can forgive the shoehorning in of the word “resist” the way one forgives a bad dad joke: the idea, however, that Offred has any kind of sexual agency in Gilead, that men are simply slaves to her charms, is about as close as you could get to an alt-right reading of the show.Moving on to Ofglen, who over two seasons has been subjected to a forced clitoridectomy and put out to pasture in a cesspool of nuclear waste. Her rebellious streak, according to Lot18’s website, “was the inspiration for this bold cabernet sauvignon – which, aptly, hails from the Rogue Valley”. A bottle of this wine, promising the kind of “pleasure and enjoyment” proscribed in Gilead, will cost you $20.And, finally, a bordeaux blanc in recognition of Serena Joy, the televangelist-turned-trophy-wife cut from the cloth of conservative ideologues like Phyllis Schlafly and Ann Coulter. In bordeaux form, though, Serena Joy is “sophisticated, traditional and austere”, a wine we are advised not to “judge too quickly” or we might miss out on “a sublime experience”. It’s true that as the show has developed we’ve seen more and more layers of Serena Joy, a complicated, self-flagellating character, but this description made me think of Donald Trump’s remarks about “very fine people” at last year’s neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, which will kill even the best of buzzes.Lot18, unfortunately, is not the first company to merchandize a show about totalitarianism and ritualized sex slavery. It may not even be the most harebrained attempt: that distinction goes to sleepwear company Lunya, which last spring released a red lingerie silk set named after Offred. The Wing, a women-only social club and workspace in New York City, got flak for its line of Handmaid’s swag, too, which included notebooks and pens embossed with peppy dictums of female empowerment. Laura Bogart, writing for Vulture, noted that the sale of white bonnets, silk-screened T-shirts, and pink matchboxes “exemplifies this tonal disconnect between the rah-rah you-go-girl-ism of the marketing plan and the deeper meaning of the show it’s promoting”.By no fault of its own actors and writers, who make up one of television’s most formidable ensembles, The Handmaid’s Tale has continued to lend its iconography to products that fail to match up to its status. As just about everyone has noted in the last year, the show is especially resonant in today’s political wasteland. But even more timely, and Trumpian, is the garish cynicism with which these products have tried turn a profit on the show’s message."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b858d41ba515c444900c224c91e37223e71382d9/62_154_3551_2131/master/3551.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b23f5997aff3367275e3e576fdd215db","title":"balkan states must embrace reform before eu ascension","story":"EU leaders are impatient at lack of resolution on issues such as border disputesEuropeans leaders are becoming “more and more impatient” with the reluctance of west Balkan leaders to accept the necessity of reforms to the rule of law, threatening the chances of them joining the European Union by 2025.The EU commissioner for enlargement, Johannes Hahn, told the summit for the west Balkans in London: “In all these countries I face a certain reluctance to address properly rule of law issues. It is a must for the EU.“I admit our member states are becoming more and more impatient on this issue because they see this is as crucial – the fight against corruption, media reform and independence of judiciary.” He said statesmanship was needed in the region if the outline timetable for accession was to be met.But he insisted the accession of countries such as Albania, Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Kosovo into the EU represented a chance to export stability to the region, adding the alternative of the status quo will simply lead to the import of instability into the EU.The London summit, part of the five-year-old Berlin process, is intended to help prepare the Balkan countries for EU membership by speeding economic reform, strengthening security and deepening the rule of law. Britain has also been promoting reconciliation by backing measures to locate and identify 12,000 bodies still missing from the civil war of the 90s, but hopes that a full-scale truth commission would be supported at the summit proved too ambitious.The UK had intended by hosting a summit dedicated to EU enlargement that it could show that despite Brexit it remained committed to Europe, and its security.The plan was torpedoed by the abrupt resignation of the foreign secretary Boris Johnson on Monday, the opening day of the summit, complaining in his resignation letter the UK was about to become a colony of the European Union.Balkan leaders on Monday were left waiting for Johnson, their principal host, to decide whether to resign his post – a delay that required his deputy Sir Alan Duncan to chair the summit. Johnson’s successor, Jeremy Hunt, attended the second day of the summit, along with Theresa May, Angela Merkel and Federica Mogherini, the EU foreign policy chief.The summit reviewed the mixed signals on whether the imminence of accession negotiations is speeding reform in the Balkans. The EU has said it will not allow into membership any state that has unresolved border disputes, a precondition that requires resolution of a host of complex ethnic, territorial and political disputes including between Bulgaria and Macedonia, Greece and Macedonia, and Kosovo and Serbia.In a breakthrough, a 27-year dispute between Greece and Macedonia could soon be over – the latter’s official name has been resolved by two reformist leaders, with an agreement to rename it Northern Macedonia. But the package is facing resistance in Greece and awaits a tricky referendum in Macedonia this autumn.Nikola Dimitrov, the Macedonian foreign minister and one of the most pro-reform figures in the Balkans, said: “The ultimate goal is to be a European democracy, but it is really high time our region stepped it up and took responsibility. We do not have the luxury of missing a golden opportunity.”Referring to the decision by the EU last month to start accession talks with Macedonia and Albania next summer, he explained: “We have been locked in the waiting room for some time, but we are now running after a train, even if we are not quite sure in what direction.”Asked why Macedonia wanted to join the EU at the time of the UK’s departure, Dimitrov said: “Perhaps those inside forget how cold it is outside.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b2ac745b92afa0ceae0737ba84bf5504af928ae/0_290_4711_2827/master/4711.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=835207cac42c2d5b8ffda3daca34611b","title":"liu xia nobel laureates widow allowed to leave china for europe","story":"Widow of Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo leaves Beijing after eight years under house arrestLiu Xia, the widow of the Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo, has arrived in Berlin, having left Beijing after almost eight years of living under house arrest and days before the anniversary of her husband’s death.At 4.49pm (1539 BST) on Tuesday a Finnair flight carrying the poet and visual artist touched down at Tegel airport in the German capital, where Liu is reported to be seeking medical aid.Human rights activists and friends of Liu had confirmed her departure from Beijing earlier on Tuesday. According to Human Rights Watch, the German government negotiated Liu’s release. “Ever since her late husband received the Nobel peace prize while in a Chinese prison, Liu Xia was also unjustly detained. The German government deserves credit for its sustained pressure and hard work to gain Liu Xia’s release,” said Sophie Richardson, the China director at Human Rights Watch.Chinese authorities have insisted that Liu, who was not formally charged with any crime, has been free to move as she wishes, but her supporters say she has been under de facto house arrest.Liu’s husband, Liu Xiaobo, was awarded the Nobel prize in 2010 for his activism in China. He was jailed in 2009 for subversion, for his involvement in Charter 08, a manifesto calling for reforms. He died last year from liver cancer while serving an 11-year prison sentence.Patrick Poon, a China researcher for Amnesty International, said Liu had been allowed to leave China but her brother, Liu Hui, has had to remain in Beijing. He was convicted on fraud charges over a real-estate dispute in 2013, a case activists believed to be retribution against the family.“It’s really wonderful that Liu Xia is finally able to leave China after suffering so much all these years,” Poon said. “However, it’s worrying that her brother, Liu Hui, is still kept in China. Liu Xia might not be able to speak much for fear of her brother’s safety.”Liu Hui posted on WeChat that his sister had flown to Europe to “start her new life”. He wrote: “I am grateful for people’s concern and assistance these past years.”News of Liu’s release came one day after the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, met with the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, in Bremerhaven, inviting speculation about whether the development was part of a broader diplomatic deal. China and Germany have in recent months become the two main targets of a US president threatening trade tariffs on industrial imports.“Is Liu Xia’s release all about softening up the German chancellor, as one of the most important representatives of the liberal industrial nations, in order to form a joint front against Trump?”, wrote the German weekly Die Zeit. “It’s an ugly suspicion, but one that can’t be dismissed out of hand.”At a regular press briefing Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China’s foreign ministry, said Liu’s travel to Germany for medical treatment was “in accordance with her own will” and had nothing to do with Li’s visit. “This is not a diplomatic issue,” she said.“Of course I am very happy that finally she’s gained her freedom and could leave China, but this does not mean China has made any improvements on human rights,” said Hu Ping, a US-based editor and friend of Liu’s.Since last year, activists, diplomats and friends of Liu have been lobbying especially hard for her release. Hu said Liu was told in May she may be able to leave in July. Li’s visit to Germany and the signing of $23.6bn (£1.98bn) in trade deals do not seem to him to be a coincidence. “This might be why she was able to leave now,” he said.Friends and advocates had been calling for Liu’s release so she could seek medical help for severe depression. In May the Chinese writer Liao Yiwu released a recording of a phone call in which Liu described the mental torture of her situation. “If I can’t leave, I’ll die in my home,” she said.One of the last times she was seen in public was in July last year, when she scattered the ashes of her late husband at sea. While under house arrest, both of her parents died and she has been hospitalised at least twice for a heart condition. Frances Eve, a researcher at Chinese Human Rights Defenders, said: “Hopefully she will be able to recuperate and receive much-needed medical care, but China is effectively holding her brother hostage so she may not speak out about her ordeal. The Chinese government has already shown its willingness to ruthlessly deploy collective punishment against their family.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3560474.1531245612!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"do not swim notice at claremont beach in howth dublin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFingal County Council has erected a temporary ‘do not swim’ notice at Claremont Beach, Howth while the results of water testing are awaited.

On leaving their famine-ravaged home town, each girl received two dresses, two petticoats, five pairs of stockings, two pairs of shoes, a bible, a bowl and a spoon.This summer, the poignant story of 110 teenage girls sent in 1848 from the devastation of a starving Skibbereen to Australia – where they were referred to as “breeders” – will be recalled in a bronze sculpture and a large piece of Australian sandstone in the West Cork town.“This is a story of bravery, the bravery of women it is a story of heroines,” says Skibbereen-based artist Toma McCullim. The girls from the Skibbereen Union Workhouse were despatched to Australia to provide labour, marry, have children and help colonise the sprawling continent.It’s uncertain how much choice, if any, they had in their departure, the artist says. At the time, 60 people a day were dying in the Skibbereen workhouse, which was rife with disease and hunger.The 110 were essentially “farmed”, says the artist with Uillinn, the West Cork Arts Centre, who has been the driving force behind the year-long 110 Skibbereen Girls public art project.In documentation she studied as part of her research through residencies at Uillinn, West Cork Arts Centre in Skibbereen and at the site of Skibbereen Workhouse, now Skibbereen Community Hospital Campus, the girls were referred to as “breeders”.The residencies allowed McCullim to carry out research and support a variety of tours, talks, film screenings and participatory workshops on the theme of the 110 girls and their journey to Australia.The 110 girls departed for Australia under the Earl Grey Famine Orphan Scheme, named after the colonial secretary who enacted it.This scheme had two aims: to reduce overcrowding in Irish workhouses through an assisted emigration scheme and to send female immigrants to settle in Australia where at the time there were nine men for every woman.The board of s in every union in Ireland put forward the names of suitable girls aged 14-18. An estimated 4,000 girls left the country under the scheme. Skibbereen Workhouse offered the most girls outside Dublin. There are believed to be in the region of 10,000 descendants of the young Skibbereen emigrants.Although the girls did not have to be orphans to be eligible for the scheme, it was stipulated that they were not to be living with their families, be of good character, unmarried and without children so that there would be no impediment to marrying Australian settlers.“Many of them did better in Australia than they could have done in the prevailing conditions in Ireland at the time,” says McCullim.At least two descendants are expected to make the journey to Skibbereen next month for a special ceremony honouring their ancestors’ story.One hundred and 10 bronze spoons have been cast by McCullim from beeswax moulds created by staff and residents at the Skibbereen Community Hospital complex, formerly the workhouse.Throughout this month, the spoons will be embedded in the archway above what used to be the workhouse’s Women’s Entrance, near the site’s famine burial ground.This piece of public art, which will be unveiled by the Australian ambassador on July 20th, will also include an installation of a piece of Australian sandstone, donated by the Australian embassy, which is expected to be placed in front of the archway.The ceremony will take place the day after the prestigious Coming Home: Art and the Great Hunger exhibition of historical and contemporary artwork from Ireland’s Great Hunger Museum, Quinnipiac University in the US state of Connecticut, opens in Uillinn, the West Cork Arts Centre in Skibbereen.The exhibition is on display in Dublin Castle"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3560324.1531236571!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"se%C3%A1n gallagher asks councils to help candidates contest presidency","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA file image of Michael D Higgins and Seán Gallagher during the 2011 presidential campaign.  Photograph: Eric LukeThe . Businessman Seán Gallagher has written to local authorities across the State asking them to consider supporting independent candidates in a presidential election.President Michael D Higgins, who defeated a field including Mr Gallagher and the late Sinn Féin politician Martn McGuinness in the 2011 election, on Tuesday confirmed his intention to seek a second term in Arás an Uachtaráin. A presidential election is expected to be held in October if others receive the backing of 20 or more Oireachtas members or four or more local authorities. In his letter to the councils, Mr Gallagher noted the role city and county councils can play in the democratic process by “facilitating the nomination of candidates” to contest the presidential election.“It is an important constitutional function available to local authority members, and in the interest of democracy and the widest electoral choice possible, I would appeal to you to ensure that you and your council colleagues exercise your constitutional right to nominate a candidate if you so wish,” he said. While he does not explicitly state his intention to seek election, Mr Gallagher wrote that councils must exercise their right to nominate candidates and provide a fair playing field for all potential candidates. He claims the office of President of Ireland cannot be “dictated by the narrow interests of political parties acting to prevent a democratic contest”. Mr Higgins issued a brief statement confirming that he will seek a second term and will be running as an independent candidate. As the office holder, he does not need to be nominated by Oireachtas members or councils. In a statement, Mr Higgins’s spokesman said: “President Michael D Higgins wishes to confirm that he will be offering himself as an independent candidate, under Article 12.4.4 of Bunreacht Na hÉireann, when the Ministerial Order for a Presidential Election is made later in the year.”“The Government has been informed of this decision...The President’s programme of official duties and engagements continues.”Mr Higgins is expected to make a statement and take questions from the media at an event in Co Mayo later.Senator Gerard Craughwell has confirmed he will be seeking a nomination to contest the election and Senator Joan Freeman is also understood to be seeking support.Speaking after Mr Higgins confirmed his intention to seek a second term, Mr Craughwell said he was disappointed Mr Higgins had “left it to the 12th hour” to announce his intention.“It was a strategic move on his part to close out the possibility of an election,” Mr Craughwell told RTÉ’s Today with Miriam. “We started this conversation 12 months ago (about an election). I’m convinced that we don’t do coronations in this country. We run elections.”Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald on Tuesday reaffirmed her view that there should be an election, and said the party’s Ard Chomhairle, its national executive, will make a decision on the issue on Saturday. Martin Heydon, the chairman of the Fine Gael parliamentary party, said its TDs and senators will make a decision on whether to back Mr Higgins at their weekly meeting tomorrow. It is widely expected Fine Gael will support Mr Higgins. When asked if he would accept the support of Sinn Féin for his candidacy, Senator Craughwell replied: “a nomination is a nomination”. However, he said he thought it would be “an ask” for Sinn Féin to support him given his background as a British soldier.This made him even more determined to get the nomination, he added. “I’m quite angry that the President left it so late. We’ve been discussing this for 12 months.”Mr Craughwell said he believed the public wants an election and no one had the right to return unopposed. He denied that he now feared he would not win. “Elections can turn on the spin of a coin.”The President will have to explain why he changed his mind about serving just one term, he added. It was important that all candidates have equal opportunities to canvas, he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3560042.1531238878!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ministers rally around may at first meeting of new cabinet","story":"Theresa May has praised Boris Johnson and David Davis in a statement to the House of Commons following their resignations.  Video: Parliamentlive.tv\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May departs following a cabinet meeting at number 10 Downing Street in London on Tuesday. Photograph: Luke MacGregorBloombergBritish prime minister Theresa May moved to reassert her authority on Tuesday after two top cabinet members quit and launched broadsides against her Brexit plans, winning support from many of her ministers including a leading eurosceptic.Ms May said she had chaired a “productive” meeting of her government, unswayed by the resignations of foreign secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit negotiator David Davis that rocked the government on Monday.Among those rallying around the prime minister was environment minister Michael Gove - a prominent campaigner to exit the European Union alongside Johnson for the 2016 referendum - who said he would not follow suit by resigning.However, the vice-chairs of the Conservative Party, MPs Ben Bradley and Maria Caulfield, resigned their posts on Tuesday because of their opposition to Ms May’s current policy on Brexit.“I fully understand and appreciate the great many challenges you face in delivering on Brexit, not least the balancing act in the House of Commons that constrains your freedom,” Mr Bradley wrote in his resignation later. “However I have come to the conclusion that I cannot in good faith be a spokesman for the party or for Government on this issue, and I cannot with any sincerity defend this course to my electorate, 71 per cent of whom voted to leave the European Union.”With less than nine months until Britain is due to leave the bloc, Ms May is sticking to her plan for a “business friendly” Brexit.She looks set on facing down a rebellion in her Conservative Party, where hardline Brexit supporters are livid over her plans to negotiate “a free trade area for goods” with the EU. One described accepting EU rules as “the ultimate betrayal”.Above a picture of her cabinet, including her new foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt and Brexit minister Dominic Raab after a mini-reshuffle late on Monday, Ms May wrote on her twitter feed: “Productive Cabinet meeting this morning - looking ahead to a busy week.”Her spokesman said she had welcomed the new members of her cabinet and they had discussed the publication of a white paper policy document on Britain’s future ties with the EU and stepping up preparations for any no-deal outcome to the negotiations with Brussels. Other ministers described the meeting as “very good”.“I think it is right that the cabinet backs the prime minister and speaks with one voice and if people don’t do that then they have to go,” justice secretary David Gauke told BBC radio.Ms May must now move quickly to try to win the EU’s support for her Brexit proposal to unblock talks. These have all but stalled because of her reticence of show her cards until now for fear of angering one of the two main factions of her party.German chancellor Angela Merkel arrives in London later on Tuesday for a meeting with May and other leaders to discuss the Western Balkans.The British leader may have stilled the waters over a possible leadership contest, but some Conservative Brexit supporters are still incensed over what they see as her decision to break her promise for a clean break with the EU.“It is the ultimate betrayal of our democracy and people’s belief in it. It’s not even an accidental betrayal, it was planned and plotted well in advance,” said Conservative politician Andrew Bridgen.“Never have so many campaigned for so long and so hard for so little,” he said.But while many Brexit campaigners were still hoping for a vote of confidence to oust Ms May, it is unlikely that they have the numbers. They also are in a minority in parliament to try to change any deal that is agreed with the EU.At a meeting with Conservative politicians on Monday, she was cheered and applauded by many, having warned them that internal squabbling could pave the way for socialist opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn to take power instead.Ms May’s proposals for a future EU relationship after Britain departs from the bloc next March had taken two years of internal government wrangling to agree. But within 48 hours Davis had quit and Johnson followed. The Daily  newspaper ran a photograph on Tuesday of him, pen poised, resigning as foreign minister. Three junior ministers also quit their posts.“Brexit should be about opportunity and hope,” Mr Johnson said in a scathing resignation letter that was echoed in headlines in a number of Britain’s national newspapers. “That dream is dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt.”Meanwhile, US president Donald Trump has said the UK is in turmoil and suggested that his meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin would be the easiest of his trip to Europe to see Nato leaders and Ms May.Speaking as he boarded Marine One, Mr Trump said: “It’s going to be an interesting time in the UK and an interesting time at Nato. We will work it out and all countries will be happy.“So I have Nato, I have the UK — that’s a situation with turmoil. And I have Putin. Frankly, Putin may be the easiest of all.”On his trip to Europe, he added: “It’s going to be an interesting time in the UK and an interesting time at Nato. We will work it out and all countries will be happy.“We do have a lot of allies. But we cannot be taken advantage of. We’re being taken advantage of by the European Union. We spend 75 per cent on Nato and frankly, it helps them more than it helps us.”–ReutersPress AssociationDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

We don\u0027t have a loyalty,Pakistan has been under military rule for nearly half of its 71-year-history.

Mr Lawai has denied any wrongdoing.Local media said Mr Zardari would face a summons over the investigation. As the former husband of assassinated Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, during the 1990s he repeatedly faced accusations of corruption, earning the moniker “Mr 10 Percent” for the allegation he took a commission on state contracts.

formation we have ever done as a Typhoon force.We have done nine ships - which are the diamond nine - which is a relatively basic formation, but it is actually making something that big.The Red Arrows perform a fly past over Buckingham Palace - streaming red, white and blue smoke down the length of the MallThe 38-year-old said he came up with a lot of the shape of the formation in terms of references, and measured it all out and where everyone should be.He revealed much of the practice has been taking place over the North Sea more than 120 miles out from land to avoid being spotted, and to give them more space.That formation is relatively big and unwieldy and trying to manoeuvre it is difficult, so doing it over land is harder, Sqn Ldr Child said.Five frontline Typhoon squadrons, plus one training unit, are involved in the formation - with eight jets and 150 personnel brought down from RAF Lossiemouth to RAF Coningsby for the flypast.The Red Arrows fly over a full-size replica

asked how he feels to be involved, he said: It is an overwhelming sense of pride... to be involved on the day - flying will be just amazing.With three weeks set aside for training ahead of the flypast, he said the Typhoon force is still delivering on operations around the world, and through Quick Reaction Alert.What we have done is reduce the training flying back in the UK, it is not that we are stopping it, we are just reduced it, he said of managing training, formation practice and operations.Asked what the Queen will have made of the display, he said: It is going to be quite a tight formation, I think hopefully she will be very impressed, it is going to be loud as well going down the Mall.The Queen and other members of the Royal family have been leading national celebrations as the Royal Air Force marks a centenary since its formation.Service personnel spelling out 100 on the forecourt of Buckingham Palace as crowds fill the Mall It was 100 years ago on April 1 1918 that the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service merged to create the RAF - the world\u0027s first independent air service.Beginning with a service at Westminster Abbey, the Queen was joined by family members including the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.The Queen has praised the Royal Air Force for its tenacity, skill and gallantry. Standing in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace, she spoke of the remarkable contribution to defence over the last 100 years.The Queen spoke proudly not only as the RAF\u0027s Air Commodore-in-Chief, but also as a citizen who remembered the Battle of Britain, and as a daughter whose father King George VI served with the RAF.She said: Presenting the Royal Air Force with a new Queen\u0027s Colour provides an opportunity to congratulate the service for your remarkable contribution to defence over the last 100 years.Tenacity, skill and gallantry have been your hallmarks as you helped safeguard freedom and security in many parts of the world.I remember the Battle of Britain being fought over the skies above us and we shall never forget the courage and sacrifice of that time.She also took the Royal Salute at the ceremony as her relatives including the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke of Cambridge plus the Duke and Duchess of Sussex watched nearby.Charles, William and Harry all chose to wear No 1 RAF uniform to Westminster Abbey, with Kate wearing a Dacre Brooch - which was presented to her by the Air Cadets when she took on patronage in 2015.And despite still being on maternity leave, after giving birth to Prince Louis only 11 weeks ago, it is understood that Kate felt it was important to attend Tuesday\u0027s celebrations.Kate wore a coat by Alexander McQueen, and a hat by Sean Barrett, with Meghan choosing to wear a dress by Dior and a hat by royal milliner Stephen Jones.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and

packed Westminster Abbey for the service, with dignitaries including Prime Minister Theresa May, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn attending alongside the royals.Theresa May shakes hands as she arrives at Westminster AbbeyThe Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, addressed the congregation and said the RAF has in its first 100 years been a decisive factor in serving the country, as well as being key in protecting democracy and freedom.With an RAF ensign draped over the high altar behind him in the abbey, Mr Welby also highlighted how members of his own family have served and been killed in the RAF - drawing attention to his own father who flew low level sorties in Burma.Video: Royals at Westminster AbbeyAir-Vice Marshal Gerry Mayhew, the air officer commanding No 1 group and the senior responsible officer for the flypast, said the day is the centrepiece of the RAF\u0027s 100th year.It is the high point for the capital, Her Majesty the Queen and the Royal family, he said.And it is a great opportunity to look back and really celebrate our past, but to look forward is a really important thing for us as we look to the next 100 years.He described being at the forefront of the flypast as a great honour, and said he hopes the Queen and royal family will see exactly what they can do for the monarch.Asked what message a 100-aircraft flypast may send to Britain\u0027s adversaries and the world, he said: It demonstrates we are a competent, professional and capable air force that has a credible, very credible, set of capabilities.Charles, Camilla, William, Harry and Meghan will also meet veterans, personnel, charity representatives and those from the civil service in a reception after the spectacle.Video: 100 years of the Royal Air ForceThe flypast is set to feature aircraft including Puma and Chinook helicopters, a Lancaster, Spitfires, Hurricanes, the A400M Atlas, Tornados, Typhoons and the F-35 stealth fighter jets.Drawing the spectacle to a close will be the Red Arrows, who in traditional aerobatic style will stream red, white and blue smoke down the length of The Mall.The officer commanding the Red Arrows, Wing Commander Andrew Keith, who took the helm in August, said it is an incredible year to be leading them.During the flypast, he said he will be flying in the formation in the back seat of the team leader\u0027s jet, getting a few photos.It is going to be business as usual for us - and hopefully clocking over that 100th aircraft, he said when asked if they will be doing anything different on the day.Please review our commenting policyCoach who led boys into Thai caves hailed hero after sacrificing meals and teaching meditation to keep team calmComment: Theresa May meets

weather tropical storm chris could end british heatwave forecaster","story":"digitalservices@telegraphdigitalservices@telegraphThe UK has been basking in a record heatwave for weeks, but the end of the hot weather could be near as a tropical storm heads towards British shores.Tropical storm Chris is likely to become a hurricane as it crosses the Atlantic and could bring wind and rain to the UK by the weekend.Nicola Maxey, the Met Office spokesman, said that tropical storm Chris, which is currently gathering off the US east coast will influence the weather but we cannot tell what that influence will be at the moment because it is still developing.There is still uncertainty about the possible track the storm will take and, if it did hit the UK, it would no longer be at hurricane strength.June saw the hottest weather since 1940, and least rainfall in 23 yearsBritain has enjoyed temperatures more than ten degrees above the average so far this summer, and it was previously thought the warm and dry weather would continue until the end of July.However, gardeners and farmers will be pleased, as the dry weather has harmed crops and gardens, as well as depleting reservoirs and sparking water warnings from utilities companies.And while the much-needed rain could hit this weekend, warm weather is still expected for the next few days.Average summer temperatures are 19C (66F) but across the UK we have seen 10C above that, according to Ms Maxey.She said a blip in the current hot weather on Tuesday, that is not down to Chris, is seeing temperatures in the south east drop to around 23-25C (73-77F) and further north to 21-22C (69-71F) in Birmingham or 17-18C (62-64F) in Newcastle, but temperatures will increase a few degrees to the weekend.Ms Maxey said: Certainly next week after ex-hurricane Chris has passed through we are looking at weather that is more mobile or normal (for this time of year) but that is not to say that we will not have another hot spell of weather.Coach who led boys into Thai caves hailed hero after sacrificing meals and teaching meditation to keep team calmComment: Theresa May meets Angela Merkel... and treats us to another day of

But, the US did not threaten Russia in the same manner.\u0026nbspAn unnamed Russian delegate said the country stepped up to back and help pass the resolution because they felt\u0026nbsp “it is wrong when a big country tries to push around some very small countries, especially on an issue that is really important for the rest of the world.The delegation was also opposed to another section of the resolution which called on countries to curtail promotion of products that medical experts agreed could cause harm to children according to more than a dozen delegates to the health meeting, the majority of whom requested anonymity because they feared retaliation from the US, according to the newspaper.Though US\u0026nbspefforts were unsuccessful since the bulk of the original wording survived two whole days of procedural talks, language calling for “inappropriate promotion of foods for infants and young children to end was removed due to US efforts.\u0026nbspThe US mission to the UN nor the State Department responded to a request for comment.\u0026nbspIt appeared,\u0026nbsphowever, the US was asking to have the language removed as a sign of support for the $70bn\u0026nbspinfant formula industry which relies on mothers not exclusively breastfeeding. Baby food lobbyists were in attendance as observers to the meeting.The US also reportedly threatened to cut its contributions to the World Health Organisation - the US contributes almost 15 per cent of the agency\u0027s budget or $845m last year - if the resolution was introduced and passed.\u0026nbspIn light of the threat on Ecuador, other poorer countries in Latin America and Africa refused to introduce the resolution out of fear of American retaliation which left Russia to push it through.\u0026nbspBreastfeeding in public controversiesA woman has sparked a heated debate among parents after she revealed that she breastfeeds both her and her friend\u0027s son.

With an estimated worth of $1bn, a trade body and a recognised marketing award, they have finally been tamedClick to followThe Independent OnlinePep talk: Kendall Jenner’s Pepsi advert was pulled shortly after it aired for appearing to trivialise demonstrations tackling social causesLast month, the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity –\u0026nbspthe biggest grouping of advertising and marketing people you could ever hope to avoid –\u0026nbspintroduced a new award: the Social and Influencer\u0026nbspcategory.Yes, those\u0026nbspgurning thumb-flexers forever punching #YOLO, #instacool and #nofilter into their smartphones as they plug products have come of age.\u0026nbspInfluencer-dom is now a fully-fledged industry. Yet only a year or two ago we were told by many (rather gleefully in some cases) that the influencer was dead or at least in crisis.Earlier this year, this seemed to be confirmed as the owner of the White Moose Cafe in Dublin turned the tables on\u0026nbsp22-year-old YouTube vlogger and influencer Elle Darby, by exposing her demand for five free hotel nights in return for exposure.His public burn spoke for many: “If I let you stay here in return for a feature in a video, who is going to pay the staff who look after you?” The twitter-mob turned on influencers. Who were they? How do they get away with it? Do they actually earn money?When the influencer marketing industry began (around 2008-10, attest the form’s historians) the notion took hold that like celebrity endorsement before it, aspirational people could become marketing tools, accessing the consumer mind as if a recommendation from a friend.YouTuber with 139,095 subscribers, was refused a free hotel stay (YouTubeElle Darby)As one observer put it:\u0026nbsp“They emerged almost overnight and in 10 years have gone from a small network to a worldwide community.” Some sources suggest that there is now a baseline of 1.1 million influencers worldwide.\u0026nbspMediakix estimated\u0026nbspthe industry was worth more than $1bn\u0026nbsp(£750m)\u0026nbspin 2017. Malcolm Gladwell’s coinage, “the tipping point”, was used a lot in meetings.\u0026nbspBy about 2014, a baffled world had started to understand influencer marketing, but the industry’s breakthrough year was probably 2016 when, as Hamda Issa-Salwe of Bravado, part of Universal Music Group, found when she did a research thesis called Investigating the Use of Influencer Marketing on Social Media.“It began to soar,” she says. “Google classified ‘influencer’ as a breakout keyword with a 5,000 per cent month by month increase in the number of times the search term ‘influencer marketing’ was typed.”Also in 2016, it was established that Kendall Jenner was paid an estimated $300,000 per social media post. Advertising agencies took more careful notice of influencers and Instagram –\u0026nbspfounded in 2010 – became the key station of the social media cross, along with other key platforms\u0026nbspsuch as YouTube, Snapchat and Pinterest.Even the fustiest legacy-media type can now see the point. The barrier to entry is low. All you need is a smartphone and a certain brio. And the research seems to add up. According to Nielsen, 84 per cent\u0026nbspof consumers trust opinions from people they know, while 70 per cent\u0026nbsptake action based on other consumer’s opinions online.vlogger Zoella reportedly has a net worth of £2.5m (InstagramZoella)The Association of National Advertisers found that 75 per cent\u0026nbspof members already work with influencers, and the growing industry will take 20 per cent\u0026nbspof the total global marketing budget by 2023.No wonder that 82 per cent\u0026nbspof millennials hope to become influencers at least, according to a survey by London-based dating app CLiKD.\u0026nbspSo the money’s talking, and influencers can do well.It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rentAs Anthony Svirskis, CEO\u0026nbspof TRIBE and a juror on the\u0026nbspSocial and Influencer award says:\u0026nbsp“On a post by post basis, brands should expect to pay £50 for someone with 3,000 followers and upwards of £300 if someone has more than 100,000 followers.” Small wonder the market is seething with aspirant influencers.\u0026nbspYet influencers are still derided as being without any particular skills: even that they’re the apotheosis of the entitled “Me” generation, spreading paid-for blandishments in vocal-fry vlogs on YouTube.While it’s hard to blame someone who travels the world in return for Instagram snaps, is there an influencer bubble waiting to burst? Paul Dyer, of marketing company Lippe Taylor, believes it will, as trust has disappeared from the sector in the sceptical Facebook-Cambridge Analytica era.“There is tremendous value in influencer marketing,” he said recently. “However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls out.”Indeed, there have been several influencer #epicfails, perhaps the most notable being\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspFestival, the ill-fated 2017 Bahamas musical festival that paid Kendall Jenner and Bella\u0026nbspHadid\u0026nbspto drum up support.\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspbombed and the repercussions are ongoing.There’s also an undergrowth of freebie-hunting influencers harassing hotels and providers. Some hotels – the\u0026nbspDusit\u0026nbspThani\u0026nbspresort in the Males among them – now use weeding out processes. “When they work hotels love them,” says one travel PR.\u0026nbspThe influencer economy … is a market irrationality. Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money“Influencers are uncritical and often share films and photographs that would otherwise be paid for. But there’s a trust problem.”There are other cracks in the influencer edifice as brands begin to ask questions about the business efficacy of influencers. As publicist Mark Borkowski says:\u0026nbsp“More brands are beginning to realise that influencer activity doesn’t necessarily drive ROI.”And the pain is on both sides, he adds. “It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rent.” Anti-influencers are coming of the woodwork –\u0026nbspand they’re not all crusty oldies with a grudge.“The influencer economy … is a market irrationality,” wrote Sam Biddle of Gawker in 2016. “Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money.” As for bots and fake followers, that’s a real problem.Fyre Festival attendees locked in airport ‘for their own safety’At Cannes, Unilever’s chief marketing officer Keith Weed called for industry action to clean out the influencer stable, and vowed never to use influencers found to be buying followers.So the sands are shifting. Hamda Issa-Salwe says that while influencer activity remains hard to define and audit, it’s still growing. Although trust and authenticity (the great influencer bon mot) are major factors, brands still spend a lot on influencers: after all,\u0026nbspInstagram has more 800 million monthly active users.And the influencers themselves are fighting back. It’s a new industry: of course legacy dinosaurs wouldn’t get it. It’s just another marketing tool. And what are –\u0026nbspsorry, were –\u0026nbspnewspapers half the time, but a vehicle of paid-for information?“Indeed, there’s a growing distrust of traditional media advertising,” says Harry Hugo, cofounder at The Goat Agency, Europe’s leading influencer agency, which claims to be growing at a rate of 600 per cent\u0026nbspa year.“Just look at the rise in ad blockers, investigations into media transparency and big networks like WPP struggling. Influencers can be one of the most trusted, and therefore highest converting, information sources for people.”\u0026nbspAlso, we jeremiahs just don’t get the craft and graft that goes into an influencer’s brand persona, adds Florencia Lujani, influencer marketing manager at agency We Are Social London.“People struggle to see why brands would pay money to partner with influencers for something which appears relatively simple,” she says. “But it takes time and effort, talent, passion and commitment.”\u0026nbspAnd even the thorny issue of disclosure –\u0026nbspthat is, whether you should know what someone is being paid to promote –\u0026nbspis a smaller issue than is often supposed, says Svirskis. “Influencers are very compliant of requirements to disclose and are often represented by an influencer agency.”There is tremendous value in influencer marketing. However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls outMost importantly of all, influencers make money for clients. Currently, the average ROI of influencer marketing is £7 back for every £1 spent, says Amelia Neate of Influencer Champions.\u0026nbspSo,\u0026nbspdo you have to be pretty? “It’s definitely not reserved for those with looks,” says Svirskis. “The cheesy smiles are long gone.” It’s about style and tone, he says, and as the industry matures it’s moving beyond lifestyle products like travel, beauty and fashion to finance, automotive –\u0026nbspeven dog food.“There are new influencers emerging every day, in every single vertical,” says Lujani. They’re marshalling themselves into communities: mummy bloggers, healthy eaters, sports fans – why, possibly even news organisations.\u0026nbspWith the maturation of the influencer world comes a shakeout: Influencer 2.0, if you will. Sheer numbers don’t matter so much anymore.\u0026nbspThe smart talk is now about engagement and micro-influencers,\u0026nbspthose with fewer than 100,000 followers and possibly as low as 5,000, but with proper peer recognition.\u0026nbspYouTuber Alfie Deyes came under fire for his recent video, ‘How I lived off £1 for a day’ (YouTubePointlessBlogVlogs)“Data shows that influence by measure of engagement actually increases as the audience size reduces,” says Svirskis. In a hedge-betting strategy, brands now prefer to work with 50 micro-influencers rather than one mega-influencer, and brands are taking influencer management in-house as influencer marketing moves into the mainstream.If children are obese then blame food manufacturers, not ZoellaInvestigation promised into Trump campaign data firmThree arrested after Facebook group raid cannabis field – only to Sexist men who abuse women on Facebook and Twitter are compensating“Most new industries go through periods of turbulence as they form foundations,” says Svirskis, who thinks that many of today’s influencers will become tomorrow’s creative directors and entrepreneurs.He has a point.

In an effort to stay one step ahead of its rivals, Snapchat\u0026nbsphas consistently pioneered new features for its messaging app, such as self-destructing messages, augmented reality capabilities and the Story format.Similar versions of these features have routinely been picked up by Snapchat\u0027s\u0026nbsprivals, with Facebook deploying several of the functionalities to its stable of messaging services and apps.Earlier this year, Snapchat\u0026nbspCEO Evan Spiegel spoke out about allegations that Facebook consistently copied the app\u0027s most popular features, saying he wished the internet giant would also copy his firm\u0027s values.\u0026nbspReferring to the data scandal surrounding Facebook, in which personal information of 87 million users was exploited by a third party for the purpose of political profiling, Mr Spiegel said:\u0026nbspWe would really appreciate it if they copied our data protection practices also.Snapchat above Times Square in New York March 12, 2015 (REUTERSLucas Jackson)Rumours of the unreleased feature come as Snapchat unveils Lens Explorer, a major new feature that allows users to search for thousands of augmented reality Lenses built by people through the\u0026nbspLens Studio app that was launched last year.The messaging app claims to have the world\u0027s most engaged and creative AR platform, with over 70 million Snapchat\u0026nbspusers engaging with them each day.We\u0027re excited by the loyalty, creativity, and variety of experiences we\u0027re seeing from the Lens Studio community to date and are committed to continuing to invest in the platform, making AR creation accessible to anyone and bringing more and more erse experiences to Snapchatters, a spokesperson for the firm said.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I have slipped the surly bonds of EarthAnd danced the skies on laughter-silvered wingsSunward I’ve climbed, and joined the tumbling mirthOf sun-split clouds, — and done a hundred thingsYou have not dreamed of — wheeled and soared and swungHigh in the sunlit silence. Hov’ring there,I’ve chased the shouting wind along, and flungMy eager craft through footless halls of air....Up, up the long, delirious, burning blueI’ve topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace.Where never lark, or even eagle flew —And, while with silent, lifting mind I’ve trodThe high untrespassed sanctity of space,– Put out my hand, and touched the face of God.”You can watch the day’s commemorations unfold live on BBC OneEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Conditions are such that detainees suffer mental health problems which sometimes lead to\u0026nbspsuicide attempts, according to the charity.Thousands of innocent asylum seekers –\u0026nbspoften fleeing war and torture – are detained each year and\u0026nbsplocked up indefinitely\u0026nbspwith no support, the charity warned.In the first intervention of its kind by a major charity, the Red Cross calls for significant reforms including a 28-day limit on detention. It found cases of asylum-seekers being detained for as long as two years and seven months.Home Office separating scores of children from parentsHome Office makes almost £100m profit from children\u0027s citizenship feesHome Office separating scores of children from parentsFive of the 26 detainees interviewed\u0026nbspfor the report had attempted suicide while they were detained, and\u0026nbspjust 25\u0026nbspof them\u0026nbspsaid they had been given no access to mental health\u0026nbspsupport services.Pregnant women continue to be “needlessly detained” in breach of the Home Office’s own guidance –\u0026nbspwith 47 pregnant women detained in the year to June 2017.The charity said the\u0026nbsp“overly onerous and traumatic” experience of attending immigration reporting centres\u0026nbsp– which many are required to do every every two weeks – should be overhauled by banning the practice of detaining people when they turn up.Mike Adamson, chief executive of the British Red Cross, said: “Most of the people in the UK asylum process have fled conflict or persecution to find a place of safety. They have already experienced more trauma and anguish than the rest of us could possibly imagine.“The threat of detention without notice hangs over many people going through the asylum process in the UK.\u0026nbspOur research shows that not knowing whether this week will be the week they are detained again, can make the process of having to report regularly extremely distressing.“This can exacerbate existing mental health issues and mean people never truly feel free.”Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the Red Cross report was a “damning indictment” of how the government treats migrants and refugees.“We know from the Windrush scandal that people are wrongly detained,” she said.\u0026nbsp“Some suffer indefinite detention without legal representation. The government needs to introduce some humanity into the immigration system,” she said.Figures obtained by the Red Cross through freedom of information requests show that of 14,733 asylum seekers who left detention in 2016, nearly half (42 per cent) had been detained for between 29 days and six months, with 10 per cent held for more than four months.The charity recommends that the Home Office allows people to live in their communities while their immigration cases are resolved by replacing the systems of detention and reporting with end-to-end, community-based alternatives.The Home Office told The Independent it had noted the recommendations from the report and was also carefully considering the contents of the Stephen Shaw review into the needs of vulnerable detainees, which is set to be published this month.The warnings come amid mounting criticism of the UK’s immigration detention system, which currently holds around 26,500 people each year and around 2,500 at any given time. Britain is the only EU country without a statutory time limit for the detention of migrants.Recent figures obtained by The Independent revealed at least one person a day needs medical treatment for self-harming in removal centres, while the prisons watchdog described conditions in the centres as “prison-like”.In May the Home Office came under fire\u0026nbspwhen it emerged that proven torture victims were also being detained.Inspectors from HMI Prisons joined growing calls for a time limit, warning of a “deep level of emotional distress” and rising number of suicides, and noting that 50 per cent of detainees were eventually “released back into the community”.UK news in picturesSerena Williams celebrates after winning against Camila Giorgi during their women\u0027s singles quarter-final match on the eighth day of Wimbledon.

It would be a huge economic problem for the UK and also for the EU. I’m not working for that deal, I’m working for a deal.”Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Big Cats: Magical moment rare Iberian lynx take a survival leap                Fear for world\u0027s rarest cat as it faces extinction by dog diseaseThe soft cries of a cub and a distance glimpse of Arina carrying a small bundle confirmed the park\u0026rsquos aspirations of producing a potential addition to the wild population.Douglas Richardson, head of living collections at the park in Kincraig, near Kingussie, explained: \u0026ldquoOur approach to managing this highly threatened cat is globally unique, with the zoo and conservation community watching what we do with a view to following our lead.\u0026ldquoBeing able to send captive-bred Amur leopards back to a part of their historic wild range in Russia would represent an extraordinary conservation success.\u0026ldquoAlthough progress has been made in recent years, habitat loss, poaching and conflict with humans remain threats to the Amur leopard, with only around 100 remaining in the wild.PAThe leopard cub was born at the Highland Wildlife Park\u0026ldquoWe have the only specially designed off-show breeding habitat in the zoo world, which ensures minimal interaction with humans and no contact with our visitors.\u0026ldquoWorking with conservation partners, including ZSL (Zoological Society of London) and conservation authorities in Russia, we hope to introduce cubs born at the park to a region northeast of Vlaostok, in the Russian Far East.An anonymous donation helped fund the building of the park\u0026rsquos leopard breeding complex for Freddo, who comes from Tallinn Zoo in Estonia, and Arina who was born at Twcross Zoo in the Midlands.The authentic habitat was designed solely to breed Amur leopards and has fulfilled its function.PAAn anonymous donation helped fund the park\u0027s leopard breeding complexMr Richardson said: \u0026ldquoInitially we confirmed the birth by observing the behaviour of the mother, as Arina had become increasingly secretive.\u0026ldquoWe have since heard cub vocalisations and one of our keepers caught a fleeting glimpse of Arina moving a cub from a distance.\u0026ldquoAt this early stage we do not know if Arina has had more than one cub and we also need to emphasise that the first few weeks are a vulnerable time in a cub\u0026rsquos life.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoWe have motion sensitive cameras in place and hope these will tell us everything is okay and that we have healthy offspring.\u0026ldquoA cub\u0026rsquos first physical check-up would be when they are around three months old, at which point we would discover their gender.Breeding Amur leopards is only one part of the challenge. Putting a captive bred animal in a landscape with its harsh winters and rugged terrain is a vastly different challenge.Mr Richardson said: \u0026ldquoA phased approach would be needed, with young leopards spending several months acclimatising and sharpening their survival skills in a contained, naturalistic environment within the proposed location of Lazovsky Zapovednik, before being released and monitored.\u0026ldquoIntroducing such a large predator to the wild is incredibly complex but, all being well, we hope this may be possible in the next few years.\u0026ldquoThis is incredibly exciting and again demonstrates the vital role zoos and conservation breeding programmes have in protecting threatened species."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/183x122/985701_1.jpg","title":"michael gove theresa may brexit environment secretary tories cabinet westminster","story":"A spokeswoman at the Department for Environment, Farming and Rural AffairsHowever, less than an hour before the conference was due to begin Mr Gove withdrew from the planned appearance.Confirming the news, a spokeswoman at the Department for Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos nothing sinister in this, he just has other diary commitments.The cancelling of the conference comes just a day after Boris Johnson dramatically failed to turn up to ministerial commitments of his own, before later announcing his resignation in protest at Theresa May\u0026rsquos Brexit negotiating position agreed by the Cabinet at Chequers.Five members of Government, including the Brexit Secretary, have resigned over deal reached at the Cabinet meeting, arguing her position is \u0026ldquotoo soft and the negotiating position suggested the Brexit \u0026ldquodream is dying.

Italy sparks eurozone WARNING as pension chief says economy NOT ready                Meghan Markle and Prince Harry set to BOOST Irish tourism economyThe National Institute of Economic and Social Research said the figures pointed to continued growth in the months ahead.Its head of UK macroeconomic forecasting, Amit Kara, said: The economy is showing clear signs of recovering from the unexpected slowdown in the first quarter.Overall though, we continue to expect the economy to grow broadly in line with its potential in the second and third quarters and not by enough to compensate for the slowdown in the first quarter.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the upturn in May was just strong enough to tip the balance in favour of an August interest rate rise -\u0026nbsp provided the Government doesn\u0027t implode before then.The Bank is widely expected to raise interest rates from 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent at its August 2 meeting.The figures from the Office for National Statistics showed all activity in the economy expanded by 0.3 per cent in May, while output, or Gross Domestic Product, rose 0.2 percent over the three months to May, both in line with economists\u0027 expectations.Howard Archer, of the EY ITEM Club, said the figures echoed recent evidence of consumer activity bouncing back from previous weather-related disruption.Given signs of increased momentum, we are confident that the economy expanded by 0.4 percent in Quarter 2,\u0026nbsp with services growth on course to run at a six-quarter high, he said.This would be a decent uplift on the 0.2 percent rise in GDP recorded in the previous three months, although disappointingly not suggestive of the economy recouping any of the activity lost to bad weather and other erratic factors in Q1.Head of National Accounts at the ONS, Rob Kent-Smith said: The report shows a mixed picture of the UK economy with modest growth driven by the services sector, partly offset by falling construction and industrial output.Retailing, computer programming and legal services all performed strongly in the three months to May while house-building and manufacturing both contracted.Services, in particular, grew robustly in May with retailers enjoying a double boost from the warm weather and the royal wedding. Construction also saw a return to growth after a weak couple of months.Royal wedding highlights: The best photos of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s wedding day.

Here are the candidates most likely to take over, with odds from Ladbrokes.The Home Secretary is currently the favourite to replace Mrs May if her leadership crumbles.Mr Javid was appointed Home Secretary in the wake of the Windrush scandal and the resignation of Amber Rudd.A known eurosceptic, Mr Javid ended up backing Remain during the EU referendum but is popular amongst the Tory parliamentary party.The MP for Bromsgrove in Worcestershire is a former managing director from Deutsche Bank.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Latin-fluent millionaire financier and MP for North East Somerset, has emerged as the leading Brexiteer on the backbenches.He has also has garnered a surprise following among many young Tories - including Jungle Queen Georgia Toffolo, who called him a sex god.Devout Catholic Rees-Mogg has made no secret of his socially conservative views, including being anti-abortion and against gay marriage.His plummy tones, double-breasted suits and traditional manner have earned him the nickname The Honourable Member for the Nineteenth Century.Jeremy Corbyn has emerged as the favourite among most bookies as the nations likely next PM.The Labour leader has had to fight constant opposition from his own MPs including a leadership contest after just a year.But the party has swung behind him after a much stronger than expected 2017 general election when Labour picked up 30 seats and Mrs May lost her majority.Despite a study showed the fabled youthquake of support from younger voters did not happen, he is enjoying strong support in opinion polls.He will be hoping Tory infighting over Europe leads to another election, which he has boasted he would win.Environment secretary has achieved a remarkable turnaround since knifing Boris Johnson.His support among party members dropped through the floor and it seemed his chances were gone forever.But Mr Gove, who played a key role in the 2016 EU referendum, has rebranded himself as an ecowarrior and green campaigner as Environment Secretary.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is still a hugely popular figure among Tory grassroots and the general public.But his support among fellow MPs seems to have evaporated in the EU referendum fallout.Mr Johnson infuriated David Cameron by using his huge public profile to campaign for Leave.His own leadership bid in 2016 was scuppered by his friend Michael Gove, severely damaging his electoral brand.BoJo has repeatedly pledged his support to Mrs May but has also angered Cabinet colleagues by trying to hijack Brexit talks and demanding extra cash for the NHS.His ambitions for the top job are well known and he is a proven winner, having been elected twice as Mayor of London in a city that heavily favours Labour.Now Foreign Secretary, Mr Hunt is the longest-serving Health Secretary in British history.He left the Department of Health after securing a £20bn funding increase for the NHS.Mr Hunt is known to have leadership aspirations and although he campaigned for Remain during the referendum he has since changed his mind and said he would now vote to Leave because of the arrogance of the EU.Thought an unlikely candidate at the time, the Brexit campaigner reached the final two of the 2016 leadership contest.She withdrew over ill-judged remarks about Theresa Mays childlessness.She is now Leader of the House, and survived in post despite reports Mrs May was planning to cut dead wood in her January reshuffle.Mrs Leadsom had a role in the downfall of Sir Michael Fallon after she accused him of lewd sexual comments.The new Brexit secretary is now in the running after taking Davis vacant spot.He played a prominent role in the Leave campaign and previously served as a Justice minister too.Before he went into politics he was a lawyer, working on EU and World Trade Organisation Law.His appointment has been welcomed by other Leave-backing MPs.But Labour MPs have been circulating a blog-post he wrote back in 2011 where he called for an end to feminist bigotry and said that men were getting a raw deal after new equality legislation.At one time, Ms Rudd was a leading contender to replace the PM but her odds have lengthened significantly following the Windrush scandal and her resignation after misleading Parliament over immigration targets.She has returned to the backbenches after being forced to resign as Home Secretary and is likely to push for a softer Brexit along with other former Cabinet members like Nicky Morgan and Justine Greening.Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond could make a bid for Number 10 after keeping a low profile during the general election.Mr Hammond is seen by supporters as a steady hand, but critics accuse him of trying to kibosh a clean-break Brexit by steering the PM towards keeping close ties.He is seen as one of the leading campaigners for a soft Brexit which often puts him at odds with Brexiteers like Liam Fox and David Davis.Mrs May was humiliated when her snap election backfired last June, costing the party its Commons majority.She also endured a series of mishaps during Octobers Tory Party conference and the fallout of the Pestminster scandal.A survey of Tory members in July showed more than 70 per cent want the PM to remain in post, but that fell to just 26 per cent in February 2018.If Mrs May was to resign there would be likely be a Tory leadership campaign, with the winner crowned PM.Alternatively, Mrs May could lose a vote of confidence, leading to the government falling.In theory, the Queen could ask the Labour leader to form a minority government, but the numbers in the Commons would make it impossible for him to govern.In this scenario, there could well be a fresh General Election with both major parties trying to secure a parliamentary majority.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Signalling that the UK might stay in a Customs Union was another enormous error.Downing Street has consistently left unchallenged the scare tactics of professional Remainers — big businesses seeking ongoing EU protection, Brussels-funded think tanks and member states wanting UK cash.The Irish land border, for instance, already copes with different currencies, duties and other tax rates.Outside the Customs Union there is no need for physical hard border posts that might inflame sectarian sensitivities — as confirmed by the head of HMRC, his Irish equivalent and a study published by the European Parliament.Instead of explaining these realities, and arguing Britain’s corner, Mrs May has allowed Irish border falsehoods to warp her entire Brexit strategy.Roberto Azevedo insisted trading with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules was “perfectly manageable”.She has similarly failed to counter claims it would be disastrous to leave the EU with no free trade agreement, using World Trade Organisation rules instead.Again, this is nonsense. Britain already conducts most of its trade outside the EU, largely under WTO rules.“It is not the end of the world if UK-EU trade is on the basis of WTO rules”, WTO director general Roberto Azevedo told me. “It’s ­perfectly manageable.”That’s a vital insight because, unless no deal is seen as a viable option, the UK’s negotiating hand is seriously undermined — with Britain then forced to accept whatever trade deal the EU offers as March 2019 nears.The Government should have been making determined and very visible preparations for no deal.The irony is that, behind the scenes, there has been considerable work.Last week the National Audit Office concluded that an HMRC upgrade that was happening anyway means ­Britain’s customs service should be ready to cope with no deal from January 2019.Instead of pursuing such rational strategies, Mrs May now wants the UK, in effect, to stay in the Single Market for goods, while facing greater restrictions on trade in services.This is totally lopsided — Britain is far better at exporting services (we run a £14billion annual surplus with the EU) than goods (which show a £96billion EU deficit).And proposals to solve the Irish border by tracking goods and collecting the EU’s tariff revenues have already been rejected by Brussels.Mrs May should just leave the Single Market and the Customs Union, with no deal if necessary.By presenting absurd ideas, our Mad Hatter Prime Minister appears to hope her people will conclude Brexit is too hard and should be abandoned.If so, she doesn’t understand the country she purports to govern.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mass deportations of illegal immigrants? Jawohl!And don’t mention the #RefugeesWelcome hashtag.What a change of heart. Merkel’s solution to the refugee crisis of 2015 was to dismantle Germany’s borders.No elected politician in modern history has ever acted with such monumental, breath-taking arrogance.Merkel’s grandiose virtue signalling unleashed mass, mostly economic migration that continues to this day.More than a million refugees poured into Germany in 2015 alone. They were almost exclusively young men because the old, the sick and children — the most vulnerable refugees and those most deserving of a helping hand — can’t walk the length of the Balkans.Anyone who had doubts about promoting limitless uncontrolled migration was silenced by Merkel’s smug catchphrase, “Wir schaffen das!” — We can do this!But Germany, and Europe, will pay the price for Angela Merkel’s apocalyptic arrogance long after she is pushing up edelweiss.Merkel’s career is on its knees because she permanently changed Germany without ever consulting the German people to see if her policy of the unmanaged migration of one million-plus young males from a totally different culture was actually WHAT THEY WANTED.Merkel never even thought about the wishes of the German people. We hear a lot about the rise of “populism” everywhere from Trump’s America to the new, vehemently anti-EU coalition government in Italy.But there is no great mystery about the rise of anti- establishment sentiment. For decades haughty politicians have viewed their own people with unbridled, undisguised, unapologetic contempt.Now, all over the Western world, they are paying the price.Theresa May should carefully study the fall of Angela Merkel. Whatever the polls might say, few would weep to see May departing Downing Street.It seems increasingly likely, from what we’re hearing out of Chequers, that this prime minister would far prefer to cuddle up to the crumbling EU empire rather than break free and strike trade deals with the US, Australia, Canada, India and China.But if we can’t trade with the world then it is not a soft Brexit. It is no bloody Brexit at all.Her job is not to soften our departure from the EU to such a degree that it becomes meaningless.Whatever her personal preferences, Theresa May’s job, and the historic role that falls to her now, is to honour the referendum of 2016, the vote we were solemnly promised was final by our former prime minister, David Cameron.It is not complicated. Don’t do a Merkel.Theresa May has to respect democracy and the will of the British people.And if she doesn’t or she can’t, if May betrays the British people, if she castrates or buggers up Brexit, if she tells 17.4million that they are ignorant racist bigots who should never have had a vote in the first place, then we are going to need a new prime minister.In Merkel’s spectacular fall from power there is a lesson for every leader in the Western world, especially Theresa May.You are not our master. You are our servant. You do not know best. And you ignore the will of your people at your peril.THIS World Cup has been a revelation. Who knew we would still be working up a sweat long after Germany, Argentina, Brazil and Spain had flown home?Who knew that England could win a penalty shoot-out in a World Cup? Then cruise through a quarter-final?And who knew England could only ever really succeed again – and true success means having a team that we love and take pride in – if we returned to having English managers? All jaw-dropping stuff.Now Alicia Aylies – former Miss France and the girlfriend of France’s fleet-footed Kylian Mbappe – proudly poses in a zippy bralet.Seriously, who had ever heard of the zippy bralet until Russia 2018? The shocks just keep on coming.FOR two weeks every year, the British go crazy about tennis.The Australian Open, Roland-Garros in France and the US Open hardly merit a second glance from the British public but Wimbledon is an essential part of our calendar.Yet this year our attention has been distracted by another sporting event in a distant land. The men’s singles final will overlap with the World Cup Final.But quite frankly, who cares?This year we are lukewarm on Wimbledon.So you had to feel for British wildcard Katie Boulter, knocked out in the second round.There is still plenty of time for Henman Hill or Murray Mound to become Boulter’s Bulge or Katie’s Cusp.LONDON Mayor Sadiq Khan is allowing a Donald Trump blimp to float above London during the President’s visit to the UK.No news yet on if Khan has plans to do anything about the gun, knife and acid epidemic on the streets of London.With well over 1,000 stabbings this year, more than fifty of them fatal, crime in London is out of control.But at least we have that Trump balloon, Sadiq.DIEGO MARADONA was pictured grinning happily in an XXL Colombia shirt before their match with England but was apoplectic in defeat.“You have to denounce this,” fumed Maradona.“As the captain of legends, I have to tell Infantino (Fifa President) this cannot be left like this.“This is a fatal mistake for the whole country.”I’m sure it all sounds much better in translation.But you get the gist – “Our headbutting boys were robbed”.Fifa hands Maradona a reported £7,000 to turn up at every match and the fat man issued a grovelling apology for criticising the ref when he reflected that seven grand might possibly slip through his cheating hands.But you can hardly blame Diego Maradona for sticking up for those grappling, nasty, spiteful, penalty-spot-scuffing Colombians.After all, Diego has done his best to single-handedly prop up one of Colombia’s major exports. And that’s nothing to sniff at.YOUNG mum Claire Morrison, 28, was mortified when her six-year-old daughter Eve took her vibrator to school for show-and-tell because Eve thought it was a particularly interesting looking pen.Some parents might prefer to keep quiet about this mishap, but Claire has gone on Facebook to tell the “hilarious” story.“She just said it was her funny pink pen,” chuckles Claire, a hairdresser from Dundee. “Then she said, ‘It must talk because it needs batteries’. So her stepdad and I laughed that off and we have safely stored it away.”It has now been shared 6,000 times.The story. Not the vibrator. Obviously. That wouldn’t be very hygienic.WE can all understand why David and Victoria Beckham would want to put on a public display of loving solidarity on their wedding anniversary.But I can’t help wondering, does Victoria really need to tell David “I love you so much” via her Instagram account and its 21.3million followers? It seems so extravagantly public.Couldn’t she just give him a card?AFTER careful consideration, MEPs in the European Parliament have voted to keep their £3,900-a-month taxpayer-funded (and tax-free) expenses a secret.Blow me down. Nobody saw that one coming.The generous expenses, known as the general expenditure allowance, or GEA, are paid as a lump sum into the MEPs salary, with no records kept, no receipts required and no questions asked. MEPs can spend it all on prostitutes and Ferrero Rocher chocolates if they want.Nobody cares.The GEA costs around £35million a year.And our corrupt continental cousins wonder why we’re leaving.DAVID Cameron received £800,000 to write his memoirs, which have been unexpectedly delayed until next year.Cameron should tell us why he made it legally binding for this country to spend £13billion a year on foreign aid, why he bombed Libya into the failed state it is today and how he blew £9million of public money on his pro-EU leaflet. And still lost!It also transpires that it was Cameron who begged Barack Obama to say, “The UK is going to be in the back of the queue,” if we dared to leave the EU.You shouldn’t be writing your memoirs, Mr Cameron.You should be writing us a letter of apology.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Of course, our security interests don’t begin and end at our borders, or even at the edge of Europe.Whether it’s Russia, Syria, Afghanistan or beyond, threats continue to emerge and develop around the world.After we leave the EU we will be free to pursue a truly independent foreign policy but that does not mean we will isolate ourselves from our neighbours.Under our proposals, we will continue to consult and co-operate with our EU partners on global issues.We will work with the EU on sanctions like those recently imposed on Russia, including co-ordinating them where it’s in our interests to do so.Our joint work on defence capability and space will continue. And we will decide where our armed forces and foreign aid could be used alongside the EU.Brexit has never been about turning our backs on Europe, pulling down the shutters and keeping ourselves to ourselves.Since well before the EU existed we have traded with and fought alongside allies around the world, and that won’t end when we leave next March.There’s still a lot of negotiating to be done.

And we’re only at the start of what will be no doubt stormy negotiations for months to come.There remain serious questions about not just the compromise that Theresa May has forced on her Cabinet but on the final deal she plans to sign with Brussels.One, does it genuinely give us the ability to sign free trade deals across the rest of the world, strengthening our links with emerging markets and with the Commonwealth?Two, does it genuinely end freedom of movement, or does the woolly language in Downing Street’s statement still give people the chance to come here on the off-chance they might find a job?Three, can a future Government genuinely seek to diverge further away from the EU in certain areas without Brussels blowing the whole deal up, or charging us a king’s ransom to do so?If the answer to any of those is no, then the Prime Minister will never be forgiven.Not by her party and, as we report today, not by the public either.IT is astonishing that £13,000 of taxpayers’ cash has been dished out to allow a man serving life for murder to indulge his musical passions by staging a rock opera in jail.That’s money taken from the pockets of working families who have to scrimp and save because the taxman milks them at the petrol pump, the checkout till and in their paycheque.Why did the Arts Council think it appropriate to give the fruits of their labour to a monster like Graham Coutts?The law-abiding public deserve so much better.ENGLAND in a World Cup semi-final.

It is a White Flag.We will have a “Common Rule Book” — written by the EU and imposed by the European Court of Justice.These rules will torpedo any trade deal outside the EU. Immigration continues under a scheme which by any other name means free movement.This is not even Brexit In Name Only. It is zombie EU membership — and the UK is the zombie with no say in rule-making and paying through the nose for rule-taking.Of course, we need to be realistic. Compromises are inevitable since we made no plans for No Deal.Thanks to Mrs May’s election horror, the sums do not add up for Brexit. Remainers rule in the Tory Party, the House of Commons and the Lords.Without a heavyweight leader, Brexit Tories know they cannot raise the numbers to oust Mrs May. A failed challenge would only boost her new-found confidence and authority.Michael Gove and others argue a future Brexit Prime Minister — Mr Gove, for instance — could finish the job once we are legally Out.In fact, Britain tends to keep its treaty ­promises.We can’t even count on EU bully Michel Barnier to stir up a revolt. He and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will probably accept Mrs May’s deal, with a few tweaks, because they are effectively its co-authors.The Rule Book will keep us in line — no ­separate trade deals, no sovereign control over our borders, no escaping the ECJ.Brexit Cabinet ministers must accept some of the blame. They failed to force Mrs May when they had a chance to prepare for a No Deal Brexit. That failure instantly handed victory to the Remainers and to Brussels.Should we one day choose to make a clean break, we will face harsh “consequences” — what Boris vividly calls “punishment beatings”.But the biggest punishment beating will come from voters.If the Tories don’t care about the 17.4million who want Brexit, they will be made to care.Constitutional lawyer Martin Howe, a Tory QC, warns we are entering “a worst-of-all-worlds black hole Brexit where Britain is stuck ­permanently as a vassal state.”The fragile Tory lead over Labour has just evaporated. Almost 40 per cent of voters think the PM has betrayed the 2016 referendum result.Tories might not switch directly to Labour, but they won’t forget.

He wore the uniform of a Squadron Leader in the RAF Regiment at todays centenary event.Earlier today, more than 2,200 people packed Westminster Abbey for the service, with dignitaries including Prime Minister Theresa May, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, Carol Vorderman and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn attending.Once again, Prince Philip missed the event, having stepped down from public engagements last year.But the Queen, who turned 92 in April, is showing no signs of slowing down.She appeared cheerful as she greeted officials at this mornings service, wearing a royal blue silk coat with a turquoise collar over a dress in the same colour, both by Angela Kelly, with a matching hat and a diamond star brooch.Its been a busy week for the monarch, who was even forced to miss her great grandsons christening yesterday as she was travelling back from Norfolk.Instead, the large brooch signifies a huge honour, usually bestowed only on Air Cadets themselves.The brooch is said to be the highest honour that a female cadet can achieve.The Duchess of Cambridge had been gifted the beautiful diamond and ruby piece as a gift from the RAF when she became an Honorary Air Commandant in 2015.And the Queen is also set to meet US President Donald Trump later this week.She last week attended a number of events as part of her visit to her official residence in Holyrood Palace, Edinburgh.The Duke of Cambridge is the fourth successive generation of the monarchy to become an RAF pilot.He received his RAF wings from his father The Prince of Wales at RAF Cranwell in April 2008 after completing an intensive 12 week flying course.Prince Harry was awarded the rank of Squadron Leader in the RAF in May this year.He was also made Lieutenant Commander of the Royal Navy at the same time, and a Major in the British Army.Air-Vice Marshal Gerry Mayhew, the air officer commanding No 1 group and the senior responsible officer for the flypast, said the day would be the centrepiece of celebrations to mark the RAFs centenary year.He told the Press Association: It is the high point for the capital, Her Majesty the Queen and the royal family.And it is a great opportunity to look back and really celebrate our past, but to look forward is a really important thing for us as we look to the next 100 years.The display took more than 11 months to plan.The head of the RAF Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Hillier told the Press Association: It is a tremendous coming together of a whole range of RAF capabilities, and a celebration of the quality of our people.It is that connection between the Royal Air Force and her Majesty the Queen."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000413105751.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"nato plans borderless military schengen agreement europe russia","story":"They will slash red tape in order to create a type of military-only Schengen zone, ending current border crossing waiting times that can reach 40 days.According to The Times, the plan has been put forth by The Netherlands and is expected to be approved at the Nato summit in Brussels this week.Ank Bijleveld, the Dutch defence minister, told The Times that enabling Nato troops to move more freely across borders would help show that Nato was improving its ability to deter threats.The current proposal, if approved, will see the waiting times from when military forces request clearance to cross a border and when they actually are able to slashed from 40 days to five.Bijleveld hopes this will eventually become a military Schengen with complete freedom of movement for Nato forces.She added: It will be the next step but it is quite difficult.Juri Luik, the Estonian defence minister, told the paper: One has to have certainty that your echelons of tanks won’t be standing at the border of another ally just to get the clearance.I hope we can sign the mobility pledge . . .

We also need to ensure that roads and bridges are strong enough to take our largest vehicles, and that rail networks are equipped for the rapid deployment of tanks and heavy equipment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000419364621.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"plane giant airbus calls on brussels to scrap hardline brexit approach and accept theresa mays chequers plan","story":"The aircraft giant called on Michel Barnier and EU capitals to pursue a pragmatic and fair deal with the UK.Its boss Tom Enders told business leaders he was more optimistic about an agreement being struck following last weeks Chequers breakthrough.Speaking at the German-British Chambers of Commerce, he said: The Chequers statement appears to show the Government are going in the right direction.We are not shy to request that Brussels and our other home countries are similarly pragmatic and fair.”Airbus caused uproar last month when bosses warned the company would pull out of Britain in the event of a No Deal Brexit.Ministers furiously accused the manufacturer of making threats against the UK and said the warning was “completely inappropriate”.Mr Enders intervention will be seen as an attempt to redress the balance and show the company is not taking sides in the negotiations.The company has also been intensely lobbying both the EU Commission and the 27 Member States to ensure a good trade deal is done.Leading German MEP Hans-Olaf Henkel, former head of the Federation of German Industries, said it was time for Brussels to reciprocate the UKs offer.He told The Sun: It seems only logical that the closer the relationship remains, the less the damage will be for British and European businesses and for the jobs and wealth of its citizens.It is now up to the EU to accommodate demands for British industry and banks to admit that what is good for British business is also good for their continental counterparts.Dr Ulrich Hoppe, director-general of the German-British Chamber of Commerce, added that businesses had welcomed the Governments new plan.He told The Sun: We welcome that the British government has developed a unified approach for the negotiations on the future relationship between the EU and the UK.Such a unified position will allow for constructive negotiations in the coming months and years.Theresa May has warned Eurocrats it is time to get serious in the talks after the Cabinet agreed a proposal to closely align with the EU on goods regulations.The plan sparked the resignations of Brexit chief David Davis and foreign secretary Boris Johnson who said they could not support such a soft exit."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000419391490.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"parasitic worm schistosomiasis lays eggs human organs europe","story":"And schistosomiasis - also known as snail fever - could be set to invade Europes shores.Around 25-30% of humans are currently infected with at least one parasitic worm species, writes Karl Hoffmann, Professor of Parasitology at Aberystwyth University, for The Conversation.The diseases they cause can be devastating.Worm infections can lead to diverse and chronic conditions such as scarring of the eyes and blindness, swelling of extremities and immobility, blockage of digestion and malnutrition, anaemia and tiredness.They can also increase an individual’s risk of developing cancer and AIDS.Schistosomiasis currently affects hundreds of millions of people each year, causing thousands of deaths.Caused by schistosome flatworms, the infection occurs when people come into contact with a type of freshwater snail that produces the worms.These worms then penetrate the skin and live in the blood vessels surrounding the intestines or bladder of the individual.When the eggs of these flatworms become trapped in human organs, they can cause inflammation, blindness, scarring, anaemia and ultimately, death.Any eggs that make it into the digestive system will be released when the carrier defecates or urinates. If these then reach fresh water, they can hatch and the cycle begins again.While Schistosomiasis was previously linked to impoverished parts of South America, sub-Saharan Africa where water hygiene is limited, recent outbreaks were reported on the Mediterranean.In 2014,  six people were infected after swimming in the Cavu river, in Corsica.And, according to Professor Hoffmann, global travel and climate change could mean we see parasitic worms continuing to move into parts of Europe and North America.The long-term consequences of increased parasitic worm distributions are difficult to predict, but the harm that infection causes highlights the need for developing control strategies that can mitigate this 21st-century threat to global health.Hoffman and his team are looking into ways to treat and prevent the spread of  parasitic diseases.We’re not at the stage of drug development, but we hope that learning more about the disruption of these proteins could ultimately save lives across the world, he wrote.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

tiny indian ocean islands","story":"Only 400 members of the Jarawa tribe remain on the Andaman Islands, in the Indian Ocean, and its feared they could be wiped out in the next ten years.The greatest threat to their existence is a highway which cuts straight through their ancestral home, according to charity Survival International.The road brings tourists to the territory who are accused of treating the Jarawa like animals in a safari park.Meanwhile poachers are believed to enter the rich forests of the reclusive islands and hunt the game the tribe needs to survive.This is one of the many reasons the Jarawa are hostile towards outsiders, having lived in harmony with the land for so many generations.The nomadic tribespeople are master hunters who trap pigs, lizards and turtles with a specially made Jarawa bow.Being an island-dwelling tribe, food sources in the ocean are vital to their survival and men often catch fish in the shallows.They are also understood to love fruit and honey, extracting it from hives by using special plant extracts to calm the bees.They are said to have detailed knowledge of more than 150 plant and 350 animal species on the island.The Jarawa also have reputations as as warriors and uncompromising defenders of their territory.They lived through both British colonisation in the 19th century and then Japanese occupation later on.In 1998, a few Jarawa started to emerge from their forest for the first time without their bows and arrows to visit other settlements.But in 1990 local authorities revealed a long-term master plan to settle them in two villages with an economy based on fishery.The plan went as far as to suggest what style of clothes the Jarawa should now wear.Forced settlement had been fatal for other tribes in the Andaman Islands, according to Survival International.Following a passionate campaign by Survival and other Indian organisations, the resettlement plan was abandoned in the early 2000s."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000419386619.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"princess charlotte sticks her tongue out as prince george waves to

choice of colour was also seen as a tribute to her grandmother-in-law who wore green on her first trip to Ireland too.Harry and Meghan touched down in a private chartered jet at Dublin Airport for their first official overseas tour as a married couple.The trip is the latest in a series of foreign royal visits to EU member states in the wake of Brexit, with the soft diplomacy jaunt expected to strengthen relationships with countries as Britain breaks away from the EU.The two-day trip will include a look at a Gaelic sports festival and an exhibit about the Irish famine, and will allow the couple to celebrate Ireland, its culture and its people.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were warmly welcomed by the Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar as they arrived at Dublins Government Buildings - the Irish equivalent of 10 Downing Street.On arrival, the happy couple were shown a plaque laid by Harrys great, great, great grandfather King Edward VII in 1904.The pair were shown a inside where they viewed a stained glassed window representing the four provinces of Ireland - Leinster, Munster, Connaught and Ulster- which prompted a quick chat about the rugby.Former sports minister Mr Varadkar asked rugby fan Harry if he had watched the England versus Ireland game to which he replied: Which one?”The couple turned to wave at large crowds who had gathered behind a rope in a sealed off corridor to catch a coveted glimpse.They were then taken to Mr Varadkars private offices where they were introduced to a number of employees including 18-year-old intern Tabitha Owen, from London, who is on a short summer secondment before starting a PPE degree at Oxford in September.Despite being the newest member of the Royal household, Meghan seemed at ease with the agenda and remained her husband, it was: Time to sign the visitors book.After briefly discussing who should sign first Harry picked up the fountain pen.Signing simply Harry, the Duke joked: I never sign big enough. Then when Meghan - a former calligrapher - signed her name with a flourish, he added: Yours is much nicer than mine.The trip to Dublin is not the first time the Duke and Duchess have been away since their May 19 wedding, which fused tradition with modernity and diversity.The couple managed to slip away unnoticed for their honeymoon, of which the destination continues to remain a mystery.Just hours before setting off for Ireland, the couple stood on the Buckingham Palace balcony alongside the Monarch and other members of the Royal household for the RAF centenary celebrations.Meghan stood regally next to the 92-year-old Queen, as the newest Royal witnessed the biggest flypast in recent memory.The Royal Family this afternoon gathered on the famous balcony to watch as 100 aircraft took to the skies for the celebrations.The Queen particularly seemed delighted with the air show, smiling and clapping as the array of aircrafts, including Red Arrows and Hercules, flew over the palace."},{"url":null,"title":"the big singalong flop","story":"Instead, it’s left to the commercial broadcaster and poor old Tony Hadley, reaching something close to climax, to sing a hymn of praise to this much-neglected national treasure.At which point, I think it’s probably time to drop the laboured sarcasm, because this next event may have been the point the cult of the NHS met its Waterloo.The Big Singalong Live, from Abbey Road Studios, where the disclaimers were heavier than Wednesday night’s rain as host Sara Cox quickly established: “This was not our idea, was it, Ashley (Banjo)?”“No, no it wasn’t.”The buck was being passed very much in the direction of the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS choir, who had come up with the perfectly ­reasonable idea of breaking television’s singalong record of 6,904 people, with a live version of The Beatles’ song With A Little Help From My Friends.Tireless and talented NHS heroes they may be, but for this thing to fly someone also clearly felt the process required some famous names to get on board.Normally, of course, this is the point when the public realises, “Ah, so it isn’t about us or the NHS at all. It’s about celebrities improving their image.”Oh, but what record-breaking names they’d assembled.Robbie, Adele, Elton, Ed Sheeran, Coldplay and Stormzy, were just a few of those who didn’t attend.Blue, Coleen Nolan, Amber Davies, from last year’s Love Island, UB40, Kimberley Walsh and Tony Hadley, on the other hand, were all involved, as was JLS’s Aston Merrygold, right, who said, on behalf of the NHS, he was: “Happy to clear my diary.”So we thank him and whoever covered the shift at Domino’s.Job demarcation, though, among the celebs, was a bit vague. A few just seemed to have backing track duties, like Kimberley Walsh who was given the line “What would you do if I sang out of tune?” (IF?)Some were enrolled for the full, record-breaking, Abbey Road finale, while others went on recruitment drives at UK hospitals, where Tony unearthed “the singing ambulanceman”, and Sara set her sights on Debbie “who’s pouring custard on a spotted Dick” — in the staff canteen, rather than the Infectious Diseases Unit.Eulogies to the great NHS god, though, were compulsory and delivered with a glassy-eyed, lip-quivering intensity that has become a very familiar sight these past few months.Good intentions, as we know, though, pave the road to hell. And so it proved with Wednesday’s Big Singalong Live, which kicked off with a parp of a klaxon, from Ashley, and Sara screaming: “Can we now please break that record.”Perhaps we can put what followed down to the swirling p***storm, in North London, or the lack of practice time — they only had six weeks — but, dear Lord in heaven — Russell Crowe didn’t unleash this much hell in Gladiator.Missed cues, frozen screens, flat voices, Tony Hadley giving it the big ’un, on the Abbey Road zebra crossing, with his “woh-oh ohhhs”.Seven thousand drunk Millwall fans chanting: “You’re going home in a London ambulance” could not have been much less unco-ordinated, but would undoubtedly have delivered an equally powerful message about the NHS.Salvation, though, was on hand in the form of Sara Cox.“The results are in and . . . (drum roll).“We almost made it, but it looks like the weather may have rained on our parade. We didn’t break the record.” A MASTERCLASS in scheduling, editing and continuity, from Channel 5, on Thursday night, that began with the very chirpy announcement: “We’ll find out What Happened to Josef Fritzl after brand new Nando’s, A PERi PERi Big Success . . . ”Which isn’t the first thing I associate Josef with, to be perfectly honest with you.

He’d go every single day and I’d trot in straight after him.”“Nando’s empire now stretches from Inverness to Plymouth.” All those clueless ITV presenters desperately trying to clamber aboard the football bandwagon, like Amanda Holden, who kicked off last Friday’s This Morning announcing: “We’re all excited about tomorrow’s World Cup final between England and Sweden.”On the strength of which, I’ve booked a once-in-a-lifetime, cheap-as-you-like caving holiday in Thailand.Column returns some time before Qatar 2022FINALLY, some awards for those fine men and women who really have gone above and beyond the call of pundit and commentating duty during this unforgettable World Cup.STICKING HIS NECK OUT AWARD – Lee Dixon: “France are always French.”HISTORIAN OF THE TOURNAMENT – Ally McCoist: “And of course, the October revolution in Russia took place here in 1977.”KING OF LOGIC – Gary Neville: “By avoiding bigger teams, you avoid them.”GLASS HALF EMPTY TROPHY – Sam Matter- face: “Didier Deschamps has lost this game even though he’s won it.”MATHEMATICIAN OF THE TOURNAMENT – Jurgen Klinsmann: “If nine out of ten are called correct, you won’t worry about the other one or two.”RUNNER-UP – Fabian Delph: “A birth only happens once in a lifetime.

The merger will see Leeds-based Asda valued at \u0026#1637.3bn, with the chain\u0027s current US owner Walmart paid \u0026#1633bn in cash and given a 42% stake in the combined business.That structure is expected to see Walmart reduce its stake over a multi-year period and potentially exit the UK grocery industry altogether following a long period in which Asda\u0027s low-price positioning has been eroded by the growth of discounters such as Aldi and Lidl.Executives have said there are no plans to close stores or cut jobs as a consequence of the deal, which is expected to deliver operational savings of \u0026#163500m. The companies have pledged that customers will see benefits including price cuts of up to 10% on many of the products that go into the weekly shop of millions of UK households.Both the Asda and Sainsbury\u0027s brands will be retained.The merger has also attracted the scrutiny of MPs such as Rachel Reeves, the chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy committee.She said when news of the deal emerged: \"The CMA is right to investigate this potential merger between two powerful supermarket players.\"Sky News revealed last September - more than seven months before the Asda merger became public - that Sainsbury\u0027s was hunting a successor to Mr Tyler.Great Portland Estates announced in May that Mr Scicluna would step down next year, while he has also chaired RSA since 2013."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan harry visit ireland live","story":"NewsMeghan Markle and Prince Harry in Ireland: Live updates and news as they tour DublinThe trip to the Irish capital is the couple\u0027s first overseas visit as a married couple\u0026nbspShareByRussell MyersDave BurkeUpdated20:22, 10 JUL 2018News\u0026nbspShareVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay nowPrince Harry and Meghan Markle have arrived in Ireland as they make their first overseas royal visit as a married couple.

But already Jeremy Hunt is doing a better job than Boris Johnson - in one very obvious way. The former Health Secretary was photographed going for a jog this morning, a favourite pastime of mop-haired millionaire Boris. And the difference is striking. While dishevelled Boris used to proudly parade his baggy red shorts, his successor is suited and booted with proper running lycra.  Will it be a symbol of a change of government style? Only time will tell. He even managed a grin as he spotted the photographers in a shot vaguely reminiscent of a 1980s workout video.  Ambitious Tory loyalist Mr Hunt finally earned his promotion weeks after claiming the crown of longest-serving Health Secretary in history. Two years ago Mr Hunt claimed this is likely to be my last big job in politics. But after securing a \u0026pound20.5billion-a-year cash boost for the NHS, he now moves to an even bigger job - and was shown round the Foreign Office last night. It came after Mr Johnson quit in a blaze of glory and spite over the \u0027soft\u0027 Brexit plan Theresa May drew up at her country retreat, Chequers. In a damning resignation letter Mr Johnson claimed the plan will reduce Britain to a colony raising the white flag. He added the Brexit dream is dying.

Labour will lead the debate in the House of Commons chamber after Ms McVey admitted misrepresenting a critical report on her flagship benefit shake-up.  Last week the party demanded Ms McVey resign for either lying or being incompetent following her remarks about Universal Credit. Now a rare censure motion in the Commons will ask MPs to formally say whether they have confidence in the Work and Pensions Secretary. The motion, tabled by Labour, also calls on the government to cut her ministerial salary to zero for four weeks.  Labour claims this would effectively see her sanctioned - just like benefit claimants who turn up late to an appointment. The motion, which has no legal force but would have a political impact, will be debated in the Commons chamber tomorrow. Shadow work and Pensions Secretary Margaret Greenwood said: Universal Credit’s roll out has caused real hardship for many people.   It has pushed people into debt, rent arrears and forced some to rely on foodbanks.      Esther McVey needs to get her act together, pause the roll out and come up with a plan to address the serious flaws in Universal Credit.  Hundreds of thousands of people have had their benefits stopped under the sanctions regime. They include more than 70,000 claimants of sickness benefit ESA between December 2012 and December 2016, 5,739 of whom suffered a sanction for 27 weeks or more.  Defending sanctions in 2013, Ms McVey said: What does a teacher do in a school? A teacher would tell you off, or give you lines and detentions, or whatever it is, but at the same time they have your best interest at heart. They are teaching you, they are educating you, but at the same time they will also have the ability to sanction you. Ms McVey was forced to apologise last week after the National Audit Office criticised her use of facts in a damning open letter. The row erupted after Ms McVey disowned a report by the NAO that warned the six-in-one benefit was poor value for money and forcing people to food banks.

Spain is widely known to be a safe country to enjoy a summer trip to. But while most visits are problem free, recently there have been a few incidents that could cause tourists to worry. Football fans have committed public order offences during the World Cup and there was a recent shooting in Benidorm, reports the Liverpool Echo . Here is a list of things the Government is warning people to look out for to ensure a safe trip. Street crime Holiday goers should be alert to the existence of street crime, especially thieves using distraction techniques. Thieves often work in teams of two or more people and tend to target money and passports.  Don’t carry all your valuables in one place, and remember to keep a photocopy or scanned copy of your passport somewhere safe. Many people have their passports stolen while passing through airports, either on arrival in or departure from Spain. Take extra care to guard passports, money and personal belongings when collecting or checking in luggage at the airport, and while arranging car hire. There has been an increase in the number of thefts from hire cars. Remove all valuables from the vehicle when you park or store items out of sight. In some city centres and resorts, thieves posing as police officers may approach tourists and ask to see their wallets for identification purposes. If this happens to you, establish that the officers are genuine and if necessary show some other form of ID.  Genuine police officers don’t ask to see wallets or purses. In any emergency, call 112. To report a crime, including stolen property and lost or stolen passports, visit the nearest Policia Nacional, regional police (Ertzaintza in the Basque Country, Mossos d’Esquadra in Catalonia, and Policia Foral in Navarre) or Guardia Civil Station to file a police report (denuncia). While in Spain, you can also call a dedicated English-speaking police line on +34 90 210 2112.  World Cup Following public order incidents after televised England matches in Benidorm, fans watching England\u0027s semi final clash with Croatia are being advised to xercise caution around the vicinity of Rinc\u0026oacuten Loix. If you’re in the area, you should follow the instructions and advice of the local authorities strict controls on drinking alcohol in the street are in force and anti-social behaviour may lead to prosecution. Attacks Personal attacks, including sexual assaults, are rare but they do occur, and are often carried out by other British nationals. Be alert to the possibility of ‘date rape’ drugs and other drugs including ‘GHB’ and liquid ecstasy. Buy your own drinks and keep sight of them at all times to make sure they aren’t spiked.  Burglaries There has been an increase in reports of burglaries in areas with holiday accommodation and residential areas in major cities. Make sure your accommodation has adequate security measures in place and lock all doors and windows at night or when you aren’t in.  Driving When driving, be wary of approaches by bogus police officers in plain clothes travelling in unmarked cars. In all traffic-related matters, police officers will be in uniform, and all police officers, including those in plain clothes, carry official ID. Unmarked police vehicles have a flashing electronic sign on the rear window which reads Polic\u0026iacutea (Police) or Guardia Civil (Civil Guard), and normally have blue flashing lights. Genuine police officers will only ask you to show them your documents and will not ask for your bag or wallet/purse. If in any doubt, you should talk through the car window and contact the Civil Guard on 062 or Police on 112 and ask them to confirm that the registration number of the vehicle corresponds to an official police vehicle.  Also be aware of ‘highway pirates’ who target foreign-registered and hire cars, especially those towing caravans. Some will (forcefully) try to make you stop, claiming there is something wrong with your car or that you have damaged theirs. If you decide to stop to check the condition of your/their vehicle, stop in a public area with lights like a service station, and be extremely wary of anyone offering help. Only use officially registered or licensed taxis. Lottery scams There have been reports of lottery scams in Spain. A person receives what appears to be official notification from the Spanish Inland Revenue office (Hacienda) that they’ve won the Spanish lottery and should deposit money in a bank account to receive their winnings. It’s likely to be a scam if you haven’t entered a lottery, you’re asked to pay anything up-front and the contact telephone number is for a mobile phone.  Balcony falls There have been a number of very serious accidents (some fatal) as a result of falls from balconies. Many of these incidents have involved British nationals under the influence of drink or drugs. Your travel insurance may not cover you for incidents that take place while you’re under the influence of drink or drugs. Some local councils will impose fines to those caught behaving irresponsibly on balconies or practising ‘balconing’.  Outdoor activities Take care when swimming in the sea as some beaches, especially around Spanish Islands, may have strong undercurrents. Most of them have a flag system but before swimming, make sure you understand the system and follow any warnings (a red flag means you mustn’t enter the water). You should take extra care if there are no life-guards, flags or signs and follow local advice if jellyfish are present. You should avoid swimming at beaches that are close to rivers and don’t dive into unknown water as hidden rocks or shallow depths can cause serious injury or death. Take care when walking along unmanned beaches close to the water’s edge as some waves can be of an unpredictable size and come in further than expected with strong undertows. Further tips can be found on ABTA’s swim safe pages.  Take extra care when planning a hike or walk to check local weather reports for warnings of extreme heat or cold temperatures. The Catalonia region has started billing negligent climbers, skiers and other adventurers who have to be rescued. Crossing between Spain and Gibraltar Spanish border checks can cause delays when crossing between Spain and Gibraltar. There is no charge to enter or leave Gibraltar. Don’t hand over money if you’re approached by anyone claiming that there is a charge. Road travel Driving rules and customs are different from those in the UK and the accident rate is higher, especially on motorways. You must carry two red warning triangles which should be placed, in the event of an accident or breakdown, in front of and behind the vehicle. You must have a spare wheel and the tools to change it. If at any time you have to leave your vehicle due to an accident or breakdown or while waiting for the arrival of the emergency services, you must wear a reflective vest or you may face a heavy fine.

The nightmare homes are being featured now after the sordid conditions that Catherine Purcell, 68, was kept in became public for the first time.  Shocking photos showing how Ms Purcell lived were part of a trial against her husband and daughter.  The court heard how Catherine died in a cesspit of her own faeces and bodily fluid which chemically destroyed her mattress and bed base, reports the Liverpool Echo.  Husband John Purcell, 72, and daughter Catherine Purcell junior, 35, were cleared of her manslaughter on July 5, at Liverpool Crown Court.  However they were found guilty of neglecting the disabled great-gran, who died while being eaten alive. A High Court judge handed him 18 months in prison, and Catherine Purcell jnr 12 months in prison, both suspended for two years. Graphic images showed the conditions of her home in the Merseyside town of Kirkby. But the Purcell\u0027s rancid property is just one of a number of house of horrors on Merseyside. Here is a look inside six other Merseyside homes and what officials were met with when their doors were opened.  Children forced to live in squalor  These graphic photos reveal a Wirral house of horrors where two children were forced to live in squalor. The alcoholic parents of the children, aged just three and six, were convicted of neglect in 2015 after police uncovered the faeces-littered hovel. The graphic photos reveal soiled linen, pillows and mattresses, dirty dishes piled high in the grubby kitchen and floors covered in rubbish.  Police were appalled after finding a bucket of stale urine in the kitchen, as well as what appeared to be faeces in an upstairs bedroom. Soiled nappies were left lying around the house and stale food had created a haven for germs to breed. The children were taken away from their parents, who cannot be named, after the intervention of social services. Describing the home as filthy and appalling, Judge Dennis Watson, QC, said: This was not something that occurred over night. This was something that developed and became the norm over a period of some months.  Real life Shameless family  This is the home of Ormskirk\u0027s real-life Shameless family who used their bath as a toilet. David Fyles was booted out of his council home in Lea Crescent in 2016 after town hall officers uncovered the house of horrors.  A bath was being used as a makeshift lavatory, because the actual toilet was blocked up with rubbish and mouldy food and piles of rubbish were strewn throughout the three-bedroom home. Doors were smashed off their hinges and neighbours reported how foul smells from the property emanated across the town\u0027s Scott Estate.  Rotting corpse found upstairs  A rotting corpse was discovered in a squalid Merseyside home from hell by health officers who joked: Have you got a dead body upstairs? Police and council officials were called to the house in Knowsley after locals raised concerns because the windows were covered in dead flies. They entered the rancid home to be confronted by an overbearing stench and saw an upstairs doorway surrounded by thousands of the insects.  The body of a man, the son of the homeowners, was found upstairs. Police arrested his sister and his parents on suspicion of concealing a body but charges were never brought. His sister, a mum-of-two, was later convicted of neglect as her two young children frequently stayed at her parents’ hovel home and were“exposed to risk of illness”. The woman was handed an 18-month community order.  Judge Stephen Everett said the punishment would have been sterner had police delays not impeded the case. He added: We will never know in the days or weeks following your brother’s death why nobody did anything.    Terrified dogs left in \u0027unbelievable conditions\u0027   Four dogs, one with a broken leg, were found in a sweltering property in Upton. Woody along with his brother, Duncan, and parents, Patch and Lucy, were found in conditions RSCPA inspector Anthony Joynes described as a house of horrors. The dogs were seized by the RSPCA after concerns were raised over their welfare.    The house had oil heaters turned on full blast, had no carpets, holes in the floor and was cluttered with piles of clothing.   Playground for rats and flies  A Toxteth man hoarded so much junk that his house became a playground for rats and flies. Bill Berry, 55, could not move around his house which was filled to the brim with years of takeaway boxes, newspapers and rubbish. He was eventually unable to get upstairs so ended up sleeping on the sofa. Bill told the ECHO about his ordeal after beating his disorder with help from Liverpool Housing Trust (LHT). He told how his hoarding began after he suffered with depression from being bullied and unhappy at work.   Dogs left to die in agony  Owner Andrew Davies failed to tell anyone her ‘Labradoodle’ cross-breeds, named Koda and Hachi, were in her former property, in Walton, after she moved in with her mum and sister. RSPCA Inspector Helen Smith, called to the house by the landlord on August 8, 2016, was confronted by a grim scene. She found the bodies of the dogs, who were brothers, decomposing in the kitchen of the filthy property – next to empty water bowls.

She\u0027s not actually broken protocol. She\u0027s not getting sent to the Tower.  The furore over Meghan\u0027s stance picked up heat during the Queen\u0027s Young Leaders Awards where she was slammed by royal-watchers for being disrespectful .   Her crime? She abandoned the Duchess Slant favoured by Kate Middleton and Princess Diana, and simply crossed her legs.  One wrote: Duchess of Sussex has her legs crossed wrong. What a disrespect to the queen. All royal ladies cross at the ankles or put both legs off to the side. And another added: Meghan don\u0027t cross your legs Queen doesn\u0027t like that.   Then she reportedly tried to hold her husband\u0027s hand - but that\u0027s a whole other story.  Once again today, all eyes were on the newlywed as she attended the RAF centenary at Westminster Abbey. Sat in a pew next to her husband she slipped her right leg over her left shortly before the service began, but then corrected herself.  But, as it turns out, she\u0027s not doing anything wrong. There\u0027s a dizzying list of protocol points she needs to adhere but, according to an expert, the Duchess slant isn\u0027t one of them.  William Hanson told the Mail Online that although royal women would avoid crossing their legs historically, Meghan hasn\u0027t breached protocol or shown disrespect in doing so now.   He said: Although used to be the custom that ladies (royal or non royal) would never cross their legs, clearly The Duchess of Sussex is finding her own style and comfortable seating position by crossing her legs. Correctly, however, she is not letting there be too much of a gap between her ankles, which can look very ungainly when done by women or men.

But it\u0027s not the first time the former actress has visited the area - and in 2013 she appeared to enjoy quite the trip to promote \u0026pound1.77 drinks. Five years ago, when Meghan and Harry were not even aware of each other\u0027s existence, she was starring in the American drama series, Suits, as character Rachel Zane. And along with pals she visited Dublin\u0027s Dicey\u0027s Garden, which describes itself as the most popular venue this side of town, and boasts drinks for just €2 (\u0026pound1.77). She posted to her fans: Dublin, you are beyond lovely. Having the best day and excited for a night @diceysgarden and @krystlenightclub xoxo.  The now Duchess of Sussex then continued the evening at Krystle nightclub, overlooking Dicey\u0027s Garden. But it\u0027s probably very different to where Meghan will be visiting during this week\u0027s trip. Dicey\u0027s Garden has mixed reviews, as well as a 3.5 rating on Trip Advisor, with 35 per cent rating it \u0027excellent\u0027, while 23 per cent branding it \u0027terrible.\u0027 I would recommend to wear shoes you don’t mind getting ruined as you stick to the floor, one reviewer wrote last month. Another added two weeks ago: The state of bathrooms was horrific, all blocked and staff didn’t seem to care when I complained about it. Most toilets blocked throughout the whole evening despite receptionist’s promises that maintenance staff was on the way.  However, in contrast one woman said: Great place! The place was amazing, great vibe and very nice architecture. Music not too bad either! Ps. They have drinks for 2€ and free entry before 7pm. And back in 2013 Meghan seemed to be in agreement. Following her trip this week the tweet has resurfaced and fans are loving it. Meghan has since deleted her Twitter account, but a number of replies to the original tweet are still on the social media platform, which seemingly verify it as genuine. One fan said: Can we all take a moment for the fact that the last time Meghan Markle was in Dublin she was slinging €2 drinks in Diceys. Never forget. Will Meghan take Harry back to reminisce with a €2 cocktail? Probably not if their packed agenda is anything to go by.  The trip signals the start of their first overseas trip as a married couple, and the Duchess emerged wearing an outfit by her designer of the moment, Givenchy. Waiting to greet the royal couple today were Britain\u0027s Ambassador to Ireland Robin Barnett and his partner Agnieszka Kepka. The newlyweds will get a taste of Irish life and learn more about Ireland\u0027s rich history. They will also attend a summer garden party at the British Ambassador Robin Barnett\u0027s residence, where they will meet people from across Ireland\u0027s arts, sports, military and social enterprise sectors.  Their Royal Highnesses will attend the Gaelic sports festival at the Gaelic Athletic Association\u0027s home of Croke Park and head to Trinity College, where they will see the Book of Kells, one of Ireland\u0027s greatest cultural treasures - not to mention it\u0027s tipped as one of the best things to see and do in Dublin .

She was hosting an event to present the RAF with a new Queen\u0027s Colour, at which she recognised the service\u0027s work. But the weather had other ideas, blowing the flag she was holding around. A video clip taken at Buckingham Palace shows the Queen giving a wry smile as it came back under control.  She paid tribute to the heroism and sacrifices made my RAF service men and women, saying: Tenacity, skill and gallantry have been your hallmarks. I remember the Battle of Britain being fought in the skies above us and we shall never forget the courage and sacrifice of that time. The Queen watched Typhoons form the shape of the number 100 in the sky, before the Red Arrows, the RAF\u0027s aerobatic team, concluded the show, vapour-trailing the red, white and blue of the Union Jack flag.

Both James, from Bishopsteignton, and his uncle swam to the surface and contacted the authorities, reports Devon Live . James said: It was about 5pm yesterday when I was scuba diving off the coast of Teignmouth and came across the device.  I could see it from quite a distance and it was about the same width as my arm span. At first I thought it possibly looked like some sort of container that was covered in rust.

It\u0027s the latest innovation in security being used by police to stop terrorists.  Met police in London used the device for the first time last year to protect the Naval Associations Parade in the capital.

A spokeswoman for the Met Police told the paper the technology would likely become a familiar sight at events that attract large crowds in London”.  Chief Inspector Nick Staley of the Met’s protective security operations unit, said: “This equipment undoubtedly has the potential to save lives and is just one of a number of measures being taken to provide protection to crowds attending major events in London and reassuring businesses, workers and visitors as they go about their daily lives. Since then X-nets have been used at events attracting large crowds across the country.

Members of the royal family attended a special service at Westminster Abbey, before gathering on the Buckingham Palace balcony to watch about 100 jets performing a spectacular flypast. The Queen attended the day along with royals including the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. And throughout the poignant event, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex shared several touching moments. During the service this morning, they were spotted gazing into each others eyes while smiling.

Meghan looked absolutely stunning in a fit-and-flare black bespoke dress by French fashion house Dior today. The bateau style neckline has become a favourite of Meghan’s, ever since she wore the style by Clare Waight Keller for Givenchy for her wedding day in May. Meghan teamed her frock with a matching hat by favourite milliner Stephen Jones, with her brunette locks styled into a sleek low bun. She completed her look with a pair of nude pointed court shoes, a satin clutch bag and her Cartier diamond and white gold earrings.

Using the pseudonym Joe Donor, the 47-year-old from Washington DC has been helping women from the USA, Europe and Argentina fall pregnant for close to a decade. Nine years ago he was rejected from a sperm bank for being too old but has gone on to father masses of children thanks to what he believes is his extra potent sperm. Joe said: I am very successful as a donor because of the exceptional quality of my seed. Not only have many, many women fallen pregnant after a single encounter with me, on at least two separate occasions, I have impregnated multiple women on the same day. Producing large amounts of sperm is why it\u0027s possible for me, some guys may need two or three days to get enough sperm and a large enough volume.  At his busiest Joe has been helping ten women a month, including couples, gay and even transgender women. He believes his sperm\u0027s potency is down to his ability to produce between 5.5 to 6.5ml of the stuff rather than the average amount produced by most men of 1.5 to 5ml. He says this allows him to donate to as many as three women a day. And according to Joe it\u0027s an even split between women requesting he ship his semen and others wanting a live insemination. Either you have it or you don\u0027t, some people claim supplements give them better sperm but it\u0027s not true, you are born with certain amounts and abilities, he said. It makes me feel really good, it\u0027s a great accomplishment, most people here in the US have 1.8 children so to be able to have over 100 is quite an accomplishment. I enjoy helping women get pregnant, it\u0027s something they want to do and we understand what will happen after the pregnancy. Joe insists his services are free apart from shipping costs, or travel fees if a recipient prefers natural or artificial insemination.  Joe describes himself online as Caucasian with blonde hair, blue eyes, 5ft 7 tall and of average build. He claims his most successful month was December 2015 when he fathered seven children. On three occasions two women have conceived on the same day. I\u0027m happy with the work that I do, I don\u0027t feel like it\u0027s an obligation Joe said. For a lot of people out there I may be their last hope. They may not have been able to find men in their lives who they want to start a family with, they may be gay, have fertility problems or any other number of other issues. Outside of his sperm donations Joe is a dad-of-three but says he doesn\u0027t talk to his family or friends about his work. He said: I haven\u0027t told anyone, unfortunately people have two views - if you want to get pregnant they view you as a saviour and if not, they want to crucify you. It\u0027s not something you can bring up, I do have other sperm donor friends and we are pariahs. The world hates us for what we are doing, while we are helping people it goes against a lot of taboos.

There\u0027s a ring to be bought, lots of planning involved and of course the pre-proposal jitters. Will they say yes? Will they think you\u0027ve done a good job? There\u0027s also a lot that can go wrong. And we\u0027re not just talking about rejection. Timing can be messed up, people can interrupt - and as one woman discovered, the ring can get stuck inside you. The story of a woman who wanted to give her boyfriend a \u0027Kinder Surprise\u0027 has been shared in a new book by former junior doctor Adam Kay.   Called This Is Going To Hurt: Confessions Of A Junior Doctor, the book provides a novelisation of Adam\u0027s time on the front line for the NHS .  Nestled among the pages is the bizarre story of a proposal gone horribly wrong. The woman, who for obvious reasons remains anonymous, is said to have decided to take advantage of the leap year tradition, that sees women propose to their partners on February 29. For her \u0027romantic\u0027 proposal, she chose to buy an engagement ring, put it inside a Kinder Egg and then insert it into her vagina. The plan was simple - she would suggest some finger-work to her partner, he would discover it, retrieve it and then she would drop down on one knee.  Equal parts unexpected, disgusting and I suppose, romantic, writes Adam. However what the lady hadn\u0027t anticipated, was that the Kinder Egg would get stuck. The egg had been inserted vertically but later turned horizontal inside her vagina. No amount of shoogling from either of them would get this particular goose to lay her golden egg, explained Adam. He added: Remarkably, she was so keen to maintain the surprise she wouldn\u0027t tell him what she\u0027d done or why.

Because for all the benefits our digitised lives bring us, we\u0027re also only ever a click away from some really, really bizarre - and possibly dangerous - so-called guidance. Take peegasms for example.  Also known as the p**s shivers, this is an example of a harmful trend which should never have seen the light of day.  So what it is a peegasm? It all began when one man asked other women if they\u0027d ever had mini orgasms from peeing after holding it in.   My girlfriend recently told me if she\u0027s had to hold her pee in for a while, when she actually goes to pee, she often has orgasms that she feels all the way up her spine to her head, he explained on Reddit .  If she does \u0027reverse kegels\u0027 while peeing, they\u0027re even more likely to happen. Sounds bizarre, right? Well, this man\u0027s girlfriend is by no means alone in her discovery. I call them the p**s shivers because they’re not quite orgasmic in my opinion but close enough, one woman responded.  Another added: I get something similar, but it’s not exactly an orgasm, just a really, really pleasurable feeling. I can do it by letting go for a split second and holding it in. It feels so good that I start tearing up. Then, when I finally do go pee, I get these delicious full body shivers. Should you try this at home? The answer to this would be a big, fat juicy no. Not unless you really enjoy the sting of a UTI.  This \u0027practice\u0027 would be most unwise, Dr Clare Morrison, GP at MedExpress , told Cosmopolitan .

The family, from Ingolstadt, Germany, have also complained about his body being sent to the same Bangkok hospital that carried out botched reports on the bodies of Hannah Witheridge and David Miller. The pair were murdered on the same island in 2014. Experts across the world slammed the DNA testing done by the hospital at the time - amid claims it was tampered with in order to scapegoat two Burmese workers currently on death row over the killings. Mr Grotsch\u0027s cousin Christina told The Sun the were no explanation for the death of the dad at his home in Mae Haad. She said: He was fit, healthy and happy. We do not trust the authorities in Thailand, especially since there are some oddities.  To date, no autopsy results have been obtained, only vague explanations and conjectures about an alleged deadly bite by a poisonous snake. Or heart and circulatory failure, without further evidence. Christina claimed the family were initially told Mr Grotsch\u0027s body had been returned to the mainland in Surat Thani. But when they checked again it was still in a temple on Koh Tao. They allegedly put pressure on the German Embassy in Bangkok, and eventually the body was moved three days later. They family had wanted forensic scientist Dr Pornthip Rojanasunand to perform the autopsy as she is seen worldwide as a respected independent forensic physician, according to the newspaper.  However, his body was instead taken to the Institute of Forensic Medicine, which is where the bodies of Miss Witheridge and Mr Miller were taken. Wealthy entrepreneur Mr Grotsch had moved to the island two decades ago, but left in 2016. He started another business on the island of Koh Phayam, before returning earlier this year to tie up loose ends. He had recently split from wife and Koh Tao native, Oey, with whom he has a seven-year-old daughter, Bene. Mr Grotsch is the tenth known foreigner to die in suspicious circumstances on the \u0027death island\u0027 in just six years. Below, we look at the previous cases. 2012 Brit Ben Harrington , 32, died on the island after his motorbike apparently crashed into an electricity pylon.  His mother Pat Harrington did not accept the explanation by Thai police and has spent years fighting for information from the Thai authorities about her son\u0027s death, including submitting Freedom of Information requests to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Mrs Harrington said she is suspicious of the explanation and had to fight to prevent his body being quickly cremated: [Thai authorities] wanted to cremate Ben the next day, but I screamed and shouted and it was stopped. I had awful problems getting anyone on the phone at first. 2014 Brits Hannah Witheridge and David Miller were murdered as they walked back to their hotel rooms in September 2014. Hannah, 23, from Hemsby, Norfolk, and David Miller, 24, from Jersey, were found dead on Koh Tao on September 15.  Post-mortem examinations showed that the young backpackers, who had met on the island while staying at the same hotel, both suffered head wounds and that Hannah had been raped. Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were sentenced to death for the killings. But although David\u0027s family called the verdict \u0027justice\u0027, the trial of the two Burmese migrant workers was plagued by accusations of human rights abuses. Nick Pearson , 25, from Derby, was found floating in the sea on New Year\u0027s Day 2014.  His parents believe he was murdered - despite police claims he fell 50ft and drowned. The 25-year-old\u0027s mum Tracey told a documentary about the island she would warn parents not to allow their children to travel to the island. 2015 Christina Annesley , 23, died on the island in January 2015 after apparently mixing antibiotics she was taking for a chest infection with alcohol. But the British holidaymaker\u0027s parents slammed Thai authorities for failing to investigate the death.  Christina, from Orpington, South East London, died shortly after arriving on Koh Tao. Her dad Boyne said a toxicology report was not carried out. Frenchman Dimitri Povse , 29, was found hanged in a bungalow on the island on New Year\u0027s Day 2015 and his death was ruled as suicide despite his hands being tied behind his back. Associate Professor Charnkanit Krittiya Suriyamanee, a criminologist and lecturer at the faculty of social science and humanities of Mahidol University, said he doubted the suicide theory citing some irrelevant evidences, according to Chiangrai Times .  He said that the victim had been drunk to the extent that he was unable to control himself, he would not have been able to tie himself up so tightly that he died of suffocation. He also noted several other odd finds. 2016 Luke Miller, a bricklayer from the Isle of Wight, was found dead in a swimming pool at the Sunset Bar at Sairee Beach on January 8 2016, with an inquest earlier this month finding no evidence he was murdered. He was discovered floating in the water by a member of hotel staff, with his death coming just days after a tragic final Facebook post on New Year\u0027s Eve, in which he said: Can honestly say this new year I am living the dream.  Thai police said a post-mortem examination showed he drowned. But, his sister Maria and the family told the BBC they would not rely on what Thai police said as there was still speculation over the circumstances surrounding the death - and that they had received \u0027different versions\u0027 of what might have happened. 2017 Belgian Elise Dallemagne was found dead and half-eaten by lizards having apparently hanged herself on the island - an explanation rejected by her family. The young backpacker had been living at a yoga and tantra retreat, which neighboured the party island of Koh Phangan, in between travelling round Asia, for two years. She was part of the sect of the Sathya Sai Baba cult movement, and lived with a self-proclaimed guru, and left Koh Phangan on April 17 to return home.  Elise then used a fake name of Elise Dubuis to check into the Triple B Bungalows next to Mae Head Pier on Koh Tao as she travelled via the island on a ferry bound for Chumphon province on her route back to capital Bangkok. But an unexplained fire that evening burned down three bamboo huts - including the one Elise had been staying in. Elise fled 2.5km to through the jungle to Tanote Bay and took a room at the Poseidon Resort where she booked another ticket for Bangkok leaving on April 24. Eight days later when locals living near the island\u0027s idyllic Tanote Bay became suspicious of a monitor lizard going back and fourth into the jungle they discovered Elise\u0027s half-eaten body on May 27 among rocks behind the Tanote Family Bay Resort.

Sara Zagidullina, 17, was attacked by Aleksandra Dulesova and three other young women when they discovered she was seeing a boy identified only as “Igor”, according to police. The shocking ordeal began when the perpetrators broke into Sara\u0027s home, reportedly shaving her head, then forcing her to perform oral sex on them before taking turns urinating on her. After dragging the naked young woman to the bathroom, they allegedly turned the water as hot as possible, inserting the shower hose into her vagina.  Shakira Pellow: \u0027Awful\u0027 final picture of schoolgirl in hospital bed her family want you to see   Police say the ordeal, which lasted for hours, could have killed Sara, who was left in agony on the bathroom floor, while the attackers ransacked her home, stealing money, a laptop and a mobile phone as well as other valuables. Using her last bit of strength, the victim managed to raise the alarm, and was rushed to hospital. There, doctors sadly confirmed that her womb had been badly damaged by the hot water and that she was now sterile.  The incident happened in central Russia\u0027s Perm Krai region in the town of Gubakha after Igor allegedly dumped 17-year-old Aleksandra after she told him she was pregnant. He is then believed to have started a new relationship with Sara, who knew nothing about his past until she was confronted by the angry ex. Aleksandra reportedly warned her victim with the ominous phrase: Leave us alone or I will kill and bury you!  She then gathered her friends Kristina Poyarkova, 16, Maria Sheputaeva, 16, and Anastasia Voronchikhina, 20, allegedly bursting into the victim’s at where they subjected her to the terrifying torture ordeal. Three of the attackers have been arrested and taken into custody, while Aleksandra is under house arrest due to her pregnancy. The four suspects filmed Sara\u0027s torture on their phones and police have found the video, according to reports. All have been charged with sexual abuse and torture of a minor committed by a gang and could face up to 15 years in prison if found guilty.

He was always the same nice lad.“I think that was one of the strengths of the Dundee team that won the championship – we were all good friends. There were no cliques in the dressing-room and none of us let our success go to our heads.“I remember when Alan was at Spurs and I was manager at Hearts, we played them in a friendly. He was a big star, but he was exactly the same as he was when we were at Dens.”“Gillie” scored a club record 169 goals in 190 appearances in dark blue and, after leaving for London in 1964, went on to earn similar legendary status at White Hart Lane, where he formed lethal striking partnerships with Jimmy Greaves and Martin Chivers. None of that came as a surprise to Seith, who rates him as one of the best ever.He said: “Alan was exceptional and a great header of the ball. His timing in the air was the thing and when he jumped he seemed to hang in the air. We knew that if we could get the ball to his head he would score goals.“At Dundee he had a fine partnership with Alan Cousin and he would have been the first to say Alan Cousin’s donkey work was responsible for him scoring as many goals as he did.“With Alan, though, it was not just about his heading, he had two very good feet as well. In fact, I was never sure whether he was left or right-footed.“He had the knack of being in the right place at the right time. He always seems to know where to be, that’s why he scored so many goals.”Former Dundee director and long-time friend, Dave Forbes, also paid tribute. Organiser of a number of events down the years to honour the 1961/62 team, he knew Gillie well.He said: “I knew he wasn’t well and I’m just glad it all seems to have been quite quick and he didn’t suffer for too long.”Particularly after spending 10 years in the limelight at Spurs, where he was dubbed the King of White Hart Lane, Gilzean was famous for valuing his privacy.For a long time after he retired, the native of Coupar Angus did not make many public appearances but, over the past decade or so, was a familiar figure at White Hart Lane on match days and made regular visits back to Dundee.“Gillie was a private man, but he was a gentleman.“I remember when we were organising Dundee’s centenary celebrations he was a big help,” added Forbes.“I am proud, honoured and privileged to have known him as a good friend.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b3f339a3829b-504x564.jpg ","title":"cammy kerr impressed by look of dundee squad as dark blues gear up for betfred cup","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor the most part, the days of footballers spending the early period of pre-season with bellies overhanging their shorts as they battle to get back in shape are long gone.The rigours of the modern game mean, when on their holidays, players have fitness programmes to follow and keep themselves in shape.It means when they report back for work towards the end of June, they’re ready to go and the sight of one of them lagging behind in training is rare.Even so, Dundee defender Cammy Kerr has revealed he’s been surprised just how fit the squad at Dens Park is.That’s been apparent in two pre-season games so far as, despite the usual rustiness when it comes to things like touch, Neil McCann’s men have looked in top condition.As usual, Kerr’s been at the front of the runs in training and breezed through clashes with Brechin and Cowdenbeath.As well as being someone who enjoys a work out, the 22-year-old admits the memory of a disastrous Betfred Cup campaign two years ago has been a factor in the work put in.Back then, boss Paul Hartley took the gamble of using the early games in the competition as part of the pre-season build up. Dundee paid the price for that gamble by failing to get out of a group they had been expected to win comfortably and, ultimately, it was a factor in Hartley losing his job.Under McCann, the policy has been that the Betfred is an important event and it’s first game, not the league kick-off next month, marks the start of the season proper. That’s fine by his vice-captain.“I personally came back feeling really fit and I think as you’ve seen the rest of the boys look really fit as well,” he said.“You can kind of gauge first day back when we do a lot of testing. Everyone is a bit anxious because eyes are on you but this has been the fittest group of boys I’ve seen.“Everyone has a sharpness about them. I don’t know if it’s the modern game and the demands there are on you but everyone has been bang at it.“For me the Betfred two years ago gave me a shock. I remember speaking about it. That season we were straight into the competitive games and you are expected to win them but it doesn’t go that way because that’s football and you have to be ready.“That’s why to get the couple of games we’ve had has been massive and to get away (to Portugal), do some training and have another couple of games is massive as well.”Dundee are now in the Algarve where they’ll do more work and face SC Farense on Tuesday. Kerr’s sure that’ll have them ready for the Betfred tie at Stirling Albion Saturday week.“I enjoy being away. I’ve been to Hungary twice and Austria during pre-season and it’s good for the team.“You get to know the new boys who’ve come because you are together all the time and that’s important. We’re doing two sessions a day, eating meals together and spending time together at night as well.“That’s important because when you have new team-mates you can’t just go out on a pitch and gel right away. It takes work and time.”With the cup games looming large, Kerr feels the time away is also a chance to prepare properly.“We’re back in the middle of next week and then right into the first tie on the Saturday, so we can do a bit of work for that as well as the general stuff we’ve been doing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"crossing for busy dundee road welcomed by locals","story":"\t\t\t\t\tResidents on a busy Dundee street have hailed the decision to install a pedestrian crossing.The project will involve closing Fountainbleau Drive, in the Linlathen area of the city, from Pitkerro Drive to Rowantree Crescent from July 23 for five days.Road safety measures will be put in place and the crossing will be installed.People living near the road backed the plan.Brian Cunningham, 48, a domestic worker, said: “The speed that some people go on the road is scary \u0026#8211 it is a long straight street and that is exactly what the boy racers want.“I think it’s a brilliant idea \u0026#8211 it’s been needed for a long time.”Jane Murray, 48, a support worker who has lived on the street for 24 years, said it was a “great idea”.She said: “The road is really busy. “Sometimes when I am trying to get across with my dog, I can be standing there for 10 minutes.“I definitely back the plan.

I love being able to tell the customer that the owners actually made the gift they are buying.”When it comes to working in retail Hannah says the most important thing is how you communicate with customers.She said: “The whole concept of the shop is to give customers that personal touch.“The most important part of that is how we interact with our customers.“The first thing you learn when you start work in the shop is everything else stops when a customer comes in and they become the most important thing.“We always say the staff in here love a chat but there is nothing better than a customer saying they have had a great experience in your store.“I really enjoying being able to serve someone well as that is what they will go and tell friends and family about and recommend the store to them.“You have to be approachable when working in retail and confident and comfortable speaking to people.“Confidence is something I have had to work on throughout my career, but it is something I would urge anyone interested in retail to work on too.”Although Hannah climbed up the retail ladder through working in several shops, there are many courses on offer in Dundee.Dundee and Angus College offer several in both retail and retail management.These include Introduction to Fashion Retailing where students get hands-on experience working within the college’s gift shop.HNC Retail sees students gaining a broad knowledge of the retail industry and the skills and qualities required for a diverse range of careers.The college also offers HND Retail Management where students have the opportunity to gain work experience managing and promoting the colleges pop-up shop, Tempus.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b434705bb1d3-846x564.jpg ","title":"locals vehemently against plans to withdraw concierge services from dundee multis","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCommunity groups are fighting back against plans to replace caretakers at Dundee’s multis.Hilltown and Lochee residents are calling on Dundee City Council to reconsider plans to centralise the caretakers with a “rapid response” team.Lochee’s Save Our High Street group, Phoenix Residents Group in Whorterbank and the Dundee Pensioners Forum are now set to take to the streets to petition fellow residents – claiming safety is being put at risk.Jayne Kelly, from Save Our High Street, said: “Everybody I have spoken to has been vehemently opposed to it.“For a lot of people, the caretakers are the first point of contact, so we want the council to reconsider this.“There’s a difference between consulting with us and allaying fears on a decision that’s already been made.”The new unit would be based out of Dundee West Housing Office in Lochee and would respond to incidents that are either called in or spotted on council CCTV. At present, caretakers work shifts as late as 3am, monitoring entrances, reporting incidents and assisting residents as required.Lochee councillor Charlie Malone previously shared his concerns about the removal of caretaker staff and wants the issue to be returned to the City Chambers.He said: “I have been contacted by community groups and many residents about fears they have in relation to the proposed centralisation of concierge services. No one has approached me in favour of the move and residents in Lochee and the Hilltown have begun campaigning.“A consultation is being planned which was meant to happen three years ago.“I will be looking to bring this back to the committee so that residents’ voices can be heard in the council chamber.”He added: “I visited an elderly resident in Adamson Court this week who told me without a concierge presence, she might never leave her house again due to safety concerns. Efficiencies can’t be delivered on the backs of the vulnerable.”A spokesman for Dundee City Council said: “Approval to consult with relevant stakeholders on the review of caretaker services was agreed by the council’s housing committee in June 2015. That consultation, which includes trade unions, employees and tenants, is ongoing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sam stanton never experienced so many changes at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSam Stanton has seen a lot of good friends leave Dundee United over the summer but, rather than looking back, the midfielder admits he excited about what lies ahead.One of the few survivors of the major cull that followed another failure to win promotion, he remains very much a part of gaffer Csaba Laszlo’s plans.And that suits the 24-year-old down to the ground.“I’ve never experienced so many changes in a dressing-room before but you just get on with it and look ahead,” said the former Hibs man.“It’s always like that in football and you get used to it after a while. There’s a lot of chopping and changing.“The main thing is all the new boys that have come in are looking good. Obviously, you miss the guys who were here before and have left but that’s just football, it’s a good change.“And I’ve really enjoyed my time here, bar the end of last season, so I’m delighted to still be here and part of things. Hopefully, I can have a good season.”While it’s still early days, Stanton believes there are signs United can make it third time lucky and win promotion this term.He’s been impressed by the quality of his new team-mates and with the way the side appears to be gelling.“At Brechin the other night we came together well and we moved the ball about pretty nicely considering it was the first game.“We are pretty fit and we’re feeling good. Everyone seems to be fitting in well and that was pleasing.“The manager’s brought in a lot of good players, so it’s exciting and we’re looking forward to the season starting.“It was a good start at Brechin and, hopefully, it will get better.”Today the Tangerines were in action in a closed-door friendly at their St Andrews training base and a week today sees the Betfred Cup kick off with a group tie against Arbroath at Tannadice.While the league is the priority, Stanton’s looking forward to that.“It’s only a few weeks until the league starts up and I’m really looking forward to it.“We’ve got the Betfred Cup starting next week and that’s good. Almost all the teams use it as part of their pre-season but we want to do well.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the

opportunity to redeploy to our other store in Inverness, which is less than a mile away,\" she said.It is understood the store will close its doors on July 10 (Tuesday).Stewart Nicol, chief executive of Inverness Chamber of Commerce, recalled the retailer had moved several times in the city centre before settling into the Eastgate unit.\"It\u0027 an undoubted blow to the city centre in that it is closing,\" he said. \"It is good that it is staying in the city but it is that whole debate about out-of-town versus the city centre.\"It is quite clear that all High Streets and even shopping centres are under extreme pressure because of internet shopping and the way people choose to shop. There are consequences of the way we shop.\"I think the challenge is to maintain a city centre which is an attractive place to visit and socialise and purchase things.\"Mr Nicol said \"an awful lot of hard work\" remained.\"It is a hard task but I think if the public and private sector work together we can do that,\" he said. \"We need to maximise all the opportunities that there are and the

store","story":"\u0026nbspTHOUSANDS of customers are being contacted following the sudden closure of an Inverness store specialising in mobility aids ranging from wheelchairs to stairlifts.Ableworld has cited an \"exploding\" glass panel and immigration hurdles for the American franchise owner as the reasons behind the closure of its Highland Mobility (Ableworld Inverness) branch in Harbour Road.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Cheshire-based company, which is the UK\u0027 largest mobility retailer with more than 30 stores, is now making efforts to contact about 3000 customers, pledging no one will lose out on deposits or delivery of orders. It also aims to guarantee that all commitments to suppliers are fulfilled.The Inverness franchise has been held for about the last two years by American Jack Alldredge who is understood to be from Florida.The company\u0027 managing director Mike Williams said Mr Alldredge had hoped to settle in the UK after visiting the country.\"He loved the idea of living here and fell in love with Inverness,\" Mr Williams said.\"But he has had immigration issues. Sometimes we make it difficult for people to invest in this country. It is a shame.\"For the past 18 months, Mr Alldredge has tried to manage the store from America but the shattering of a glass panel in the building \u0026ndash understood to be leased \u0026ndash was the final straw at the beginning of June.\"Fortunately, no one was hurt,\" Mr Williams said.\u0026nbsp\"In our 18-year history, we have never closed a store apart from relocation so it is sad that after the roof \u0026lsquoexploded\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash which was a glass entrance, leaving a very dangerous situation with other panels \u0026ndash Jack decided to call it a day.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMr Williams said he was disappointed for Mr Alldredge as well as the store\u0027 three employees including a manager.As the store was operated as a franchise, Ableworld is not obliged to step in but it is aiming to honour commitments to suppliers and customers.\"Although saddened by the situation, Ableworld will ensure that all suppliers of stock to the company will not lose out and either Highland Mobility (Ableworld Inverness) will settle all accounts or Ableworld UK will satisfy all the suppliers,\" Mr Williams said.\"Also no customer will lose out on their present deposits or product delivery of orders.\"Ableworld will be setting up support networks for past customers of products and writing to customers explaining the situation.\"Too many businesses in our industry and others pull the plug and leave their customers and suppliers high and dry which is something we will not do.\"He also revealed the company was actively looking to open another franchise in the Inverness area.Inverness MP Drew Hendry said the store\u0027 closure would be a great loss to many disabled people. Citing the high-profile case of city guesthouse owners Russell and Ellen Felber who are fighting deportation to America, Mr Hendry said this was another example of how immigration policies were not working.\u0026nbsp\"I am already working with countless other local families facing a similar fate, including the Felbers whose ongoing battle to stay in Inverness is utterly heart-breaking,\" Mr Hendry said.Inverness disability rights campaigner David Sansum said there were few mobility aid suppliers in the city while the next nearest store was about 40 miles away in Forres.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"I\u0026rsquom sure the closure of Ableworld will leave a big gap,\" he said. \"It is shame.\"\u0026nbspIn recent months, there have been a spate of incidents at Inverness retail parks where glass panels have fallen from overhead canopies.In March, Highland Council urged building owners with glazed canopies to check adequate inspection and maintenance arrangements were in place while Inverness South councillor Ken Gowans called for glass panels to be removed from canopies at all the city\u0027 retail parks.Tuesday 10 Jul 2018 8:35

is.Her bones were found in a coffin many were convinced contained Simon Fraser 11th Lord Lovat, the last man to be beheaded in Britain in 1747 for supporting Bonnie Prince Charlie and the Jacobite cause.Although official accounts stated the 80-year-old peer, nicknamed the Old Fox, was buried at the Tower of London, the clan always maintained supporters had intercepted his body and spirited it back to his homeland.But a forensic investigation led by renowned forensic anthropologist Dame Professor Sue Black sent out shockwaves earlier this year when it was discovered the remains were those of an unknown 25-year-old woman plus four others, including a child.They will all be reinterred in the crypt on Thursday, August 23 during a service attended by Lovat Fraser family members and others with an interest in the mausoleum.Writer Sarah Fraser, who married into the clan and wrote an acclaimed biography on the Old Fox entitled The Last Highlander, said the service would have an air of dignity and include prayers for the dead led by Father Maximilian Nwosu of St Mary\u0027 RC Church in Beauly.

But with the finishing touches applied to the new ground, Moorhouse says it’s “great” that their plans have finally come to fruition.He said: “It feels great and that is the overriding feeling – we feel proud of what we’ve managed to achieve.“We feel relieved because we’ve been so long without our own home and that’s not a nice feeling for anybody.“Contrary to popular belief, it costs an absolute fortune not to have your own ground.“I’ve heard so many things about how we’ve managed to save a fortune and invest it in the team and nothing could be further from the truth.“Playing every game away from home is a costly affair but we now have a place we can call home and we’re proud of it. It looks amazing.“Hopefully it allows us to fulfil our ambitions to play in the Scottish League and that’s not going to stop until we get there.“This year we’ll be equally determined and some of the changes to the squad will hopefully reflect the ambitions of the board, the club and the management team.“This is the platform for us to move on from where we are.“The Highland League is a great league to play in and we have a lot of friends in the Highland League, and they will remain friends. But we need to kick on because we’re an ambitious club.”Cove have encountered several problems over the last three years.Moorhouse added: “We’ve had a number of major obstacles. None of them we could see when we started on this journey.“When we closed Allan Park in April 2015 against Fort William, we didn’t think for one minute it would take three years to get in here.“We had initial issues around the sale of the first ground, to do with the bids that came in, and we lost nine months with that process. The next problem was access to the site. We lost a load of time with that and then we had issues with the weather.“But the design team and professional team that we brought on board to do the construction were first class and here we are now.“But we lost about a year and a half and because of that, it costs you extra money.”Now that the new ground has been built Moorhouse also hopes Cove can attract more fans from the area.He said: “You’ve got to feel sorry for our fans. They probably feel like they have been forgotten about and that’s never been the case on our part.“It’s been difficult to cater for them because we have been using other teams’ facilities and they’ve had to travel to every single game.“The guys who followed us through thick and thin I think have enjoyed themselves because the team have kicked on and played well. They’ve seen good football.“Playing in our area, the people who used to watch us at Allan Park will hopefully come back and, at the same time, we’ll want to create a new group of Cove fans because it’s three years since we last played in Cove.“The laddies who used to come and watch and run after the footballs when they were kicked outside the ground, they are grown men now.“Things have moved on in that period of time and we need to capture a new group of Cove fans.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"brushes with greatness for sick children as their art is shown at successful event","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn exhibition showcasing the artistic talents of sick children in Aberdeen has been hailed.Grampian Hospital Art Trust (GHAT) and Belvidere Gallery teamed up to display the art of the young people, who are patients at Royal Aberdeen Children’s Hospital (RACH).Each painting was created during the hospital’s art room sessions – a patient-centred project led by trained artists.The artwork has been on show at the Belvidere Gallery, in Rosemount, since the beginning of June.It is the first time the gallery has worked with the hospital trust, having previously engaged with schools and other organisations over the years.At a special event held on Saturday, their work was celebrated with the children receiving their paintings back framed and a certificate from co-leader of Aberdeen City Council Jenny Laing.Jo Hastie, artroom co-ordinator at the hospital, said they were delighted with how the project had gone.She said: “It was a lovely day, it was so great to see the kids looking happy and pleased with themselves and getting their artwork.“They had a lovely day being spoiled, a lot of them have been through quite a difficult time and it was really nice making a big fuss of them.“For me it was nice to see our artists rewarded for the work that they do.“I loved it, even though it can be quite stressful to organise as you do wonder if anything will go wrong but it is worth all the effort.”Jo thanked the staff at the gallery for all their help during the project.Artroom is designed to give children a respite from medical routines and relax them and boost their self-esteem.GHAT has been running the project for more than 10 years and is based on a model first introduced at Roxburghe House.Mrs Laing said: “It was a lovely event and gave the children and their parents the opportunity to come and see all the hard work that has gone into this.“The Belvidere Gallery should be commended for all the community work it does and has done throughout the years with different schools and the hospital.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/5b444d1b4ab85-e1531211073203-684x564.jpg ","title":"man says sorry for kicking puppy and yanking it by its lead on aberdeen street1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe man at the centre of a video in which a dog is kicked and pulled by its lead has said he is “sorry” for what he did.Footage recorded on Portland Street in Aberdeen showed a black cocker spaniel puppy being yanked by his lead and lifted off the ground.The clip, which was posted on social media, was shared and viewed thousands of times before being taken down.Chris Gainer, 39, the man in the video, was warned about his actions by the Scottish SPCA after the video came to light last week.He told how he had since received a number of messages, including some threatening assault.Chris, who says he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2012, said: “I lost my composure in the moment captured after months of toilet and obedience training and it was not acceptable.“The video almost went viral and gave rise to a great deal of emotion without any other context.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live.

Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"exciting shinty at the macaulay sixes","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 22/06/18, 8:15 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowNo fewer than 29 youth shinty teams travelled to Oban\u0026#8217s Mossfield Park for the annual Macaulay six-a-side competition.The winners of the main competition for P7 and under were Inverlochy, who defeated Taynuilt 1-0 in the final with Taynuilt taking the Oban Celtic Shield.The Alastair Campbell Shield for P5 and under was won by Braxi Boys from Inverlochy who defeated Bute in a very exciting final after extra time by one penalty to nil.The Macaulay Development trophy was won by Rockfield Rapids.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

Jorja was the top Mid Argyll girl in the long jump reaching 3.03 metres and also had a respectable 10.55 metres throw with the 500g turbo javelin.The girls B team finished ahead of the A team in 28th overall, mainly due to an excellent 14.25 metres javelin throw by Sophie Balkeen.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12468674.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_240218grant_07JPG.jpg","title":"maybole super school one step","story":"NewsMaybole super-school is one step closer to being builtCouncillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson15:27, 10 JUL 2018NewsNew Carrick Academy artist impression (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA \u0026pound42million super-school has taken a step closer to being built in Maybole.

Plans will see Cairn and Gardenrose Primaries merge to become a new school located at the purpose-built campus. Nurseries for both schools would also merge to be ready for August 2021. St Cuthbert’s Primary – where parents responding to the consultation issued a rejection of the move – would also relocate but operate as a stand-alone school. A bid for funding will now be made to the Scottish Government.

Nicola, 28-year-old classical singer married 30-year-old shipbuilding engineer John Hunter. The pair now live in Shawlands, Glasgow, but were both originally from Ayr. One Friday night back in 2009 John walked in to Harley’s Pub in Ayr to wish his cousin a happy birthday, and his sister told him to say hello to Nicola – her workmate at the time. “Nobody knows if it was the brown eyes, the sweet perfume or the six pints, three vodkas and the shot of Midori that caused him to steal my cardigan but steal it he did,” joked Nicola. She added: “A few days later, cardigan in hand, John returned it to H Samuel where I worked at the time. And that moment was the beginning of something special.” Since then both have enjoyed years of happiness and in October 2016 – seven years after meeting – John asked Nicola to marry him at Loch Lomond.  John and Nicola tied the knot on Thursday, June 7, at The Cruin at Loch Lomond. The couple said: “It was relaxing, elegant and absolutely perfect. “We can’t thank the staff enough. The weather, setting and scenery were breath-taking.” The bride wore a Vera Wang dress from David’s Bridal, Braehead, the bridesmaids also wearing gowns from David’s Bridal. The kilts were the Spirit of Lochearn tartan from Kilts 4 U. The wedding party consisted of Best man Mark Cosgrove, Groomsmen Niall Carney, Paddy McCurdie and Ryan Glass (nephew, aged 8), Maid of honour sister Jennifer Cassells, Bridesmaids Laura Dickson, Heather Armstrong and Aimee Trainer, Groom’s parents John Hunter and Hazel Hunter and the Bride’s parents Brian Cassells and Julie Cassells. The pair are currently celebrating being newlyweds in Bangkok, Thailand, and will be heading to Koh Samui, Thailand, then on to the Atlantis in Dubai.  3D Cakes created the couples wedding cake. The couple said: “We were inspired by the Scottish theme and used the same tartan ribbon that was on the kilts.” Kev Moulds Photography captured Nicola and John’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to look back on. The bouquets were arranged by Narcissus Flowers by Susan Hair and make-up was styled and created by Anna Wade (hair) and Lynn Brown (make-up).

Bids of \u0026pound1.5million are being sought for Enterkine House, perched above Annbank. The luxury four-star retreat, which boasts 74 acres of land, employs around 50 staff. Kirk House and Steading, a six-bedroom farmhouse currently used as overspill accommodation for the hotel, is also included.

It follows a long-running noise battle at the hotel which saw bosses spend \u0026pound80,000 soundproofing their wedding marquee. Council chiefs were told that slapping an 11pm curfew on party bands could put the hotel out of business.  But they finally got the all-clear earlier this year and revealed plans to build a permanent structure. However, the hotel is now being offered to the market. Bob Cherry, a partner with Galbraith, said: “The purchaser of Enterkine would find it relatively straightforward to continue the current business, which is well-established, and there are further opportunities for diversification or expansion of the tourism and events facilities on the estate, subject to the necessary consents. “This is a beautiful estate with a thriving hotel business and potential for further development.” Brian Sheldon, of Christie \u0026amp Co, added: “The market for country house hotels such as Enterkine House has vastly improved in recent years. “Its location in South Ayrshire and within such an enviable estate and countryside will attract local, regional and potentially international operators. “Whilst the business is trading well, there is certainly scope for further growth.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"royal troon golf club make","story":"NewsRoyal Troon golf club make generous donation to hospital unitIt follows a charity 18-hole golf event with Troon Portland and Troon Ladies, writes Charlene Bennie.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post15:39, 10 JUL 2018News\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRoyal Troon Golf Club has made the generous donation of \u0026pound1k to Crosshouse Hospital’s Acute Stroke Unit.

Steve the Seagull sneakily snatches a bag of crisps from bakery giant Greggs in Ayr. The sly bird checks to see if the coast is clear and grabs a packet of Walkers if staff are busy – and he’s tried every flavour. Greggs team member Charley Cooper said: “He could be in three times a day. He always goes for the crisps on the bottom shelf. He also took a pack of yum-yums recently. “He is like a thief in the night. He stalks this place. I shout ‘Steve’ and he flys off.” Hilariously the staff have dubbed the winged bandit ‘Steve Segal’ after the action movie actor.  Charley said the popular pest has been causing a flap for about two years. Air traffic controller Steve McNamara made a video of the bird in action last Tuesday. The dad-of-three said: “It was so funny. It landed outside Greggs, walked straight to the crisps stand inside, got a pack of ready salted and headed back out to the pavement. “ It then whacked the packet with its beak and devoured them. It only stopped to let out a cry of joy in the middle of its feast. “A few other people saw it and were incredulous. I had a feeling the bird wasn’t a first offender and it looked like it knew exactly what it was doing. It was a snatch theft.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article3294074.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/JS33570090.jpg","title":"up your game face boot","story":"NewsUp your game or face the boot - shock SNP ultimatum to South Ayrshire Council leaderIt comes as rival camps “fight like rats” to wrestle the council’s power base back on track.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson15:21, 10 JUL 2018NewsCouncil leader Douglas Campbell (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailUp your game or face the boot. That’s the shock ultimatum delivered by warring SNP councillors to their embattled leader. Douglas Campbell has been ordered to regain control of his split ranks during the council’s summer break. It comes as rival camps “fight like rats” to wrestle the council’s power base back on track. A racism storm and failed coup on Councillor Campbell has plunged the SNP into crisis. And the Post understands another plot to oust the leader is now brewing. It follows all SNP group members signing a declaration of support for their under-fire boss just two weeks ago. But a party insider has revealed growing disquiet is threatening to tear the group apart.  Within hours of the public show of support, Cllr Campbell was being placed under increasing pressure to step down of his own accord, rather than face another bruising challenge from within, the Post has learned. A senior source said: “People agreed to fall in line and sign the declaration for the sake of the bigger picture. “But it’s widely accepted that a change is required and this can’t go on. “The group is in a position where people will fight like rats to get what they want. “However, the even bigger concern is trying to keep the administration intact.” Worries over a potential walkout from Labour colleagues has, until now, ensured enough SNP support behind Cllr Campbell. A potential change in the their leadership is thought that have strained relations with administration partners, who have indicated they are happier working with Cllr Campbell.  But the Post understands that Cllr Campbell’s Labour past is forming a big part of the problem for the SNP leader as he battles factions within his new party. And a new warning – issued as councillors left for their summer break – stressed that he must crack the whip among his troubled ranks. The source added: “It was made very clear that if he doesn’t, the matter will be taken out of his hands. “The party is being crucified every week and it cannot be allowed to continue. “Some see Douglas as being far too close to Labour and that is undoubtedly a big issue for him. “Either way, he’s been given the message in clear terms that he needs to get everyone behind him and on the same page.” When asked about the warning, the group’s depute leader, William Grant, insisted: “This is news to me.” Cllr Campbell added: “Cllr Grant responded to your enquiry that ‘This is news to me’ and I have nothing to add.” "},{"url":null,"title":"unpaid-work-for-teenager-who-broke-mans-jaw-after-earlston-7s","story":"A TEENAGER broke a man\u0027s jaw with a punch during an argument after Earlston Rugby Sevens.\nThe victim had arrived at a party in Station Road to pick someone up on the night of May 6.\nHis vehicle was approached by 18-year-old Nathan Rice of Glenburn Avenue, Newtown St Boswells, who started acting in an aggressive manner and tried to get into the vehicle where a woman was sitting.\nThe car owner was returning to the vehicle and told Rice to go away and the pair squared up to each other.\nSelkirk Sheriff Court was told that the pair were pushing each other and then Rice connected with a punch to the left hand side of the face.\nThe pair were swinging punches that were not connecting and eventually they were split up.\nThe court heard that the victim woke up at 11.30am and could not close his mouth, and on attending hospital found he had a broken jaw.\nDefence lawyer Mark Harrower said the hotel worker felt bad about what happened and had not intended to inflict such an injury.\nHe added: \"He is a young man of good character and has learned a valuable lesson of what the consequences can be.\"\nRice pleaded guilty to charges of behavingin a threatening or abusive manner and assault to severe injury.\nSheriff Mark Thorley said: \"No doubt drink played a part in this but at lease you have shown remorse for your actions.\"\nHe was given a 12-months Copmmunity Pay Back order involving 160 hours of unpaid work.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"up-to-50-jobs-created-with-new-home-bargains-store-in-galashiels","story":"UP to 50 jobs are being created with the opening of a new \u0026pound4million Home Bargains store in Galashiels this weekend.\nThe Stirling Street outlet, which is due to be opened on Saturday at 8am, replaces the smaller Channel Street store which closes the day before.\nJoe Morris, operations director at Home Bargains, told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore thrilled to be launching this flagship store in Galashiels and look forward to welcoming customers through the doors.\nThe 25,000 sq ft store, which has previously been a Co-Op and B\u0026ampM, will offer shoppers a range of products, including homewares, health and beauty essentials, sweets, snacks and drinks, as well as fresh and frozen food.\nJoe added: \u0026ldquoStirling Street will be a great location for us and we\u0026rsquore proud to be able to offer local people top-branded goods at exceptionally low prices.\nWith more than four million customers each week, Home Bargains is one of the country\u0026rsquos best-loved discount retailers, stocking top-quality branded goods at low prices.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"feature-peebles-pupils-meditate-their-way-to-mindfulness","story":"IT\u0027S a typical weekday, high school students are lying on the floor of their classroom, eyes closed, listening to the soothing sounds of tranquil music, gently guided by their teacher as they breathe deeply, exhaling all worries away and their minds drift off\u0026hellip\nNow, I know you must be wondering, what on earth are they teaching at Peebles High School? What about prelims, exams, studying, grades?\nBut what do all these pressures bring to the fragile mind of a young person, and how do they process the stress to ensure their mental wellbeing?\nIn steps Suzi Gibson, who has been running mindful meditation sessions with Peebles High pupils as part of Health Week for the past five years.\nAnd so a group of pupils dropped their pencils, calculators and chemistry tools and walked through the doors of a more unique classroom setting, kicking off their school shoes and leaving their cares behind them as the lay in the comfort of Space 108 in Peebles.\nCan mindfulness meditation really help pupils concentrate amid the distractions of 21st century living?\nI decided to experience for myself the sessions offered freely to the pupils by Suzi, who guided sessions at the high school before opening her studio at Greenside, Peebles, in January 2016.\nAdmittedly I had always been a bit sceptical about meditation. I mean seriously, how can sitting on a floor in the lotus position, inhaling the pleasant oil aroma while the ambient sounds of dolphins singing and ocean waves crash, bring me peace of mind?\nI\u0026rsquom a wife, mother, writer, and like most people, my life is busy and my head is bursting with thoughts from which there\u0026rsquos no escape.\nBut I entered the beautiful airy studio with an open-mind and intrigued about the experiences of the pupils.\nOn this particular afternoon, I feel like I\u0026rsquove got the weight of the world on my shoulders. Thoughts are racing through my head like a train out of control. But immediately I feel a sense of calmness speaking to Suzi, as she explains the techniques she is using and gently guides me through the smooth ride to a quiet mind\u0026hellipand I am, going, going, gone\u0026hellip\nI am in a state of deep peace and the mind is calm, so much so, when I hear Suzi\u0026rsquos soft instruction to open my eyes \u0026ndash I don\u0026rsquot want to. I love it here.\nSo now I can see why meditation could potentially tackle a myriad of problems suffered by young students, including mental health. This is a growing problem in the Scottish Borders, with evidence suggesting almost 2,000 children and young people in the region will experience mental ill health at some point in their lives.\nThe sessions are offered to groups of pupils from S1 to S3, who arrive at the studio giggling with excitement and anticipation for their new experience.\nSuzi explained: \"There are some nerves and awareness of peers, especially if there is a mix of ages. The great thing is, once they close their eyes, it becomes completely about their own experience. Fidgeting and chatting stops, there is a sense of calm, and some sleep which is great because they perhaps need it.\"\nEach group is given an insight into the benefits of meditation, as well as exploring how stress becomes unhealthy, warning signs, and how to build resilience through practical techniques that can help reduce anxiety.\nThe meditation guru shared skills with the pupils which, if put into practice daily, can be life-changing.\nSuzi said: \"They are all very relaxed and quite amazed at the experience. I hope they leave with the knowledge that they have the ability to create calmness within themselves using some of the techniques they have learned, leading to greater concentration, focus, creativity and well rested teens.\"\nThe visible difference in the pupils during the session at Space 108 has astounded school staff. \"Some of the teachers and staff who have attended over the years can\u0026rsquot quite believe the quiet and calm that begins to settle in the room. I\u0026rsquove had a few parents afterwards tell me how much their kids enjoyed it,\" said Suzi.\n\"There is a lot of anxiety and tension in our kids today, sometimes a feeling of being relaxed is a little alien to them, then they experience it. That\u0026rsquos the important bit, they have an experience of relaxation and calm, not an intellectual understanding that it is good for them, but an actual experience.\"\nResearch has proven that mindfulness and meditation is very beneficial to a person\u0026rsquos mental health, and many schools are incorporating it into their classrooms, teaching philosophies, and disciplinary programs.\nIn fact, some schools are choosing to replace detention with meditation with it even being used as behavioural therapy in classrooms.\nWhether this trend will catch on remains to be seen, as there are many parents who still prefer traditional discipline, with youngsters being given their marching orders to the principal\u0026rsquos office for unruly behaviour.\nBut one thing is certain, the pupils of Peebles High School reaped the benefits of their mindful meditation sessions with Suzi during Health Week last month.\nPrincipal teacher of pastoral care Kirsteen Robertson, said: \"The studio is beautiful, the students immediately notice how soothing the space is, the lovely smell and lighting. The sessions give our students strategies to relax, think calmly, reducing stress and anxiety and improve sleep. It\u0026rsquos just amazing to see how some of them react.\"\nHaving embraced meditation and its healing benefits, I leave the studio feeling renewed, carefree and a little lighter on my feet. The everyday worries and thoughts I described like a train racing out of control?

summer holidays are here and it’s easy for health routines to go out of the window as children relax, enjoy the outdoors and get stuck into their favourite hobbies.Asthma UK is launching a campaign urging parents of children with asthma to make sure they take their usual preventer medicine and keep up a routine over the school break.The medicine builds up over time so will help to protect their child from an asthma attack during the summer holiday and once they return to school.Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially life-threatening asthma attack in the UK and three people die from an asthma attack every day.In September, children are nearly three times more likely to be admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack than in August, partly due to seasonal triggers such as cold and flu viruses.If a child hasn’t kept up their preventer medicine routine over the school holidays, they will be at greater risk of reacting to these triggers.The good news is that by taking a few simple steps, parents can help their child to avoid asthma attacks and enjoy the summer as much as anyone else:Keep up your child’s usual preventer medicine routine, usually a brown inhaler.Make sure your child has an up-to-date written asthma action plan, which you can download from Asthma UK’s website, and share this with anyone who will be looking after them as using one means they’re less likely to end up in hospital for their asthma.Track your child’s asthma symptoms using a diary or a symptom calendar.Prepare for going back to school by arranging for your child to have an asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse to check your child’s medicines and make sure your child has spare, in-date reliever inhalers to take into school.Parents whose children have asthma can access support through our nurse helpline.Last year we helped nearly 1,000 parents who called on behalf of their child with asthma.For information and support on how to manage your child’s asthma during the summer or to download a written asthma action plan visit www.asthma.org.uk/safersummerDr Andy Whittamore, Practicing GP, Clinical Lead at Asthma UK.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"2012s football

supplies during the current period of hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer usage has increased significantly.With the current weather conditions forecast to continue people should take simple but important steps to conserve public water supplies.In some areas there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water during the summer and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely and  to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Some water treatment works and distribution networks are working at near capacity to meet demand.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of usage and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce usage wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their usage and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible, use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.Scotland’s public water supply is the lifeblood of the country, for household and business customers and more than 1.3 billion litres is used per day.There is a strong and resilient water distribution network but everyone will need to play their part as Scotland enjoys its hottest and driest summer in many years.To help customers use water wisely, advice is at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or by calling 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer,Chief Operating Officer,Scottish

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.

Councillor McMillan said it had been a great honour to be joined by veterans from East Lothian at the flag-raising ceremony which took place on Monday morning.  He told those in attendance: \"Today is an opportunity to recognise the enormous contribution made by service personnel - past and present - and pay tribute to those who very sadly paid the ultimate sacrifice.  \"This November marks a century since the end of the First World War. A large number of residents left East Lothian in service of their country \u0026ndash many of whom, tragically, would never return.  \"Sadly, in the 100 years since, the world has seen all too many conflicts \u0026ndash some on a large scale, others more confined. In war, and in peacetime, our armed forces have promoted peace and security, confronted terrorism, and delivered aid to those in need.  \"That\u0026rsquos why, as Provost of East Lothian, I value occasions such as Armed Forces Day. A chance to give thanks, remember, reflect and look ahead.\"  Mr McMillan also paid tribute to the role of women in the military and in times of conflict, noting that 2018 was also the 100th anniversary of the first women being given the vote.  He said: \"Women played a significant role in the war effort, taking on work such as farming, transport and munition production, and the perseverance of Suffrage activity subsequently led to women being given the right to vote.  \"For a number of years now women have deservedly been playing a full and active role in our Armed Forces \u0026ndash reflective of the increasingly inclusive society in which we all live and are so keen to protect.\"  Veterans who attended the ceremony on Monday were invited to enjoy refreshments after the event."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7979931.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scotlands-best-black-pudding-made-in-east-lothian","story":"  When the final of this year\u0026rsquos Scottish Black Pudding Championship was held earlier this month at the Edinburgh New Town Cook School, it was Anderson\u0027s Quality Butchers who came out on top.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.

Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area.

However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.  The museum is open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10.30am to 4pm each day."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8006789.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"coast-road-closed-after-car-overturns","story":"  Police said one person was trapped in a car which has overturned and they have closed the road while work to free them is carried out.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.  The site had long been earmarked for Sainsbury\u0026rsquos after it won a lengthy battle with Tesco to build on the site in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8009220.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dunbar-student-heading-off-to-the-olympics-of-tech","story":"  A games development team, made up of students from Abertay University, will take on the best in the world at the Microsoft Imagine Cup in Seattle.  The competition \u0026ndash dubbed the Olympics of Tech \u0026ndash seeks out the most innovative and potentially world-changing software solutions and comes with a first prize of $100,000.  Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.  The Abertay team are focusing on making the simulator better before they head to Washington.

The young people would like to re-build the shelter with wider community involvement.  But Kathryn and Douglas Paul, who live at Glasclune Gardens, would prefer to see the shelter demolished.  Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.  The couple told the Courier they had experienced long-standing anti-social behaviour from youngsters who already gather at the shelter.  Mrs Paul said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had bottles thrown into the garden \u0026ndash they are loud and they get up to all sorts. It\u0026rsquos been going on five or six years.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.

She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park.

The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

In April, Police Scotland asked East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board to review the pub\u0026rsquos licence and that of its manager Christopher Darling.  However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.  He said that if given approval to go ahead the pub could re-open early next year.

About 14,000 primary and high school pupils in East Lothian have been visited at their schools as part of the trophies tour in the run-up to the Scottish Open, which takes place from next Thursday (July 12), and the Ladies\u0026rsquo Scottish Open which begins on Thursday, July 26.  Mr Martin said: \u0026ldquoThe trophies tour finale at Sanderson\u0026rsquos Wynd was an amazing day and these children not only got to see the trophies up close but also got to grill a brilliant professional athlete in Beth Allen. It was also fantastic to give them the opportunity to swing a golf club for the first time.  \u0026ldquoI hope that the trophy tour has inspired children across East Lothian to come down to Gullane in July and continue to get involved in golf.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable. It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.  She said: \"The announcement has been made to our network of hosts and producers, many of them will communicate to their members when they are ready, and we will do a public communication in August.\""},{"url":null,"title":"talented-teenage-drummer-clara-wilberforce-joins-national-youth-pipe-band-of-scotland","story":"  Clara Wilberforce, who has been playing the snare drum since she was in P6 at King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, has linked up with the National Youth Pipe Band of Scotland\u0026rsquos development band.

Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.  Her first event will feature Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain at the Phil and Aly RSNO St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day Concert at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on November 25.

Clara, who is in S5 at Knox Academy and studying Higher maths, English, geography and human biology, is also a member of the school\u0026rsquos pipe band as well as Haddington Pipe Band, where she is a senior drummer.  Her mum, who praised the efforts of Davey Barnes, who runs Knox Academy Pipe Band, and Dave Henry, drum teacher, said Clara \u0026ldquoloves the drumming and she had made a number of good friends through music and boosted her confidence.  Alastair Bruce, chairman of Haddington Pipe Band, congratulated Clara, who lives in the town, on the achievement.

Now his son Kit, who lives in Belhaven, has released a new version of the tale which looks at Chris\u0026rsquo 30-year career with the company, its characters and ships.  The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.  Kit \u0026ndash who last year released The Triumph and Tragedy of the Bantams, which focused on a band of \u0026ldquobrave but largely forgotten soldiers \u0026ndash has added his own stories of being a \u0026lsquoMacBrayne Child\u0026rsquo.  He added that his dad was known as the \u0026lsquostoryteller\u0026rsquo in the family and he wanted to make sure the stories were available to a new generation.

The dad-of-three said: \u0026ldquoThe TV course has been a brilliant journey.  \u0026ldquoColleagues often ask where I find my energy, and sometimes I have to ask myself the same thing, especially at 4am when I have forgotten to go to bed. Perhaps my endurance and resilience comes from my 12 years as a commando.  \u0026ldquoThere have been sacrifices, the biggest of them being to have had no social life throughout this time, but I am passionate about television and I am now talking to production companies and hoping to make my mark in the documentary genre.

Matt, who served with the Royal Marines in Northern Ireland, has already completed a music production with National Museums Scotland for a new exhibition on Scottish pop from the 1950s to present day.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history.

Using a mobile phone at the wheel is one of the fatal four road offences which can have devastating consequences if it causes a fatal or serious collision.  \u0026ldquoWe will be using the information provided by Norfolk County Council\u0026rsquos road safety team to help us target drivers in the future but the message is simple \u0026ndash leave your phone alone whilst you\u0026rsquore behind the wheel.  Norfolk County Council\u0026rsquos road safety team have worked with speed and warning sign specialists Westcotec on deploying the next-level signs, which are a first for UK roads.  The system is able to simultaneously detect bluetooth signals so that anyone legally in a call via their car\u0026rsquos speakers is not wrongly issued a warning.  Although the signs are unable to log offending number plates, such a feature is being considered for development in the future. There is also no facility for the signs to record footage.  For now, a counter will keep track of phone usage on the road to help authorities understand driver habits.  Diane Steiner, deputy director of public health said: \u0026ldquoOur priority in public health is to make Norfolk a healthy and safe place to live and the new technology enables us to provide a reminder to drivers who may be using their handset whilst driving.  \u0026ldquoWhilst this is still not a perfect science, the new generation of sign is significantly more accurate and reliable than the first."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8052223.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"german-minister-jokes-about-birthday-deportations","story":"  Interior Minister Horst Seehofer remarked on the number on Tuesday, but said of the deportation flight: \u0026ldquoit wasn\u0026rsquot booked by me.

However, the first study of its kind in Scotland reveals a \"rapid halt\" in long-term breastfeeding 500 years ago.  Archaeologists obtained tiny bone fragments from the remains of 67 children buried at Aberdeen\u0026rsquos St Nicholas Kirk the 12th to 18th centuries and analysed them to estimate the age at which they must have been weaned off breastmilk.  They found a \"sudden\" reduction around the 16th and 17th centuries.  Dr Kate Britton, who led the study at Aberdeen University, said: \u0026ldquoIt is often thought that a relatively short period of breastfeeding \u0026ndash of around six months - is something that emerged later in the 18th and 19th centuries.  \"But our study points to a very different picture with this change occurring much earlier.  \u0026ldquoBreastfeeding and weaning practices tell us a great deal about changing \u0026lsquosocial norms\u0026rsquo and wider economic and cultural changes.\"  The individuals buried in Aberdeen would have been fairly affluent and middle class, but the findings correspond to previous bio-archaeological studies in England indicating that the decline in duration of breastfeeding was occurring across all classes.  Dr Britton said further research is needed into the reasons why trends in breastfeeding changed 500 years ago, but among wealthier women it is thought it may have declined in popularity because it interfered with their outfits or pursuits, such as playing cards.  It also coincided with the expansion of cities, which accelerated the spread of ideas, and post-Reformation Protestantism which promoted the mother\u0027s role in childrearing and made wet nurses taboo.  Dr Britton said: \u0026ldquoBy analysing our data in conjunction with the results of these previous studies, we can see that trends were very similar across England and Scotland.  \"For example, we can see that middle class people in Aberdeen were behaving in same way as those in London workhouses a century or so later.  \u0026ldquoWe can only speculate as to why this might be but increased urbanisation, women working outside the home and cultural changes following the Reformation may be contributing factors.  \"Furthermore, maternal nursing was seen by some as inconvenient and unfashionable, interfering with social pursuits.  \u0026ldquoAn alternative was wet-nursing, but there also seems to be a corresponding decline in the social acceptance of wet nursing in this period, with medical writers and physicians in the later medieval period and into the 16th and 17th centuries discussing the link between the personal attributes of the person feeding an infant and the baby\u0026rsquos character.  \"Red-heads, for example, were to be avoided as wet-nurses as they could make a baby hot tempered with their milk.  The findings are published in the International Journal of Osteoarchaeology."},{"url":null,"title":"alesha-macphails-mother-thanks-island-people-for-their-help","story":"  Georgina Lochrane, who also goes by the name Genie, took to a local Facebook group for locals on the Isle of Bute to reach out to them following her daughter\u0027s death.  The devastated mum said Alesha would be \"proud\" of what they had done for her and apologised for not being able to make the vigil the islanders organised Alesha on Sunday night.  The vigil attracted hundreds of mourners to Rothesay\u0027s Guildford Square, where mourners held candles and left tributes to the youngster.  It is the first time Genie has spoken out since her daughter was found dead in a woodland area near to her Grandmother\u0027s house.

Still, they were only the Brexit Secretary and the Foreign Secretary, who may have reached their decisions because Theresa May treated them as peripheral. Despite his letter, David Davis\u0026rsquos resignation came not because the Chequers proposals crossed his \u0026ldquored lines by much, but because he was cut out of a say in them.  Instead, Mrs May entrusted her plan to a civil servant, Olly Robbins, her Europe Advisor and former Permanent Secretary at the Department for Exiting the EU, essentially sidelining her minister. That shows such bad judgment that it should be (and may soon be) grounds for a challenge to her leadership.  Cue Boris. The fact that the Foreign Secretary\u0026rsquos departure was, apparently, announced by Number 10 yesterday afternoon while he was still writing his resignation letter corresponds with my memories of waiting around for his column to arrive, so that I could edit it. My personal experience doesn\u0026rsquot enable me, alas, to divine the exact rationale for his leaving, though I suspect that the future of Boris Johnson figures large in it.  At any rate, here is where we are now, though the problem is partly the other way round. The Brexit referendum determined where the UK wanted to go from, but not its destination, beyond the cheery expectation that it would be broad sunlit uplands where democracy and prosperity would flower unchecked.  This is true even for those who voted Remain. That was no more a vote for the status quo than \u0026ldquoLeave determined which form of Brexit we would get: the EU is, by its own definition, an evolving project of \u0026ldquoever closer union with \u0026ndash as we\u0026rsquore now constantly told \u0026ndash strict insistence on certain fundamentals.  The fact that there are observably everywhere exceptions to these unbreachable principles is either one of those mysteries, like \u0026ldquoman is born free but everywhere in chains, or indicates that the statement was nonsense to start with, like \u0026ldquosheep are born carnivorous but everywhere eat grass.  But let\u0026rsquos assume \u0026ldquoBrexit means Brexit, whatever that means, and consider the possible destinations. Some people argue for a leaving which amounts to staying, like my mother when she says \u0026ldquoGoodbye on the telephone and then embarks on a two-hour account of what the rest of the family has been up to for the last month. One suspects that, for example, Anna Soubry and Sir Keir Starmer have this in mind when they talk of respecting the vote while staying in the Customs Union, Single Market, ECJ, CAP, CFP, Eurodac, Enisa, Eurojust, Uncle Euratom Cobley and Europol.  Others, like Jacob Rees-Mogg and the European Reform Group (ERG), seem keen to tell the EU that we don\u0026rsquot want to play with them any more, are keeping our \u0026pound38 billion ball and going off to play under WTO rules. These attitudes, and the split they represent in the Tory Party (though Labour MPs have their own equally intractable divisions), has been compared with the Corn Law movement.  Though it was Robert Peel (a Tory) who finally did repeal the Corn Laws, and the measure was proved right, Conservatives might also remember that it split the party so comprehensively that it took almost 30 years before it recovered as a viable political force.  The Radical Whig, Cobden \u0026amp Bright approach acknowledges that free trade has done more to increase prosperity than anything else in human history. But (like so many truths) it is a minority view. Free marketeers talk approvingly of \u0026ldquodisruption and Joseph Schumpeter\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquocreative destruction, but even if those forces are right in the long term \u0026ndash as history has shown them to be \u0026ndash the short-term costs and shocks are by no means negligible.  That may be why even Douglas Carswell, of all people, has expressed his puzzlement at ERG resistance to the proposals set out at Chequers, arguing that it is still recognisably leaving. More to the point, he and others who are relatively relaxed about compromises worry that setting red lines where the ERG wants them risks not getting any Brexit at all. This, obviously for different reasons, also seems to be the calculation of many Remainers unapologetically seeking a second referendum, who therefore want any other option to fail.  Michael Gove\u0026rsquos position when supporting (though in a rather lukewarm fashion) the Chequers plan on Sunday was, pragmatically, that detaching ourselves from the EU will take time and that some things \u0026ndash such as some ECJ supervision, or maintaining regulatory alignment in specified areas \u0026ndash may be a price worth paying in the short term. We can always decide, further down the line, that they are holding us back, or a bad deal, and renegotiate or withdraw from them then.  Mr Davis\u0026rsquos and Mr Johnson\u0026rsquos departure should not disguise the fact that the overwhelming problem with the Chequers proposal \u0026ndash tied up with its being the product of civil servants and technocratic politicians of the sort that, alas, Mrs May has turned out to be \u0026ndash is that it is no more than a wishlist. Delivering it might, in the end, satisfy Leavers, but just now it is merely an opening sally in negotiations against the EU, which will take it as a starting position, reject great chunks of it and ask for more.  Actually to get what the remains of the Cabinet have reluctantly agreed on, Mrs May should have sounded a little bit more like Mr Rees-Mogg making noises about WTO rules.

Mr Rowley, 45, remains in a critical condition.  Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson blamed Russia for committing \u0026ldquoan attack on British soil over the latest poisonings, some four months after Sergei and Yulia Skripal were targeted.  Counter-terror police have said their main line of inquiry is whether the two cases are linked, but Mr Williamson went a step further by pointing the finger at Moscow.  He told MPs: \u0026ldquoThe simple reality is that Russia has committed an attack on British soil which has seen the death of a British citizen.  \u0026ldquoThat is something that I think the world will unite with us in actually condemning.

The Ministry of Defence is working with the police on the investigation and the clear-up effort, with 175 armed forces personnel involved.

Police are yet to recover that item but Public Health England said the risk to the public is low and warned against picking up \u0026ldquoany strange items such as needles, syringes or unusual containers.  Central to the investigation is John Baker House, the supported-living accommodation where Ms Sturgess lived, Mr Rowley\u0026rsquos home and Salisbury\u0026rsquos Queen Elizabeth Gardens, which remains cordoned off.  A red Ford Transit van in which Mr Rowley was a passenger on June 30 has also been recovered and tested as part of the murder inquiry.

This could run into millions of pounds and put at risk the future viability of the business.The company have also met with local Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur, to express their concerns about the delay.As the start of this month, as Mr Matheson stepped into the shoes of the previous minister for transport Humza Yousaf, it was announced that lack of agreement between the Scottish Government and Pentland Ferries had led to no discounted fares being introduced in Pentland Firth ferry routes, by the Government\u0026#8217s self-set deadline of the end of last month.Andrew Banks, Managing Director and Owner of Pentland Ferries said: “We want these passenger subsidies implemented as soon as possible but we need to be 100 per cent sure that the scheme complies with state aid rules.  We have never had any subsidy from the government and even though this scheme gives money to the passenger, not the operator, the minister has told us that we would be liable for any repayment if at a future date the scheme is deemed illegal. This could run into the millions and could finish us off.“We cannot take that risk and we have a responsibility to our staff, our community and family to make sure the scheme works for everyone. We want to work with the Minister and his team to discuss a way forward so that we can all benefit from reduced fares. This scheme will be fantastic for our business, attracting more visitors to the islands and making it cheaper to travel to the mainland for residents. So we want this unlocked as soon as possible. We welcome the Minister’s willingness to gain a full understanding of the detail and very much hope to be able to meet him in Orkney soon.”The minister, Mr Matheson, was asked for a response to the comments from Pentland Ferries and Mr Banks. At the time he replied, Transport Scotland said the invitation had not yet been received so the minister could not comment.However, Mr Matheson did say: “The Scottish Government remains committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles. I am conscious that there is a great deal of interest in this issue amongst users of the services. As I begin my new role as Transport Secretary, I want to ensure that I gain a full understanding of the detail — it is already very clear to me that planning to introduce reduced fares on the Northern Isles network has been a complex and challenging piece of work.“As a first step, we will cut fares on the Aberdeen-Lerwick and Kirkwall-Lerwick services from June 30. These reductions will be around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.“On routes to Orkney, it has been necessary to engage with commercial operators on the Pentland Firth. We set out a very fair and reasonable proposal that would maintain competition, enabling them to protect their existing market share. Unfortunately, not all the commercial operators have felt able to agree to our proposals. This means we cannot currently implement reduced fares on any of the routes to and from Orkney without the risk of legal challenge.“This is both disappointing and frustrating, but I am determined to work through the issue to see what more can be done. I have asked Transport Scotland to undertake some further work to see what measures, if any, we can take. As part of that, we are willing to reopen talks with commercial operators.  I will provide a further update to stakeholders and to Parliament as soon as I can, with a view to bringing the full benefits of the scheme to the people of Orkney and Shetland.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will help reduce the initial barrier of connection for a defined period of time.Two events are planned at the St Magnus Centre in Kirkwall, from 6pm to 8pm on Wednesday July 11 then from 10am to 12pm on Thursday July 12 with a further event at the Doubletree by Hilton, Glasgow Central, from 10.30am to 12.30noon on Friday July 13 and finally, a webinar will take place on Tuesday July 17 from 10am to 12pm.Registration is required for the Alternative Approach consultations via the following link: https://www.ssen-transmission/news-views/articles/2018/6/solving-orkney-s-catch-22/Commenting on the Alternative Approach consultation events, Lauren Milligan, commercial policy manager, said: “As a customer-driven initiative, stakeholder engagement has shaped the Alternative Approach proposal to date.“We want to ensure that we develop a solution that not only works for network companies but also the wider industry and other connection customers and would therefore encourage anyone with an interest in our proposed Alternative Approach trial to register for one of our consultation events.”The final stage of consultation is planned to take place in Autumn on the various components of the transmission reinforcement project in advance of submitting planning applications to the relevant planning authorities, the Scottish Government, Marine Scotland and Orkney Islands Council.The progression of the project is subject to all necessary planning consents and securing regulatory approval from industry regulator Ofgem, with the Alternative Approach trial also subject to regulatory approval.For more information on the proposed Orkney transmission reinforcement, including links to both consultation documents, click here.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Each of the three winding barrels will have a small motor fitted, and a sensor, which will automatically detect when the clock has wound down to a certain level. In addition, the clock will also be fitted with a pendulum regulator, which will ensure the clock time is more accurate.Cathedral custodian Fran Hollinrake said: \u0026#8220It is the end of an era. It was always a great workout climbing the tower stairs and manually winding the clock, but it was just becoming too impractical with all our other duties. The clock will still be the clock, it will just have a couple of new bits added on.\u0026#8221The previous clock on St Magnus Cathedral dated from 1761, and was made by Hugh Gordon, a clockmaker in Aberdeen. But during the early 20th century, as part of the Sheriff Thoms bequest, a new timepiece was commissioned that would see the cathedral through the 20th century and beyond. The present clock was made when the world was at war, in 1915, although it was not actually installed until 1919, the same week that the Treaty of Versailles was signed that ended the First World War.James Ritchie and Son (Clockmakers) was founded in 1809, and the company specialised in large steeple and public clocks, both making and restoring. If you are familiar with Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh, you will know the world-famous Floral Clock, not far from Waverley Station. It was made in 1903 by Ritchie\u0026#8217s, and was the first of its kind in the world.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4766362.1531165163!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon keen to create scottish public owned energy firm","story":"        The feasibility of a Scottish state-owned energy company is set to be examined.

Theresa May has betrayed those 17.4 million who voted for Brexit with her latest plan, writes Brian Monteith                Well, does Brexit now mean Brexit? Does the Prime Minister’s Cabinet agreement on a negotiating position – more than two years after the British people voted to leave the European Union – amount to a craven capitulation or a triumph of pragmatism in the face of the EU’s intransigence?             The test must surely be to examine the proposal against what Theresa May has repeatedly told us, namely we shall be leaving the EU’s single market and customs union, we shall be controlling our own borders and we shall be free from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. In other words, by regaining full sovereignty the UK will take back control.            The press statement that summarised the Prime Minister’s proposal, which will form the basis of a White Paper, has been examined by barrister Martin Howe, QC, a respected specialist in European law and adviser to Lawyers for Britain – and it has been found seriously wanting.His 18-page advice can be found at their website and is well worth a read but the telling phrase is this: “These proposals [therefore] lead directly to a worst-of-all-worlds ‘Black Hole’ Brexit where the UK is stuck permanently as a vassal state in the EU’s legal and regulatory tar pit, still has to obey EU laws and ECJ rulings across vast areas, cannot develop an effective international trade policy or adapt our economy to take advantage of the freedom of Brexit, and has lost its vote and treaty veto rights as an EU member state.”• READ MORE: David Davis resignation plunges government into crisisTo achieve unanimity around her proposal, the Prime Minister connived against her colleagues who have repeatedly given her the benefit of the doubt only to find that decisions taken in good faith on issues such as the single market and customs union are consistently reopened to be debated again.Consider this: Mrs May flew to Germany to reveal her proposal to Chancellor Angela Merkel before she had presented it to her own Cabinet in an attempt to obtain pre-approval. It is generally held that the EU was also given wind of what she was proposing and was asked not to dismiss it out of hand before any negotiations.             The Cabinet members were then given the 120-page document to read individually only two hours before their meeting started and had their phones and watches taken off them so they could not communicate details of the contents or the meeting. Meanwhile, civil servants behind the plan were leaking details of the proceedings as if they were commenting gleefully on Eurovision Song Contest entries.That a Prime Minister should seek to cut a deal behind the backs of her own Cabinet betrays that she is not negotiating for the best deal from the EU but on the contrary, is negotiating together with the EU against Brexiteers in the Cabinet who represent the 17.4 million that voted Leave. If that is not treachery I don’t know what is. What we are heading for is not a soft Brexit, as its supporters are portraying it, but a soft Remain that will in time become a hard Remain – for it will undoubtedly result in further concessions. The Prime Minister’s Chequers agreement is only her opening gambit and, by the example of her performance thus far, must mean further concessions along the way.To consider what May has done let us look at it from a Scottish context. Imagine Scotland voted to leave the UK in a second independence referendum, but in the negotiations for a new relationship with the UK the SNP Cabinet is divided because some fear a soft Indyref will tie Scotland forever to decisions by UK institutions such as Westminster, the Bank of England and UK Supreme Court. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon quietly jets down to London, meets the UK Prime Minister of the day and reveals the plans she will present to her Scottish Cabinet before they are able to read it and agree to it. Sturgeon, with the promise of no more than murmurings from the UK that it is only a good starting-point, comes home and threatens the collapse of the government and an early election if she doesn’t get her way.            That is what May has done, and it is nothing short of treacherous to the decision that was taken on 23 June, 2016 by the British people – and it is not even the final settlement. No matter how sweet-sounding its initial reaction, the EU will bargain for more.  One has to conclude that if May had shown as much cunning and sharp practice towards the EU and Michel Barnier as she has shown to her Cabinet members then she would have undoubtedly have won greater support and loyalty from those who have put their faith in her, only to be betrayed.As is the way of politics I doubt we have heard the last of this shameful episode in the Conservative Party’s history. Too many are looking to their ministerial careers, their superannuated pensions, their limousine lifestyle and ambitions. David Davis was meant to be the minister for exiting the European Union but has become the doormat for the Prime Minister’s kitten heels. On Friday she trod all over him, again. Boris Johnson fires off smart-ass one-liners like torpedoes, but they have ultimately turned back and sunk him, for he is finished as an alternative to May if he can’t do a Heseltine and storm out. Meanwhile, Liam Fox is on a mission to irrelevance who will want to discuss trade deals in any serious fashion with him now? Michael Gove was apparently the first Leaver in Cabinet to support May’s plan if true then he has excelled himself as the most duplicitous of all having stabbed Boris Johnson in the back during the Tory leadership election on the basis he would not have delivered Brexit, he has now knifed the Brexit movement completely.            Left isolated, Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt and Esther McVey have capitulated with their colleagues. Only a number of backbenchers, certainly too few if Labour backs May’s proposal, are wisening up to what it means.A Survation poll, carried out since the announcement, suddenly puts Labour ahead with the Tories dropping three points. It is only the beginning. The Cabinet may be united for the moment, but are all holding hands as they jump off an electoral cliff into that dark tarry black hole they are being warned about.• Brian Monteith is a director of Global Britain"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4766338.1531203441!/image/image.jpg","title":"tommy sheppard mp the uk is not a democratic country","story":"        It\u0026#8217s time the UK as a whole caught up with Scotland, Wales, and for that matter most of the developed world, by ditching its outdated voting system, writes Tommy Sheppard MP.

But we should celebrate that achievement precisely because it shattered an unjust status quo. And we still have an unjust status quo – a broken system that the Tories seem hell-bent on defending. The pomp and ceremony of Westminster may seem quaint to some, but its democratic system is as outdated as its traditions. Even putting aside the fact that most of the legislators are unelected Lords, the elected House of Commons uses, in first-past-the-post, a voting system to elect MPs that doesn’t even reflect the votes cast by the electorate.            The majority of seats shared by the Conservatives and the DUP was won with just 43 per cent of the vote. In fact we have had governments elected by a minority of voters for almost all of the time since World War II, while millions of voters are excluded at every election.READ MORE: Euan McColm: Proportional representation gets my voteThe same goes for local councils across England, where you find one-party fiefdoms without a single opposition councillor and absurd results like Plymouth and Wandsworth, where the party that lost the election won the most seats. I’m not pretending that elections in Scotland are perfect but at least the Scottish Parliament, with its proportional electoral system, reflects the votes cast. Our local elections also use a form of PR so that seats match votes and councils reflect the people they serve. And you can vote from the age of 16 allowing young people to get, and stay, involved in politics.The fact that we have managed to reach this point – of having democratic institutions that reflect the people – is worth celebrating, particularly given the vociferousness of opposition to this simple principle by politicians elsewhere in the UK.Proportional representation of voters is absolutely central to any modern democratic society – and it’s abhorrent that no Westminster government has ever genuinely asked the electorate whether they’d actually like Parliament to reflect the way they vote. Instead, the people were fobbed off in 2011 with a choice between the status quo and a system that is often even less proportional: the alternative vote.            Two-thirds of people believe that seats should match votes at Westminster, according to recent polling, and for as long as Scotland remains a part of the UK, the SNP will champion any moves towards making this a reality.READ MORE: Labour could win ‘more votes but fewer seats’ than Tories in ScotlandFirst-past-the-post governments elected on around 40 per cent of the vote are simply not democratic. It’s time the UK as a whole caught up with Scotland, Wales, and for that matter most of the developed world.Westminster would finally see governments that not only look like the people who voted for them, but that represent the views of the majority. That’s why the hundreds of volunteers from Make Votes Matter who took part in Demand Democracy Day on 30 June shouldn’t be ignored. You’ve got to admire their spirit. They organised around 60 street stalls across the UK – from Dover to Dundee – and invited members of the public to sign the new petition for proportional representation which calls on MPs to support it. If you really want to help celebrate democracy, sign the petition to Make Votes Matter and let’s get proportional representation for Westminster.

The Nationalist leader at Westminster said his party would “welcome” another election if the Prime Minister’s proposals for exiting the EU failed to protect Scotland’s interests.            Mrs May is due to publish a Government white paper on her Brexit plans next week, despite the turmoil caused by the resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson.            The agreement reached at Chequers last Friday includes plans for a free trade area for industrial and agricultural goods, based on a “common rule book” and a “combined customs territory”.However, there will be different arrangements for trade in services including financial products, with the UK recognising neither side will enjoy “current levels of access” to each other’s markets.READ MORE: Nicola Sturgeon: SNP will press for single market membershipMr Blackford said if Mrs May did not alter her plans to bring them closer to this position, the SNP would “relish” the chance to fight another election.“If we’re talking about a situation where the Scottish economy is going to be threatened and if there’s an opportunity for us to have a debate with the people of Scotland, then of course I would welcome that,” he told the broadcaster.            “My focus in the short term, my party’s focus…is about protecting the interests of the Scottish people. That’s about making sure that we stay in the single market and the customs union.“If we faced an election as we go through that process then so be it, it’s something I would relish and something I would look forward to. I believe the SNP would come out of that in a strengthened position.”Challenged over the result of last year’s snap general election, which saw the SNP lose 21 seats in Scotland including those of Alex Salmond and Angus Robertson, Mr Blackford was defiant.“The SNP are still the dominant voice, the dominant party in Scotland. We’ve been the government party in Scotland for the last 11 years,” he said.            “I would firmly believe that if we had to put ourselves in front of the electorate again, we’d get the overwhelming backing of the people of Scotland.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 19 ","story":"Shetland’s young sports competitors retained their hold on the Stuart Cup at the weekend, with the margin of victory, in the end, being fairly comfortable.\nGoing into the last event of the junior inter-county, the netball, Orkney had to win by 32 points to overhaul the visitors’ lead. Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday.

in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nTuesday 10 Jul 2018 8:39 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Sunrise_SMO_lead_image-1200x800.jpg","title":"former sabhal mor ostaig chairman","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nFormer Sabhal Mòr Ostaig chair Duncan MacQuarrie was celebrated this week with the first road in the new Kilbeg Village development, Rathad MhicGuaire (MacQuarrie Road) named in his honour during an official ceremony held on Monday.\nThe ceremony was carried out by Kate Forbes MSP and recognised the key role which Mr MacQuarrie has played in the college\u0026#8217s development over many years. Sabhal Mòr Ostaig principal Prof Boyd Robertson said, \u0026#8220This is a richly-deserved honour for Duncan which recognises the hugely important contribution he has made to the development of the college over many years and the vital contribution he has made to the development of the Gaelic language and culture and to the advancement of Gaelic and Gaelic-medium education, both as a teacher and as a former HM Inspector.”\n“Duncan\u0026#8217s critical input to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig’s development in its challenging formative years was marked by his steady stewardship, as a former chairman and his pioneering work, alongside that of his fellow trustees, demonstrated an exemplary vision and commitment without which what is now the National Centre for the Gaelic Language and Culture would not have existed.”\n“For that, all who have benefited from this wonderful and inspiring place, over the intervening years, owe him a great debt of gratitude and it is for that reason we celebrate with him here today.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"}]
