Time to turn to the experts for some tips ... From pay freezes to furloughing and reduced working hours, 2020 changed the financial circumstances of many people, so it’s not a shock to find that more than a third of British people are worried about their finances as a result of the Covid-19 crisis, according to Aviva.The pandemic has shown that the future is impossible to predict, but surely that’s all the more reason to prepare for the unexpected when it comes to your money.Resist kneejerk reactionsSelling your car or leaping into a less-than-ideal job can seem like sensible moves when your financial circumstances change suddenly, but it’s not the time for kneejerk decisions. “Never rush into rash decisions because of loss of income,” says Laura Stewart-Smith, Aviva workplace savings manager, “Instead, take time to think things over before taking any action in relation to your finances.”Impulsive reactions aside, moving quickly to take stock and regain control of your finances is something Stewart-Smith recommends for anyone faced with loss of income. “Don’t delay in facing the facts – doing so sooner rather than later is likely to be better for your wellbeing, and can actually help you feel better compared with the uncertainty of not knowing your true financial position,” she says.Build a budgetIf your income drops, your first task should be to draw up a revised household budget. Cheryl Sharp, founder of the accountancy firm Pink Pig Financials, recommends analysing bank statements from the past three months to track where your money goes and identify savings you can quickly make.“Categorise everything into how important the spend is – for example, your mortgagerent is critical but a take-away coffee is a luxurynice to have,” she says.With your budget in place, you can formulate a plan to live within your means and avoid or get out of debt. But don’t start a budget and then forget about it. “Share it with someone you trust for accountability, and then track, review and adjust your budget as your circumstances change,” says Sharp.Don’t forget to include annual costs. Plan to put money aside each month towards those once-a-year bills, so they don’t come as a surprise.Pick up the phone“Talk to your bank and any other financial providers you have relationships with because they may be able to help,” says Stewart-Smith. “Ask what’s available in your circumstances, and whether you can review your package or defer payments. You might have payment protection that can kick in if you lose your job or experience loss of income, but you won’t necessarily know unless you pick up the phone and speak to those experts.”Don’t ditch insurance“Check whether you’ve got insurance policies designed to help if the worst happens, such as payment protection insurance, mortgage payment protection insurance or short-term income protection insurance,” says Jay Lee, a mortgage adviser and founder of uAcademy, which provides training for mortgage advisers. “They might be part of a bank-account package or a mortgage add-on product, so you may not even realise you have them.”It can be tempting to cut costs by ditching insurance policies when your income changes. “Don’t – your home is your castle and you should protect it, so buildings and contents insurance is a must,” says Lee.Reviewing your home insurance policy, however, does make sense when your finances change. “If you’re worried about unexpected expenses during a period of reduced income, you could invest in add-on packages such as boiler repair or accidental damage and home emergencies policies, which will cover these eventualities.”Ponder your pensionIf you make fixed monthly payments into a pension, it may be worth switching to a flexible plan if making the payments is too much of a financial stretch. “It’s also worth reviewing your pension, as you may be paying higher annual charges than you would in a different scheme,” says Lee.While paying lower charges today won’t immediately put money in your pocket, you could end up with a bigger pension pot in the future, making you better off when you retire.Start a rainy day fundHaving an existing savings pot can help soften the blow when the unexpected impacts your income. Even if you haven’t got that to fall back on, don’t make the mistake of thinking saving is only for when finances are flush. The best time to start saving is now.“Some people believe they don’t have any spare cash to put away for emergency savings, but this is rarely the case,” says Claire Roach, founder of Money Saving Central.“Even when your income is reduced, put as much as possible into an emergency fund each month – aim to save three to six months of basic living expenses so you can take control of your finances during times of illness or unexpected loss of income, and continue to meet your financial obligations.”Consider new income opportunities A loss of income can hit hard, but it can sometimes yield new opportunities. Lee lost his job in fraud investigation for a UK bank during the first lockdown, but it prompted him to launch his business running online training courses for mortgage advisers, which now turns over £5,000 a month.“It was an extremely worrying time as not only had I lost my job, but lockdown meant I couldn’t find any other work to keep me going until the situation improved,” he says.“I set up my business hoping it would cover a few of my bills, but within weeks I was making enough money to keep running my household.”Above all, remember that support is available when your financial circumstances change. “Take all the practical steps to shore up your finances and make sure your money is working as hard as it possibly can for you. Also, check whether you can apply for any benefits, speak to your tax office to see if you’re eligible for rebates, and look into tax-efficient investments and savings vehicles,” says Stewart-Smith.“Then remind yourself that the situation is not your fault. Loss of income is very often outside of an inidual’s control. But there are many organisations that can help. You’re not alone.”The views expressed in this article do not constitute financial advice.

Try not to panic, say experts, because retirement savings are long-term investmentsCovid-19 has turned the world upside down, sending Britain into its worst recession since records began. People may worry about what this means for their pension pot, wonder whether they can afford to save, or even consider raiding their retirement fund. What is the reality for pensions in a recession and how can you secure your future in uncertain times?Don’t panicSeamus Walsh, a pension guidance expert for Aviva, says that many people were spooked by the impact of the virus on stocks and shares earlier last year: “When big drops occurred in the markets back in March, some customers asked to switch funds. But ... things have been tracking upwards since.”Any panic may well be misguided as pensions are meant to be long-term investments that ride the highs and lows of stock markets. After the last financial crisis, pension funds recovered their losses when equities rebounded. This time round, while stock markets have been volatile since Covid-19 struck, news of potential vaccines has helped them, and pension funds, to recover lost ground.“Pensions investments are for the long term,” says Walsh. “The longer your money is invested, the longer it has to recover from any dips.”Where is your money? “People should know where their money is invested and be comfortable with the balance of their portfolio,” Walsh says. “Your pension provider can discuss your options. If you’re prepared to pay for advice, seek out a financial adviser.”While equities have had a volatile year, fluctuations should even out over time. Cautious investors may opt for a more balanced portfolio, with some money invested in cash or government bonds, which are regarded as a safe haven. Age is another factor – those nearing retirement may move more money into bonds as they will need to access their cash soon, while younger savers have more time to make up short-term losses.Choose the right pensionMany people struggle to understand pensions but given their importance, it’s worth spending time getting your head around the details. Final salary, also known as “defined benefit”, pensions are the gold standard, but many employers have moved away from providing such generous schemes that give a guaranteed retirement income. More common are defined contribution schemes where employees build up inidual pension pots through their contributions and those of their employer. They know what they are putting in, but the payout is less certain, as it depends on the performance of the markets and your pension provider in managing your fund.Under automatic enrolment, a government initiative to increase the number of people saving for retirement, employees are automatically signed up for the pension their employer offers. As long as you don’t opt out, you will make contributions alongside your employer, and receive tax relief on the money you pay in.Alistair McQueen, Aviva’s head of savings and retirement, says: “For employed iniduals, any money they pay in is boosted by their employer under automatic enrolment. They can’t access money until they are 55, but they do get money from their employer they wouldn’t otherwise receive.”Things are a bit different for people who are self-employed. They can pay into a personal pension set up with a provider of their choice or choose a self-invested personal pension (Sipp), which gives investors control over how money is invested. “Self-employed people should be aware of the boost a pension gives in tax relief,” says McQueen.An important source of income for most pensioners remains the state pension. For people who are uncertain how much they will receive and when, the government has an online calculator to give an accurate forecast, and help people plan ahead.McQueen adds: “From 55, you can access your pension, but there are implications for your retirement finances, plus tax issues if you take out a lump sum. Also, the amount you can save into a pension later may be affected. Seek help. You could turn to Pension Wise, the Money Advice Service, the Pensions Advisory Service, Citizens Advice or your pensions providers’ support services.”Some people may feel they cannot afford pension payments if they are unemployed, furloughed or have seen earnings slump, but it is wise not to stop payments if you possibly can as this is likely to mean you have less to retire on. McQueen says: “Pension products are very flexible, allowing you to stop, start, increase and decrease contributions. Talk to your provider to make adjustments. Before you act, check a pensions calculator online to assess the long-term implications.”Why pension saving is usually a good ideaExperts insist there is no bad time to start a pension. And be reassured savings are protected by the Pensions Protection Fund. McQueen says: “All pensions are heavily regulated by government regulators. Iniduals also have recourse to the Pensions Ombudsman if they feel mistreated.”The views expressed in this article do not constitute financial advice.

There is immense pride among health workers able to protect the most vulnerable and witnessing at first hand the enormous gratitude and relief of patients. This light is so important amid the darkness.But in the past week over 230,000 cases have been recorded, including more than 60,000 in a single day, a new dismal high 30,000 have been admitted to hospital. Almost 3,000 are fighting for their lives in ICU ventilation. Per capita, the UK has more new cases than any other major country in the world. Our health service has been under-resourced and understaffed for years under the Tories. Now it is pushed to the limit.Oxygen supplies are under pressure, important operations have been cancelled, ambulances are backed up, and hospitals warn they could be soon overwhelmed. Questions about emergency rationing are starting to be tentatively raised. The NHS is in its hour of greatest need, and it cannot dial 999.No one should be surprised we are in another lockdown, the real question is: why did the government not take action sooner, saving lives and limiting the growth of the next wave?Matt Hancock reported a new strain had been identified on 14 December, the prime minister learned of its infectiousness on 18 December. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) raised the prospect of lockdown on 22 December. Where was the urgency and focus from the prime minister?Yet again the government was slow to act, outpaced by the exponential growth of this deadly virus. How come the prime minister, with all the scientific expertise at his disposal, all the power to make a difference, keeps on getting it wrong? The government hasn’t been short of data, it has been short of judgment. It is as though the prime minister has been allowing the virus to make all the big decisions.With almost 80,000 dead, we can’t have more tragic delay. Breaking chains of transmission, squashing infections and rapid vaccination rollout are all now fiercely urgent.First, on transmission, there are 10 million key workers across the UK, the vast majority of whom aren’t able to work from home on laptops. Our key workers are the backbone of our country, yet the Tories take their efforts and their health for granted.Many are low paid, use public transport to get to work and, by the nature of their jobs, experience social mixing. By going to work to keep society functioning they are exposing themselves and their families to greater risk. They deserve so much better.Making every workplace Covid-secure must be a national priority. The TUC is urging workplace safety guidance to be updated to include greater use of mask wearing, social distancing and, crucially, the introduction of safety standards for ventilation.This crisis has brought society’s fractures into sharper focus. Covid exploits inequalities, with those from poorer backgrounds being disproportionately impacted by it.Chronic staff shortages across the NHS are now exacerbated by this rampant virus that has sent 30,000 NHS off sick. NHS staff left undefended without adequate PPE in the first wave now feel unprotected while waiting for the vaccine in the face of a raging second wave.While the government intends to vaccinate all frontline staff, given the current situation, this is not urgent enough. We’re demanding that ministers offer vaccinations to all frontline staff over the next 14 days. It is the very least they deserve. The NHS will start publishing daily vaccination figures from Monday. I urge ministers to publish daily figures of numbers of NHS staff vaccinated as well.We have already seen two worrying variants emerge, with the UK B117 strain and the South African strain. Put simply, the more virus there is circulating, the more opportunities it has to mutate further – mutations that could give it an advantage in evading the immune response.We are therefore in a race against evolution. For all our sakes, we need to make this lockdown work and go further and faster, both at home and across the globe, to roll out vaccination now. There isn’t a moment to lose when so many lives are on the line."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60921b1f182b2ac86a7fa6e8352b33f98ae21504/0_270_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=1d00bd07d7493368aec2858e94fd6c7b","title":"chorley derby fa cup match report","story":"National League North side Chorley are in the fourth round of the FA Cup for the first time in their 138-year history, after defeating a Derby side reduced to fielding an entire team of youth players following a Covid-19 outbreak.With interim manager Wayne Rooney and his entire first-team squad isolating, development coach Pat Lyons selected a Derby side without a single minute of senior game time. Such was the level of inexperience in the away side, the Derby players wore numbers 1-11 on their shirts, due to none of them actually having a senior squad number.They did the Championship club proud with their endeavour but ultimately failed to avoid elimination, after goals from Connor Hall and Mike Calveley deservedly ensured Chorley became the first sixth-tier side to reach this stage of the FA Cup since Havant \u0026amp Waterlooville in 2008. The Lancashire club are now also only one win away from becoming just the 10th team at their level to reach the fifth round.But no matter what happens next, Chorley will be in the hat for the last 16, as the draw for rounds four and five will take place at the same time. Their manager, Jamie Vermiglio, who works as a headteacher at a local school, had stressed his side were still underdogs despite the Covid outbreak which had depleted Derby’s ranks.Yet within 10 minutes they were ahead, after Derby failed to clear their lines from a Willem Tomlinson corner and allowed Hall to head in at the near post. Four minutes earlier, Derby thought they had won a penalty when Matthew Urwin brought down Cameron Cresswell, but the referee, Kevin Friend, changed his decision after deciding Urwin had won the ball.That, in truth, was the closest Derby came to troubling Chorley all afternoon. The young Rams players were certainly not short on spirit but they lacked the physicality to match their more senior opponents, despite the hosts, who are 125th in the league pyramid, being a part-time outfit.Chorley dominated the majority of the contest, and after several near-misses either side of half-time, their control was finally rewarded seven minutes from time, when Calveley prodded home from an Elliot Newby cross to ensure their place in the next round."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f0cf752fc113dd6071077806ad4687972eac6a3/0_266_4618_2771/master/4618.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d6d05ab7ca0604156efbba2ee2ccf85","title":"chorley v derby county fa cup third round live","story":"The semi-pro seniors ran out comfortable winners over the inexperienced young professionals at Victory ParkAaron Bower was at Victory Park to see Chorley advance to the fourth round for the first time in their history.

Peep! Peeeeeeep! From the National League North, the sixth tier of English football, Chorley advance to the fourth round of this season’s FA Cup.

THere are Chorley players ququeing up for it, but Calveley steers the ball home on the volley with his right foot. Looks like there’s little chance of extra time after all.82 min: Just the one goal in it as we go into the final 10 minutes. Should Derby chisel out an equaliser and the score remain level at the end of normal time, the game would go into extra time and then penalties if required. There are no replays in the FA Cup this season.80 min: Chorley goalscorer Connor Hall limps off with what looks like a knee injury and is replaced by Lewis Reilly. 77 min: Cardwell heads over on the stretch for Chorley at the far post, after getting on the end of a cross from Newby. It was a mite too high for him and he couldn’t get much purchase on his header.76 min: Ebosele has a cross cut out by Tomlinson and Derby have a corner. The ball’s floated into the area, headed across the face of goal and ends up in the arms of Chorley goalkeeper Matt Urwin.75 min: Derby County take off defender Max Bardell and replace him with target man Bartosz Cybulski, who looks about seven foot tall. He has the physique of a young Peter Crouch.72 min: Free-kick for Chorley, who have just brought on Adamn Henley for - I think - Andy Halls. It’s a long way out and the ball’s floated out for a goal kick.69 min: Chorley corner. A wonderful delivery is sent towards the far post, where Harry Cardwell I didn’t get almost scores with a header despite being face down on the ground. The ball is hacked clear by Isaac Hutchinson before it trundles over the line.65 min: Derby substitution: Festy Ebosele comes on for Osazee Aghatise. I’m delighted with that, because young Festy is one of only two players in either squads that I know anything about! A native of Wexford in the Republic of Ireland, he joined Derby County from Bray Wanderers. Bray, of course, being in County Wicklow and the local team of top comedian and amateur astronomer Dara O Briain.63 min: Having apparently weathered Derby’s early second half storm, Chorley are back in the ascendency. Getting on the end of a good cross from the right, Mike Calveley heads a good scoring opportunity downwards and left of the upright. He’ll be disappointed with that, Clive.63 min: With a pull-back from the byline, Newby tees up Cardwell for Chorley, but his shot on the turn is blocked.60 min: A lot of the play being condensed in the middle third of the pitch, punctuated by regular throw-ins. Derby win a free-kick wide on the right, which Chorley clear, but only as far as Dylan Williams for the visitors.58 min: An impromptu game of head tennis over by the technical areas ends with the ball going out of play and assorted players from both teams claiming the throw-in. It goes the way of Derby. 57 min: For Chorley, Elliot Newby creates room for a shot on the edge of the Derby penalty area, but fires straight at Matt Yates.55 min: Derby County look like a different side in this second half, playing with a vim, vigour and confidence that was not evident in the first 45 minutes. They haven’t created anything in the way of a chance, but are giving Chorley far more to think about.52 min: Curiously, the unconfirmed word on the street is that Chorley don’t have a goalkeeper on their bench, for reasons that aren’t quite clear.I’m guessing they don’t have one availalable - it would be quite the gamble to not have a reserve goalkeeper in the squad, particularly in a game where each team is allowed five substitutes. 50 min: Derby win a free-kick wide on the left, a long way out. The ball’s played into the mixer, half-cleared and eventually ends up in the hands of Chorley goalkeeper Matt Urwin.49 min: Better from Derby, who seem to have upped their game considerably after a fairly feeble first half effort. 48 min: Derby played themselves into trouble there, trying to play the ball out from the back. Harrison Solomon lost the ball, which was played to Hall, who was unamrked in acres of space. 47 min: Connor Hall strikes a venomous shot towards the bottom left-hand corner form about 20 yards out, but Derby County goalkeeper Matt Yates gets down to save with a strong right hand.46 min: Play resumes with Derby going on the attack in the opening seconds of the second half. Chorley win a throw-in deep inside their own half and use the opportunity to clear their lines.Looking at that reversed penalty decision again: Matt Urwin came off his line to contest a through ball with the oncoming Cameron Cresswell, might have won the ball and brought the Derby man down at the same time.Having seen it in slow motion another two times, I’m still not convinced the goalkeeper got the ball, but in the BT Sport studio, Robbie Savage is certain he did.What I can tell you for certain is that Kevin Friend, the only man whose opinion matters, originally awarded a spot-kick before overturning his decision on the advice of his linesman. A reminder: there is no VAR in this game, technology is only being used in games that are being played in Premier League grounds that are equipped for it. I’m not sure that’s entirely fair, but them’s the rules. Peep! Kevin Friend brings the first half to a close. Chorley from the sixth tier lead the youth of Championship side Derby County by the only goal of the game, a scoreline that doesn’t do the home side’s dominance justice.45+1 min: Another Chorley corner ends with Ollie Shenton shooting into the side-netting from a very tight angle.44 min: We approach half-time with Connor Hall’s headed goal separating the sides, but in truth there’s been a gulf in physicality, if not necessarily class.The grown-up part-timers have completely dominated the youthful full-timers, who can consider themselves pretty fortunate to still be in the game. 42 min: A let-off for Derby! Will Tomlinson rattles the cross-bar with a lobbed volley from distance that had Matt Yates well and truly beaten. The effort presented itself when a long-throw was cleared his way and sat up nicely. If his improvised effort had gone in it would almost certainly have been a goal of the round contender. 40 min: Max Bardell gets the better of makeshift Chorley left-back Lewis Baines and tries to tee up Bobby Duncan with a pull-back, but Chorley keeper Matt Urwin intervenes and es on the ball.38 min: Cardwell wins another flick on which lands at the feet of Elliot Newby on the right flank. He cuts inside and tries his luck from distance but his effort sails high over the crossbar. 36 min: Chorley goalkeeper Matt Urwin lumps the ball long and Harry Cardwell wins another flick-on for his side. Derby clear on this occasion but Cardwell is a big unit and a constant threat.34 min: Derby County have yet to register an attempt on goal, while their hosts have had five. Chorley win another corner and the ball is swung to the near post, where it’s cleared.32 min: Bobby Duncan, a cousin of Steven Gerrard and former Liverpool acadamy prospect, protests when the ball goes out for what he thinks should be a Derby County corner, only for a goal kick to be awarded to Chorley.28 min: From the byline, Connor Hall pulls the ball back to Mike Calveley in the penalty area through the legs of a defender. Calveley’s first touch is awful and a good scoring chance goes to waste.

Bournemouth 3-1 Oldham (King 74) or Oldham 1-3 Bournemouth (King 74), whichever you prefer. Quite a few headed goals this afternoon. Here’s another!Still plenty of time to go in the 3pm kick-offs. But there’s a big match kicking off in just under an hour, and the teams contesting it have landed. Barry Glendenning has the details of The Arsenal v Newcastle United.BREAKING NEWS: Big Sam continues to stomp about the technical area with a face on.Burke continues to shine against Bristol Rovers. He drives down the left and sends a shot across Day and off the base of the right-hand post. Meanwhile another near miss, this time at Ewood Park, where Blackburn still trail Doncaster. Harvey Elliott has come on, and goes close with a curler towards the top left. Balcombe in the Donny goal fingertips spectacularly, then parries the rebound as well. Magnificent play all round.GOAL! Blackpool 2-1 WBA (Madine 66). A lovely sweeping move by the 1953 winners, and Big Sam is under pressure again! Lovely combination play between Yates and Madine, and the latter moves into space down the middle before whistling a low shot into the bottom left! Anyone interested in the aforementioned Matthews Final should click below, or perhaps consider this.Whatever happens in Bristol, this should serve Sheffield United well. They’ve been so constipated in the Premier League, with just eight goals in 17 matches. This should blow a few cobwebs off, and yes, it’s for the best that I mixed metaphors there.GOAL! Bristol Rovers 2-3 Sheffield United (Bogle 63). More good work by Burke, followed by a smooth run into the area by Bogle down the inside-right channel. He slots home at the near post, and this is turning into a classic!GOAL! Bristol Rovers 2-2 Sheffield United (Ehmer 62). A corner from the right. A flick-on at the near post, and Ehmer can’t miss from a couple of yards. Dismal defending. However ...GOAL! Bristol Rovers 1-2 Sheffield United (Burke 59). The latest jinking genius off the Scottish conveyor belt is sent scampering down the middle. No mistake. He slots home. However...GOAL! Stoke 0-2 Leicester (Albrighton 59). A lovely goal this, as the ever-underrated Albrighton swans in from the right, drops a shoulder, and whips a lovely curler into the bottom left. Could this be Leicester’s year in the FA Cup at long last? Four losing appearances out of four in the final. It has to happen sometime, surely.Just in case you’ve been as confused as me ... and if that’s that case, I feel for you ... but the Oldham-Bournemouth tie is being played at the Vitality Stadium, on account of the Boundary Park being frozen. So we’ve been referring to Bournemouth-Oldham as well as Oldham-Bournemouth. No idea what the official line is. I suspect traditionalists will go with the latter, as per the draw, but for clarity I may keep on with the former. In either instance, feel free to sue us.GOAL! Blackpool 1-1 WBA (Ajayi 52).

Remember, extra time and penalties could be coming up. Almost certainly will be, somewhere or other. Here we go, then.The half-times, then. A very entertaining first 45.At Burnley, Richard Keogh is shown the red card when the ball hits his hand as he covers as last man. Has a clear scoring opportunity been denied? Not according to VAR, because Chris Wood, who would otherwise have been sent clear, was offside. Or was Wood in the process of fouling Keogh? Either way, the decision is overturned.GOAL! Oldham 1-1 Bournemouth (Bahamboula pen 45). Keillor-Dunn is brought down by Dennis - or was it a e? It’s soft, put it that way. Bahamboula smashes the gift home. GOAL! Wycombe 3-1 Preston (Jakobsen pen 43). A lifeline for Preston just before the break, as Allsop rashly brings down Riis. Jakobsen slams the penalty home.GOAL! Blackburn 0-1 Doncaster (Richards 42). A speculative long-range effort by Richards finds the bottom right, Pears in the Blackburn goal at fault for weak hands.GOAL! Bournemouth 1-0 Oldham (Brooks 43). Not long after nearly going behind, saved by the woodwork, the Cherries take the lead with a deflected long-range effort from Brooks.GOAL! Blackpool 1-0 WBA (Yates 41). The Seasiders work the ball down the left. A low cross is whistled along the corridor of uncertainty. West Brom’s defence does what it usually does, standing stock still to a man. Yates comes in from the other flank to slam home from close range. On the touchline, Big Sam fumes. He’ll run out of lug-steam soon, the way this season is going. One man can only generate so much. But a shock is on!Oldham hit the woodwork against Bournemouth! Barnett drifts in from the left, and curls with purpose towards the top right. The ball caroms off the upright and away. What an effort that was.Sheffield United have the ball in the Bristol Rovers net, but it’s disallowed. Egan rises to smash a header goalwards. Day parries. Mousset slams home. But Egan is penalised for climbing all over his opponent. BREAKING NEWS: On BT Sport, Peter Walton agrees with the referee’s decision. To be fair, it is the correct outcome, but you get the wider point.WHAT A GOAL! Stoke 0-1 Leicester (Justin 34). James Justin cuts in from the left, beats two Stoke players, then curls a vicious shot into the top-right bin. Slightly surprised that the net, plus the entire frame of the goal, isn’t currently flying over the Stanley Matthews statue. That was one hell of a strike. And to think some were worried about missing Ben Chilwell.It could be one of those days for Burnley. They should equalise in short order, but somehow Tarkowski manages to hit the post from a couple of yards. What a miss!GOAL! Burnley 0-1 MK Dons (Jerome 29). The ball sent in from the left.

Wednesday are suddenly enjoying a rich vein of form under caretaker Neil Thompson.GOAL! Wycombe 3-0 Preston (Knight 25). A shock developing, of sorts, between these two Championship sides. A free kick sent out right is hoicked back into the six-yard box. Knight extends a telescopic leg to guide home from close range. This is over.There are going to be a lot of matches going to extra time at this rate. A reminder that there are no replays this season. Straight to extra time then penalties if needs be. Ah, the days of the multiple replay. There’s one of those old-school marathons in this JoS, which admittedly is mainly worth reading for an on-form Smyth wading in below the line throwing hands. Those were the days.GOAL! Bristol Rovers 1-1 Sheffield United (Kilgour 21). There are two isions between Rovers and United, but the scoreline is level at the Memorial Stadium. A deep right-wing cross is met by Kilgour, who rises regally and plants a glorious header into the top left. Keeper no chance! That is a lovely finish.Ah the magic of the long third-round lull. Don’t shoot the messenger.GOAL! Wycombe 2-0 Preston (Jacobson 9 pen). Ikpeazu is bundled over by a small pocket of air, or maybe the nearby Earl. It’s soft, but it’s given. Jacobson lashes it down the middle, and Wycombe have wandered out of the blocks at Olympic pace. GOAL! Stevenage 0-1 Swansea (Routledge 7). The second successful downward header of the afternoon, and the Swans take the lead against the League Two strugglers.GOAL! Bristol Rovers 0-1 Sheffield United (Day og 6). Osborn crosses dangerously from the left. Mousset rises and slams a header off the crossbar. The ball drops down and twangs off the back of the unfortunate Rovers keeper Day, who was sprawling mid-e. That’s unfortunate for poor Day, but the cross and header deserved reward.GOAL! Wycombe 1-0 Preston (Onyedinma 3). The first goal of the 3pms didn’t take long. A right-wing cross slung into the Preston box Fred Onyedinma rises at the far post and heads back across goal and into the bottom right. What a start for the Championship’s bottom side against 12th-placed Preston.Burnley have flown out of the box. A ball whipped into the Franchise FC ball from the left Chris Wood has his header tipped over after a mere 23 seconds.As we prepare for the 3pms, then, a reminder of all the early results:Anything spring out at you there? Seeing we’re under no obligation to get the pom-poms out and cheerlead for the FA, the answer is surely no. Not that we’re resorting to that tiresome old jaded-contrarian schtick it’s just that a lot of the participants really could do with Concentrating On The League in this concertinaed campaign for one reason or another. Of the 20 teams in action, five are making serious promotion pushes (Blackburn, Doncaster, Bournemouth, Swansea, Stoke) one has legitimate Premier League ambitions (Leicester) and ten are looking over their shoulders, sweating like someone who might have just blown his chances of getting his presidential pension (West Brom, Bristol Rovers, Sheffield United, Burnley, MK Dons, Sheffield Wednesday, QPR, Fulham, Stevenage and Wycombe). But on the flip side, there are no replays this season, so teams may go hell for leather anyway. Entertainment ahoy? Ach, why not. Entertainment ahoy!Good old Bob, eh kids? He’s already furnished you with the team news of all the upcoming kick-offs, but here’s an almost certainly redundant reminder of the 3pm fixture list, just in case, or for the record, or whatever.That’s it for the lunchtime games.

Separately, Marks \u0026amp Spencer said it was concerned that a third of the products in its Irish food halls, including Percy Pig sweets, would now be subject to import tariffs. Such taxes could spell higher prices for shoppers.DPD said new border procedures, including additional customs paperwork, needed for parcels destined for Europe were putting extra pressure on turnaround and transit times.The company said it was returning one-fifth of parcels to the sender because they had incorrect or incomplete data attached. It also blamed delays and congestion at UK ports for its decision, as well as more rigid requirements for Channel crossings. The firm said it hoped to restart the service on Wednesday.The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, said he expected there to be “significant additional disruption” at UK borders as a result of Brexit customs changes in the coming weeks. Speaking to broadcasters, he said: “So far disruption at the border hasn’t been too profound but it is the case that in the weeks ahead we expect that there will be significant additional disruption, particularly on the Dover-Calais route.It is our responsibility in government to make sure that business is as ready as possible, and hauliers and traders have already done a lot but we have to redouble our efforts to communicate the precise paperwork that is required in order to make sure that trade can flow freely.”Although the government sealed a “tariff-free” trade deal on Christmas Eve, it has emerged that food and clothing products that do not qualify as made in Britain could be hit with levies.Boris Johnson was said to have swerved the topic of Brexit impact in a call with more than 200 business leaders earlier this week. “It was a meaningless call, it was all mottoes – we are going to build back business better, build back business greener – and a few patsy questions about how much better it would be, nothing about the realities of Brexit and Covid hitting us all hard,” said one business leader.The department store chains Debenhams and John Lewis, which recently closed its international business, are among the big names no longer serving the Irish market. Fortnum \u0026amp Mason, the famous London department store, has also temporarily ceased shipping to Northern Ireland and EU countries.The bookseller Waterstones has also suspended sales to customers in EU countries, as has the fashion chain Jigsaw.Retailers have been hit by the cost of customs paperwork that applies to all imports and exports, including goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.M\u0026ampS has temporarily cut nearly 400 products from the food and drink aisles of its 20 stores in Northern Ireland. Sainsbury’s has made a similar move and filled the gaps on its shelves with products from Spar shops. The moves are designed to simplify the business and so avoid the delays at the border amid reports of retailers having trucks turned back.A spokesperson for M\u0026ampS said it had served customers in Northern Ireland for over 50 years and its priority was to provide the “same choice … our loyal customers have always enjoyed”. Its stores had been receiving regular deliveries this week but the changes came as it moved over to new processes, he said.M\u0026ampS has also warned that more than 2,000 of its food products, including Percy Pigs, could attract new import taxes when re-exported to its stores in EU countries such as Ireland and France. The new “rules of origin” regulations dictate whether tariffs must be paid based on where a product’s ingredients come from and where it has been manufactured.The M\u0026ampS chief executive, Steve Rowe, said: “Tariff-free does not feel like tariff-free when you read the fine print. For big businesses there will be time-consuming workarounds but for a lot of others this means paying tariffs or rebasing into the EU.”Tesco said it had experienced short delays moving goods into Northern Ireland but that it had a “good supply of products coming into Northern Ireland”. It added: “There has been a short delay on certain products but we’re working with suppliers to get these back on the shelves as quickly as possible and direct customers to alternatives where we can.”Tesco said it was discussing the rules of origin regulations with HMRC and Irish Revenue and hoped “to find a satisfactory resolution as quickly as possible”.The British Retail Consortium said: “At least 50 of our members, all of them large retailers, face potential tariffs for re-exporting goods to the EU.”Dominic Goudie, the head of international trade at the Food and Drink Federation, said some product-specific rules meant exports were no longer viable, with “serious challenges for supply chains that  across the UK and EU”.He also said EU-produced food and drink that moved to other EU markets via Great Britain without further manufacturing taking place in Britain faced the payment of full EU tariffs on return to the EU.“As a result, suppliers are being forced to cancel deliveries of products to customers, particular those in Ireland,” he added.One unnamed source for a logistics business spoke of mayhem behind the scenes. He described how one truckload of parcels had to be completely offloaded and relabelled on Thursday night before export to the EU, simply because one line on the code for goods was wrong.He also told of companies hiking charges for invoices to £3.50 a parcel going to Europe, making low-value goods too expensive to export.John Arbon Textiles, a small artisan knitting wool company in Devon, said it had been told by DPD that its spools and balls of fibre would not be accepted in Europe.“I feel DPD are being cautious, but I have no confidence that I can send anything to my customers in the EU at the moment,” the business’s owner, Juliet Arbon, said.Northern Ireland’s chief vet has said goods arriving in the region, which is now following EU rules for imports, would be destroyed or returned if not compliant after a short grace period.Robert Huey told a Stormont committee that some companies contracted to do the paperwork for hauliers were “overwhelmed” and in one case a staff member had to show a major supermarket how to complete its paperwork."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/409453f0a21d9ac60da25af2366bbce9460f997d/0_172_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=655dda52330d571c99c40d8b5564c79f","title":"england councils told to redouble efforts on housing rough sleepers covid vaccine","story":"Guidance also says rough sleepers must be able to access Covid vaccine in line with other at-risk priority groupsCouncils in England have been told by the government to “redouble their efforts” to house all rough sleepers, and make sure they are registered with a GP to enable them to receive a Covid vaccine over the next few weeks.The government also renewed existing temporary protections for renters by extending its ban on evictions for all but the most extreme cases for the next six weeks – until at least 21 February – with the policy kept under review.The announcement on Friday followed increasing pressure on ministers to step up their pandemic homelessness policy by campaigners alarmed at rising numbers of rough sleepers as the UK went into lockdown amid freezing winter weather.Issuing update guidance, the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, said: “At the start of this pandemic we made sure that the most vulnerable in society were protected. This winter, we are continuing in this vein and redoubling our efforts to help those most in need.”The guidance says local authorities must ensure rough sleepers can access the Covid-19 vaccine in line with other at-risk priority groups outlined by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, either via a GP or “by other means if mainstream provision is unsuitable”.Friday’s announcement was broadly welcomed by homelessness charities. Jon Sparkes, the chief executive of Crisis, called it a “lifesaving intervention” at the “most dangerous moment of the pandemic for those without a home”.While local authorities welcomed an extra £10m government funding to help support efforts to house rough sleepers over the next few weeks, they warned more cash would be needed.Although thousands of rough sleepers were taken off the streets during the first lockdown, there has been a rise in numbers since the original guidance lapsed in June, with many unable to access housing help from their local authority because they have no recourse to public funds, such as immigrants.The Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government said it expected councils to consider the needs of those who may otherwise be ineligible for support because of immigration status. A spokesperson said: “Councils must use their judgment in assessing what support they may lawfully give to each person on an inidual basis, considering that person’s specific circumstances and support needs.”There was a cautious welcome for the extension of the eviction ban. The housing charity Shelter said that while the ban did not halt the evictions process entirely, it was “the minimum required to keep more people safe in their homes” for the time being.The Welsh government has also extended its eviction ban – though for a longer period, until 31 March. “Renters should not be forced out of their homes, at a time when we are asking people to stay at home,” said the Welsh housing minister Julie James.The campaign group Generation Rent said the new arrangements in England weakened the government’s original guidance, which said renters could only face eviction if they had more than nine months of arrears. This has been shortened to six months."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dee918b482d7073f6e656871f6ac8b1ac53da127/0_50_3574_2144/master/3574.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=944b14077c17b9b23a249d4b7dc22b0a","title":"families who took on unjust benefits decisions","story":"In our latest report for the 2020  and Observer appeal, we talk to Child Poverty Action Group and those it has helped• Please donate to our appeal hereWhen Trudi and Gavin Scott moved back to the UK from New Zealand with their severely disabled son, Theo, in December 2016, it was the start of a “horrendous” few years of financial struggle triggered by the family being refused disability living allowance.At one point, when Gavin had to give up work to look after Theo while Trudi was recovering from a major operation, they had to scrape by on child benefit, tax credit cash and food bank vouchers, causing them to fall behind with bills.But in October 2020, in a case brought by the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) – one of the  and Observer’s 2020 appeal charities – they and another family successfully challenged the lawfulness of the DLA eligibility rules.“Four years of fighting just to get something for my son, who is a child and is disabled … I can’t tell you the stress and the strain,” said Trudi Scott, 50. She and Gavin, who is a prison officer, live just outside Norwich.Theo, who is now 12, has Down’s syndrome, a rare bladder dysfunction and other conditions including autism.An upper tribunal decision found that the rules relating to how long people have to be in the UK before being eligible to claim DLA had breached Theo’s human rights. As a result, the family is entitled to £22,910 (the DLA money he lost out on, plus the disabled child element of child tax credits and carer’s allowance), which they would spend on modifications to the house to help Theo. However, it is far from certain whether they will ever receive this money, as the government could yet appeal against the decision.The Scott’s case is just one of the most recent in a long line of successful legal actions the CPAG has mounted against unlawful or unjust social security decisions. In 2016 it won a “bedroom tax” case at the supreme court, meaning families with disabled children who needed overnight care would no longer be penalised. More recently, CPAG has achieved legal victories on everything from universal credit to the payments made to a family when the mother or father dies.Kevin Simpson, 41, an engineer who lives in Chester, lost out on a “life-changing” bereavement benefits payout – a lump sum of £3,500, plus £350 a month for 18 months – purely because he and his late partner, Debbie, who died of breast cancer in 2018, were not married (they were engaged but then “events took over”).CPAG took up his case, and that of another widower, arguing that restricting higher-rate bereavement support payment (BSP) to spouses was incompatible with human rights law and discriminated against children of unmarried parents. In February 2020 the high court ruled in their favour.Asked about how they had been managing financially over the past few months, Simpson said: “You do what you can do – you carry on. It’s all you can do … I’ve tried to do this for my kids, and for the next person this is going to happen to.”It is estimated that each year, about 2,000 families with children lose out on payments worth up to £9,800. It is possible Simpson could yet receive the money his family missed out on. After the verdict, the government said it would bring forward a remedial order to extend BSP to cohabitees with children. But this has not happened yet, and it is not known whether it will be applied retrospectively in full.CPAG also represented Sharon Pantellerisco, who in July 2020 won a high court victory against the Department for Work and Pensions after she was benefit-capped and left up to £463 a month worse off because of the way universal credit calculated her monthly earnings (the government has since been given permission to appeal the ruling).Pantellerisco, a 41-year-old care worker and single mother-of-four from Southport, Merseyside, was penalised purely because her employer paid her every four weeks rather than monthly.Clarke said: “You can get so far with policy work and campaigns work. This is about using the law to hold government bodies legally accountable for ensuring that the rights of children to a decent standard of living are recognised.”• Please donate to the  and Observer appeal here.

Some doctors and nurses have already quit.Dr Rebecca Lewis, a co-secretary of the Doctors’ Association UK and a senior intensive care registrar at the Royal Brompton hospital, said the government had done little to look after doctors and nurses, and that many had in effect been forced to work for 10 months without a break as a result of cancelled leave and staff shortages.“NHS staff repeatedly warned the government against relaxing guidelines over Christmas but unfortunately these warnings were not heeded, and we are now seeing the grave consequences,” she said.“It is becoming more and more difficult to see how we will avoid a mass exodus of doctors and nurses after all this is over, due to the impossible mental strain working through this pandemic has put them under. Little has been done to look after and protect those who are tasked with looking after us, and we will continue to see the consequences of this even beyond the pandemic.”Morale has also been sapped by some people’s flagrant breaches of restrictions, protests by Covid deniers outside some London hospitals over the past week.“It makes me feel so angry,” said an intensive care nurse at University College London hospital (UCLH), who asked not to be named. “I just saw them on the ground floor, not wearing any masks, but we didn’t discuss among colleagues because we don’t have any time.”The stress reached a peak this week seeing women like her, in their 30s, severely ill with the virus and fearing she could suffer the same fate.“I’ve got palpitations going into work, it’s so horrific. We’re not immune to trauma either,” she said.As she spoke to the  on Friday, the number of deaths recorded daily reached its highest since the start of the pandemic, and the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, declared a major incident as the number of infections in the capital rose steeply.Some sections of the public have failed to perceive the damage the virus is causing, according to a critical care nurse at Barnet hospital. “Fake news is really damaging, because some people believe it. I don’t know what their motivation is but ultimately it has a malicious intent,” she said.The government’s initial failure to prioritise healthcare staff for vaccination had also dampened staff’s spirits, she said, coming on the back of longstanding concerns over NHS underfunding and a wider failure to address poor public health.“Morale is dreadful, I’m really sorry to say that,” she said. “People do this job because they believe in it. We are one of the few countries in the world with universal healthcare from cradle to grave, but there’s a limit. People are working long shifts, are off sick, and there’s just so much work to do.”The enforced absence of patients’ families has also deeply affected healthcare workers. “The emotional and physical toll does not necessarily arise from wearing PPE all day and night its knowing families can’t be at the patients’ bedside,” said an intensive care doctor at UCLH. “It’s horrible having to update relatives over the phone to tell them that they’ve got worse or there’s no change.”With about four or five patients per nurse, as opposed to the ideal scenario of one-to-one care, there are concerns senior doctors could be forced to ration treatment if the rate of infection and hospital admissions does not subside quickly.A nurse treating Covid patients at the Royal London hospital said that in a recent fortnight, at least one person she had been caring for had died each shift. “Waking up in the morning to come in has just been getting harder and harder because every shift is complete shit,” she said. “But then you get on the tube after your shift and see people not wearing a mask, and there’s just still a lot of people out, considering how bad it is.”She hasn’t seen her siblings since March because she fears spreading Covid to her family, and believes the weekly clap for carers, which returned on Thursday, would remain a hollow gesture until more people begin obeying the lockdown.Back on the ward, capacity has long been exceeded and there have been chaotic scenes. “We had a Covid patient waiting in A\u0026ampE for up to 49 hours for a bed the other day, and that wasn’t even the worst we’ve had, she said. “My colleagues and friends have been great cheering me up. Just knowing that at some point it will eventually be over is the only thing keeping me going, but we’ve still got the peak to come.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fc244be325835aff40e52711b36474426608658/410_11_882_529/master/882.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a6c252a2e525f28c745609b35d40582","title":"irish film arracht eschews brit bashing to tackle famine taboo","story":"Foreign language Oscar entry is set in mid-19th century during failure of potato cropsBrit bashing is in vogue in Ireland. Brexit and the centenary of bloody atrocities during the war of independence have stirred historic grievances against the old colonial master.Posts on social media and rhetoric from Sinn Féin express anger about centuries of oppression and more recent British transgressions, a trend that last month prompted the president, Michael D Higgins, to call time on anglophobia.A new Irish language film is about to crash into the debate. Arracht, Ireland’s foreign film Oscar entry, is a period drama set during the most cataclysmic event in British-Irish history: the Great Famine.It centres on a fisherman in the west of Ireland who battles to survive when disease ravages potato crops in 1845, plunging the country into a cycle of starvation, misery and emigration that halved the population.Many in Ireland think the British government’s indifference and bungling amounted to genocide.The makers of Arracht however have sidestepped explicit politics and finger-pointing. The film depicts the land-owning gentry not as villainous agents of British colonialism but as people with deep ties to local communities.“I always dislike moustache-twirling bad guys in films,” said Tom Sullivan, the writer and director. “The landlords had intimate relationships with Irish people for generations. I leave it to other people to vilify the Brits.”The film showed the atrocious consequences of authorities who viewed the famine as God’s will or the result of native fecklessness, but it also showed the close bonds between Irish and British people, said the director. “Sometimes we don’t accept our history in an honest way. We’re intrinsically linked to the British and the English. The Brit bashing and the victim thing that is sometimes played out – we need to move beyond that.”The famine’s legacy still tangles Anglo-Irish relations. State papers released this week disclosed that John Major, when he was prime minister in 1996, stopped a plan to commemorate the famine’s 150th anniversary, deeming the issue too sensitive. The British home secretary, Priti Patel, caused indignation last year when she suggested food shortages in Ireland could give the UK leverage in Brexit talks.The Irish Film and Television Academy chose Arracht, which means Monster, as Ireland’s entry for the Oscars’ international feature film category. Members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will decide if it is nominated for the 93rd Oscars in April.Made for just €1.2m (£1m), Arracht received accolades at festivals in Tallinn, Dublin, Galway and Glasgow. The  called it a “beautifully crafted murder ballad”.A collaboration by TG4, Screen Ireland, and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, it is a double rarity in being in Irish and dealing with the famine, long a taboo topic for filmmakers.Black 47, a western-style revenge thriller set during the worst year of the famine, blazed a path and found critical and commercial success in 2018. It featured an Irish ranger who returns home after fighting for the British army in Afghanistan and discovers his family dead amid a wasteland of ruined crops and British callousness.Arracht centres on Colmán Sharkey, played by Dónall Ó Héalai, a fisherman who asks his English landlord to not raise the rent, an appeal that triggers violence and flight to an isolated island.“I like to tell the story of traumatised characters that manage to salve or heal their trauma,” said Sullivan. “This was about a fisherman who was isolated and something terrible that happened to him. The famine just crept in. I didn’t approach it from political standpoint.”The mass starvation had become “sacred ground” on which filmmakers feared to tread but that was changing, with at least three other films in development, said Sullivan, a Dubliner and fluent Irish speaker.The film is to be released in Ireland and the UK this year. The success of Parasite, the Oscar-winning South Korean film, and Scandinavian crime thrillers, shows audiences are embracing subtitles, said Sullivan. “Foreign languages are becoming more accessible to a general audience.”The film was shot in Lettermullen, a rural Irish-speaking area on the county Galway coast that averted need for sets or special effects, said Cúán Mac Conghail, a producer. “My mission was to make sure that nobody watched the film and thought of the budgets.” The story was intimate, said Mac Conghail. “How could you empathise with a million dead? But you could empathise with one.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47f389bce8e31bcc2fccefbc24c2b07c63b56cf0/0_206_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b23594417a5c0876890caf965279c7f5","title":"kim jong un calls us biggest enemy and says nuclear submarine plans complete","story":"North Korea should ‘further advance nuclear technology’ and develop more flexible attack capability, leader tells party congressNorth Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has called the United States his nuclear-armed nation’s “biggest enemy” and revealed that plans for a nuclear-powered submarine are complete, state media said.Kim’s declaration on Saturday also included a call to develop smaller, more adapatable nuclear warheads, comes less than two weeks before the inauguration of Joe Biden as US president, and after a tumultuous relationship between Kim and the outgoing Donald Trump.Kim and Trump first engaged in a war of words and mutual threats, before an extraordinary diplomatic “bromance” that featured headline-grabbing summits and declarations of love by the US president.But no substantive progress was made, with the process deadlocked after a meeting in Hanoi broke up over sanctions relief and what the North would be willing to give up in return.Pyongyang “should focus and be developed on subverting the US, the biggest obstacle for our revolution and our biggest enemy”, Kim told the five-yearly congress of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea, the official KCNA news agency reported.“No matter who is in power, the true nature of its policy against North Korea will never change,” it quoted him as saying, without mentioning Biden by name.Pyongyang has poured vast amounts of resources into developing its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, which it says it needs to defend itself against a possible US invasion.The programmes have made rapid progress under Kim, including by far its most powerful nuclear blast to date and missiles capable of reaching the whole US, at a cost of increasingly stringent international sanctions.The North has completed plans for a nuclear-powered submarine, Kim said – something that would change the strategic balance.“New planning research for a nuclear-powered submarine has been completed and is to enter the final examination process,” Kim told the congress.The country should “further advance nuclear technology” and develop small-sized, lightweight nuclear warheads “to be applied differently depending on target subjects”, he added.He said North Korea must also advance the precision attack capability on targets in the 15,000km (9,320-mile) striking range, an apparent reference to the US mainland, and develop technology to manufacture smaller, lighter nuclear warheads to be mounted on long-range missiles more easily.“Nothing would be more foolish and dangerous than not strengthening our might tirelessly and having an easy-going attitude at a time when we clearly see the enemy’s state-of-the-art weapons are being increased more than ever,” Kim said. “The reality is that we can achieve peace and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula when we constantly build up our national defense and suppress U.S. military threats.”The comments came in Kim’s nine-hour work report to the meeting, spread over three days, which KCNA was reporting in detail for the first time.Agence France-Presse and Associated Press contributed to this report."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fffe037ef2560664ed84e22d02cf43b59626dc4/0_57_3784_2271/master/3784.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8167c8e136ee7e56d50547a1c0daa4c4","title":"sriwijaya aeroplane loses contact after takeoff indonesia","story":"Suspected debris found in sea after Sriwijaya Air flight went missing shortly after takeoffAn Indonesian passenger plane carrying 62 people that went missing on Saturday is feared to have crashed, after suspected debris was found in the sea north of Jakarta.The Boeing 737-500, which departed from Jakarta’s international airport at about 2.36pm, lost contact four minutes later. Data from the flight tracker FlightRadar24 said Sriwijaya Air flight SJ182 had reached an altitude of nearly 11,000ft (3,350 metres) before dropping to 250ft.The plane was carrying 50 passengers, including seven children, among them three infants, and 12 crew members, according to the transport ministry. It was scheduled to make a 90-minute journey over the Java Sea to Pontianak, the capital of West Kalimantan province on Borneo island.A local fisherman reported that he had seen possible debris at 3.30pm, when an explosion was first heard, according to Deby Riana Sumanthi, the head of maritime agriculture and food security for the sub-department of Thousand Island-Jakarta.Footage of suspected wreckage was also broadcast on Indonesian TV. “We found some cables, a piece of jeans, and pieces of metal on the water,” a security official told CNNIndonesia. It has not been confirmed that the debris came from the flight.Agus Haryono, a rescue agency official, told Reuters that 50 people were searching for the aircraft and would continue working into the night. Indonesia’s transport ministry said it was investigating the incident.“A Sriwijaya plane from Jakarta to Pontianak with call sign SJY182 has lost contact,” said ministry spokesman Adita Irawati. “It last made contact at 2:40 pm (0740 GMT).”The president director of Sriwijaya Air, Jefferson Irwin Jauwena, said the airline was coordinating with Basarnas, the National Search and Rescue Agency and the National Transport Safety Committee. The airline, which was founded in 2003, mostly flies within Indonesia and has an otherwise solid safety record.The plane, a Boeing 737-500, does not use the same software system as those involved in two crashes that killed hundreds of people and left Boeing in crisis, according to Reuters.In October 2018, 189 people were killed when a Lion Air Boeing 737 Max jet crashed into the sea minutes after taking off from Jakarta for a domestic flight. Months later, a Boeing 737 Max 8 crashed in Ethiopia, killing all 157 people onboard. The US justice department fined Boeing $2.5bn last week after the company was charged with fraud and conspiracy in connection with two crashes.A Boeing spokeswoman said: “We are aware of media reports from Jakarta, and are closely monitoring the situation. We are working to gather more information.”Indonesia, the world’s largest archipelago nation, has also been criticised for poor safety standards in its aviation industry, which has been plagued by accidents.

The news comes as Marseille joins Strasbourg and Dijon in having its curfew moved forward to 6pm from 8pm, running through to 6am the following morning.The tighter restrictions form part of the government’s response to halt the spread of the virus. In the UK, 1,035 more people have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, according to government data, bringing the total to 80,868.The government said that, as of 9am on Saturday, there had been a further 59,937 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK, meaning the total number of cases has now exceeded three million.Friday saw the highest number of UK deaths- 1,325- reported on a single day since the outbreak began. There were 59,937 people in the UK that tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday, down from 68,053 the previous day. See the official release here.A long queue has been seen in Forest Hill, south London, as people queued to receive Covid-19 vaccinations.Maria Demetrious filmed a queue winding around several corners after dropping off her father, 85, and mother, 79, for his jab at the Jenner Practice on Friday.Her brother, Paul, who posted the video on Twitter, said: “My parents have been isolating since February 20. On arrival for Dad’s Covid-19 vaccine time slot met this circus! They left without it!” The Care Quality Commission commented on the video, saying the incident had been raised for review.Hi everyone, this is Yohannes Lowe. I’ll be taking over the live blog now. As always, please feel free to drop me a message on Twitter if you have any coverage suggestions. The UK’s health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said he is delighted that the Queen has had her first dose of the vaccine.The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh have received their Covid-19 vaccinations, joining more than a million people in the UK who have been given the jab.In an unusual move Buckingham Palace, which rarely comments on the private health matters of the monarch, 94, and her husband, had been given the injection.It is understood that the Queen decided the information should be made public to prevent inaccuracies and further speculation. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said:The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have today received Covid-19 vaccinations.A royal source confirmed to PA Media that the injections were administered by a royal household doctor at Windsor Castle.The Queen and Prince Philip have been spending the lockdown in England at Windsor Castle, in Berkshire, after deciding to have a quiet Christmas and forgo the traditional family gathering at Sandringham.Health officials in Ireland have said they believe that three cases of the South African coronavirus variant have been contained.The country is grappling with a surge that has exceeded the first wave of the pandemic. On Friday it confirmed its first cases of the variant in people who had travelled to Ireland from South Africa over the Christmas holidays.Cillian De Gascun, the head of Ireland’s national virus laboratory, told the national broadcaster RTÉ:The UK variant is of more concern to us purely because of the amount of virus that’s on the island, and we know that it’s transmitting in the community.The good thing about the South African variant is we know exactly where those cases came from, they have been contained, controlled and contact-traced, and to the best of my knowledge there was no onward transmission.The government on Wednesday announced its strictest lockdown measures since early last year, warning that a “tsunami” of infections fuelled by the UK variant and the relaxation of curbs ahead of Christmas could overwhelm the healthcare system. France is to extend its Covid-19 curfew to a further eight departments, the country’s prime minister, Jean Castex, said on Saturday, citing a “tough and necessary” response as some opposed the restrictions in several cities. France has been increasing its anti-virus restrictions in the face of rising cases and imposed a post-New Year curfew on 15 of its 101 departments, Agence France-Presse reports. The country has recorded about 67,000 deaths to date from some 2.7m cases and the R value is rising. The new departments likely to be subject to an earlier curfew are primarily in the east of the country, including Bas-Rhin, Haut-Rhin and Côte d’Or, as well as the central one of Cher.Castex highlighted the southern port of Marseille, France’s second largest city, where local politicians of all stripes have voiced opposition to extending the partial lockdown and questioned its effectiveness. “In reality we are applying the same criteria to Marseille as we apply elsewhere,” he said, confirming the earlier lockdown would be extended to eight departments including the Bouches-du-Rhone, which includes Marseille. “Everybody is conscious of the epidemic not weakening or that on the contrary it is growing stronger in some areas,” he said. Opinion polls show around half the French population are sceptical about having the jab, notably more than in neighbouring countries. Turkey confirmed 11,749 new cases on Friday, including 1,291 asymptomatic patients, taking the tally of infections to 2.3 million. 186 further deaths were recorded, bringing the country’s total to 22,450, the Andalou Agency reported.The figures represent a significant drop in the countrywide number of coronavirus cases from the 32,102 new infections reported on 15 December.Koca added that discussions with public health authorities in four of Turkey’s biggest cities on preparations to start Turkey’s vaccination campaign were ongoing.A growing number of scientists are calling for tighter restrictions in England in light of surging infections in many parts of the country.Prof Robert West, a participant in the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (SPI-B), said the current restrictions are “still allowing a lot of activity which is spreading the virus”. The professor of health psychology at University College London said he, as well as other epidemiologists, medical scientists and virologists he has spoken to, think the rules should be tightened.He told BBC News that more children were going to school than in the first lockdown and that schools were “a very important seed of community infection”. Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine will arrive in France on Monday, French prime minister Jean Castex said, as the country steps up its vaccination drive following a sluggish start. Castex and the health minister, Olivier Veran, visited a health centre in Tarbes, southwestern France, on Saturday as part of the government’s campaign to accelerate France’s vaccine rollout. Vaccinations also took place in Taverny, near Paris. The French medical regulator HAS said on Friday it had approved the Moderna vaccine, having previously cleared PfizerBioNTech’s rival.  President Emmanuel Macron held phone conversations on Friday with German chancellor Angela Merkel and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen to discuss Europe’s vaccine strategy, Reuters reports.US-based Moderna said on Monday the it would produce at least 600m doses of its Covid-19 vaccine in 2021, up by 100m doses from its previous forecast. There have been a further 2,373 cases of coronavirus in Wales, taking the total number of confirmed cases to 168,094. Public Health Wales reported another 62 deaths, taking the total in Wales since the start of the pandemic to 3,919. A nurse working in a hospital in the Welsh region hardest hit by Covid deaths spoke about how she felt “overwhelming fear” as 13 ambulances queued up outside its A\u0026ampE department. Senior A\u0026ampE nurse Sarah Fogarasy told BBC Wales the situation at the Royal Glamorgan hospital, where there was no capacity at the unit, had left her wanting “to leave”. “This bit makes me quite emotional. For the first time I was sat trying to coordinate this department and I had that overwhelming fear that I just wanted to leave. I was just ‘I’m done. I’m done with this.’“And it’s scary, it fills you full of fear when you have got 13 ambulances outside, queuing around the car park. Where do you go from that?”Amanda Farrow, a senior doctor, described the pressure at the hospital in Pontyclun last Saturday as “unrelenting”.

File photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsSecond-level teachers union the ASTI is to urge its members to reject the new public service pay agreement in a forthcoming ballot. The union said on Saturday following a meeting of its central executive council that the new accord did not resolve the issue of ensuring equal pay for teachers recruited after 2010. Teachers hired after 2010 are currently on lower salary scales than their colleagues who were hired before that date. Speaking after Saturday’s meeting, ASTI general secretary Kieran Christie said that while the proposed agreement included modest pay increases for teachers, it followed a 12-year period during which teachers endured significant cuts to pay and increased work demands. “In the past 10 months we have seen an unprecedented display of commitment, flexibility, hard work and agility across a range of civil and public services. During this time teachers and school leaders have worked tirelessly to support their students and to ensure their education continues. In this context it is scandalous to think that a significant proportion of these teachers are experiencing pay discrimination. These teachers have been denied equal pay for up to a decade,” he said.ASTI president Ann Piggott also said: “We cannot accept proposals that involve a continuation of unequal pay for thousands of second-level teachers. This injustice is not just felt by those personally affected, but by the entire teaching profession. The ASTI took strike action over this issue and all members endured the force of punitive measures. Today’s decision demonstrates that ASTI members want to continue to stand up for lower-paid teachers.”Reduced career earningsAt the meeting some of the teachers affected stated that they have experienced unequal pay for up to 10 years. Many are now in their 30s and 40s and have substantially reduced career earnings. The ASTI ballot on the pay accord will take place in the coming weeks. The leadership of the Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) has also urged its members to reject the proposed agreement, which was negotiated last month, in a forthcoming ballot.The deal provides for a 1 per cent pay rise in October 2021 and a further 1 per cent rise in October 2022.There is also another pool of money, equivalent to a further 1 per cent pay increase, being set aside to deal with issues, pay claims or outstanding awards in particular parts of the public service. Various unions and organisations representing about 340,000 State employees are currently considering the new agreement. The public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions will decide in February on whether to ratify the deal based on ballots of its affiliated members."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4452513.1610097419!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how to lockdown proof our education system","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHow can we make sure our education system works for students, teachers and parents  during this lockdown?

Photograph: Alan Betson  The Cases of the South African variant of Covid-19 discovered in Ireland have been contained, Dr Cillian de Gascun, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory, has said. “They have been contained, they have been controlled, they have been contact traced, and to the best of my knowledge at this stage, there was no onward transmission,” he told RTÉ Radio One’s Saturday with Katie Hannon. However, Dr de Gascun said the variant remains a concern because its mutations could impact on how the vaccines work, but he added that this was a “theoretical risk at this point in time”. Dr de Gascun, a member of Nphet, urged anyone with “travel exposure” to South Africa in the last 28 days to “come forward and make themselves known”.The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet)announced on Friday that three cases of the South African variant of Covid-19 have been detected for the first time in Ireland. All were associated with recent travel. Nphet appealed for healthcare workers who travelled from South Africa to self-isolate for 14 days.The South African strain emerged in August in South Africa’s eastern Cape region, before spreading to other provinces as infections accelerated in recent weeks.The new variant has been linked to the surge in Covid cases in South Africa and health experts fear that it is not only more infectious than previous forms of the virus but could make some vaccines less effective.Almost 1,300 people with Covid-19 are being treated in hospital this weekend with the head of the HSE saying this number will continue to rise. Latest figures show 114 patients admitted to hospital in the past 24 hours with coronavirus, bringing the total number to 1,285. Another 14 have been admitted to intensive care units, bringing the total most severely ill with the virus to 119. Paul Reid, chief executive of the Health Service Executive (HSE), said those figures will continue to surge. “Saving lives and protecting more people (from) getting sick is our priority. But, in time, the huge sacrifices everyone is making will work.”Minister of State for Health Mary Butler described the trajectory of infections as “extremely serious”. “The current situation is extremely serious. Every day we see figures increasing at an exponential rate and they are always worse than the previous day. But everything that can possibly be done is being done,” she said.Latest data from the Government also shows more than one in five people getting tested for Covid 19 are positive. Of 174,126 tests completed in the last seven days, some 22.4 per cent were found to have the virus. The number of positive cases continues to hit record levels, with 8,248 new cases reported on Friday night, and a further 20 deaths recorded. One official said he expected to see several days of “significant hospital admissions” but that the situation should “ease off” after that.Health sources said that hospitals were preparing to use ventilators outside intensive care units if the ICUs reach capacity in the next week. The health service has about 400 ICU beds but has access to about 1,800 ventilators.Ministers and senior officials say next week will see the most severe test of the health service since the pandemic began as a proportion of the very high numbers of positive cases reported since Christmas will become seriously ill and require hospital care.“Next week is it,” one minister said.There are some signs that the post-Christmas surge of infections may be abating, with the positivity rate of tests and GP referrals showing signs of easing off.But there was further worry last night when the Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan confirmed that three cases of the South African variant of the virus had been detected in Ireland.

Photograph: Denis Charlet AFP via Getty ImagesAll UK residents travelling to France on direct ferries from Ireland will require negative Covid-19 tests after the French authorities extended efforts to contain the British virus strain.The Department of Transport issued a notice on Friday night saying lorry drivers with UK passports must prove they are resident in Ireland to be allowed into France without negative tests.France initially banned lorry drivers from entering the country from Britain before Christmas in an effort to prevent the spread of the more infectious coronavirus mutant into the country.The ban led to thousands of trucks, including up to 250 Irish-driven vehicles, being held up at emergency lorry parks and on road lay-bys across southern England for two days.The restriction was lifted on the condition that drivers have the negative PCR or antigen Covid test taken less than 72 hours before embarking on their journey to France.The French government has now extended the travel restrictions to lorry drivers with UK passports who are resident in Britain and Northern Ireland travelling on ferries from Ireland.One industry source said that France was now “closing the side door for UK residents.”Lorry drivers arriving into Cherbourg or Dunkirk on the direct ferries are being asked to prove they are resident in Ireland to be allowed into France without a negative test.“The French authorities are aware that a driver could hold a UK passport and still work and live in the South,” the department said in a note to shipping companies on Friday night.“If the driver can prove by showing proof of address in Ireland – a scanned version of a utility bill, etc – they will be allowed in without proof of a negative test.”ProveThe department said that there have been a number of cases of UK passport holders driving Irish trucks and who could prove they lived in Ireland that have been allowed into France.“Drivers with UK passports driving Northern Ireland-registered trucks or working for Northern Ireland haulage companies may have more difficulty in coming through,” it said.“They risk being sent back if they do not have a valid PCR or antigen test.”The tests must be carried out in Britain or Northern Ireland.The department said that the level of concern about the British strain of Covid is “very high” and that France believes that it has only small clusters of the UK strain so far.“Containing this is a priority for them at this time,” said the department.Some Northern Irish hauliers have used the direct ferries from Rosslare to Cherbourg and on the new shipping route to Dunkirk to avoid Covid-19 related delays through Britain and new post-Brexit border controls between the EU and the UK that came into effect on December 31st.Demand to travel on direct ferries has surged as new customs, regulatory and sanitation checks at EU-UK borders have led to delays on the “landbridge” route through UK to mainland Europe.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4453512.1610128614!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"level 5 restrictions may no longer be enough to drive down case numbers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAt this stage it is hard to see the broad mass of the population being immunised before mid-year. This leaves the Government with some difficult choices from the end of the month.  Photograph: Getty ImagesThe figures tell their own story, and a remarkable one: 12 times as many Covid-19 cases on Thursday as during the peak of the first wave last April, with 50 per cent more patients in hospital, and rising.After months of showing Northern Ireland up in a bad light, the Republic now has the higher level of virus transmission on the island. From being best in Europe, we are now worst in terms of growth in cases.At the end of June 2020 we had three cases per 100,000 people today the incidence stands near the 1,000 mark. No part of the country has remained untouched. In Belmullet, Co Mayo, one of the most remote districts in the country, one out of every 50 people have had Covid-19 over the past fortnight.ICU admissions were still lower on Thursday than in the spring, but may not be for much longer. Given the lag time between cases and serious illness, the expectation is that more than 200 patients will need intensive care next week, higher than at any time in the pandemic.We are still experiencing fewer deaths – 11 a day on average compared to 32 in the spring – but that could change if the health service becomes overloaded and nursing homes are not protected. Why is this happening? It is hard to argue with Tánaiste Leo Varadkar’s contention that “you don’t go from 400 cases a day and a 5 per cent positivity rate to 7,000 cases and a 25 per cent positivity rate because of one thing. It takes a lot of things.”He put it down to five factors: the opening up of hospitality in December household visits and family gatherings intercounty travel the new variant of the virus and non-compliance at funerals and in shebeens. Perfect stormSo, did we all party across county lines? Contact tracers report large numbers of entire families testing positive. The anecdotal evidence suggests a perfect storm of pre-Christmas socialising by younger people, who then took their newly-acquired infections home over the holiday, where older family members contracted the virus in large enough numbers to fill the hospitals. Add to this the hard-partying, post-funeral pubbing minority and you had the ingredients for another explosion in cases.But even allowing for the time of year – spent indoors in close quarters with others – and the excess traditionally seen at Christmas, it is hard to explain what has happened in the past week without recourse to the new variant theory.First identified in the UK only last month, the B.1.1.7 variant is said to be at least 40 per cent more transmissible than others (this is a relative risk, not an absolute one). It is now clear that this strain was present in Ireland at least as far back as November, and that it is rapidly becoming a dominant force – accounting for up to 25 per cent of all samples sequenced in the first week of January.We still have a lot to learn about this variant but it does seem to be driving current trends. This may let the Government off the hook to an extent for not following public health advice before Christmas, but it poses all of us a new challenge.The new variant may force a reset of current strategies. Level 5 restrictions may no longer be adequate to drive down case numbers, so additional measures could be needed. Things should become clearer during January.There are at least signs that the current spike has reached its peak, and that the figures should soon start trending downwards. But how far down? Having failed to reach the target floor at the end of the last lockdown in November, what chance is there of doing so with the new, more transmissible virus in circulation?It takes almost a week to walk off Everest coming down off our current stratospheric heights will take even longer. The distribution of vaccines will affect the calculus in a positive way. Every week 40,000 of the most vulnerable and exposed will be immunised this month and next. That should start translating into fewer hospitalisations and deaths, but if allowed the virus will continue to rip through the rest of the population with uneven results. UncertaintyThere remains much uncertainty over the supply of vaccines. Health officials on Friday briefed journalists on progress, but during the course of the morning the situation changed several times. The EU doubled its order for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The European Medicines Agency brought forward its consideration of the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine, which is already administered in the UK, to the end of January. With its routine storage requirements, this vaccine is urgently needed as the centre-piece of a mass vaccination campaign. At this stage it is hard to see the broad mass of the population being immunised before mid-year. This leaves the Government with some difficult choices from the end of the month. We learned from the first surge that once closed services are hard to open again. Schools stayed open successfully and largely safely through the October peak despite the incidence among teenagers rising to about 200 cases per 100,000 people.Schools remain controlled and safe environments for young people, as Dr Tony Holohan made clear again this week, though not immune to the dangers posed by high transmission levels in broader society.In the first week of January the incidence among under-5s, 5-12 year-olds and 13-18 year-olds was 203, 226 and 488 respectively. The number of school outbreaks, as opposed to cases among children picked up elsewhere, has remained small.Absent further increases, this suggests a relatively small peak to come down off before children can return to class, though it may make more sense to open primary schools ahead of second-level ones.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4454375.1610200023!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mayo gp in covid 19 hotspot calls for nightly curfew to curb cases","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA local GP in a west of Ireland ‘hotspot’ has called for a nightly curfew.

People should mind themselves on the roads, and drive with care.”The bitter cold snap is being caused by a northerly air flow, from the polar side of the jet stream.The east of the country is worst affected. Where temperatures do rise above freezing by Saturday afternoon, they are expected to dip quickly again as soon as the sun sets.In the north west of the country and parts of north Connacht, where there is some cloud cover, temperatures might rise to highs of four degrees briefly during the day.Saturday night is expected to be colder than normal again for the time of year, but not as severe as Friday overnight.Temperatures are predicted to dip to as low as minus three, with more risk of frost.Sunday is forecast to be another cold start – with a risk of frost and fog – however temperatures should reach between 3 and 7 degrees during the day in parts, with the western half of the country expected to be the mildest.Ms Kealy said it “won’t be as cold next week” as more unsettled weather moves in with a westerly air flow, and temperatures should get closer to normal for the time of year.Highs of between 6 and 9 degrees are expected by Monday, although overnight temperatures may again plunge below freezing at times.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlTo order The 2020 limited-edition Matt Christmas jigsaw, go to telegraphcartoonjigsawsOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: Police promise to impose even tougher crackdown amid calls for new measuresInauguration Day 2021: When is Joe Biden sworn in as US president, and will Trump attend?Comment: How I managed to get a leftover Covid jabTrump promises to create own social media platform after Twitter bans president permanentlyThe Queen and Duke of Edinburgh receive coronavirus vaccineSchool absences near double amid warnings that county lines gangs are fuelling truancyMr Bean\u0026#39s giant turkey on head joke \u0026#39stolen\u0026#39 by FriendsWhat next for Donald Trump\u0026#39s children, after Joe Biden\u0026#39s inauguration?

In the interview she told Bashir: “There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded” in reference to the Prince of Wales adulterous affair with Camilla Parker-Bowles.The existence of the second much more personal letter is understood to show a closeness between Mr Bashir and the princess and offer further evidence that she was happy the interview had gone ahead and pleased with its outcome.Mr Bashir has admitted faking two bank statements that falsely showed payments to the former head of security of Earl Spencer, princess Diana’s brother, from a tabloid newspaper and an offshore company.Earl Spencer said Mr Bashir used the faked statements to wrongly gain his trust and subsequently secure a meeting with Diana that led to the interview. The allegations are deeply damaging for the BBC’s reputation prompting its new director-general Tim Davie to order an independent investigation into events more than 25 years ago.The inquiry, begun in November, is being chaired by Lord Dyson, a former Master of the Rolls, and is expected to take six months to complete. Mr Bashir (although still on sick leave) has indicated he is willing to cooperate with the Dyson inquiry and to give his version of events. Sources have suggested that with his career under such scrutiny, Mr Bashir has nothing to lose by doing so.The  understands the second letter will be submitted by Mr Bashir to Lord Dyson to show that Princess Diana still trusted him, even after his deceit over the bank statements was made public in a Mail on Sunday expose in 1996.Earl Spencer kept notes of his meetings with Mr Bashir, including one where he introduced the journalist to his sister. His notes from the time allegedly show 32 false claims and smears made up by Mr Bashir to persuade Princess Diana to give him the interview.Princess Diana wrote a letter to the BBC after the interview, confirming she was not shown any faked bank statements by Mr Bashir and “that these documents played no part in her decision”.The letter went missing (it is understood a member of the BBC staff had taken it home as a keepsake) but has been handed back to the corporation and supplied to Lord Dyson.The second letter from Princess Diana is understood to be much more effusive and was sent directly to Mr Bashir. It shows the pair remained in touch after the interview.Mr Bashir has been accused of showing the letter to Michael Jackson and his entourage to persuade the pop singer, now dead, to give him an exclusive interview in 2002.Jackson’s former bodyguard Matt Fiddes said Mr Bashir had used “the Princess Diana handwritten note to convince Michael he could be trusted”.Alan Waller, the former head of security whose bank statements were faked by Mr Bashir, has now made an official complaint to the politan Police. Scotland Yard has said it will examine the complaint before deciding whether to launch a criminal investigation.Neither Mr Bashir nor Lord Dyson were available for comment.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"zero gravity rooms hazmat suits like getting covid security","story":"I knew re-entering South Korea wouldn’t be easy. I just didn’t realise it would take over 24 hours to get back home from the moment I landed.No sooner had I arrived in Seoul than my temperature was checked.I had to submit multiple quarantine forms asking whether I had symptoms, and that I agreed to quarantine rules during my upcoming 14 days of self-isolation. In recent months, those who have breached compulsory self-isolation have been imprisoned, or even deported.I was told to throw away my mask and replace it with a tighter one kindly provided.A quarantine official had my name on a list of incoming passengers from the UK and South Africa, meaning I had to get tested immediately for Covid-19 - despite already producing evidence of a negative test issued in the UK. (If not at the airport, other arrivals must get tested at their local health centres.)I was escorted by a man in a full hazmat suit onto the windy tarmac to get tested. Officials were clearly taking no chances during the few seconds I lowered my mask while they inserted a swab deep into my nose and throat.Next, I was required to install a self-quarantine app on my smartphone to diagnose myself three times a day for two weeks.This alerts authorities of any symptoms such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath. They then called my phone to make sure the number worked.Finally through immigration, those of us who were tested at the airport were brought to a quarantine facility to await our results, which came out nine hours later.In my case, I was told my test needed to be re-analysed, which would take another 10 hours. And so I was brought to a negative pressure room to sleep the night, meaning that air inside the room could not flow out.The test, meals, and quarantine were all free of charge. After lunchtime the next day, I finally received the negative result I was waiting for.A nurse, again in full PPE gear, came to collect me and gave me gloves to wear. I was then taken by bus back to the airport with others who had just been discharged.Police officers were waiting for us and took the register. I was exhausted, but the end was in sight. We were allocated inidual quarantine taxis, where the driver was sealed off from the back seats. I was driven to my doorstep, and haven’t left my house since.Meanwhile, my local district’s health centre calls me daily to check up on my physical and mental condition. I’m only allowed to open the door to pick up online shopping, groceries and food deliveries placed on my doorstep.I’ve also received a hygiene care kit which includes sanitiser, masks, and medical waste bin bags, the latter to protect waste collectors from potentially coming into contact with the virus.I’ll be able to throw out my waste after the 14 days are over, when specialised waste disposal workers will come. I’ll then also need to get re-tested for the third time, having come from the UK.My experience in South Korea was in stark contrast to the one I went through at London Heathrow a few weeks back.No temperature checks, no screening, no testing, no negative PCR results, no request to present passenger locator form, little social distancing, many passengers with masks under their noses, and some staff without masks.It was the first time in one year after leaving South Korea that I felt exposed to the virus.The measures taken in South Korea may seem excessive, but the view here is that they are necessary to contain the spread of the virus. I am grateful to live in a country where the government cares for those it governs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"clive indias named dropped house former school links british","story":"Clive of India\u0027s name has been stripped from a house at his former private school over his links to empire, sparking warnings from professors about the “craven” trend of erasing history The Merchant Taylors\u0027 day school for boys in Hertfordshire briefly educated the low-born Robert Clive before he was expelled for fighting.The East India Company clerk rose to become a notoriously wealthy military leader who led British expansion on the subcontinent, and was been blamed for mass famine and plundering.Clive House at the £20,000 per year school has now been renamed following a consultation with past and present students to avoid associations with the “foundation of Empire”.But professors and former pupils have cautioned against the “mindless attitude being taken towards the British Empire” by “pusillanimous revisionists”.Historians have also argued the self-made Shropshire lad Lord Clive is an inspiration unfairly maligned by his contemporaries and by history, whose name should be revered and not removed.Headmaster of Merchant Taylors\u0027, Simon Everson, announced in a letter to old boys that:  “Robert Clive has always been a controversial figure.“His actions in India were the foundations of Empire, but were also questioned by his own contemporaries“From this moment forward, Clive House will be renamed.”The new name will honour former pupil and Surrey cricketer John Raphael, who was capped playing rugby for England and died a war hero in 1917.Mr Everson explained that Lord Clive was “a chap who was at the school for one year and was expelled, achieved extraordinary things, but is certainly questionable”, whereas the Surrey all-rounder was “exemplary”.The head added that the decision to remove his name, while retaining a plaque dedicated to him, was made with the approval of current and former pupils, and school governors.  But Cambridge historian Professor Robert Tombs said removing vestiges of Britain’s imperial past is an example of the “craven and mindless attitude being taken towards the British Empire by many public institutions”.He added that history is to help us understand the past and “not impose our own values on it”.Former pupil and Tory MP Lord Andrew Robathan said:  “The school authorities should be ashamed of themselves.   “Clive existed, a brave, successful and  probably ruthless adventurer, perhaps corrupt, but in the context of the 18th Century.  “He should not now be \u0027cancelled\u0027 by pathetic and pusillanimous revisionists.”Clive joined the East India Company in 1743 and after a failed suicide attempt went on to defeat Muhgal forces with company troops at the Battle of Plassey, allowing British expansion into Bengal.He amassed a huge amount of wealth and has been accused of plundering the population, and causing starvation in the region by mismanagement.  His own contemporaries shunned him and he brought up corruption charges and later cleared before purportedly taking his own life at the age of 49.Historian Dr Zareer Masani has argued against the historical reputation of Clive as a brutal colonialist, and criticised the decision to remove his name from the school house.He said:  “It’s absurd that people are now demonising him, he had mixed reputation in his time, quite unfairly denigrated by rather snobbish Whig oligarchy who though the as a kind of self-made mad for having made his wealth himself rather than inherited it“He is a model of someone who really pulled themselves up.  We should be honouring people like this who made something of themselves.”Mr Everson the decision to rename Clive House was an “opportunity to debate rather than cancel” and a plaque would remain in place marking brief Clive’s presence at the schoolHe added that pupils and focus groups agreed with the decision to honour Raphael.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"resurrect backing britain campaign","story":"Anyone old enough to read or to recognise a Union Jack in 1968 will recall the famous “I’m Backing Britain” campaign. It was started by a few secretaries, and became so popular that Britain’s manufacturing industry simply couldn’t cope with the subsequent spike in demand. Now is the time to resurrect it.Why? Because by accident or by design, a disease which originated in China has ruined our economy – and left China’s booming.The “Stay At Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives” campaign proved just how powerful a simple popular campaign can be. Surely now that our farmers and manufacturers are so desperately in need of protection it’s worth trying a similar tack?  We just need Brits to Back Britain.Of course the Government could go a step further. Some might rail against the idea of offering public money to farmers to produce food which we would otherwise be forced to import, yet the fact is that most of our competitors subsidise their farmers. We have lost countless productive farms as those who work them struggle with ever-increasing regulation while battling against competition from heavily subsidised foreign producers.It doesn’t need Government intervention to replace lorry-loads of French apples – we just need to buy the apples we grow in Britain. More importantly, we need to revert to buying produce that is in season, not demand tasteless foreign strawberries in December while pretending to forget the miles they have travelled.Supermarkets, too, can do their bit. A few years ago I picked up a cauliflower in Tesco, and promptly put it back on the shelf.  The lady beside me said “What’s wrong with it?”. “Grown in Spain,” said I.  “Oh,” said she: “I hadn’t seen.” She put hers back too. I could hardly blame her for not noticing  but her response was proof that if only all supermarkets would celebrate British farmers, the average consumer will happily Buy British.Covid has proved that there is still an enormous sense of community in this country of ours. We are all happy to do what we can to support heroic NHS workers restaurateurs have been backed in providing takeaway food and we fret about how to keep hard-working teachers safe: but there is one group of essential workers who get neither the government support nor the public praise they clearly deserve: the British farmers and manufacturers working round the clock to keep this country running throughout its darkest hours.We often deem the French to be “arrogant” because they believe anything French to be far superior to a similar product made elsewhere: but perhaps – whisper it – that arrogance is nothing more than justified pride.

We expect schools to work with families to ensure all critical worker children are given access to a place if this is required.If critical workers can work from home and look after their children at the same time then they should do so, but otherwise this provision is in place to enable them to provide vital services.The DfE also said that schools were expected to strongly encourage vulnerable children to attend class.Vulnerable children could include pupils who may have difficulty engaging with remote education at home due to a lack of devices or a quiet space to study, according to the advice.The new lockdown measures mean the entire country will be subject to the same tougher measures, including the closure of all schools. This means the tier system is not currently in place.Every school had been instructed to draw up plans to ensure children continue to receive an education even if they have to stay at home.Mr Johnson said on the announcement of closing schools: I want to stress that the problem is not that schools are unsafe to children. The problem is that schools may nonetheless act as vectors for transmission, causing the virus to spread between households.Read more on the previous tier system: All schools will remain closed until mid-February, with the possibility that these measures could be extended further.This means most secondary school pupils will stay at home until at least February half term. Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, announced on January 6 that GCSE, A-Level and AS exams will not take place this summer. Exams will be replaced by teacher assessments, with Mr Williamson saying that the government will put our trust in teachers, rather than algorithms. The Education Secretary has also stated that the Department for Education and Ofqual had already worked up a range of options. Details are currently being fine tuned, but it will be a form of teacher-assessed grades, with training and support provided to ensure these are awarded fairly and consistently across the country.When schools reopened in September the Government published 25,000 words of guidance explaining how school children and staff should be kept safe.Older children will be encouraged to avoid close contact with one another, in part because risks increase with age. Teachers are not restricted to a single bubble, but are urged to stay at the front of any classroom to reduce contact. In class, pupils must sit spaced out side-by-side and facing forward.The use of the staff room by teachers is also meant to be “minimised”. Schools must contact local health protection teams immediately so those in close contact with the child can be traced. Currently, pupils in a bubble, year groups and very rarely, the entire school, could be asked to self-isolate. A mobile testing unit could also be sent to a campus. Schools will be offered serial testing of close contacts of staff and pupils who test positive to negate the need for entire year groups to self-isolate at home.Teachers who help a child with symptoms do not have to self-isolate unless they develop symptoms themselves. However, they should thoroughly wash their hands and wear PPE while with the child. The area where someone suspected of having Covid-19 has been must then be intensively cleaned.If a parent insists a child with symptoms should attend school, the headteacher can refuse to take the pupil if they believe there is a threat to others.Staff will also supply and promote the use of tissues as part of the “catch it, bin it, kill it” technique to control germs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"schoolteachersno likely catch covid 19 sweden remained open","story":"Schoolteachers were no more likely to catch Covid-19 than the rest of the adult population when they remained open during the first lockdown, a study has found.Fewer than 10 preschool teachers and 20 schoolteachers in Sweden were admitted to intensive care suffering from the virus up until June 30, data from the country\u0027s Public Health Agency reveals.This equates to 19 in every 100,000 teachers overall, according to the research.Despite Sweden keeping schools open at the height of the pandemic, there was also a low incidence of severe Covid-19 among children, with only 1 in every 130,000 being admitted to intensive care with the virus.The study was conducted by Swedish researchers and published in the New England Journal of Medicine.Sweden adopted a very different strategy to tackle Covid-19 compared with many other countries, choosing to avoid a full-blown lockdown.In addition to keeping schools open, shops and restaurants also remained open across the country, with parks and recreational areas packed with groups enjoying the spring sunshine.The government only banned events with more than 500 participants, issuing a recommendation that those who visit pubs and restaurants should be seated at a table rather than mingling at a bar.People taking public transport were advised to think carefully about whether their journey is necessary.Those who fell ill with coronavirus-like symptoms only needed to wait two days after they felt well again before returning to work or school.However, as early as March 10, a group of doctors and researchers wrote a joint opinion piece in Sweden\u0027s leading medical newspaper warning of a potential disastrous impact on Sweden\u0027s health service if tougher actions were not taken.I get the feeling that they want to spread the infection to get an immunity, but it\u0027s pretty cynical because it will be at the price of hundreds, if not thousands of lives, said Olle Kämpe, a professor at Sweden\u0027s leading medical university the Karolinska Institutet, who was among the authors.There have so far been almost half a million confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Sweden and almost 9,500 deaths.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus vaccine everything know uks","story":"NewsWhen will I get coronavirus vaccine  Everything we know about UKs jab rolloutThe UK is in a race against time to inoculate the public as virus rates soar.

The Army has been helping set up around , local vaccination centres at  GP-led centres,  hospitals and seven super-vax centres in stadiums and conference centres. Boris Johnson has promised hundreds of thousands of jabs a day by this coming Friday in a drive to inoculate all million of the most vulnerable by February . After claims of a postcode lottery, the Prime Minister declared: It is our plan that everyone should have a vaccination available within a radius of ten miles. Grandmother Margaret Keenan became the first person in the world to get the vaccine on December  , with roll out of the Oxford vaccine starting on January .  The vaccine offers hope against alarming rises in Covid infections after a highly-transmissible iant took hold in southern England. But given itaposs the largest vaccination drive in NHS history, things are not going entirely smoothly. Critics say thereaposs been a slow start to the rollout of the two jabs that are on stream, Pfizer BioNTech and Oxford AstraZeneca. A third, Moderna, has been approved for use but wonapost be in the UK for months. To meet his target, Boris Johnson needs more than , vaccinations per day - starting from a week ago. So what facts are there about the vaccine rollout, and when might you get yours  Hereaposs everything we know so far.Who will get the Covid vaccine  Everyone over  in the UK should eventually be eligible for a Covid- vaccine -they choose, and unless there is a medical reason they shouldnapost have it. That is more than million people. Clearly, not all of them can get it at once - which is why a priority list has been drawn up. Over-s, elderly care home residents, frontline NHS and care staff, and aposshieldersapos will be in the first wave of vaccinations between now and February . The vaccine is not recommended for most children because of very limited data about its effect on them. It is only advised for children at very high risk of exposure and serious outcomes - for instance those in care with neuro-disabilities. The vaccine is not recommended for most pregnant women either because of insufficient evidence about the effect on the child. However, breastfeeding women can get the vaccine. And so can pregnant womenthey have very high risk of serious complications due to a health condition, or the risk of exposure is high and canapost be avoided. Immunocompromised adults may get the vaccine but some may not respond as well to it. For that reason there may have to be a cocooning strategy for them even after the vaccine rolls out. When will I get the Covid vaccine  The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationhas identied nine priority groups who will get the vaccine in the first wave of the rollout. The Government believes vaccinating these groups - around  million people - would stop % of preventable Covid deaths. However, Boris Johnson has only promised a firm timetable for the top four of these nine groups- about million people in the UK. They have been promised a first dose by February . The Department of Health says people in groups  to  will start getting their first doses between mid-February and the Spring. Itaposs not clearthataposll clash with the huge demand for second doses that begins from early March. The order is:Residents in care homes for older adults and their carers -year-olds and over and frontline health and social care workers -year-olds and over -year-olds and over and aposclinically extremely vulnerableapos iniduals who have been told to shield -year-olds and over - to -year-olds with serious underlying health conditions-year-olds and over -year-olds and over -year-olds and over WhatIaposm healthy and under   Healthy under-s will be in the second wave of the jab once the first is completed. However, itaposs not clear when this will happen and unless thereaposs a huge increase, it seems likely it wonapost be before Easter. The order for under-s to get the jab has also not yet been decided.Officials are also considering whether front-line workers such as teachers and the armed forces should be given priority, as their jobs could increase their risk. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said teachers and nursery staff have a very strong case for priority - because the government wants schools to reopen first. How many vaccines do we have  The UK has ordered million doses in total of approved vaccines - million of BioNTech Pfizer, million of Oxford AstraZeneca and million of Moderna. In theory thataposs more than enough for everyone in the UK, but itaposs not that simple. Only a fraction of those have been manufactured and shipped to hospitals and GPs so far. The UK will only be able to vaccinate people at the speed doses roll off the production line. Batches must be approved by the MHRA regulator and moved from just one warehouse in Great Britain, at present, to sites all over the country.Whataposs happening with second doses  Everyone must have two doses of the vaccine, regardless of whether it is the Pfizer or Oxford jab. There is some protection after one dose but itaposs not as good. Initially people were supposed to get the Pfizer jab booster within  days. But on December  the UKaposs four Chief Medical Officers dramatically changed tack. Instead, people will only get their second dose after  to  weeks. This is to free up capacity to plunge as many first doses into arms as possible by Easter. The policy has sparked controversy, and speculation that it could raise the risk of the virus mutating to develop resistance. The governmentaposs advisors said they believe this risk to be small, and offering many people partial protection will save more lives. Professor Chris Whitty said the longer gap raised a theoretical risk of an escaped mutant of the virus emerging. That is a real worry but quite a small real worry within the system, he told a No news conference. The general view was the size of the increase of the risk is sufficiently small that measured against this ability to double the number of people who actually are vaccinated, the public health arguments are really strongly for doing what we have decided to do. How will I be notied when it is my turn  You will be contacted to book an appointment either by letter or by phone. Hospital hubs and GP surgeries have already started rolling out jabs, and care homes are beginning to vaccinate patients and staff. Where are the super-vax centres   Seven mass vaccination centres are expected to open in the next week to speed up the rollout of the jab. Londonaposs Excel Centre and the Manchester Tennis and Football Centre are among the vast venues to hand out jabs. Epsom Downaposs racecourse in Surrey, Ashton Gate Stadium in Bristol, the Centre for Le in Newcastle, Birminghamaposs Millennium Point and Robertson House in Stevenage will also operate as major vaccination hubs. NHS staff and volunteers will staff these large conference and sports centres, and add to  GP-led centres and  hospital sites due to open by the end of this week. How many people have had the vaccine so far  More than . million people in England had been vaccinated by January , rising to . million for the whole of the UK. NHS England figures show , patients had the jab in the week up to January . In this period, , doses were given to people over -years-old.

Because he, and the rest of the mad-eyed, far-right posse, backed up something I wrote a few months ago: That Donald Trump was looking increasingly like Adolf Hitler in his final days. There he sat, paranoid, in his Washington bunker, denying reality while sycophants pretended all was well. The big dference, I argued, was that Trump would never take a cyanide pill as he was too cowardly. Say what you like about Hitler but he didn’t try to get out of World War One by claiming he had “heel spurs”. When he incited that mob in Washington to attempt to destroy democracy by pandering to their basest prejudices, the Hitler parallels stood up. As Germany’s Foreign Minister, Heiko Maas, said, watching it unfold: “Seditious words turn to violent actions – on the steps of the Reichstag, and now in the Capitol.” It’s something most sane people feared from the day he was sworn in and spent hours in front of his TV raging at comments about the ­smallness of his inauguration crowd. Then ordered his staff to doctor ­photographs to prove his audience was bigger than Barack Obama’s. It signposted a war against anyone who refused to buy into his cult of narcissism. All non-believers were dismissed as fake news peddlers, ­Marxists or deep-state enemies, as he drugged his followers with lies and conspiracy theories. What we saw on Wednesday night in Washington was merely the culmination of his deliberate play to far-right groups, everyday racists and the not very bright that he would make America Great Again. With ‘Great’ being an unsubtle codename for‘White’.  Buthe was so dangerous, why did the major figures in successive British administrations not see it  Andthey did, why did they pander like the worst kind of s appeasers to an out-of-control monster sowing ision and hate  It’s yet another indictment on these recent gutless Tory governments. Remember Theresa May holding his hand in Washington, and promising a full state visit soon after he was elected, when he was openly demeaning her to anyone who listened  Michael Gove grovelling to him in Trump Tower, Jacob Rees-Mogg saying he would definitely vote for himhe were American and Boris Johnson demanding he be given the Nobel Peace Prize. This despite the object of their flattery mocking their incompetence over Brexit and publicly claiming the NHS was broke and London had become a racist hellhole.

Some of these changes might leave Brits better off but others might hit the pockets of struggling people and familiesnot prepared for.And although  should see the end of the coronavirus pandemic, the effects of the upheaval could be felt in the long term.Here are some of the major changes which could affect you and your family.. Self-employed grant deadline - January Since the resurgence of the coronavirus the government has extended the help available to self-employed people whose finances have been hit by the pandemic. A grant available under the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme is open for applications, but will close on January . The grant is worth up to  per cent of average monthly trading profits, capped at £, in total. It is paid in a single instalment covering three months. What are your hopes for   Let us know in the comments below  . Self-employed tax payments deadline - January If you are one of the over five million self employed people in the UK, you need to submit your self assessment and pay your tax bill by January , or face a penalty and be forced to pay interest. If you do not comply HMRC has the power to collect your outstanding tax through a debt collection agency, or even take you to court. Donapost leave this until the last minute, as dferent payments take ying amounts of time to clear, so you might need to make the payment at least five working days in advance. . Scottish child payments begin - February On February , Scotlandaposs new child payment scheme comes into force.The scheme allows Scottish families who collect certain benefit such as Universal Credit, Jobseekeraposs Allowance, income related Employment and Support Allowance, Housing Benefit, Income Support or tax credits to claim £ per week per child under six.. Rail fare rises - March  On March  rail fares will increase by .% across the UK. This was intended to happen in January, but was delayed due to coronavirus. If you need to buy a new season ticket, it would be wise to do so before prices go up.. Expected increase in capital gains tax - March  Although itaposs too soon to know what will be included in the March  budget, it is expected that the government will be forced to raise taxes to pay for the mounting costs of coronavirus relief schemes. One likely way that this hole could be plugged is through an increase in capital gains tax. Rishi Sunak ordered a review of the tax in July, asking the Office of tax Simplication for advice on opportunities to simply the tax and make it fit for purpose.Capital gains taxes are currently charged at  per cent on the sale of second homes and buy-to-let properties. An increase would mean that anyone selling an investment property, such as landlords, would have to pay extra to complete the sale. . Increases in benefits payments - April Although payments will fall overall due to the end of pandemic boost, standard allowances will increase slightly above pre-Covid levels from April . The increase will depend on age, disability status andyou have dependants like children oryou are a carer. A single person aged under  will have a standard allowance of £., up from £.. Those over  will be entitled to £., up from £.. The child element will also increase to £. for a first child, up from £.. Other benefits increasing in  include the Careraposs Allowance rising to £. per week, from £. and the Widowed Parentaposs allowance increasing to £. from £... Inheritance tax rules changes - April  By April  married couples will be able to leave up to £ million tax-free to their direct descendants. The additional inheritance tax free residence nil rate band will rise to £,. To qualy a property must have been lived in at some point by the deceased, and be passed onto direct descendants, such as children and grandchildren. The residential nil rate band is available on top of the existing inheritance tax free allowance of £,, meaning that iniduals will be able to leave £, free of inheritance tax. If the first of a married couple to pass away leaves their estate to their spouse, the nil band rates can be passed onto the surviving spouse, meaning that upon their death their descendants may be left with a £million allowance. This is an important change for families with medium sized homes and savings, as they will now be able to pass on and benefit from their estates tax free. . Letime Isa charge relaxation ends - April From April  you will be charged  per centyou withdraw money from your letime Isa, for any reason other than buying a first home or to use it as your pension. To help people struggling financially due to coronavirus, in March the government lowered the charge to  per cent. However this change is set to be reversed, soyou need to withdraw from your ISA youaposll need to do so before then.. Changes to wages and income tax - April In November Rishi Sunak announced that the National Minimum Wage and National Living will increase in April. National Living wage workers over the age of  can now earn £. per hour. Workers aged  and  will see their wages go up to £., and  to  year olds pay will increase to £..  to  year olds will see their pay rise to £., and apprentices can now be paid £.. Income tax thresholds will also rise, which increases the amount you can earn before paying any tax. The increase of . per cent will make the allowance £, for basic rate taxpayers and £, for higher rate taxpayers. Good and bad news for public sector workers, as nurses, doctors and other NHS staff will be given a pay rise from April.

The couple founded Urban Outreach  years ago and last year they helped thousands of local people - including redistributing , unwanted first class airline dishes to those in need. David is modest about his work and is keen to point out that it was the donations from the public that got  off to a flying start. “We have people donating food all the time, but in the Christmas of  we had the largest amount we’d ever seen in all the years we’ve been doing this,” he says. “We had so much, we were storing supplies in a church building, offices and food bank. “When Covid- hit, we had enough food from people’s generous donations to survive for the first four weeks of the original lockdown. It was a remarkable thing and it gave us a whole sense that we could cope with whatever was ahead. “Once, we had a delivery of , first class airline meals and we didn’t have any room for them, so a pasty manufacturer cleared a whole freezer so we could support other areas of Manchester. Of course there were tough times as David, , Christine, , and their team of volunteers worked around the clock to deliver what was needed – including providing , lunches in the school holidays, , food hampers at Christmas and , meals for the homeless over the winter period. “We’ve encountered some of the saddest parts, as well as the happiest bits during the pandemic,” says David.“We had volunteers who were really struggling, then we were sending food out and finding people had died. At one point we had  people delivering food, that was quite magnicent. “Furlough was the answer to our problems because we had so many people volunteering and their companies let them use their vans. It was remarkable. We put on barbecues, Caribbean meals and non-alcoholic cocktail bars for the drivers.” David and Christine are just two of the erse group of people who were awarded MBEs in the New Year Honours list. It’s a powerful way to say thank you to people on the frontline, who have supported the nation through the unprecedented times of the Covid- pandemic. Anyone can nominate someone that they believe has made an exceptional contribution to UK society.People are honoured for achievements such as making a signicant dference to their community and improving le for others, long-term voluntary service and remarkable innovation and entrepreneurship. The Bagleys were both surprised to be awarded MBEs and are clearly humbled by the honours. “I just happened to be at home one afternoon and I was going through some emails and I went in and said to Chris: ‘I’ve just got this email about a MBE thing.’ I read it through and realised it wasn’t a hoax!” says David. “Later, she got an email too and we had  hours to accept it. I guess at some point we’ll collect them, but we haven’t been given any sort of date yet. But getting to call my mum and tell her was the best thing. I’m adopted, so my parents made it all possible. I said: ‘I’ve got a gt for you.’ This MBE is theirs, too.“If we take an MBE, it’s not ours. It belongs to thousands upon thousands of people who have volunteered, given and supported us – children who have ridden their bikes up and down the street and got their neighbours to donate. It belongs to them. We only created a space and people filled that space.“The one thing to come out of all this is people pulling together. Evenyou only have one thing to give, it’s added to somebody ’s one thing and together we have an abundance.”Vital support for those with sensory loss  Jacquie Winning MBE, , from Falkirk is manager of the Forth Valley Sensory Centre and her work with people with sensory loss has been more important than ever during the pandemic. “Covid- has been challenging for everyone, but more so for people with sensory loss,” she explains. “Those with hearing loss are facing extra challenges due to face masks and social distancing interfering with their ability to lip read. There are also signicant challenges facing people with sight loss in maintaining physical distancing while undertaking essential trips out. “I identied these challenges and provided support with Braille copies of essential Covid- information for people with sight loss, a telephone, text and email befriending service to support those who were isolated as a result of lockdown. As well as podcasts providing the most up-to-date Covid- information for people with sight loss.” Jacquie’s dedicated and hard-working team are also supporting people living with sensory loss so they can pay their bills remotely. She shares the recognition her MBE gives with the rest of her team. “This award recognises the achievements of everyone at the Sensory Centre in what has been an exceptionally challenging year,” says Jacquie. “Thanks go to the dedication, enthusiasm and willingness to adapt by our team, volunteers and partners, and the tremendous support of our board of directors. Together we have been able to continue to provide essential services for our vision and hearing-impaired centre users, who continue to be some of the most vulnerable and hardest hit by the pandemic. I am privileged to work with such an inspiring group of people.”  Critical care on the frontline and pivotal research and tutorials in the background  Critical care consultant at Royal Gwent Hospital Dr Tamas Szakmany was made an MBE after he led the response of the Welsh Critical Care Network during the pandemic. He looked after  patients, doubling his normal clinical time spent at the bedside. On top of this, Dr Szakmany, , from Newport, South Wales, spent hours on conference calls, online tutorials and webinars to share his experience of working in ICU and rapidly built up a research programme. He also took part inthe Oxford vaccine trial. The last thing he expected was to be honoured for his work, so he was surprised to get the email informing him of his MBE. “I was completely astonished, touched and humbled. I thought I was doing my job like everybody . I didn’t think for one minute it would result in this,” he says.  “Once I was allowed to talk about it, the first thing I said was how fortunate I was to work with this team: the clinical and managerial team, the civil servants and the research team at my hospital and across the UK.  was dficult professionally. Personally, I had many successes. It was a double-edged sword. The MBE is recognition for the enormous effort everyone has made to get us through the first wave and I hope we have similar success again. “We will get through this together. I ask the public to stay at home. If you do go out, wear a mask and keep your distance. When it is offered, have the vaccine.”Decades of tireless dedication   "},{"url":null,"title":"brit couple defied covid rules","story":"NewsCouple fined for breaking Covid rules by sneaking woman in Barbados hotel for threesomeAndrew Luker and Julia Knightley, from Greater Manchester, were arrested after a security guard spotted Mikaela Jacas climbing over a fence and going to the couples roommirrorShareCommentsByDave Burke:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsAndrew Luker and Julia Knighley were caught sneaking a woman into their room \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Dr Saleyha Ahsan is an emergency medicine doctor working in ITU in Bangor, North WalesShe is also a broadcast journalist, most recently presenting Channel  documentaries Coronavirus: Can Our NHS Cope  and What’s It Like To Catch Coronavirus  aposMy dad suffered from asthma and in the last three or four years he’d started on an amazing treatment which gave him his le back. He was going out socialising and his lungs felt amazing. aposHe loved Scotland, bagpipes and steam trains. His dad was a train driver in India and before he became unwell with his asthma we used to go up to the ‘Harry Potter’ train, the Jacobite steam train that runs from Fort William to Mallaig. He also loved travelling overseas.  aposI thought we’d be able to do it all over again but instead, he was locked up indoors shielding and it was awful. aposMy dad was super careful and really strict but on the th or th of December he began to display Covid symptoms. aposI’m one of his registered carers so I was given permission to stay with him when he was taken to hospital. I arrived on the rd and stayed with him until the th when he died. aposI knew things were bad when he struggled to breathe without his CPAP mask. It was a long drawn out death, I feel so bad about how long it took and the agony of watching it. aposThere was one day where he said: ‘Just let me die’, which was heartbreaking. aposI handled all my dad’s healthcare and last night I got a phone call from the GP practice inviting him for the vaccine. It was like a bullet to the chest: I had to say: ‘I’m sorry, he died of Covid last week’. aposMy real job is emergency medicine and it was always planned that I’d work in intensive care this year. Because of Covid, it’s been an incredible year and it’s made me thinking about changing my speciality. aposWe’ve learned a lot about Covid since the first wave of the pandemic and now is the crunch time.  aposMy dad encouraged me and supported me in my ambition to join the army at a time when there were really no other examples I could see of people like me - a British Muslim woman. aposI went for selection to go to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and passed. My dad was really proud and spoke often to his friends about it. aposThey thought I had done something good for the community by doing this. But truth is, it was my father’s influence and encouragement that made me do it. I did end up becoming the first British Muslim woman to go to Sandhurst and become commissioned into the Army. aposThe tributes about my father have been incredible - reading about his le as a teacher from former students. One said: ‘Saddened to head the passing of Mr Chaudry, a pioneer way ahead of his time. Taught me computer science at Mayfield High School when the school had no computers. aposWith his dedication and support, I was able to rise to the top in the field of computer science.’ So he wasn’t just an incredible influence on our lives but that of so many others. aposThe one comfort we have is our faith. We’re Muslim and we all believe that everyone’s got their time.apos Dr Syira Ahsan is a GP in North East London, with her work including the out of hours area of Queen’s HospitalaposIn this third lockdown, Covid has exploded. When my dad was upstairs on the ward and I was working downstairs, on one sht every single patient bar one had Covid symptoms. aposThese are young people in their s, struggling with their breathing and it was really surreal. aposWe are at maximum capacity, there are not enough doctors and we are all really exhausted. aposI’ve been a doctor for over  years but I’ve actually got to the point where I think: ‘What is the point ’ Hopefully it’s a fleeting thought. aposYou try to do everything for everyone  and then you lose your own parent. It’s not stopping, it’s like a tidal wave. aposCovid is a really cruel disease, there’s a slight lag between what you’re seeing radiologically and the patient themselves. aposWhen my dad was talking without any oxygen aid they wheeled out his chest X-ray and we sat in silence because as doctors we knew that X-ray was horric. aposHis funeral was like an airport runway - he was the first of the day and there were so many others waiting. aposThe most precious people I think in society are our elderly and we would be so selfish to become complacent and lose them. That’s why we don’t have a choice but to be vigilant. aposMy dad was a strong, independent -year-old. He instilled core values in all of us - to always be honest and truthful and do the right thing. You work hard and you give back. He was big in stature and we’d call him the BFG, the Big Friendly Giant. aposHe was so loved.apos Dr Saima Ahsan is a paediatric consultant at St Mary’s Hospital, LondonaposWinter is usually much worse than the summertime in paediatrics because you have loads of viruses like respiratory illnesses. aposNow, you’ve got the usual paediatric patients with adult Covid patients to care for on top of that and I think the next couple of weeks could be the hardest yet. aposYou don’t have enough cubicles and Covid patients need cubicles or at least to be isolated together. aposYou have a haematology unit where you do bone marrow transplants - you cannot have mixing of Covid patients with immuno-suppressed ones. aposI’m so proud of my colleagues but the NHS is chronically underfunded and we’re seeing the consequences of that now. aposI’ve been talking with my colleagues, who have been fantastic, about going back to work. They’re extending the number of adult Covid patients we’re going to be looking after and I think it might be quite dficult for me because of the way my dad passed away. aposAs a consultant you’re the leader, you have to support the rest of the team and I don’t want to break down in the middle of the ward.  aposWe lost our mum in October  so we were just coming to terms with that when this happened. aposThe thing about my parents was that they were very, very kind. aposMy dad had  eleven grandchildren and one is already studying medicine. He was always checking up on me - he’d offer to cook for me because he knewyou did back to back ‘on calls’ you’d neglect yourself and go without eating a proper meal for a few days. aposI didn’t see him as much as I would have liked this year and I really missed him, the phone wasn’t the same as sitting there in person with a cup of tea.aposDr Safiyah Ahsan is a London GP who works in urgent careaposWhen the pandemic began I was living with my dad but with him needing to shield, I moved out and practically lived in my car at first. aposI worked at urgent care centres at Barking and Harold Wood Hospitals during the day and in the evenings I’d do shts at the  centre where patients call up. aposPatients with Covid symptoms tended to go straight to AE. Instead, we would have a lot of patients coming in upset because they found it dficult to speak to their GPs. They felt really neglected and scared. aposTriaging on the phone was shocking because every single patient that called up was breathless. They were patients of all ages, as young as their late s. aposWe were all learning on our feet about covid and then you’d drive home late from your sht and all you’d see were ambulances blue lighting. For the patients we called the ambulances for, there was a fear they wouldn’t come out. aposI wanted to stay at home and spend time with my dad during the second wave because we were still coming to terms with our mother not being around so I stuck to telephone triaging and teaching my medical students online. aposWe’d do really nice things like cook together. I’d be working and I’d hear him having an in depth conversation about politics or he’d be watching a gangster film or programme about steam trains. aposHe was in such good health and was planning to move to Canada, we were gearing ourselves up for that next year. aposI went on social media briefly yesterday and was quite surprised by the number of controversial posts about how covid isn’t real or it’s all a big conspiracy. aposMy dad was absolutely fine and covid somehow crept in. It came out of nowhere and killed him.apos Dr Shoaib Ahsan is a doctor in acute medicine working in LondonaposI’ve been working on and off in the pandemic due to my medical background, which makes me high risk to Covid. aposI was working in London when it began and I caught Covid straight away. When I felt sluggish I put it down to being in lockdown and it was only when I had a shower and couldn’t stand up that I realised something was wrong. aposThe next two or three weeks was a blur. It’s a weird, drawn out disease, not like the flu that you get for four or five days. aposAfter I had recovered I went back to work in Devon where there was a lower instance of Covid. Even there, I’d be finishing at pm instead of pm because the number of people to treat had gone up and so the working hours had gone up. aposCovid is a new disease and it’s about trying to manage patients with illnesses we know about with one we have no idea about. We are still learning about its after effects.  aposI lived at home with my dad and I’d have a chat with him every morning. He was a friend who was always there. aposWhen my mum died last year, he took the mantle of being both mum and dad. Even thought he was elderly he’d always do things for you. aposHe’d always ask: ‘Do you need anything ’ which was really nice.

George Arnold, , suffered a bad fall while walking his dog, Cappie, on slippery footpaths on Wednesday, before making a distressing phone call to his son when he knew there would be no use in trying to get up.Son Ian rushed to the scene assuming his dad would have been in the ambulance and on his way to hospital, reports the Liverpool Echo.But by the time her got there he was shocked to find his old man still lying where he fell, chilled to the bone and developing hypothermia, which can be fatal. Have you experienced a long wait for an ambulance due to stretched resources  Email webnews@mirror Ian and a pal were forced to peel George off the ice and carefully place him onto a fishing bed and into the back of a van. His embarrassed dad looked at him in distress and fear he was going to cry in front of everyone before screaming in agony with eyes rolling his head.  Ian told the Echo: My dad called me and just basically said he had a fall and couldnapost get up. He said a man and a girl who where nearby had called him an ambulance and they said theyaposre on their way. A little old lady who lived nearby had brought him a blanket. I said shall I come down and he said there wasnapost much point because the ambulance was coming. I phoned my sister and she said we should go down anyway just in case, so I got a few bits together and we drove up. I turned up fully expecting him not to be there, but he was literally just lying on the ice.   The North West Ambulance Service was battling  other emergencies at the time, waiting in the Merseyside area alone, a spokesperson said. The pensioner from St Helens was suffering from hypothermia by the time he was rushed to hospital. The ambulance service has apologised and vowed to investigate after the -year-oldaposs traumatic ordeal in St Helens, in an area between Clock Face Road and Cranshaw Avenue. The ordeal began when the pensioner slipped on the icy ground, which was some distance from the roadside, and knew instantly he had seriously injured himself.  Ian said he received a call at around .pm from his distressed dad - who is diabetic and has twice suffered from cancer. Ian said he tried to lt his dadaposs leg to place something underneath him but the smallest movement was agonising. He said: He was in that much pain he was literally crying. The  operator said donapost move him because it could cause more damage, and just to keep him as warm as we could. Ian says he was told an ambulance would be on the way as soon as possible but as time dragged on his dad began to deteriorate. He said: After about two and half hours my dad was shaking like a leaf, and he said he was feeling sick. He started telling me he could not feel his left leg any more. He kept saying, aposI donapost think I am going to make itapos. I phoned the ambulance again and said aposlook, you are going to have to get here nowapos. Ian said the  operator could say nothing more than an ambulance was on the way and eventually a manager was brought over, who asked to speak to his dad. But as Mr Arnold was conscious and able to respond, the severity of the  call was not escalated and the pensioner was left on the ice. Ian said he knew at this stage he could not wait any longer, and called his aposbest mateapos John Jenson, who drove as close as possible with the van and the fishing bed. He said Mr Arnold was struggling to remain conscious, and had been lying on the ice so long his clothes were stuck to it. Ian said: I told my dad aposIaposm sorry, we are going to have to lt you onto this fishing bedapos. He said aposbut I am going to cry in front of everyoneapos, as there were quite a few people there by then. We had to literally peel him off the ice and he was screaming in agony. We managed to carry him over to the van and all the way to the hospital his eyes were rolling in his head. Fortunately Ian and Mr Jenson managed to get Mr Arnold to AE at Whiston Hospital where he was treated for hypothermia and began coughing up blood - which Ian says he was told may have been related to exposure to the cold. The pensioner underwent surgery to his hip today and is recovering well, said Ian. He said: I understand that there is a pandemic and there must be a lot of pressure, but just because he wasnapost bleeding and was conscious does not mean he wasnapost an emergency. Ian also added he wanted to praise the amazing community spirit of the passers by who helped including Reese Jones, the man who called  and waited with him for over two hours. He said: There was quite a lot of concerned people that brought him blankets and stuck around in the bitter cold, and I was cold too, probably -°, thataposs what my car said when I got in it later.

Lewis White suffered a catastrophic brain haemorrhage after a stroke six years ago and is no longer able to speak to his family.The determined boy, who was left severely disabled by the stroke, is now wheelchair bound and unable even to lt his head, Liverpool Echo reports. Mum Sharon, , said the stroke came out of the blue and devastated her happy boy while he was at home during the school holidays. The mum-of-three, of Flintshire in Wales, said: Heaposd been feeling a little bit poorly. Heaposd had a sickness bug for a couple of days. “It was exactly as youaposd see it. The right side of his face dropped and he couldnapost use his right side.”Lewis was rushed to intensive care at Wrexham hospital and blue lighted to Alder Hey Childrenaposs Hospital in Liverpool the next morning. Sharon and her husband Daniel were told the devastating news their son had suffered a massive stroke and he would need to relearn how to speak and eat again through physiotherapy.  Doctors also discovered Lewis had Pan Vasculitis affecting his brain, liver, kidneys, spleen and bowel. Without treatment, the condition would result in organ failure. As part of his treatment, Rocky fan Lewis was given chemotherapy and put on high dose steroids and immunosuppressants. The determined schoolboy would listen to the Rocky theme tune as he battled through therapy and towards recovery.But in early , a routine scan showed Lewisapos Pan Vasculitis had caused damage to blood vessels in his brain.  This caused him to suffer mini strokes which would eventually cause larger strokes. Later that year, he had a ten-hour operation to improve the blood flow to his brain but his condition deteriorated and further strokes damaged the left side of the organ.Having to spend Christmas in Alder Hey in , Sharon remained by her sonaposs side as they watched the Christmas lights being switched inside the hospital. She said:Afterwards I took him back upstairs and he was talking to me about it and then he just started screaming with a pain in his head. The crash team came in, the artery had burst on the left side.  He had an operation at one oaposclock in the morning. The bleed shunted his brain over to the right side of his head and it swelled. “We were told it was unlikely they would be able to save him.” Medics miraculously saved Lewisapos le but a scan in early  showed he had suffered colossal brain damage and would unlikely recover.Sharon said: “We think his personality is still there but heaposs severely disabled now. He canapost hold his head up or anything. “We think he might be communicating by blinking but we donapost know. We think heaposs responded to us.

She normally marks the day with family gatherings, small parties and dinners with friends. But before she married her prince in  and became a member of the royal family, the celebrations were a lot more exciting. She normally hit the London clubbing scene with her friends, and she was treated to a few romantic evenings with her then boyfriend, William. Weaposve had a look through some of Kateaposs pre-royal birthdays, and what sheaposs done in more recent years. th birthday After meeting William when she was in her late teens at university, Kate was well used to being in the media spotlight by the time she turned .

The couple said they had spent months considering the le-changing move, but a source said it came as a bolt from the blue for the rest of The Firm, who were reportedly furious.Princes Charles and William were reportedly given just  minutes warning of the Sussexesapos Instagram statement, and Harryaposs grandmother the Queen was said to be hurt. However, according to experts the Queen played a blinder and took back control of the scandalous situation with two perfectly constructed statements. The first, released shortly after Meghan and Harryaposs bombshell post, was short and snappy, explaining that there was a lot of work to be done. In just  words, she acknowledged the development and warned working out an agreement would be complicated. It read: Discussions with The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage. We understand their desire to take a dferent approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through. Speaking on Channel  documentary, The Queen: In Her Own Words, speech writer and former British Ambassador Charles Crawford said: When the Queen makes a statement, itaposs a statement with a capital aposSapos. Thataposs because there is something which needs to go on the record.  The tone was flawless, and above all it was very short. However it was with her second statement on the subject, which she shared after an emergency summit at Sandringham with Charles, William and Harry, that she really took back control. She explained that talks had taken place ands the logistics were being worked out. It read: Today my family had very constructive discussions on the future of my grandson and his family.  My family and I are entirely supportive of Harry and Meghan’s desire to create a new le as a young family. Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working members of the Royal Family, we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent le as a family while remaining a valued part of my family. Harry and Meghan have made clear that they do not want to be reliant on public funds in their new lives.It has therefore been agreed that there will be a period of transition in which the Sussexes will spend time in Canada and the UK. However, experts claim it was the final line that really sent a message. It read: These are complex matters for my family to resolve, and there is some more work to be done, but I have asked for final decisions to be reached in the coming days. Speaking on the documentary, Charles says: When the Queen asks for something, it happens.  Do you think Meghan and Harry were right to quit their senior royal roles  Have your say in the comments section below. It also sent a public message to the people advising Harry and Meghan - aposthis is over, letaposs get down to an agreement and move onapos. It was a nicely phrased but firm statement saying this is where things stand, just so you all know, and thataposs it. Royal correspondent Roya Nikkah praised the way the Monarch dealt with the dficult situation.

The necklace is engraved with the letters aposG, L, Capos in honour of Prince George, seven, Princess Charlotte, five, and two-year-old Prince Louis. On the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgeaposs Instagram account an image of Kate wearing a floral face mask and waving was posted as a birthday tribute. The post was captioned: Thank you for your kind wishes on The Duchess’ birthday. Birthdays have been very dferent in recent months, and our thoughts continue to be with all those working on the front line at this hugely challenging time. Kate is believed to be with her family at their Norfolk home of Anmer Hall, where the Cambridges spent Christmas after the Queen decided to have a quiet festive period at Windsor Castle.  Due to the lockdown her birthday is likely to be very low key with her spending the special day with Prince William and their three children. The Cambridges have been forced to turn to video calls to carry out virtual engagements when restrictions were in place but they have done face-to-face when permitted. In November, the duchess said she was humbled more than half-a-million people took part in her landmark research on the issue of early years. The study was the largest of its kind in the UK on perceptions of early childhood - which found only one in four people recognised the key importance of the first five years of a childaposs le.  In December the Cambridges spent three days touring the country by royal train thanking frontline and key workers for their efforts during the pandemic. However the trip provoked veiled criticisms from Welsh and Scottish ministers who raised questions about the timing of the visit while coronavirus cases were still prevalent.In a lighter moment Kate, William and their children made a rare public appearance as a family when they went to a London theatre to watch a pantomime staged for key workers in the run-up to Christmas. And the Cambridges and their children were pictured a number of times taking part in the weekly clap for carers tribute during the first national lockdown.Last yearaposs Kateaposs  birthday was overshadowed when the day before the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their bombshell news they were quitting the royal family and would become financially independent - something they have achieved. Catherine Elizabeth Middleton was born to Carole and Michael Middleton at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading on January , .  She was christened at the parish church of St Andrewaposs Bradfield in Berkshire on June ,  - the day before Prince William was born. In the mid s the Middletons lived in Amman in Jordan before theyto Berkshire. At the age of , she went to the exclusive, private Marlborough College in Wiltshire, where she part-boarded.

The money-smart mum, from West Yorkshire, has spent a year freebie hunting and bagging free items. Kasia Dul has collected freebies, including a Pandora charm, Elizabeth Arden and Dio beauty bundles, an Echo Dot, Amazon Fire HD  Tablet and YSL Touche Eclat Illuminating Pens. The -year-old said: “I haven’t counted exactly how many free products I’ve managed to collect over the course of  as there are so many but, at a guess, Iaposd say that my stash of freebie items and prizes is worth around £,. “It’s mostly made up of beauty products, which are worth around £,. “On top of this, I also earned £ of Amazon vouchers for sharing links for free products.Plus, I won £ in a live draw competition and £ of PayPal Credit by taking part in a Facebook draw,” she added. Her freebie hunting is so successful it’s helping Kasia save money as well, as she does not have to buy make-up, fragrances and skincare products for a while. The thrty mum said: “I’d usually be spending around £ a month otherwise. “Some of the freebies I got were full-sized so they lasted for a long time.  I even had enough to share with friends and family as gts.” Kasia first began her freebie hunting hobby when she was recovering from an illness, looking for a way to fill her time. “I started applying for free stuff when I was at home on sick leave at the beginning of the year,” she says. “While I was recovering, I discovered LatestFreeStuff.Every day there is something new to apply for. You also receive rewards for being an active member.”  She uses the sites app and newsletter to try to get freebies and has found a community of other freebie hunters as well. She explains how her trick is to switch on the app notications so she gets a reminder every time a new free item is added. When she hears it ping, she user her spare time to immediately apply for it.  But youaposve got to be quick - as there is competition among the many members is fierce and samples quickly run out. Andthere are any extra steps included, such as postage and packaging fees, this should be clearly stated which allows you to choose whether to go ahead with it, or not. Kasia added that she usually avoided applying for freebies when there would be a postage fee, unless it is a small amount or the products are full-sized. “There’s a Polish language group on Facebook called ‘Zaradni Polacy w UK Grupa’ that’s great for finding freebies and bargains, as well as tips and tricks on how to save money. Plus I’m a big fan of latestdeals freebies,she added.She also utilises tester  and is always asking for free samples in shops too. Examples of tester  include Home Tester Club, The Insiders, TryIt Sampling Community, First Beauty, Personal Perks and Vogue Insiders.  And she advises asking the salespeople at beauty counters at Boots, Debenhams, House of Fraser and The Perfume Shopthey have any free samples they can give away.Deepak Tailor, founder of LatestFreeStuff, says: “Kasia has become an expert-level freebie hunter and her collection of coveted products is impressive."},{"url":null,"title":"single mum eight living nightmare","story":"NewsMum-of- trapped in bedroom after Covid test - leaving kids alone downstairsMarie Buchan, from Selly Oak, Birmingham, tested positive for coronavirus and is self-isolating in her bedroom, leaving her eight children to fend for themselves downstairsmirrorShareCommentsByAndy Richardson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsMarie Buchan with her eight children at their home in Selly Oak, Birmingham \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The gran-of-three never suffered any problems with her sight, so was left horried when staff told her something wasnapost right at an appointment in August . The gran-of-three was rushed to the Gartnaval Hospital in Glasgow for tests. Days later, Elaine, from Largs, North Ayrshire, was diagnosed with uveal melanoma, a form of eye cancer.That same month she had emergency surgery to remove her left eye and replace it with a prosthetic one, report the Daily Record. Medics said they had no choice as her tumours were too aggressive to be treated, and warned that despite the operation being a success, there was a aposhigh-riskapos of her cancer ing. In November , their worst nightmare became a reality. Elaineaposs cancer ed, but it appeared in her liver. She received immunotherapy followed by early phase trials of chemotherapy. After two rounds of failed treatment, the Maltby familyaposs last hope for the dental health worker is Chemo-saturation Therapy. The therapy saturates the liver, helping to deter further tumours from growing and prolongs le expectancy. Treatment is currently unavailable on the NHS in Scotland and can only be accessed privately in Southampton where six sessions cost £,. Without treatment, doctors have given Elaine just two years to live.  Her devastated daughter, Natalie Maltby-Lemon, said they are now in a race against time. The -year-old told the Record: Our world as we knew it has fallen apart. Mumaposs never had any health issues, she loves hill walking, her job and keeping busy. Itaposs so unfair that there is a treatment out there but unless you are extremely well off it is unavailable. Weaposre all devastated.

Claire Byrne, , and -year-old Paula Breen were both hospitalised as a result of the drunken brawl at the Clock in Kirkdale, Liverpool. They both appeared at Liverpool Crown Court on Friday with visible scars on their face as a reminder of the fateful night on January  last year.Judge Gary Woodhall condemned their violent actions saying their use of glasses and bottles as weapons were so aposincredibly seriousapos that they both deserved to be locked up, Liverpool Echo reports.He said: Other customers describe being shocked by the violence you both engaged in and feared for their safety. The CCTV footage speaks for itself. Anybody watching that CCTV footage would be horried by the violence you both engaged in. At the start of the clip, Breen can be seen sitting at a table with friends in the pub at around .pm. Byrne is shown to take a stool from that table, then sit back down at a dferent table with another group, prompting Breen to stand up. Breen can be seen to shout something, then walk over to speak to Byrne, who just seconds later picks up a wine bottle and repeatedly coshes her with it as all hell breaks loose. Christopher Hopkins, prosecuting, said other people intervened to restrain Byrne, before Breen fell to the floor, with bumps to the head as a result of the initial unprovoked assault. The video shows Breen, a mum-of-one, get back to her feet and take a glass from a shelf which she throws at Byrne who is stood in a crowd of people. The glass flies through the air before it hits mum-of-three Byrne in the centre of her forehead.  On impact it smashes and inflicts a two to three inch long laceration. More people intervened and Breen was persuaded to leave the pub. A second CCTV clip shows Breen standing outside before Byrne comes out of the pub and picks up a glass that was lying on the pavement. Mr Hopkins said Byrne attacked Breen with the glass but it is not captured on camera. The court heard it was disputed whether Byrne broke the glass before thrusting it into Breenaposs face - as per Breenaposs account - but Judge Woodhall said he would sentence Byrne on the basis the glass smashed on impact. Dazed and confused, Breen then went back inside, slipped and fell to the floor. The clip provided to the Liverpool Echo resumes as Breen re-enters the pub and falls over, before Byrne appears, holding another wine bottle.  She is then shown attacking Breen with it as Byrne lies defenceless on the floor. When arrested Breen, who was left with a wound to the side of her chin and cuts to her arms, told officers I retaliated. Mr Hopkins said both women made admissions in police interviews and pleaded guilty to affray. Byrne, from Kirkdale, has a previous conviction for threatening behaviour in  and a caution for common assault in January . Peter White, defending Byrne, accepted it was an exceptionally serious offence, adding: The CCTV does her no favours. He said Byrne claimed she hadnapost been drunk, but was on medication for mental health issues and knew she shouldnapost have been drinking. Mr White said: She had recently gone through the breakdown of her marriage of  years at the time of that offence.  The lawyer said his client accepted she had been using alcohol as a crutch but in the  months since hasnapost touched a drop. Mr White said Byrne cared for a -year-old son with dficulties, and another child, aged seven, with less serious dficulties. He said Byrne had another child, aged , who lives with her ex-partner and whom she sees on a regular basis, and lived opposite her mum, in her s, who has emphysema and relies on her for daily needs. Mr White asked the judge to bear in mind her caring responsibilities, stating: She is utterly ashamed of her behaviour on that night. Rebecca Smith, defending Breen, from Anfield, who has no previous convictions, said there was a distinction to be drawn between her client and Byrne. She said: Whatever words were exchanged between Miss Breen and Miss Byrne, it was an unprovoked attack to start with. Ms Smith said Breen was dazed when she fell, and after throwing a glass in retaliation, tried to remove herself from the situation.  She conceded both womenaposs behaviour was unsavoury and to some levels despicable. Ms Smith added that Breen suffered from PTSD as a result of what she witnessed when her husband died in , which had also affected her -year-old son. Judge Woodhall said when Breen first approached Byrne, it seemed for no apparent reason Byrneaposs almost immediate response was to attack her with the bottle. He said Breen caused a signicant injury by throwing a glass at Byrne, who in turn didnapost give up and pursued her outside. The judge said Byrne initiated the violence in a sustained and unprovoked assault and her violence was greater than Breenaposs.

Key workers claim they are struggling to drop their children at school where non-key worker parents are needlessly dropping off their children. Under Covid lockdown rules, primary and secondary schools must remain closed until at least mid February. Children with at least one key worker parent are permitted to attend class while others should engage in remote learning at home. But some teachers and parents say schools are dramatically busier than the first lockdown closure in . And some key workers say they their child has been denied a place as classrooms fill up during the UKaposs third lockdown. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School  College Leaders, told the Daily Mail: “We are hearing reports that attendance in some primary schools is in excess of  per cent because of demand from critical workers and families with children classed as vulnerable under criteria which has been signicantly widened.The key worker category has been signicantly widened since the first lockdown, and now even includes Brexit transition staff.On Wednesday, Ministers confirmed children can also learn on-sitethey lack the appropriate technology to learn remotely. But parents have been accused of sending their children to school by ly claiming key worker status. It comes after the Department of Education also expanded the categories of vulnerable children who can still attend school.  Mr Barton added: We are urgently seeking clarication about the maximum number who should be in school. Health experts say that school closures are crucial in reducing the infection rate, despite the impact on childrenaposs education. But reports suggest non-key worker parents continue to send their children to class, despite government rules. Examples of busy schools include Willerby Carr Lane Primary School where half of pupils are attending lessons in East Riding, Yorkshire, according to Mr Barton. Some  children arrived at the school on Wednesday and were placed in apossuper-size bubblesapos ranging from  to  pupils. Meanwhile five times as many pupils are still attending class compared to the previous lockdown at Invicta Primary School in Deptford, south east London, he adds. NHS worker Victoria Pass told of the dficulties she has faced in sending her children to school.Speaking to Manchester Evening News, she said: I’m a frontline NHS worker and been declined by my child’s school. Now I’m questioning whether to go to work or stay at home and not help save lives because my children need me. Others are now choosing to keep their children at home because of the higher attendance. Katie Cowley, a teacher from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, said: I was amazed at the amount of children in when I dropped mine off. As a teacher myself I have no choice but to send them in. I am genuinely worried for their safety and may now decide not to send them in, I am so worried for them and myself.

The statement comes two days after Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol in a violent attempt to thwart the democratic process which left five dead. The rioters - inflamed by Trumpaposs  claims of election fraud - smashed windows, sent lawmakers into hiding and looted federal property including a laptop which was stolen from Pelosiaposs office. Pelosiaposs call to stop Trump from ordering a strike before he leaves the White House came just before congressional Democrats began a conference call to discuss whether to impeach Trump for an unprecedented second time. The situation of this unhinged President could not be more dangerous, Pelosi said. The House of Representatives speaker said she had discussed the matter with Army General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Milleyaposs office said that Pelosi had initiated the call and that the general answered her questions regarding the process of nuclear command authority. A US official, speaking anonymously, said that any use of nuclear weapons is a highly deliberative process. In opening the conference call, Pelosi called Trump an insurrectionist and said the members were there to discuss how we go forward, according to a source on the call.Trump praised his supporters on Twitter after yesterday promising in a video to ensure a smooth transition to President-elect Joe Bidenaposs administration.On Twitter, he said of his fans: They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!  Trump also confirmed he would not attend Bidenaposs inauguration, departing from a time-honoured tradition that typically sees the outgoing president joining his successor at Capitol Hill for the ceremony. The practice is seen as an important part of the peaceful transfer of power. At least one Senate Republican, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, has said he would consider supporting an impeachment proceeding. Sasse, a frequent Trump critic, told CBS News on Friday he would definitely consider any articles of impeachment because the president disregarded his oath of office.

Sheaposs worn it for work, while out walking, to chill out on the sofa and even on Christmas Day. In fact, the -year-old has worn the Rowena dress, which is made from sustainably sourced merino wool, for  days in a row. The church Leader and college chaplain Sarah Robbins-Cole joked that sheaposs taking her job very literally, becoming a lady of the cloth. Sarah, who lives in Boston, USA, joined the  Day Dress Challenge on September ,  in a bid to live without fast fashion and help save the planet. She enjoyed it so much that sheaposs set herself a new challenge for . “To my surprise, wearing the same dress for  days in a row didn’t take anything away from my le. “Instead, it’s inspired me to go one step further and not to buy any new clothes or accessories between January , , and January , . “I realised that, at my age, I have clothes for every occasion andI need a ballgown, I’ll dust one off that’s been in my wardrobe since !“I am thinking of clearing my wardrobe and having a big declutter, but I’ll wait and see what I do wear over this coming year first.”Sarah has three children with her British husband, clergyman Adrian - Elizabeth and Will - and the family have two rescue dogs. She was among about  women who took up the -day challenge, run by clothing brand Wool.  Designed to show participants how wearing just one garment every day would change their spending habits, reduce their laundry load and, by not buying fast fashion, help them to save the planet, it also changed the way Sarah felt about how she looks and dresses. “I first saw the challenge on social media and thought why not ” said Sarah. “So, I really was a lady of the cloth!” Participants were allowed to wash and dry the dress overnight, butthey were awake, they were expected to wear it. And anyone who completed the challenge would win a , which is £, voucher to spend on a new Wool dress.  Teaming her long-sleeved, scoop-neck, knee- Rowena dress, made from sustainably sourced merino wool, with a dog collar when she was working and even tucking it into jeans for an outdoor hike, she then documented the challenge by posting all her  dferent looks on her Instagram page @thisdressagain.Sarah, who has just started a sabbatical and is in the midst of a doctoral programme in educational leadership, says not only did her repetitive wardrobe simply her le, it also taught her about something she calls “spotlighting.” “Spotlighting is that feeling that everyone is looking at you when in reality, they’re probably not,” she said. “Wearing the same dress for so long helped me avoid that feeling.”  The only really dficult part of the whole challenge, according to Sarah, was having to post a new look every day on social media. She said: “I forewarned my college students that I would be taking the challenge because they’d be seeing me in the same dress every day, which they might find odd. “But, more importantly, I told them not to think when they looked at the pictures I posted that they were a true reflection of my le and that I was always that tidy and well put together. “It was important to me for them to know that. “I remember one student telling me how she could come out of a lecture feeling happy, check her phone, see what looked like someone ’s picture-perfect le and feel depressed by the time she had crossed the campus to her next lecture.  “By taking on this challenge, I had an insight into the unbelievable pressure that comes with social media.” She was equally surprised by the number of random followers she attracted – including some very handsome men – who found their way to her Instagram pages – who she feared were not who they said they were. She also received some intimate and inappropriate comments from strangers, who she ended up blocking. But, overall, she had a very insightful and worthwhile experience, saying: “The dress was comfortable, easy to wear and completely unremarkable.  “I enjoyed accessorising it and, although I missed wearing jeans and found the long sleeves a bit warm when the sun came out, I didn’t really miss anything from my normal wardrobe. “It was so easy to get up and get dressed in the same thing. It saved me loads of time and it was simple to brighten it up using accessories. “The challenge did make me think about how many clothes end up in landfill, how much water is used to produce cotton and how we don’t really know whether the clothes we buy are made ethically, too.” Most importantly, the challenge helped Sarah to connect on a deeper level with what really matters in le.

Michael Delaney, from Co Offaly, Ireland, was in hospital for seven weeks with the virus last year and at one point his family was told to prepare for the worst now. But after a miracle survival, the -year-old was among the first  residents at his care centre to get the Pfizer vaccine this week. Thursday marked the beginning of the rollout of the vaccine to multiple nursing homes across Ireland. Mr Delaney  collapsed outside his home and was rushed to hospital last March, right at the start of the pandemic. I spent seven weeks in hospital and there was five weeks I donapost remember anything at all, he said. Theyrang the family and said I had an hour to live. The next morning I was up eating breakfast and here I am today getting the vaccine. Itaposs great to get it. I donapost know how to describe it, itaposs that good. I am very happy. Mr Delaney said he was looking forward to having visitors again. It means we could socialise with each other again, he added. Nicola Daly, director of nursing at Ferbane Care Centre, described it as an emotional day for residents and staff. It means the world, itaposs amazing, she said. Residents havenapost seen their families, and we have tried everything from Zoom, FaceTiming, WhatsApp.  This is fantastic - we can live our lives again. I have a house here that is full of le and full of laughter, and we are near that step again. The staff have been amazing and have put their shoulder to the wheel, day after day after day and they have kept Covid out. The last nine months have been horrendous. I am nurse, I was never trained for this, none of my colleagues were. Itaposs like you were going into war the whole time. Your back is against the wall, you have the stf neck and cannot relax and are anxious.If a resident got a cold, sore throat or temperature we thought it was Covid rather than thinking they have the flu. We have all aged  years.Residents and staff will receive a second dose of the vaccine in three weeks. By Valentineaposs Day weekend we can start living and partying again. It will be great celebrations in Ferbane, Ms Daly said.

Those businesses also have no guarantee of when they will be able to reopen.Many of those affected by the restrictions are not big chains but locally-owned employers that were just managing to get by when the pandemic began.Now they have endured numerous cycles of opening and closing over the last  months and burned through whatever savings they may have had.It is more important than ever that both of Scotland’s governments are doing everything they can to support Scottish businesses.The UK Government has already taken unprecedented action by protecting almost one million Scottish jobs through the furlough scheme.It has also supported , Scottish businesses with Bounce Back Loans and delivered £. billion to the Scottish government to manage the pandemic.Yet, in the words of the Federation of Small Businesses, support from the SNP government in Edinburgh has been “a dollar short and a day late”.Their own statistics show that more than , businesses are still waiting for their application to the business support fund to be processed, even though that fund closed in July.We are proposing a -working day national standard for new business applications to be processed and councils given the right support to clear the application backlog.#Douglas RossAlso, £ of every £ set aside to support businesses over the October ‘circuit breaker’ has not been paid out.The SNP have also announced support for ious groups like wedding suppliers and taxi drivers at the start of December, yet we are now into  and those businesses still cannot apply for that funding.That is why the Scottish Conservatives are calling on the SNP to take urgent action to improve the business grants system.We are proposing a -working-day national standard for new business applications to be processed and councils given the right support to clear the application backlog.This will ensure that businesses have the certainty of when they can expect a decision on their grant application and, most importantly, can access funding sooner.We are also calling for an end to the press-release-first-and-guidance-second approach that the SNP has taken on business funding.They should have applications open as soon as an announcement is made so that businesses are not waiting weeks for vital support.In addition, we are challenging the SNP to match the UK’s commitment to pay up to £, as a one-off grant to retail, hospitality and leisure businesses in England this month.Nicola Sturgeon’s government is sitting on more than £ million from the UK Government. Get this money spent.Given how dficult this winter is, this money should be used to support struggling shops, pubs and hotels now, not hoarded away for another day.Finally, we urge the SNP to give retail, hospitality and leisure businesses certainty that they will not face full business rates in the next financial year.We need  per cent tax relief carried into   so that we are properly supporting those businesses to recover from the pandemic. We will be campaigning for this to be delivered in the Scottish budget.With the vaccination rollout, we are all hopeful that we will see ato normality in the coming months. Yet,we do not properly support businesses across Scotland now, then we may find that many local employers remain shut even as the rest of our country reopens.Scottish businesses need cash in their accounts now, not more promises in SNP press releases.

I have aspirations to play in the top flight and I think that’s where this club is going.“I just turned  so, hopefully, the best is still to come and I feel like I’ve been at Dundee I’ve become a better player and I’m getting better every year.“My family will probably move up here later in the year which will be great for me to spend more time with them and not having to travel so much.“That’ll be the first time we’ve really lived together as a family, we’ve not had that yet.“In my career I’ve always been travelling a few days a week to see them.“Hopefully, that will improve my game as well, not driving so much and feeling settled at home.”Marshall’s first assignment since signing his new deal is to help the Dark Blues past Lowland League Bonnyrigg Rose tonight in the Scottish Cup.Dundee are big favourites for the clash but the former Queen of the South left-back knows the Championship side need to be careful to avoid being the victims of a cup upset.“These games are tricky because whichever way it goes, we won’t be getting much praise tonight,” he said.“If we win, people will say we should have won butwe get beat it’ll be a catastrophe.“Bonnyrigg will come and be hard-working, be dficult to beat and have some good players who will have had offers to go higher up the leagues.It will be a good test but we have to stay professional and approach it like we would any other game in the league.“When I was at Queens we playedFormartine United but we got past them.“Then there was a Scottish Cup game at Albion Rovers and the draw was already done, the winner would play Celtic.“We ended up getting beat - and missing out on a huge game so I’ve been on both sides of it.“I’ve beaten the smaller team but also been the wrong side of a shock.“It is a banana skin we need to avoid.”Dundee head into the contest on the back of their best run of the season, six unbeaten in the Championship and having won their last three.Marshall knows how important it is to keep the momentum going by making that four wins on the bounce and booking a place in round three.He added: “The team is going well just now as well, we’ve hit a good run of form with six games unbeaten.“The boys are flying and everyone is pulling their weight on the pitch. One to XI everyone is playing well, hopefully we can continue that.“Confidence is there. When we were going through a sticky patch confidence was low but winning games always helps.“I think you can see that by the way the lads are playing.”The Englishman also enjoyed his first trip to Broughty Ferry beach this week when the Dundee coaching staff put on a training session with a dference.He said: “We got a text saying we were training at the beach. I was like ‘what’s going on here, I didn’t even know Dundee had a beach!’“It was freezing as well but we did get a good session in and it was a good bit of bonding for the boys.”The Dundee media team posted out a photo on social media of a wayward football floating out to sea on the Tay.Marshall himself was quick to point the finger of blame on twitter at fellow defender Jordon Forster but admits ‘Fozzy’ wasn’t completely at fault.mdash Dundee Football ClubJanuary , “Paul McGowan stitched Fozzy up, to be fair,” he revealed.“Gowser asked for the ball, Fozzy played it to him and Gowser just moved out the way and it went straight in the sea!“I’m not sure Fozzy went to get it, that’ll have to come out his wages.”Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world but now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves. www.heatheryheightsDuring wintry weather and shorter days it can be tricky fitting in longer walks and time for exploring the outdoors.What is fantastic about Knapdale and Kintyre is that we only have to go a short distance to gain truly spectacular views. The three walks in this edition y from relatively short, using tracks and paths to the lovely viewpoint of Castle Dounie, to challenging, where the terrain is tough underfoot and good route finding skills are required. All three start at Crinan harbour before climbing up through oak and birch woods to gain open vistas with views to Jura, Scarba and Mull. The convoluted ridge walks are rugged and wild, the steep sides sweeping down to the Sound of Jura where tides race and swirl. If you are lucky you may see pods of dolphins or even whales.. At the car park a signboard shows the Crinan Trail. This is the shorter of the routes but all three start and finish together. Leave the car park and turn left. Keeping to the road by the shore you will see a trail marker post ahead leading you briefly along the shore before the path heads into oak woods. After m the path bends sharply left. To the right a faint trail heads west towards the Sailor’s Grave but your route starts its steep muddy ascent to the forestry road above.. On reaching the road turn right, after m you will reach a bench and the first junction to your left. Here you have a choice either come back from the track ahead or to your left. All routes can be undertaken in either direction. I suggest for the longer routes you go straight on and for the Crinan Trail you go left.. For the Crinan Trail follow the waymark posts and arrows. After .km the route turns right onto a path and winds up and down with glimpses of views to come. Turn left at a sign for a viewpoint. This will take you up to the knoll atop which the remains of Castle Dounie, a prehistoric dun, command spectacular views over the sound towards the Gulf of Corryvreckan. There it is said the Cailleach Bheur, a giant witch, once washed her plaid in its whirlpools. Enjoy the vista before ing down to the junction and turn left. The path now meanders down to the forestry road. Turn right and head north round the coast above Adnoe Point and back to your path down to Crinan harbour.. For the longer walks, go straight ahead at the bench . Follow the track for nearly km, which leads you round a couple of hairpin bends and above Adnoe Point, before turning south. Keep your eyes open for the waymark posts and turn left onto a path. Head uphill for m. At the viewpoint sign turn right up to Castle Dounie and enjoy. To your south is the ridge that leads to Creag Mhor.. Immediately after dropping from Castle Dounie you will see a broken down wall on your right. Follow this for a short distance until you can start to work your way up onto the ridge to your right, by a couple of birch trees with coners on the skyline above. The ridge walk is convoluted, airy, rough and summits numerous lumps and bumps with fantastic views. Keep to the crest or east side as the drop-offs to the west are impressive but not to be dallied with. The highest rocky bump of Creag Mhor is parallel to the north end of the rocks offshore.. After  minutes of knobbly and exposed ridge walking #you do not fancy tackling navigation along walls in woods # this is now the time to keep an eye out for an obvious wide firebreakin the trees, below to your left. This leads you at a ° angle straight to a forestry track in the valley below. To check you have the right point look across from the firebreak and you should see a wall continue the line on the other side. Head down the firebreak to the track and turn left. This will take you back to the junction by the bench where you can turn right on the forest road then left todown the path to Crinan harbour.. If you wish to adventure on* and are confident with your route finding then continue south on the ridge # crossing over an old wall not on the map # to where it suddenly drops to a tiny col with forest directly ahead. Ahead is a steep little rise with walls on it. One drops to the right but it is the one going southwest into the forest you need to follow, for the next m. Keeping the wall directly on your right, circumnavigating the odd boulder and ducking the odd branch, you will see that the deer have created quite a path and that the way is often clear. Eventually it drops you very steeply down to a stream with another wall directly ahead. Turn left, southeast, up the stream with the wall on your right # it is boggy # until you reach a quaint waterfall on your left. A small break in the wall to your right allows you to escape the trees that have fallen across the wall higher up. Continue with it on your left across a tree harvested area and up the bump ahead. You will pop out onto a track end.. Follow this short track down to the forest road below. Turn right and almost immediately turn left onto a grassy track that crosses a stream and heads east up into the forest. After m you will come to a sharp left-hand bend. Directly in front of you a wall goes steeply up into the trees. This is your route up to Bealach na Moine. It leads up slippery, mossy rock for m, over a barbed wired fence , up a very rough and eroded track for nearly m, past a spring hidden with fallen trees, then over more pleasant grass and moss to the col. This last section makes you realise why it is worth the effort as views open up east and west. Turn right over a couple of steep little hillocks on the ridge. Suddenly ahead you will see your goal, the trig point and the summit of Cnoc Reamhar, also known as Gallachoille Hill and a Marilyn to boot. It really is a fantastic view.. Toeither descend the way you came or drop down from one of the breaks in the ridge to the north end of the small lochan on the west side of the summit, and follow the faint Landover track north to the spring. Re-join your ascent route, taking care on the way down. Turn rightat the forest road it is now an easy km back to the junction with the bench. Turn right then left after m, following the path back to Crinan harbour.*You can also drop down the firebreak and turn right on the track to join the route up to Cnoc Reamhar,continuing along the ridge does not appeal.The described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities. The remainder, £,,, is mostly allocated to single-use ferry facilities, and a huge proportion of that is to provide overnight parking for CalMac ferriesreaders will have to make up their own minds about the merits of spending £,, for an overnight berth at Fionnphort, and £, on a feasibility study for a breakwater at Lismore.CMAL pay back around half of the £,, to the council through harbour dues for the use of council-owned piers, however, that still leaves a whopping £ million gap in the required funding.If past experience of other CMAL projects is anything to go by, the planned eight per cent increase in council harbour fees and charges up to   is not going to cover it.Fergus Gillanders, KilmelfordSir,Last year, , was challenging and, although many people like to give generously to charity at Christmas time, it may have been dficult to make a donation this festive season.It#s not too late # you can still help support the Royal National Institute of Blind Peopleby collecting and donating used stamps from cards and parcels you may have received.Your stamps will be recycled and turned into vital funds that will help RNIB support children with vision impairment.

These additional consumers will need more food while Scotland’s multial land can also meet, at the same time, the growing demand for a range of goods and services that hits targets on climate change, the environment, renewable energy, bioersity, and the wider and hugely important rural economy.#To move forward urgently, let us identy all the means and mechanisms we can put in place.  Let us have credibility for farmers by investing in bioeconomy, bioenergy, agro-forestry, precision farming, and shorter food chains – support for which is within the Government’s gt.#NFUS has been promoting our industry as one that can change to meet public goods for public money requirements, with an upbeat forward-looking mindset. This outlook will empower our farmers and crofters and drive us forward to the holy grail of sustainable profit with all the environmental, welfare and standards the public expect as thefor their investment and support for our industry.#In , the black cloud of COVID- needs swept away, a process driven by the vaccines that our scientists have developed, and lessons learned on the things we should do better but also how we have adapted and adopted new methods for good.#People should be more accepting of others’ views with ambition to work collaboratively for mutual benefit. There is a belief binary tribalism is ‘the norm’ and the use of social media to promulgate the “yer either for us or agin us” culture is acceptable. It is not hard being considerate and kind.#Agriculture also urgently needs delivery of an ambitious coherent policy delivering a sustainable profitable industry that addresses climate change, bioersity and an increasing demand for nutritious high standard and welfare food. Procrastination has a price.#Brexit will go by, like foot and mouth, the oil crisis, and the great depression, but we need enough freedom and flexibility to be able to innovate and chose our own paths through it as well.#We need to throw open our doors to the public and build trust on what we do and how we do it. There is huge potential from selling our story both on farm and in the food chain. We also need to encourage more ersity in our industry across the piece it can and will add value both financially and culturally.#To quote Shihab Kazi: #The moment you need to get started is called #now#.##I wish everyone health wealth and happiness for the coming year.#"},{"url":null,"title":"golf club responds to covid restrictions","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Ms Sturgeon said the new iant accounts for almost half of all new cases in the country.\"It is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned now than I have been at any time since March,\" said Ms Sturgeon.Schools will now stay closed for a further two weeks until February  - with plans to reopen on January  scrapped.The new lockdown means that outdoor gatherings are limited to two people from two dferent households.Anyone  or under will not be counted towards that number.Travel restrictions remain in place, with cross-border journeys banned unless essential.Places of worship will have to close again.Ms Sturgeon said that the new measures would not be \"in place any longer than necessary\", but warned that the lockdown could continue past February .The First Minister added that the Borders is currently at more than % of its COVID hospital capacity."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeons-coronavirus-announcement-full-lockdown-explained","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced that Scotland will enter a national lockdown.As of midnight tonight, it will now be a legal requirement for people to stay at home unless for essential travel.Speaking at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said: \"I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from tomorrow, for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes. This is similar to the lockdown of March last year.\"The First Minister added: \"Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.\"The decisioncomes as cases of Covid- have dramatically risen across the country, with, new positive cases announced today.Heres the key points from todays announcement:Stay at home messageFrom tomorrow,you live in a Level  areayou cannot leave your home except for an essential purpose - much like back in March.This means when you do go out, stay as close to home as possible and stay away from crowded places.And it remains the case that no-one is allowed to travel into or out of Scotland unless it is for an essential purpose.Schools will stay closedNicola Sturgeon confirmed that schools will stay closed until February  for the majority of pupils.The change will apply to all pupils - except vulnerable children, and children of key workers. And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.Ms Sturgeon said: \"I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.\"However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.\"First, the overall level of community transmission is too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.\"The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.\"We, therefore, have to adopt a cautious approach.\"So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.\"This decision will be reviewed on January  whether they canto school on February .Meeting people outdoorsFrom tomorrow,the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.Previously, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, the Scottish Government willconsider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to -year-olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the twopeople from twohouseholds rule.Working from homeAnyone who is able to work from home must do so.It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to workthat work cannot be done from home.The Scottish Government are asking people and businesses to take this \"really seriously\" because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level .Every business is being asked to look again at their operations and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Shielding advice changesIf you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.Hospitals near capacityNicola Sturgeon confirmed that thetotal number of Covid- patients in hospital is close to its April peak.In terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid- capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, GreaterGlasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to twoweeks ago.Other restrictions will also come into effect includingplaces of worship closing,no wakes, two-metre distancing in canteens and further premises closing.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.What help will be provided Grants areavailable for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions. That support is, in addition, to support through the UK wide furlough scheme.The Scottish Governmentrsquos financial support for businesses during the pandemic currently totals more than pound. billion.How can I report a rule breach You can report a breach taking part in Scotland by accessing the form here.The form is for reporting breaches and isnot meant for reporting emergencieswith the police still advising members of the publicto call  in an emergency.Recent Covid- hotspots:"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-new-lockdown-rules-borders","story":"THE Borders is going back into a full-scale lockdown for at least four weeks.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced todaythat mainland Scotland will see strict coronavirus rulesenforced from midnight until at least February .These rules will be even tighter than the Level  measures which forced the closure of pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops.During her statement, Ms Sturgeon outlined what the new restrictions will mean for mainland Scotland.

Its frustrating that people over  still havent received letters with details of their vaccination appointment and I know there are many anxious people waiting.ldquoIn the meantime, I would urge everyone to follow the tough new rules to minimise the virus spread as best we can until we get to that point.ldquoAlthough everyone predicted the restrictions on businesses such as hospitality would go on longer than the three weeks promised, Government support for firms is still far too slow.

Thorne Security says it could have a system in operation for £,, less than half the amount the  previously thought it would cost.The system would include four cameras to cover Main Street, Longrow, Burnside Square and the area around Hall Street and the cross.Four special television screens at Campbeltown Police Station would allow the police to watch the pictures from the cameras. The images would be recorded on an industrial-quality video recorder at the station. The pictures could alert the police to trouble or help them trace offenders.The team from Thorne Security will be visiting Campbeltown at the end of January to demonstrate the equipment.The secretary of the , Sergeant Douglas Reid of Campbeltown police, has already contacted the Scottish Office for more details about the funding package. Sergeant Reid said: ‘The  is fully committed, following the tremendous public response, to go in as far as possible along this road.’The  is already planning to apply to other local and national bodies for contributions towards the cost of the system.The Scottish Office’s challenge competition will make funds available for groups representing local communities to bid for money to fund CCTV systems.Applicants from dferent areas will bid in competition with each other for a share of the government cash.The first town centre security camera system in Scotland was set up in Airdrie three years ago. New research shows that in the first two years after the system was set up, the crime rate plunged by  per cent.The Scottish Office says there is no evidence that crime was simply being shted to areas outwith the reach of the cameras. Instead the total amount of recorded crime actually fell.FIFTY YEARS AGOMcCartney again!Mr Paul McCartney, ex-bass guitarist with the Beatles, has recently purchased from Mr A Revie, Loch Ranachan Farm, which comprises  acres and adjoins his other farm, High Park.Mr McCartney has been spending a few days on the farm with his we and family over the festive season.One happy Rangers fanMr Crawford Morans of  Albyn Avenue, who is employed with the Ministry of Social Security, has had a good ending to the old year.

In the Clyde, however, the Board of Trade did not insist on this in respect of vessels trading exclusively within what is known as the smooth water area.This area was within an imaginary line drawn from Skipness Point to Fairlie. On the date in question, the accused conveyed a cargo from Glasgow to Tobermory via the Crinan Canal.As soon as he had left Crinan, he was in contravention of the regulations, having entered the more hazardous waters off the west coast.On behalf of the accused, an agent stated that he had traded with the Bloodhound for nearly  years. During the war, the ship had been requisitioned by the Ministry of Shipping, and under the orders of that department had been sent outside the limits of the smooth water area.The accused had naturally thought that what he had been doing during the war, when he traded to ports on Islay and the Ayrshire coast, he was free to do now.Sherf Macmaster Campbell imposed a penalty of £."},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 1 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Searching for innovative ways to reconnect with audiences at home and abroad TWTC’s creative director Sadie Dixon-Spain created the ‘Clanagram’, creating paid employment for actors, and producing virtual keepsakes for audiences.Clanagrams are personalised video greetings, sending friends and family near and far love and good cheer, as TWTC’s team of professional actors bring to le a selection of Scotland’s great names.An ideal gt for those with Scottish heritage, Scots in exile, or simply lovers of all things Scottish – it is a unique message from a Scottish hero, sent to them directly to celebrate a special occasion, or simply just to make them smile.Visit www.clanagram to become a member of Bonnie Prince Charlie’s army and receive a message from the Young Pretender himself, a recitation of poetry by the national bard, or a tale from Scotland’s most famous outlaw, Rob Roy.The arts have suffered immensely due to the Covid- pandemic, while tight restrictions continue to press pause on the live events industry. With the creation of digital performances and offerings such as Clanagrams, TWTC aims to continue finding innovative ways of performing, bringing theatre back to audiences, and offering creative professionals employment once again.WEST KINTYRE:Nothing blows away the cobwebs like a walk along Westport Beach on Kintyre#s west coast.The beach, the longest in mainland Argyll, is one of the jewels in Kintyre#s crown and usually draws surfers and tourists from near and far all year round.At the moment, however, under the strict new lockdown measures which limit travel, it is much quieter than usual and is frequented mainly by walkers, runners and dog-walkers living nearby.This photograph, taken by Mid Argyll-based amateur photographer Aileen Gillies in December, shows not only the beach#s rugged coastline but also its wild beauty."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane january 8 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Here we spotlight some of the deserving stars that Prime Minister Boris Johnson applauds as “an inspiration to us all”.Last year brought to the fore a new breed of community champions# including those working in the NHS to treat coronavirus patients, scientists developing effective vaccines and key workers keeping essential services operating.These “ordinary people” who continue to go above and beyond have been recognised for sterling work delivered in extraordinary circumstances.The  New Years Honours has recognised champions of sport as well as stars of stage and screen but this year, more than ever, it is ordinary people who have been recognised alongside them. Among the deserving recipients are leading lights who have battled to save lives and keep the NHS afloat and those who have kept the country smiling by spreading kindness.The list includes medical experts as well as volunteers working with youngsters, the elderly and those with disabilities. Those working in libraries, education and community arts also received recognition. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “In a year when so many have made sacrices to protect our NHS and save people’s lives, the outstanding eff orts of those receiving honours are a welcome reminder of the strength of human spirit and of what can be achieved through courage and compassion. “The  New Year Honours offer us an opportunity to salute their dedication and recognise many who have gone above and beyond in their contribution to our country. “As we begin a new year and continue to come together to fight this virus, may their service and stories be an inspiration to us all.”Jacquie Winning’s award “recognises the achievements of everyone” at Forth Valley Sensory Centre following “an exceptionally challenging year”.The  year-old from Falkirk was recognised for going the extra mile to manage “wraparound” services to people with sensory loss during the pandemic “COVID- has been challenging for everyone, but more so for people with sensory loss. Those with hearing loss face challenges due to face masks and social distancing interfering with their ability to lip read.“Those with sight loss face signicant challenges managing to maintain physical distancing while undertaking essential trips out,” explained the MBE recipient.Jacquie’s support included providing Braille copies of virus information, establishing telephone, text and email befriending lelines to address isolation and producing podcasts providing vital updates.“The impact is that some of the most vulnerable people in society have been incredibly well supported during the most challenging of times. Thanks go to the dedication, enthusiasm and willingness to adapt by our team, volunteers and partners, and tremendous support of our board of directors.”Cabinet Office confirmation of Dr Tamas Szakmany’s award made him “astonished, touched and humbled”. The  year-old from Newport explained: “I thought I was doing my job like everybody . I didn’t think for one minute it would result in this. I’m really surprised. Once I was allowed to talk about it, the first thing I said was how fortunate I was to work with this team. “ was dficult professionally. Personally, I had many successes. It was a double-edged sword. The MBE is recognition for the enormous effort everyone has made to get us through the first wave. I hope we have similar success again.”The Royal Gwent Hospital critical care consultant, recognised for exceptional service to the NHS, spearheaded Welsh Critical Care Network response during the pandemic, rapidly disseminating information on lessons learnt via traditional and social media s. Filming his personal and professional le, he helped produce an emotional deeply personal documentary “Critical: Inside Intensive Care Coronavirus” episode, broadcasted by BBC Wales and included among American Society of Chest Physicians and Society of Critical Care Medicine teaching materials.A Belfast community worker is celebrating “the surprise of his le” after being honoured. Michael Briggs’ MBE was rewarded for services beyond the call of duty in the voluntary sector and community.“Even though we’ve hardly moved out of the office, it’s all been pretty busy,” explained the EastBelfast Community Development Agency Executive Director.“We’ve been managing our COVID programme, buying bulk food to get out to groups we support. We developed a network of groups delivering small packages to people who are vulnerable, shielding or in financial need.” The  year-old continued: “There are so many stories from older people who say ‘it’s just good to know people are thinking about us.”Thinking the honour email was promotional, Michael initially “didn’t actually take it seriously”.He revealed: “I nearly didn’t open it. Then I saw it was from the Cabinet Office. “For me, it’s about the efforts of other people as well.“So many people have been very supportive over the years. I’m the one who ends up getting the award, but other people have been involved in the success of my work.”A British Red Cross refugee support staff emergency responder initially thought his honour announcement email was spam! Golam Chowdhury was then “humbled” when his British Empire Medal was confirmed. “I had no idea I had even been nominated,” said the -year-old from Portsmouth.“It’s been challenging, both personally and professionally, but I am always amazed by human resilience and community spirit. Watching how people come together to support each other has been incredible.”Involved in active frontline response to COVID- in Hampshire as a Refugee Support staff member, Crisis Response South East tactical cell weekend coordinator and local Emergency Response, City of Sanctuary and Cycling UK volunteer, Golam received his accolade for outstanding achievements in healthcare during the virus pandemic.“I don’t do my job – or my volunteering – for praise,” said the father-of-two. “I do it because,the tables were turned and I was the one that needed help, then I would hope that there was someone out there to support me. “I’d like to dedicate my award to everyone in all communities who are helping others.”For more information on Honours recipients, go to gov.uk honours"},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 8 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

More than £ million of this we have been grateful to receive at Sightsavers.Money raised by players has been indispensable in helping Sightsavers to fund, in  alone, eye services for more than , people and more than  sight-saving cataract surgeries.In , funding also helped us to support the Covid- response. Children with disabilities kept learning throughout the pandemic, thanks to distance learning equipment and teacher training, PPE and hygiene kits.Children like Marie in Sierra Leone, who is blind and was in danger of being left behind when schools closed, until she was given a typewriter, a radio and assistance so that she could keep studying.So, once again, a big thank you to all the players in Scotland for your generosity.To find out about some of the lives being turned around by players# support, please head on over to www.sightsavers.org ppl or give Sightsavers a call on   .Dr Caroline Harper CBE, Sightsavers CEO.Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns on whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But, although customers’ usage of data more than doubled during the period, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m proud also of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.While BT Group continues to invest billions in these networks, we know that we can’t do this alone. We’ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland director.The  Covid crisis has prompted a greater sense of social cohesion and solidarity but it also exposed and exacerbated some of the barriers that blind and partially sighted people still face.Access to online shopping slots, a lack of essential health information in formats such as audio and braille, and confusion over whether social distancing allowed for blind and partially sighted people to still be guided added to the distress many felt.The first lockdown came out of the blue when we had little real-le experience of managing a national emergency, but it is now more essential than ever that we learn the lessons and ensure no one falls through the safety-net. Another period of enforced confinement during the winter months could hit some particularly hard.During the first lockdown, RNIB Scotland and other charities worked extremely hard to ensure the needs of the most vulnerable were met # at a time when even the most able in society were thrown by the suddenness and uncertainty the crisis had created.We negotiated set online shopping slots for people with sight loss, worked with public bodies to ensure the often vital information they put out was available in formats accessible to everyone, and claried the rules on guiding people with a visual impairment.These gains must be reinforced  we are ing to another nationwide lockdown.Currently, around , people are living in Scotland with signicant sight loss.

Following enforced shut-down in March , CPH was able to re-open from September to December, one of very few cinemas in the UK to do so.At CGS, Mr Fyfe had to consider the iety of needs of the school#s children and their parents, his own needs and those of his family as he supported the entire network of staff, which includes several more Davids # music teacher David Cosgrove and maths teachers David Hamilton and David MacDonald.The heroic work of all the school#s staff through lockdown ranges from supervising vulnerable and key workers# children in the HUB and the challenges of online learning, to packing and distributing food parcels and delivering hot lunches in the community.As leboat coxswain, Mr Cox leads a crew which includes several heroic Davids # David Mullen, David Ward, David Campbell, David Colville and David Reid.Despite still having to attend all call-outs, in full kit and PPE, the team#s training came to a halt soon into the first lockdown, but they were eventually able toto training on a two-week rotation, one week on land, the other offshore.Having to physically distance proved incredibly hard for the crew, with multiple people required to safely carry out some tasks.Even small rescues using the Y-Boat # the vessel on top of the Severn-class leboat, not to be confused with the inshore rescue boat which is towed on a trailer # presented challenges given the amount of space on the boat.Masks were, and continue to be, worn inside the wheelhouse at all times and when working closely together outside on the deck.These Davids # and, of course, so many other people in the community # helped navigate the community through unprecedented and challenging circumstances in many dferent ways.If you know of a heroic David who deserves a shout-out, please let us know by emailing editor@campbeltowncourier or telephoning  .CAPTIONS:David Cox.

The Glasgow-born artist, who has ancestral links to Kintyre, died at the age of  in .In , with the help of pupils from the art department at Campbeltown Grammar School, he created the Ro-Ro sculpture of a birlinn-style boat which sits atop a stone plinth near the town#s New Quay to mark the restoration of the short-lived ferry service between Kintyre and County Antrim.It was unveiled in October  by Campbeltown Grammar School pupils Collette Sloey and Alan Downie at a ceremony attended by fellow pupils, members of the public, Argyll and Bute councillors and members of Campbeltown Community Council, as well as Mr Wyllie himself.In addition to tracking artworks which exist in the public domain and in public collections, the Mapping Memories project aims to include the locations and details of the artist’s major temporary installations, such as the Straw Locomotiveand the Paper Boatwhich now exist only in memory and archive material.Throughout the year leading up to what would have been Mr Wyllie’s th birthday on Hogmanay , the George Wyllie Estate will welcome public contributions to the project and will publish previously unseen material from the artist’s own archive.By visiting www.georgewyllie anyone can add audio or video recordings, text, photographs and film as well as the geographical location of the work about which they are posting.A second blog on the website called Just For Fun asks people to share the ways in which Mr Wyllie inspired them to get creative.Announcing the digital launch of the trail, the artist#s eldest daughter, Louise Wyllie, said it would form a permanent marker of her father#s #out and about# approach to art, which took him across the UK and beyond.She said: #My father used to say that his definition of public art was art the public couldn#t avoid and there are hundreds of sculptures, installations and artworks out there some of which we know about, like the Running Clock in Glasgow, and others which were temporary, such as his most famous artworks, the Straw Locomotive and the Paper Boat.#There are works of my father’s out there – in pubs, houses and gardens – that we don’t know a lot about and it’s important to us that we find out more about them.#We’d like to collate as much information as possible to create the art trail map. The project will act as a window into the past, allowing people to discover my dad’s temporary installations, which were often his most ambitious and influential works.#So we#re asking the public # communities, artists, curators, critics, welders, shipbuilders, school pupils# anyone who worked with my father, who remembers his temporary installations, or knows the whereabouts of public sculpture, to contribute to this project by sharing their stories.#"},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-prestonpans-residents-admit-breaching-asbos","story":"Clare Ingle, , was ordered not to allow more than two visitors to enter her home in Dunbar when she appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court on June , .Ingle broke the order on November  last year and was fined pound by Sherf John Cook when she was in the dock at the Capital court last Wednesday.Meanwhile, James Hateley was given an ASBO on June  last year following incidents at his home in Prestonpans.He was also told not to allow more than two people to visit his home but was found to have breached the rules by having three visitors on April .Sherf Roderick Flinn sentenced -year-old Hateley to pay a fine of pound to mark the ASBO breach."},{"url":null,"title":"coppersmith-george-cairns-releases-cairns-scotch-whisky-liqueur","story":"George Cairns, of East Loan, worked with food technologists at Queen Margaret University in Musselburgh to create Cairns Scotch Whisky Liqueur, which combines blended malt whisky, elderberries and Highland heather honey.George began his career as a coppersmith in  as an apprentice with McMillan, the copper pot still specialist in Prestonpans, making stills and whisky distillery equipment.He progressed to a career in education on the subject, teaching his trade at the University of Edinburgh before working to develop his own drink.He said: ldquoIrsquove always had an interest in whisky all my le, from working in the distilleries, being a consumer, and Irsquove always been involved in some way or another.ldquoIt was an idea that came to me some years ago I spent some years working with the food technologists at Queen Margaret University to develop the method and get the formula just right.His whisky liqueur was ready to sell in February but launch plans were forced to a halt by the coronavirus lockdown.George said: ldquoThe Covid- pandemic impacted on the proposed launch of the product but a soft local launch on social media resulted in steady sales and excellent consumer feedback.George commissioned chocolatier-patissier Sebastian Kobelt to create a limited-edition cranachan truffle to complement the Christmas sales of the whisky liqueur.With hopes it will be on sale in shops early next year, Cairns Scotch Whisky Liqueur can be bought online from www.cairnsscotchwhiskyliqueur"},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-foodbank-boosted-donation-charity-elcap","story":"The money, which would have been used to pay for catering at ELCAPrsquos annual general meeting in October, was made available by the Prestonpans-based social care organisationrsquos Covid-enforced decision to move its AGM online.Paul White, ELCAP chief executive, said: ldquoIn a normal year, wersquod welcome delegates to our AGM with coffees, teas and a bite to eat.ldquoWhile we really missed seeing everyone, we thought wersquod donate the money we saved to a good cause in East Lothian.ldquoRecent research from the Trussell Trust forecast a  per cent rise in demand for food parcels between October and December this year.ldquoWith that in mind, we thought it right to support our local foodbank with a small donation.Candace Higgins, East Lothian Foodbank director, said: ldquoAt East Lothian Foodbank, we do our utmost to provide the best possible food to people restricted by poverty.

There was heavy traffic and, needless to say, Irsquod never driven a bus before and hadnrsquot expected to at this moment either.ldquoYou mean drive the bus  I foolishly asked.ldquoThatrsquos why you are here, isnrsquot it  he replied.I was on the bus with two other learners, as well as the instructor. We had been given some rudimentary instructions by him as hersquod driven the bus into the busy city centre, but I hadnrsquot realised we would actually have to drive the bus through busy streets.That was the first time I had driven a bus. It was, of course, an assessment of my capabilities. I negotiated as best I could and quickly learned what a tail swing was, as I nearly shaved off the nose of a woman who was standing on the edge of a pavement waiting to cross the road!The gearstick felt like it had been cemented to the vehicle, making changing gears a Herculean effort, with the engine roaring as I struggled to crunch it into gear. I drove slowly and cars began honking their horns in frustration.There was a big L on the rear of the bus, but I think when people see a bus in the city centre they assume the person driving actually knows how to drive a bus!It was a stressful  minutes and, when I finally pulled over, the instructor looked at his notes shaking his head. I cannot repeat what he said, but it was a generally negative assessment with lots of adjectives.Yet I wasnrsquot written off and was told I needed six full days of lessons as a minimum before sitting my test. Against everyonersquos expectations, including mine, I passed first time.I had done it and realised one of my lersquos dreams.There was a specic reason I needed a bus driving licence: I wanted to be a driver guide and take people around Scotland on tour. My le had undergone some dramatic changes and my le ambitions had changed as a result.It wasnrsquot, of course, about money or climbing a career ladder, but about the hopeful expectation it would make me rich in experiences and give me a new angle on le.My head and heart were full of Scotlandrsquos stories, and this seemed a perfect way to use my love of history and folklore, and share my passion for the landscape that held so many personal memories for me. I felt my le was about to be transformed and indeed it was.So that day I passed my bus driving test was a day of utter joy. Although over  years ago now, I can still feel the elation.I worked for dferent tour companies at dferent times in my le over the following  years. It was something I couldto whenever I needed it. During the last period of my time as a driver guide, a transport manager called Ronnie worked miracles as he juggled my rota to fit round my very complicated childcare arrangements. I will be forever grateful to him for his understanding.Were my expectations of the job realised or did I have an over-romanticised image of it  Irsquod say a bit of both. I tried my best to showcase Scotland, but I quickly understood people travel for dferent reasons with dferent interests.But it opened a window on the world for me. I met so many people from dferent walks of le and dferent countries and cultures. It taught me so much about the way humans behave towards each other and how we handle and respond to experiences in dfering ways.We were all on mini le journeys together, usually three days, sometimes five. In this brief fleck of time, a small group of people would be together amidst the splendour, and sometimes challenging conditions, of Scotland. When connections were made, it was because of shared values, regardless of cultural dferences.I began to see the tours as a metaphor for the way we live our lives, not just in observing others but myself as well. I had never thought the job would be a lesson on the philosophy of le, but that is partly what it became for me.It revealed to me that happiness, enjoyment and appreciation is a default within us, not something to be found, bought or acquired, or even weather dependent!That now seems so obvious but it took years for me to truly understand how we can become so easily trapped in the hedonic treadmill. I know thatrsquos a fancy term, but its meaning is simple: that as we go through le, we quickly take things for granted and so seek new and higher levels of satisfaction which we believe will give us happiness. While we can get a rush of pleasure and satisfaction in new things or experiences, we soon then take those for granted as well. So the cycle continues. We become like dogs chasing our tails in pursuit of what we think will make us happy or give us a more fulfilled le.The tours taught me that appreciation is the key to this. You donrsquot have to be a tour guide to learn this lesson, of course, as we all have our lersquos experiences that teach us. But that treadmill is so easy to fall into, even when you know it offers a  dawn. It can take a conscious effort to climb out of it.That is when we need what is called a hedonic reset: another fancy term for stopping that chase of our tail and taking time to appreciate what we have. This can be done by temporarily depriving ourselves of things we take for granted and so regaining our appreciation of them.A simple example could be when we go camping.

I will set out our decisions shortly.However, I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from midnight tonight for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes. This is similar to the lockdown of March last year.However, before I set out Cabinetrsquos decisions in more detail, I want to explain in some detail why they are so necessary.In the last few weeks, there have been two signicant game changers in our fight against this virus.One, the approval of vaccines, is hugely positive and offers us the way out of this pandemic.But the other - the new faster spreading iant of the virus - is a massive blow.Possibly the most simple way of explaining the challenge we face right now is to compare it to a race.In one lane we have vaccines - our job is to make sure they can run as fast as possible.Thatrsquos why the government will be doing everything we can to vaccinate people as quickly as possible. I will say more about that later.But in the other lane is the virus which - as a result of this new iant - has just learned to run much faster and has most definitely picked up pace in the last couple of weeks.To ensure that the vaccine wins the race, it is essential to speed up vaccination as far as possible.But to give it the time it needs to get ahead, we must also slow the virus down.And because it is now spreading faster, that means even tougher restrictions are necessary.The evidence is now compelling that the new iant is up to % more transmissible than previously circulating strains, and that it may add as much as . to the R number.And according to recent analysis of PCR test samples, it appears that the new iant already accounts for almost half of all new cases in Scotland.That increased and faster spread is undoubtedly driving the very serious situation we now face.Todayrsquos case numbers ndash , new cases, with % of tests being positive - illustrate the severity and urgency of the situation.No new deaths were reported today ndash because yesterday was a Sunday and registration offices were largely closed ndash but since I updated Parliament before Christmas,  deaths have been recorded in the daily figures. That again reminds us of the continuing grief this pandemic is causing.But this is not just about one dayrsquos numbers.We are now seeing a steeply rising trend of infections.Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.In the week from  to  December, the seven day incidence of cases per , of the population increased by % - from  per , to  per ,.Test positivity has risen sharply too.The next update on the numbers of Covid patients in hospital and intensive care will be published tomorrow.I would expect these to show that, nationally, the total number of Covid patients in hospital is close to its April peak. And in some boards, the pressure is already very real.For example, in terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, Greater Glasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The number of people in intensive care is still signicantly lower than the April peak ndash which partly reflects the fact that treatment of Covid has improved signicantly since last spring.But even so, the total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to  weeks ago.That means that these numbers reflect what the level of new cases was around  weeks ago.Given that the number of cases has increased signicantly since then, we can expect to see signicantly increased pressure on the NHS over the course of this month.Contingency plans remain in place to double and then treble ICU capacitynecessary.And the NHS Louisa Jordan continues to be available to help meet demand - as indeed it has been doing in recent months. , patients have attended there for scans and outpatient appointments nearly , NHS staff and students have been trained there and it is currently being used for Covid vaccinations.In short, NHS services are coping at present ndash although the pressure on frontline staff is considerable - but already in some areas the position is fragile, and getting more challenging.Andthe rate of increase in case numbers that we have seen in past two weeks was to continue unchecked, there would be a real risk of our NHS being overwhelmed - even with contingency plans in place.In fact, our modelling suggests that without further intervention, we could breach inpatient Covid capacity within  or  weeks.And, of course, a sharply increasing number of cases, in human terms, means many more people becoming ill and dying.All of that explains why we have to act quickly and decisively.The situation in some other parts of the UK - where case numbers are already much higher than here, and where the contribution of the new iant is already greater - shows what may lie aheadwe donrsquot.As things stand, we estimate that we are possibly about four weeks behind the position in London and the south east.The rapid acceleration in London began when it was at about  new cases a week, for every hundred thousand people. Thatrsquos the level Scotland was at a week ago.London is now seeing  new cases a week per ,. Test positivity is around %. And pressure on NHS services is acute.We have an opportunity in Scotland to avert the situation here deteriorating to that extent.But we must act quickly.The advice of our clinical advisers is clear that the increased transmissibility of the new iant means that the current level  measures may not be sufficient to bring the R number back below .It is essential that we further limit interaction between dferent households to stem the spread and bring the situation back under control, while we vaccinate more people.In short, we mustfor a period to a situation much closer to the lockdown of last March.Let me therefore set out in more detail the decisions Cabinet has reached.It is important to stress that these are not decisions taken lightly. I am acutely aware of the impact they will have and I know they will not be welcome.But they are in our judgment essential.As government, our clear and overriding duty right now is to act quickly to save lives and protect the NHS.We know that delay or preication in the face of this virus almost always makes things worse not better - evenit stems from an understandable desire that we all share to wait for more data or evidence.To turn to the decisions in detail. The decisions I will speak about a bit later on schools, let me be clear at this stage, they will apply to all parts of Scotland. However other decisions that I will outline will apply to those parts of Scotland currently at level , which of course is all of mainland Scotland, and they are effectively an enhancement to level .The island areas currently in level  will remain there for now, although we will continue to monitor them very carefully.These additional level  restrictions - essentially ing us to a position similar to the lockdown of last March - will be in place for the whole of January. We will keep them closely under review.However, I cannot at this stage rule out keeping them in place longer, nor making further changes. Nothing about this is easy.The first measure is that our fundamental advice, for everyone, is to stay at home.That is the single best way of staying safe.We consider that this stay at home message and advice is now so important that, from tomorrow, it will become law, just as it was in the lockdown last year.This means it will only be permissible to leave home for an essential purpose.This will include, for example, caring responsibilities, essential shopping, exercise and being part of an extended household.In addition, anyone who is able to work from home, must do so. It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to work,that work cannot be done from home.We are asking people and businesses to take this really seriously ndash as we all did in March, during the first lockdown, - because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level . We now need every business to look again at their operations, and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Businesses have already shown a tremendous capacity to adapt during this pandemic and Irsquom very grateful to them for that - and we need them to consider their operations again, as we all work together to reduce transmissions.The Economy Secretary will be speaking to business organisations about this, including this afternoon. We will also engage with unions on these issues. And we will continue to considermore regulatory action is required.We are also providing new guidance for people who are in the shielding category.If you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.The Chief Medical Officer is writing to everyone who falls into this category, and his letter will count as a Fit Note for those who need it.Unlike the lockdown last year, the frequency of outdoor exercise is not being limited.It is important for physical and mental health that we can get outdoors for fresh air and exercise as much as possible.However, from tomorrow, the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.As of now, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, we consider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to  year olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the  people from  households rule.In addition, strict travel restrictions remain in place across Scotland. From tomorrow,you live in a level  area - as the majority of us do - you cannot leave your home except for an essential purpose. When you do go out, stay as close to home as possible and stay away from crowded places.And it remains the case ndash and let me stress this point - that no-one is allowed to travel into or out of Scotland unless it is for an essential purpose.Presiding OfficerA number of other measures will come into effect on Friday of this week.It is with real regret that we consider it necessary for places of worship to close during this period for all purposes except broadcasting a service, or conducting a funeral, wedding or civil partnership.I am well aware of how important communal worship is to people.But we believe that this restriction is necessary to reduce the risk of transmission.While up to  people will still be able to attend funeral services, wakes will not be possible during January. And a maximum of  people will be able to attend wedding and civil partnership services.Presiding OfficerI know how devastating restrictions like these are and I give an assurance that we will not keep them in place for longer than is absolutely necessary.There will also be additional measures in relation to businesses, in addition to the tightening of the essential retail definition that took effect from Boxing Day.The current  metre exemption for workplace canteens will end ndash so canteens will have to ensure that employees sit  metres or more apart, rather than  metre.The number of non-essential services which remain open will be further restricted.Premises which will need to close as a result of these changes will include, for example ski centres, showrooms of larger retailers, and clinics offering cosmetic and aesthetic procedures.I know that many businesses have already been hit by the restrictions which were put in place on Boxing Day.And of course I know that the vast majority of businesses have taken their responsibilities seriously, and have invested in Covid safety measures.In addition, the move to home working has brought challenges for workers and employers. I am hugely grateful for the way in which businesses and their staff have responded to those challenges.Grants are of course available for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions. That support is in addition to support through the UK wide furlough scheme.The Scottish Governmentrsquos financial support for businesses during the pandemic currently totals more than pound. billion.However, we will continue to assess what more the Scottish government can do ndash either in closure grants or other forms of support - to help businesses and those who work for them.We will also work with councils to ensure community and social support for those who need it, including for parents balancing work and online learning.We will confirm additional resources later this week.Presiding Officer,The final substantive issue I want to address - before giving an update on vaccination - relates to schools.We announced before Christmas that most school pupils would learn remotely ndash rather than in school ndash until Monday  January.I can confirm that we have now decided to extend that date and keep schools closed to the majority of pupils until  February. We will review this again in mid-January.The change will apply to all pupils - except vulnerable children, and children of key workers. And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.There is no doubt that of all the dficult decisions we have had to take today, this was the most dficult of all and its impact is of course the most severe.The evidence to date makes clear that thanks to the hard work of school staff and pupils, schools in Scotland have been low-risk environments for Covid. We will work with our partners to ensure that remains the case.That will include ongoing work on testing in schools and discussions about when, in the context of the overall programme, it will be possible to vaccinate school staff.And I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.First, the overall level of community transmission is simply too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.We therefore have to adopt a cautious approach at this stage.So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.We will review on  January whether they can - as we hope -to school on the  February.I know that remote learning presents signicant challenges for teachers, schools, parents and young people, and we will work to support children and parents throughout this.The Scottish Government, Education Scotland and local authorities are working together to further improve the remote learning options which are available for schools.And it is also worth highlighting that since schools ed after the summer, more than , devices ndash such as laptops ndash have been distributed to children and young people to help with remote learning. More devices are being distributed by councils on a weekly basis, and in total we expect our investment ndashwhich builds on existing local authority action - to benefit around , disadvantaged children and young people across Scotland.I also want to stress one final point.Just as the last places we ever want to close are schools and nurseries - so it is the case that schools and nurseries will be the first places we want to reopen as we re-emerge from this latest lockdown.They remain our priority.That is why we are considering whether and to what extent - consistent with our overall duty to vaccinate the most vulnerable first in line with JCVI recommendations - we can achieve vaccination of school and childcare staff as a priority. Many teachers will of course be vaccinated over coming weeks as part of the JCVI priority list.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.Sothe evidence tells us we can get some pupils back safely, we will do that.However ultimately, the best way of enabling more pupils tomore quickly is by reducing community transmission of the virus as much as possible.And all of us ndash by accepting and abiding by the wider restrictions I have set out today - have a part to play in achieving that.Before I leave the issue of education, let me remind the chamber that we already had plans in place for the staggeredof universities and colleges. We will be considering this week whether any further change is necessary.Presiding OfficerBefore I close today, I want to give a brief update on our current expectations around vaccine supply.The Health Secretary will give a more detailed update on vaccination in a statement the chamber next week.However, I can confirm today that well over , people have now received their first dose of the vaccine.The first doses of the Astra Zeneca vaccine are being administered today.In total, over the period to the end of January - including the more than , already administered - we expect to have access to just over , doses of vaccine. Obviously, we hope that increases.These will be split roughly equally between the Pfizer and Astra Zeneca vaccines.However, we anticipate that some of the Astra Zeneca portion will be available only in the last week of January.We do not yet have certainty on supply schedules beyond January but will keep Parliament updated as these become firmer.However, our current expectation, based on assumptions about supply and the new advice on doses being administered up to  weeks apart, rather than , is that by early May everyone over , and people under  with specic underlying conditions, will have received at least the first dose of vaccine.That is everyone who is on the JCVI priority list, and comprises more than . million people.Once everyone on the priority list has been vaccinated, we will start vaccinating the rest of the population, and will do this in parallel with completing second doses for those on the priority list.Those timetables are of course heavily dependent on vaccine supply. And for that reason, they are at this stage cautious.However, I have tasked our vaccination team with exploring and keeping under ongoing review all options to speed up the rate of vaccination and bring these timescales forward as far as possible.I am grateful for the many offers of assistance we have received and while many of them may not prove possible or practical to take up, they will be consideredThe Health Secretary will say more about all of this in her statement next week.Presiding OfficerTo conclude, this is most certainly not the new year statement I wanted to give.And I know it is a statement no one wanted to hear.But as I said at the beginning, we are now in a race between the vaccine and the virus.The Scottish government will do everything we can to speed up distribution of the vaccine.But all of us must do everything we can to slow down the spread of the virus.We can already see ndash by looking at infection rates where ndash some of what could happen here in Scotlandwe donrsquot act.To prevent that, we need to act immediately and firmly.For government, that means introducing tough measures ndash as we have done so today.And for all of us, it means sticking to the rulesIt means continuing to follow the FACTS guidanceAnd it means ndash above all ndash staying at home.That is again our central message.Stay Home. Save lives. Protect the NHS.If we do this, we give the vaccine the time it needs to get ahead and ultimately win the race.I know that the next few weeks will be incredibly dficult.Irsquom sorry to ask for further sacrices, after nine long months of them. But these sacrices are necessary.And the dference between now and last March is that with the help of vaccines, we now have confidence that these sacrices will pave the way to brighter days ahead.So ndash for everyonersquos sake and safety - please stick with it and stay at home."},{"url":null,"title":"new-lockdown-rules-scotland-covid-restrictions-explained","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the new rules on Monday afternoon, asthe latest restrictions came into effect from midnight today in all Level  areas of the country andwill continue throughout the month.Speaking at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said: \"I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from tomorrow, for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes.

For a start only one of the four major Indian characters is played by an Indian actor . The others are played by blacked-up British actors in the shape of May Hallatt, Esmond Knight and, as Kanchi, Jean Simmons, fresh from playing Estella in David Leans Great Expectations. Theres a mannered shrillness to some of the performances, too. Audiences used to a more naturalistic style of acting will find it grating. Oh, and David Farrars entrance as nunly lust object Mr Dean isnt the most prepossessing: he arrives on a tiny pony wearing tiny shorts, long legs almost trailing the ground.

If you want a film about sexually frustrated nuns losing it in a Himalayan hilltop retreat that used to be a princes harem, this is the one for you. And ponder this as you view: Michael Powell initially wanted Greta Garbo for the Clodagh role before Glasgow-born Kerr came into the picture.SundayThe Dressmaker, Channel , .pmBased on the bestseller by Rosalie Ham, The Dressmaker is a s-set comedy drama threaded with lustrous strands of revenge, redemption and mother-daughter bonding.

This is not the work of crusty French bread or a rogue brazil nut, but a soft-centred chocolate which, when bitten into, put up a fight. In size, this hand-made cherry brandy fondant, decorated in pink icing, was less a piece of confectionary and more a magicianrsquos top hat. Its neighbours were half its girth, whereas the lid bulged over this beauty. It was absolutely delicious but next time ndash and there will be a next time ndash Irsquoll use cutlery.Irsquove been eating a lot of chocolates lately. Turkey, stuffing, and panetone too, and a surfeit of other festive fare. In my defence, these caloric treats are balanced with seasonal side dishes of brussels sprouts, carrots and kale. Irsquove had a fondness for brussels sprouts since we had to boil a saucepan of them in my first domestic science class. It was the only lesson in this subject where I excelled. Back then, I seasoned with pepper.Today, a drizzle of olive oil turns them into the food of the gods. Thus, as I reach for a mid-morning biscuit, eyeing up the snow clouds outside and thinking of the energy required to get me through to lunch, I refuse to feel guilty. Others, however, seem hell-bent on pricking the nationrsquos conscience and turning an innocent cooked breakfast or buttered scone into a source of shame.There are many reasons to dread the start of the new year, not least the dark and cold. One unfailing, ill-timed and unnecessary scourge is the avalanche of advice doled out around January  by nutritionists and dieticians. Even worse than the tips of health professionals is the enthusiasm of former junk food addicts who, after a Damascene conversion that usually involves a near-death experience, are messianic about their new habits.My idea of weight control is whether or not I can tuck a T-shirt into my jeans after theyrsquove been in a -degree wash. The battery on my bathroom scales died years ago, since when theyrsquove been gathering dust under the bed. This is not something to boast about , but while I can face up to many things in le ndash a leaking roof, mice under the eaves, a looming taxdeadline ndash knowing how many kilos Irsquove gained is not one of them.There seems something sadistic about exhorting people to give up comfort food at precisely the time of year it was designed for. It might be fine to start January with a health kickyou live in Alice Springs or Calornia. In Achiltibuie or Crail, however, it feels cruel. When sleet is whistling around the windows, and the streets are coated in ice, the idea of following a meagre, challenging or carefully calibrated diet does not appeal.All of us know, by now, that Covid does not just love a crowd, it is also drawn to love handles. Being clinically obese is thought to raise the risk of coronavirus complications. The unfailing appearance of New Year diets, however, seems more a lestyle adjunct than a serious medical intervention. They fall into the same category as making resolutions to give up fags or booze, or to pound the pavement, clocking up steps like a hamster on a wheel. This year, however, therersquos not even the incentive of needing to be beach-ready by summer. I doubt many of us will be mentally prepared to launch ourselves into a warmer climate and inviting sea in July, evenwe are enviably lithe and toned.Obviously,I felt I was getting too heavy, Irsquod feel obliged to knuckle down and deal with it, whatever the date. It is true also that the majority of us could probably benefit from tweaking our menus around the margins. But the longest, blackest and dreariest month of the year is not the time to begin. It is counterintuitive, and possibly even self-defeating, to ask us to turn ourselves into a new and better version of ourselves, ldquothe best me I can be, when our internal clock is on perpetual snooze, coming alive only at the smell of roasted potatoes. When night descends by mid afternoon, and we have barely enough oomph to empty the dishwasher, let alone turn the kitchen into a MasterChef set, our willpower is posted missing.Perhaps I ought simply to bypass the magazine features that show vegetable slurries greener than a David Hockney landscape, or chargrilled chicken served with an acre of al dente field. Yet it is not the promise of slimness that lures me in but the ever-changing science of food. That, and the thought of the guinea pigs who allow themselves to become living laboratories. One such group is the cohort of older women cited in the German science writer Bas Kastrsquos new book, called The Diet Compass.These grandmothers were each given a muffin a day for seven weeks. One lot was baked with sunflower oil, the other with palm oil. Unsurprisingly, everyone gained weight, but those in the second category grew fattest. More cheering is Kastrsquos discovery thatyoursquore over , a very small glass of white wine with dinner works like a catalytic converter, in terms of cholesterol and insulin. After you reach o, however, all benefits fade.

Once first names have been established, itrsquos Mr Johnson, Ms Sturgeon, Mr Leonard you get the picture. An honoric, according to Wikipedia, is ldquoa title that conveys esteem, courtesy, or respect for position or rank when used in addressing or referring to a person. And therein lies a problem. Do we ordinarily need to convey esteem, courtesy, or respect in this day and age Irsquom not so sure about esteem, but the latter two qualities seem to be sorely lacking in public discourse. At The Herald, we like the tone of civility they imply. It is only a matter of courtesy to refer to the subject of a report as Mr MacDonald rather than MacDonald and respect for achievement to acknowledge Professor MacDonald.There has to be a line drawn, however the reader would soon switch off from a storyit was peppered with references to Jimmy MacDonald, OBE, FRCSE. health service resources, to know that it is being put forward by a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh.There will be those who will argue that all this is antiquated. Should we be steering clear of distinctions of class, gender, marital status and academic achievement Our style guide for in-house journalists has this to say: ldquoGenerally, everyone aged  and over is referred to as Mr, Mrs or Ms . The exceptions are famous people, criminalsand people who have been dead for a reasonably long time. Common sense is key here depending on the tone of the piece.

In Edinburgh, the National Galleries plan to revisit their superb Eardley retrospective of a few years ago, but with more new archival material, and the fruits of new research into Eardleys methods, including her use of photography.There will also be a new book by curator Patrick Elliott. In Dumfries, Dulau points out that the Gracefield Arts Centre has some astonishing unseen documentary photographs of and by Eardley, and on Arran, the nascent Heritage Trail will mark places of interest, from the cottage which Eardley and her painter friend, Margot Sandeman, used as a studio over the holidays as young women, to the beach on which Eardley painted an early landscape.ldquoI think most interesting, too, is that theyre speaking to locals who knew Eardley, now, whilst they still can, whilst that knowledge is still there to tap.There will be an exhibition at the Scottish Gallery to coincide with theEdinburgh Festival and at Paisley Museum, there will be specialist tours of the Secret Collection store to view previously unseen early drawings made whilst Eardley was still a student. It is a wide sweep. For Eardley is still an enigma, one of those th century women artists ndash like Barbara Hepworth or Tove Jansson - whose deliberate dedication to their art despite the dficulties that women faced in being able to do so, became all-encompassing.Eardleys influence on the generation of artists that came after her was and continues to be huge, partly because of the immediacy and insight of her vision ndash it does not date.Her ability to capture character, relationships and place seemed innate, from the street kids in Townhead, ldquothe living part of Glasgow as she called it, where she had her studio, to the clftops of Catterline in Aberdeenshire, where she spent her final years. ldquoStand at peace, she would tell the children, serious, as she tried to get them to stop moving for long enough to sketch their essence.But Eardley, too, seemed to stand at peace when painting, a focused, frenetic, fast-paced slapping on of paint, sketching le in simple strokes, layering on, rubbing in, scraping off. ldquoI never seem to find I want to move, she said in a letter to her close friend, the painter Margot Sandeman, content some years later in her cottage at Catterline, pitched at the end of a row, undisturbed by friendly neighbours.Her large seascapes and field views belong to these final years, painted down on the shore in all weathers, her easel lugged down with the help of local fishermen. She was a brilliant master of light, but she painted the dull greys too, flashing in a streak of red, an emotion from the landscape or from the brush.And her work constantly evolved, refined, even in that scant decade and a half. Just before her death of the breast cancer that racked her body and spread to her brain, Eardley had a breakthrough solo exhibition down in London at Gustav, Browse and Delbanco, with works in which she had begun to add elements of collage, the pickings of the Glasgow streets, from newspapers to sweet wrappers.Outrageously, a partner at the firm picked them off, as though London, despite its own slums, its own rags, would not take to the literal pasting on of the evidence of Glasgows poverty-struck Eastern streets. Eardley fumed, but she kept on, despite the fear of the cancer, the pain. When she died, working still, an unfinished portrait of two more Glasgow children was on her easel, the brilliance of expression and character caught in the act of creation. Some  years on, no-one, not even a London gallerist, would be picking bits off now."},{"url":null,"title":"independence-eu-scotland-set-fast-track-long-haul","story":"This is no small matter. An independent Scotlandrsquos relationship with the European Union would be the most consequential decision of its future foreign policy. Small states such as Finland, Denmark, or Ireland all put the EU centre stage in their international policies. And, as the UK will find, leaving the gravitational pull of the EU is challenging indeed.It could be argued that the Scottish Government goal of independence in the EU should be Scotlandrsquos longer term aim. For now, Scotland might benefit from letting the new EU-UK relationship, however problematic, settle in. Setting up a new state will take time, not least the challenges of currency and managing the fiscal deficit in the aftermath of the Covid crisis. And a dferent UK government might move back closer to the EU, changing the implications for independence.Some argue that Europe is not so important in independence debates, or suggest a transition over time via the European Economic Arealike Norway, or even favour a more Brexit-like Scexit where an independent Scotland is in neither the EU nor EEA.Yet such hesitancy may mean missing the EU boat. Awareness of Scotlandrsquos pro-remain vote is currently high across the EU. But interest in Scotlandrsquos independence debate ies: itrsquos followed more in Berlin or the Hague than in Prague or Budapest. The EU has many other more important priorities to contend with.Still, the upcoming Holyrood elections, alongside the new EU-UK deal, are also prompting substantial interest from EU media as to the prospects for Scottish independence. And EU political figures are fully aware that a fragmentation of the UK is possible.The political challenge for the pro-independence side is how to build on and dynamise these current levels of awareness and sympathy. EU member state governments will stay neutral on the constitutional question. But there are plenty of politicians, not least in the European parliament , who insist that an independent Scotland would be welcome back in the EU. Even where governments, such as in France, Spain or the Netherlands, are concerned at the prospect of a disintegrating UK, there are opportunities to engage positively with their publics ndash as the UKrsquos baffling and self-harming lsquoglobal Britainrsquo sets sail.But European politics moves on. A Scottish rejection of the UKrsquos new post-Brexit trajectory is likely to have more salience, impact and support in the coming period thanit waits a decade. By , the new EU-UK relationship will probably have settled down. Upsetting and recasting it might look more problematic then, whereas an independence referendum in , for instance, would look like another unfolding, and eminently understandable, consequence of Brexit.This is where those who caution against speed may be mistaken. Itrsquos conceivable thatScotland chose independence in , it could re-join the EU ahead of the western Balkan candidates. Certainly, dferent EU opinion-formers see Scottish accession as much more straightforward, technically and politically. While the Scottish debate obsesses around currency and deficits, many EU observers see in Scotland a country that spent  years in the EU, is still aligned to EU rules, and is a stable, ing democracy .But the independence debate needs to be alert to how it looks from the EU. And those who want a Scexit outside both the EU and EEA should explain the very dficult economics of that isolationist position. Nor does the simplistic dismissal of the EUrsquos single market as neoliberal, unfettered capitalism match the reality of the tough social and environmental level-playing field conditions that are in the EU-UK deal.Those who prefer the Norway approach need to ask themselves why no other country since  has chosen to join the EEA rather than the EU. It creates a major democratic deficit ndash a strange choice for a newly independent state, and in the case of Norway only happened after its public rejected the negotiated EU accession terms.Nor is the EEA a transitional route to the EU rather it might be taken as a signal of lack of interest. If Scotland wanted to re-join the EU that would need to be clear upfront after an independence vote. A candidate country usually agrees a specic association agreement with the EU, with the added plus of also unleashing both political support and financial assistance.Independence in the EU will certainly mean a hard border between England  Wales and Scotland . But the UKrsquos brave new world on the edge of the EU will give much insight into the implications of that border and likely costs and benefits for Scotland.All of this assumes, of course, that there is a legal, constitutionally valid referendum, including clear political agreement between London and Edinburgh. The rather inward-looking debate around lsquoplan Brsquo tends to ignore the fact that some plan Bs may be a hard sell in the EU. It might also be wise, in terms of future EU understanding, to put more emphasis on why Boris Johnson should allow a referendumthe SNP win a majority in May, rather than already weakening the impact of his potential lsquonorsquo by saying itrsquos expected.The EU choice is not a side issue in the independence debate. It would determine the type of independent state Scotland would be: one that works with others, at the table, to influence EU choices, or one that sits it out on the sidelines. Striking while the iron is hot might provoke a more positive and welcoming European dynamic than a debate that is overly inward-looking and cautious.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

By prioritising the vaccine by age, you are giving it to the richest first, and compounding health inequalities\" alt\"HeraldScotland: \" class\"editor-image\"This is a gap that has been widening notably in the second wave.According to the Scottish Intensive Care Society Audit Group , there have been twice as many Covid ICU admissions since August for people from the poorest areas of Scotland compared to the wealthiest .In the first wave the dference was much narrower: % to %.: If only taking back control had also applied to our borders in a pandemicWe know that the poorest have been twice as likely to die and the less well-off are much more likely to work in essential occupations which cannot be done from home.While the focus has been on immunising frontline NHS staffanalysis by NRS has shown that Covid death rates are actually higher among factory workers, retail staff, drivers, and people in the construction trade.\" alt\"HeraldScotland: \" class\"editor-image\"The counter to this of course, is that vaccination is not the only solution: we could arguably do just as must to protect these iniduals in low-paid and insecure workwe signicantly improved the financial support and facilities for self-isolation, given that many will not qualy for sick pay and live in overcrowded accommodation.Dr Zubaida Haque, a member of independent SAGE, told Newsnight this week: ldquoThe reason why over-s are being prioritised for the vaccinations is because age is a signicant predictor of risk in Covid-.ldquoButthe Government focused on improving test, trace, isolate and support - and itrsquos the isolate and support that matters the most - then that is also going to get us out of this pandemic, because that is going to suppress the virus.Indonesiarsquos approach is also not the only way of restarting the economy.

It is due to the Rangers v Celtic match on Saturday, January .The match was shown on a TV channel that requires a long-term subscription and many Glaswegians cannot afford such luxuries, but they were so desperate to watch the match they they crowded into small flats of the few who did have subscriptions and ignored social distancing laws. By keeping the volume of TV commentary low the police would not be able to catch the culprits, especially since this happened at many locations all at once.I note that Celtic have been in the United Arab Emirates this past week. It is a place that has strict censorship and refuses to admit that it has many Covid- cases.What a dreadful example they are setting.

It was little more than a regurgitation of misinformation which has been pedalled in much of our media over the last four years.I also heard the selected highlights of Donald Trumprsquos leaked phone-call with Georgiarsquos Republican Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, which provided Mr Maughanrsquos inspiration. It comprised little more than the President urging him to do his job properly by reacting to evidence of election fraud in his state. Inaction in the face of wrongdoing facilitates the injustice. But Mr Raffensperger is compromised, as witnessed by his willingness to attempt to damage Mr Trump.In spite of four years of ceaseless attacks from the media, a phoney impeachment and treacherous officialdom, Mr Trumprsquos record of achievement is impressive: in international affairs he started no new wars, defeated Islamic State, revamped the military, signed not one but four Middle East peace deals, defused a tense stand-off with North Korea, exposed Iranian ill-will on the nuclear deal and, most importantly, confronted the Chinese Communist Partyrsquos hegemony and litany of abuses at home he produced a booming economy and record stock markets, achieved record high black and Latino employment rates, punctured the absurdly expensive green deal balloon, managed  per cent reduction in illegal immigration by , effected Obamacare reform and extracted warp-speed vaccine development.He achieved more in  months than Joe Biden achieved in  years in political le. Mr Bidenrsquos only achievement is personal enrichment.The wellbeing of honest people throughout the world is contingent on a strong USA led by a capable Commander in Chief.SoMr Maughan meets President Trump one day on a golf course, I suggest he should treat him with respectful gratitude.John McArthur, Glasgow G.COMPLAINTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROBEDNOT all the blame for the events in Washington lies with Donald Trump and his leading supporters. Had the mainstream media properly reported and discussed the ious allegations of material electoral fraud the issue might well have been defused. Also,the Supreme Court had heard the challenge brought by Texas and endorsed by Mr Trump that would have helped to close isions.While claims of interference by a rogues gallery of foreign states are entirely implausible, many of the other allegations are not.Suggestions that vote-counting machines were linked to the internet and could be remotely hacked could best be described as ldquoI want to know more.Some evidence produced definitely warranted detailed investigation ndash notably the glitches in certain vote counts where blocks of votes suddenly switched from Mr Trump to Joe Biden.Statistical evidence goes further and at least raises doubts as to the overall result. The simplest is that Mr Biden got by far the largest-ever presidential vote off a record low for a winning candidate of  counties to more than , won by Mr Trump. However, as both the mainstream media and the Supreme Court chose not to canvas and thereby defuse these matters, the distrust and ision will fester, to the severe weakening of America, a result which will undermine our security here in Britain.Otto Inglis, Crossgates, Fe.BLACK MARKS FOR RED TAPEFIFTY years ago, a hospital was run very efficiently by a superintendent, a matron and a secretary. They knew their job and ran a team who also knew the job and had freedom to do it. If needed, they collaborated with colleagues in nearby hospitals. Fty years ago the councillor in charge of education had a business background and would make a decision in a lunch break, setting out clear criteria for judging outcomes.Now our hospitals are over-run with a plague of administrators , who need to take over ward space to accommodate growing numbers and who are unavailable after pm, leaving nursing staff to take urgent decisions. Now in local government we have a six-week committee cycle so administrators, often with no business acumen, can shuffle mounds of paper and decide what to tell elected members. Fty years ago, administrators were a support resource for frontline staff who delivered the goods. Now they are the frontline staff who suck resources out of the system and in some cases are paid more than the Prime Minister.James Watson, Dunbar.Read more: We must not let the old wither away for the sake of the young"},{"url":null,"title":"big-read-20-year-quest-preserve-scotlands-historic-canals","story":"No longer the once bustling water motorway that saw sea-going vessels and barges transport everything from crops to livestock, to passengers from the port of Grangemouth to the heart of Glasgow, the worldrsquos first man-made sea to sea ship canal, the Forth  Clyde, was in its death throes.Opened in  to serve the industrial revolution and closed in , the waterway was derelict. Choked with weeds, tow paths littered with crisp packets and broken bottles, filthy water and everything including the kitchen sink beneath its calm surface, Scotlandrsquos longest lowland canal and its eastern cousin, the Union Canal, shared the honours of being dangerous, smelly eyesores.Without the efforts of small groups of passionate ldquocanal-aholics who cleared junk and weeds from clogged locks, the canals would almost certainly have been filled in or simply left to fall into disrepair.Instead, this May will mark  years since the ambitious millennium project to revitalise the two canals reached its climax.After a breathtaking two years of work that saw the cluttered canals cleaned, a new km stretch of Union Canal created at Edinburghrsquos Wester Hailes, some  major obstacles overcome, seven new opening bridges and  road bridges built, nine new locks,  masonry bridge refurbishments and , tons of silt removed, a new chapter in the le of the two waterways began.Over two decades, the pound. million Millennium Link has transformed areas around the once grim waterways into prime real estate, sparking the construction of thousands of houses, inspired new businesses from cycle rentals to water sports centres, created mini communities of brightly painted houseboats and become thriving havens for wildle.Enjoyed by walkers, cyclists, anglers and canoeists, perhaps most surprisingly for those who once collected rubbish from its surface, they have attracted tourists from around the world.ldquoWe used to clean up the canal and it was absolutely shocking, recalls Tommy Lawton, one of the founders of the Forth and Clyde Canal Society which, with other canal groups across the central belt, helped drive forward the idea of a revived canal network.ldquoThere were parts of the canal just behind Kirkintilloch and Twechar where there was so much rubbish dumped, you could walk across the water ndash and we often did.ldquoWe bought two old barges from British Waterways for pound each, put in new bottoms and outdoor motors.

We got , signatures in six weeks ndash remember this was well before social media.ldquoWhen the Lottery came back and said they would provide funding for the Forth and Clyde Canal and the Union Canal as well, we just about fell through a hole in the ground.Richard Miller, Scottish Canals director of infrastructure, was a graduate engineer in  appointed to work on the Millennium Link. ldquoA lot of people had a lot of doubts, he recalls. ldquoWhy spend pound. million on reopening a canal, why not built a school or hospital ldquoBut the Millennium Link has definitely delivered on that pound. million investment from  years ago.One economic report from late  suggested Scotlandrsquos reborn canals had inspired pound. billion of investment in or around their banks, with more than  homes built and almost the same number of main construction jobs supported.While last summer, with the world reeling from Covid- and Scots emerging from lockdown to explore their local areas and reboot amid nature, a Glasgow Caledonian University study revealed the death rate figures for communities living close to canals had lowered since they had been regenerated.No longer dumping grounds, the canals provide nature corridors for deer, kingfishers, otters, foxes and pollinators.ldquoThere is now good quality green and blue space, says Richard. ldquoIt has delivered  times the original investment and created health benefits for people of Scotland which has been put at poundm.ldquoItrsquos a national asset.Both canals are drenched in history.Work on the Forth  Clyde Canal began in , triggered by the Industrial Revolution as manufacturers sought a fast way to share their products and trade ballooned.Rising from the port at Grangemouth at the mouth of the River Carron, it followed the line of the Antonine Wall and lted boats through a flight of locks at Falkirk towards Glasgow.Jacobite money seized following the  rebellion enabled the remaining locks to Bowling to be constructed in .Almost two decades later, a bitterly cold winter that led to coal shortages in Edinburghrsquos expanding New Town prompted moves to construct a new canal link with the west. Among the navvies to construct the -mile Union Canal were notorious murderers Burke and Hare.But faster railways, the closure of the port of Grangemouth following the First World War and new motorway links brought their demise.ldquoFrom the day they closed people wrote letters to newspapers saying it was madness, but they werenrsquot listened to,says Mr Miller. ldquoIt was down to volunteers to try to keep them open.It took a mammoth effort between  and  to fulfil the Millennium Linkrsquos promise to revive the canals.

The mixing of people on that scale, including the potential movement of tens of thousands of students to university halls and private-rented flats, simply isn’t safe right now.

Among the deserving recipients are leading lights who have battled to save lives and keep the NHS afloat and those who have kept the country smiling by spreading kindness.The list includes medical experts as well as volunteers working with youngsters, the elderly and those with disabilities. Those working in libraries, education and community arts also received recognition. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “In a year when so many have made sacrices to protect our NHS and save people’s lives, the outstanding eff orts of those receiving honours are a welcome reminder of the strength of human spirit and of what can be achieved through courage and compassion. “The  New Year Honours offer us an opportunity to salute their dedication and recognise many who have gone above and beyond in their contribution to our country. “As we begin a new year and continue to come together to fight this virus, may their service and stories be an inspiration to us all.” vw, px\"  Jacquie Winning’s award “recognises the achievements of everyone” at Forth Valley Sensory Centre following “an exceptionally challenging year”.The  year-old from Falkirk was recognised for going the extra mile to manage “wraparound” services to people with sensory loss during the pandemic “COVID- has been challenging for everyone, but more so for people with sensory loss. Those with hearing loss face challenges due to face masks and social distancing interfering with their ability to lip read.“Those with sight loss face signicant challenges managing to maintain physical distancing while undertaking essential trips out,” explained the MBE recipient.Jacquie’s support included providing Braille copies of virus information, establishing telephone, text and email befriending lelines to address isolation and producing podcasts providing vital updates.“The impact is that some of the most vulnerable people in society have been incredibly well supported during the most challenging of times. Thanks go to the dedication, enthusiasm and willingness to adapt by our team, volunteers and partners, and tremendous support of our board of directors.” vw, px\"  Cabinet Office confirmation of Dr Tamas Szakmany’s award made him “astonished, touched and humbled”. The  year-old from Newport explained: “I thought I was doing my job like everybody . I didn’t think for one minute it would result in this. I’m really surprised. Once I was allowed to talk about it, the first thing I said was how fortunate I was to work with this team. “ was dficult professionally. Personally, I had many successes. It was a double-edged sword. The MBE is recognition for the enormous effort everyone has made to get us through the first wave. I hope we have similar success again.”The Royal Gwent Hospital critical care consultant, recognised for exceptional service to the NHS, spearheaded Welsh Critical Care Network response during the pandemic, rapidly disseminating information on lessons learnt via traditional and social media s.

We developed a network of groups delivering small packages to people who are vulnerable, shielding or in financial need.” The  year-old continued: “There are so many stories from older people who say ‘it’s just good to know people are thinking about us.”Thinking the honour email was promotional, Michael initially “didn’t actually take it seriously”.He revealed: “I nearly didn’t open it. Then I saw it was from the Cabinet Office. “For me, it’s about the efforts of other people as well.“So many people have been very supportive over the years. I’m the one who ends up getting the award, but other people have been involved in the success of my work.” vw, px\"  A British Red Cross refugee support staff emergency responder initially thought his honour announcement email was spam! Golam Chowdhury was then “humbled” when his British Empire Medal was confirmed. “I had no idea I had even been nominated,” said the -year-old from Portsmouth.“It’s been challenging, both personally and professionally, but I am always amazed by human resilience and community spirit.

Loganair has recruited and trained engineers locally to take over from retiring long-serving members of its team and is committed to continuing this policy of local investment in Orkney wherever it possibly can. During the new contract, Loganair has said it fully expects to convert the aircraft to use low-carbon propulsion to replace the same type of conventional piston engine which has powered the services for over  years.

As ordinary folk, none of these three ‘coves’ come with the egotism associatedwith this level of stardom. Their down-to-earth attitude, gentle humility and self-confessed naivety of the wider music industry is part of their unique charm and connects them to their fans across the generations who reward them with unwavering loyalty.“The Barrowlands was booked but that sold out just as quickly. Suddenly all the venues sold out, including gigs in London and Manchester. It was unbelievable.”“We are not the type of band that can sit down and invent new materials,” said Innes.“Everything comes out of Boydie’s head and, until it’s ready to be released, it’s not coming. You don’t ask him to do anything. He has a heart of gold and means well to everyone but,you ask him to do something, and he’s not ready for, it will not get done. We are waiting to see what happens with live gigs next year.”Innes confesses to feeling nervous about the uncertainty of the future of live performances. He said: “Over the summer, a lot of people believed the situation with the pandemic would be better but I realised things were getting worse for live music. I really wondered whether Peat  Diesel would ever play live again.“I am, however, a positive person who always sees good things in bad situations. Watching pre-Covid TV programmes where people are sitting closely together does put fear through us though. Until maybe everyone takes this vaccine and Covid goes away, I think live music is really going to struggle.“When we are playing, the crowd sucks up the atmosphere we have created.“If that atmosphere is not there, I don’t think people will enjoy it. For the  tour, I am not sure whether people will be ready to gather or whether they would rather wait that extra while to attend a gig. We will have to wait and see how it goes.”The  tour has been rescheduled for next year, with a gig booked for Skye in the autumn.Innes says he is looking forward to coming back to Skye: “We have played on Skye before and were not sure how they would get us. It was an amazing experience for us, though, as people sang along to the words and really enjoyed the performance.“Despite the sea between us, Skye people are very like us and understand our music.“We decided the tour had to include a venue on Skye as we feel they are our friends and family and a place where we feel at home to be ourselves and enjoy our time there.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/XMAS-HAMPERS-PORTREE-1-scaled.jpg","title":"skye community response well","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSCR chair Ross Cowie said the group — which was set up in March last year in response to the first lockdown — was ready to go and in a stronger position this time around.“We’re back to where we were in the first lockdown but we are better prepared having had that experience and we are ready to help with whatever is required in supporting the community — whether that#s picking up prescriptions, delivering food, fuel, any practical support or just advice.Commenting on the group#s work following the initial lockdown, he added: #We put contingencies in place because we were aware that a second phase was likely, so we have a huge store of personal Protective Equipment for the health care sector or anyone  who requires it.“This time it has been a lot easier than the first time, we were reacting to the situation then and learning as we went along, but now we are well prepared.“We are here, we have the phone line, it#s open five days a week but we can scale it up to seven days a weekneeded.”He added: “We have a great bunch of people on board and we connect with all the other operations throughout the island.”A number of food share and emergency food provision initiatives are in operation throughout the island and are advertised locally —you need further advice you can call the helpline.Prior to Christmas Skye Community Response volunteers provided  festive hampers and  presents to members of the community mainly around the Portree and Braes area but also island-wide for Women’s Aid.“Nobody should hesitate in getting touch, the food shares are there to be used, and we are here to help.“We have a robust set-up, and we can also direct people to the relevant support in their area.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3574441.jpg--.jpg?1609941600000\n","title":"cllr mccaughey gifts kells and connor primary school newly refurbished computers","story":"KELLS and Connor Primary School were given an early Christmas gt last week, as DUP Cllr William McCaughey presented two refurbished computers to the school.The computers were refurbished by GSC Computers who were delighted to help.

The Church of Ireland, Presbyterian Church, Methodist Church in Ireland and Roman Catholic Church made similar statements this afternoon. It follows a meeting this afternoon of the Northern Ireland Executive’s ‘Faith Leaders’ Forum’, which was convened by Junior Ministers, Gordon Lyons MLA and Declan Kearney MLA. Church leaders and other faith leaders received advice during the meeting from Dr Michael McBride, the Chief Medical Officer , and Professor Ian Young, Chief Scientic Advisor , regarding the worsening Coronavirus situation. Speaking on behalf of the Presbyterian Church, the Clerk of the General Assembly and General Secretary of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, said, “Our churches are part of the local community and we recognise the very serious situation that Northern Ireland finds itself in today. With the extremely high level of transmission of the Covid- virus, combined with the numbers in hospital and intensive care, the very clear warning from the CMO and CSA this afternoon was that over the next number of weeks this situation is going to worsen signicantly.” Mr Gribben continued, “In light of our ongoing consultations and the current serious and worsening situation, and in line with unequivocal public health guidance that people should stay at home, we have written to our congregations in Northern Ireland, informing them that all in person Sunday gatherings for worship, along with most other in person church gatherings, should cease in all PCI congregations from midnight tonight until Saturday,  February . “It is of course regrettable and disappointing that over these next few weeks our congregations will no longer be physically gathering for worship. However, because of the alarming rise of Covid- infections in the community, this is the right decision to take, both for the safety and protection of people and also to contribute to the overall reduction of inter-person contact in line with the government’s ‘stay at home’ message.” The Clerk concluded by saying, “In these dficult days, as we continue to look to God, and encourage others to find their hope in Him, let us help and pray for one another, lting up all those on the frontline, those in authority making dficult decisions and especially all who mourn and miss loved ones.” Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh, John McDowell, said in a statement with his fellow bishops that the escalation of numbers in hospital and intensive care is placing immense pressure on our healthcare staff. He added that the number of deaths and warnings from officials is of grave concern. We recognise that clergy and parishioners have together worked steadily to implement protocols which have ensured that public gatherings for worship have been as safe as possible since the re–opening of our buildings in early summer, said their statement. We also appreciate that the Northern Ireland Executive has acknowledged over the last  months the importance of people being able to gather in person for worship. The ongoing engagement between faith communities and the Northern Ireland Executive is warmly welcomed and is something which we believe has been, and continues to be, of benefit to wider society. However, in light of the current serious and worsening situation and in line with clear public health guidance that people should stay at home, we have decided that all public gatherings for worship and all other in–person church activities should cease for our particular denomination, until Saturday th February , subject to review in late January, with the exception of weddings, funerals, arrangements for recording and or live–streaming, drive–in services and private prayer . We note and welcome the fact that the same position has been adopted by the Presbyterian Church, Roman Catholic Church, Methodist Church and others in Northern Ireland. In making this decision for the ‘greater good’ of all within our community we continue to remember in our prayers the sick and bereaved, all who are suffering, those whose lives have been directly impacted by Covid–, praying too for those in positions of responsibility who are faced with making dficult decisions at this challenging time. A statement issued on behalf of Archbishop of Armagh, Eamon Martin, said the Catholic Church was very concerned at the current serious public health position in which Northern Ireland finds itself: with the extremely high level of transmission of the Covid- virus the continuing escalation of numbers in hospital and intensive care the number of associated deaths and, the increasingly unsustainable pressure on our healthcare staff. The statement, which was also signed by the other Catholic bishops from dioceses within Northern Ireland, added: The clear message from health officials is that this situation is going to worsen signicantly over the coming weeks. We recognise the efforts of so many in our parishes who have been working to ensure that our gatherings for public worship are as safe as possible and we welcome the continuing engagement between the faith communities and the NI Executive which has led to consensus between us on the importance of people being able to gather in person for worship. At this time, however, we acknowledge and support the unequivocal message from public health authorities that the movement and gathering of people should be minimised and that as many people as possible stay at home for the sake of health, le and the Common Good. In light of our ongoing consultations and of the current serious and worsening situation, and in line with clear public health guidance that people should stay at home, we have decided that for a limited period , the celebration of the Eucharist and other liturgies should take place without the physical presence of the faithful - with the exception of marriage, funeral, baptismal liturgies and drive-in services . Arrangements for recording and or livestreaming, and making inidual visits for private prayer are also permissible in accordance with regulations. We encourage parishes, where possible, to continue to broadcast the celebration of Mass - and other devotions and prayer services - online and on other media, knowing that faith and prayer can be a tremendous support to iniduals and society during these dficult times. We make this decision reluctantly, conscious that not being able to gather for public worship can cause pain for all the faithful, but in the hope that this limited period of sacrice will be for the protection of le and health and for the greater good of all. We once more ask for prayers for the sick, the bereaved and all those whose livelihoods have been particularly impacted by the pandemic. We keep in our prayers all health workers, carers, chaplains and other essential workers. We welcome the announcement that a similar position is being taken by the leaders of the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the Methodist Church in Ireland and many other denominations and faith communities in response to the unequivocal message from public health authorities that as many people as possible stay at home at this time. President of the Methodist Church,Rev Dr Tom McKnight, commented, “We made this decision in light of the clear advice from health officials that this action would be of benefit to public health and for the sake of the ‘Common Good’. As this Pandemic continues we are particularly mindful of those here and around the world whose lives are most profoundly impacted, people who are isolated, who are suffering or worried because of economic concerns, young people who carry a particular burden, those who are ill, and those who have lost loved ones. The church continues to be committed to doing all we can to support and stand with those in most need. As a church we continue to pray for those leading our country at this time."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1610110925376.jpg--uk_approval_for_moderna_vaccine.jpg?1610110925000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20210108newsuk approval for moderna vaccine","story":"The Moderna coronavirus vaccine has been approved for use in the UK.

Brogan was also disqualied from driving in Northern Ireland for one year.Belfast Most ReadPrivate hospital in Belfast steps in after NHS operations are cancelledCoronavirus: NI may neverto normality despite success of vaccine, warns Professor YoungBBC NI accused of #trolling# Jamie Bryson over Irish language street signs storyPoots in storm as Michael Gove warns Irish Sea Brexit border chaos will get worseCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Theatre capacity to be allocated to those most in need as  deaths and , new cases reportedLatest NewsNorthern Ireland records nine more Covid- deaths and , new casesMPs criticise fine for Birmingham pub bombings campaigners as ‘morally wrong’Queue winds around corners in south London as GPs roll out vaccineFive arrested at anti-lockdown protest in LondonLarge parts of Spain brought to a standstill by deadly blizzardLatest from Belfast Northern Ireland records nine more Covid- deaths and , new casesMPs criticise fine for Birmingham pub bombings campaigners as ‘morally wrong’Queue winds around corners in south London as GPs roll out vaccineFive arrested at anti-lockdown protest in LondonDuncan Ferguson admits Everton feared cup upset against Rotherham,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePeople moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland could need a customs declaration under new rules.January   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailPeople moving to Northern Ireland from Great Britain could have to use a customs declaration for their possessions under new post-Brexit rules. The UK Government has advised that anyone using a removal company or another person to move their own personal belongings will need them to register for the goods vehicle movement system.However, anyone personally moving their belongings will not need a declaration and can avoid filling out a safety and security declaration at their point of entry.Moving companies and those moving other people#s possessions will need to make a customs declaration and may also need to make a safety and security declaration.Those businesses affected and can sign up for the Trader Support Service. It guides people through the new customs declaration process. There are no limits on people wishing to move from Great Britain to Northern Ireland and vice-versa.The changes have come about as part of the Northern Ireland Protocol which treats Northern Ireland dferently from the rest of the UK under post-Brexit rules, creating a trade border in the Irish Sea. A number of leading unionist politicians have called for the Government to invoke Article  of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement and suspend the protocol.Since the end of the Brexit transition period a number of companies have reported dficulties transporting goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.There have been reports of empty shelves at supermarkets across Northern Ireland. The UUP have tabled an Assembly recall petition in an attempt to get the Executive to take action around the issues resulting from the protocol. In response to the call Alliance MP Dr Stephen Farry said beware those offering populist, simplistic solutions. Article  doesn#t offer a remedy. No major business organisation is calling for this.Problems re poor preperation on GB side can be fixed with better info. With genuine structural problems, only route is for UK  EU to find solutions together, the North Down MP wrote on social media. The UUP MLA Roy Beggs, who tabled the recall petition, said the Irish Sea border is causing horrendous dficulties for hauliers and this is being seen in shops and businesses across Northern Ireland. It is damaging the Northern Ireland economy and the situation is escalating.“The UK Government needs to act before we face further serious disruptions to the economy in Northern Ireland. I have therefore tabled a petition to recall the Northern Ireland Assembly calling on the First and deputy First Ministers to ask the UK Government to intervene and relax the rules on trade flows between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the East Antrim representative said.“I would call on other parties to sign this motion. Each have vowed to protect Northern Ireland#s best interests and the Assembly can send a strong message by speaking with one voice.

It#s no dferent for some of our familiar faces.Cool FM DJ Pete Snodden#s day starts early with his top rating morning show.And these days he is even busier when he clocks off, arrives home and the school work begins. The day job, it seems, is child#s play.Dad to Ivana and Elayna, he has now found himself in the driving seat.I#ve been promoted from classroom assistant to head teacher, he said. Last time around my we Julia was the one in charge, this time she#s still working. It#s all on me and I#m feeling the pressure of long ision, Sometimes I think I#m happier to get the right answer than the kids!He said the novelty factor back in March kept things fresh and fun is starting to wear thin.Keeping it going is hard, he said.The idea of coming up with timetables was all new and in some ways exciting in March. Not so much this time.Now my eldest daughter is halfway through P. She should be working harder than ever. The work is more intense and we don#t want her to get behind. That#s a lot of pressure, but I feel for teachers too. Too much work and they#ll be criticised, too little and they#ll be criticised.What we#re doing is trying to strike a balance, but everyone#s le is dferent.Writer, author and working single mum Leesa Harker had embarked on the first bout of homeschooling with enthusiasm.But this time round she#s finding things far from plain sailing as she gets stuck into schoolwork with daughters Lola and Lexi. If I#ve learnt anything from last time, it#s that I need to learn more, she said.I#m already having a bit of a meltdown. It#s already obvious that some schools are much better at doing this than others.Today one of the girls had  minutes of work. The day before there was a link sent through for a YouTube exercise video for PE, that was it.But I#ve heard from other mums that their kids are getting work to keep them learning for hours. There does seem to be a real dference and it#s only going to increase fears that schools haven#t learnt how best to do this and that some kids will be so far behind when they get back into the classroom that it#s going to be dficult to catch up.The planning for this should have been better.Last year I felt we were all in the same boat. This time some of us are in a dinghy with a hole in the bottom while others are sailing off in expensive yachts.For BBC Radio Ulster presenter Kerry McLean, there is an extra workload this time around as her youngest daughter has just started P.I remember talking to my mum back in March and saying how glad I was that Eve was only four. But this time around she#s P and that#s probably turned out harder than I imagined.If I#ve learnt one thing, it#s that I made the right career choice in not going to be a teacher! With the older kids I can say now you need to do A, B or C. With Eve it#s a sticky fingered, hands on job.My kitchen is now part studio, part music store and three parts classroom. I need a bigger table!For Kerry, having three children at dferent stages of their education is proving a challenge.They need dferent things, she said. Tara is very self driven, Dan can be easily distracted by a cloud passing the window and with Eve it#s all cutting out and sticking. I try to keep my work under control so I can spend time with the kids and help them through.Their schools have been great, but I know there#s a big dference in the way other schools are able to manage.I refuse to compare myself with other parents.I won#t pretend to be Mary Poppins. If my kids go to bed at night with smiles on their faces, that#s good enough for me.Belfast Most ReadPrivate hospital in Belfast steps in after NHS operations are cancelledPoots in storm as Michael Gove warns Irish Sea Brexit border chaos will get worseCoronavirus: NI may neverto normality despite success of vaccine, warns Professor YoungBBC NI accused of #trolling# Jamie Bryson over Irish language street signs storyDUP#s Paisley defends Donald Trump in wake of US Capitol riotsLatest EducationMinisters clash as transfer test row no closer to being resolvedMark BainOpinionExams standoff is a lesson in Northern Ireland#s uneasy relationship with selection testsSecond NI grammar school ditches transfer test Executive #not going to collapse# over transfer test issue, says former Education Minister John O#DowdLatest from Belfast Biden calls Trump ‘unfit’ for presidency, but fails to endorse impeachmentMultiple arrests at anti-lockdown protest in LondonNorthern Ireland records nine more Covid- deaths and , new casesMPs criticise fine for Birmingham pub bombings campaigners as ‘morally wrong’Queue winds around corners in south London as GPs roll out vaccine,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueFirefighters at the scene of a house fire on Victoria Street in Portrush.Allan PrestonTwitterEmailJanuary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailA neighbour who heroically saved a woman from a house fire in Portrush has been praised for his quick response.Firefighters were called to reports of a fire in a house on Victoria Street around .am on Friday.It is understood a woman living at the house had been walking her dog and ed to find the property in flames.Four fire appliances attended the scene, with fire fighters wearing breathing apparatus and using four jets to extinguish the blaze.One female casualty was rescued from the property using a ladder prior to the arrival of the fire crews.The cause of fire was reported to be accidental ignition and was dealt with by pm.Ulster Unionist Alderman Norman Hillis attended the scene and said he was relieved there was no loss of le.I was told a young lady was evacuated out of a first floor window by a neighbour using a ladder, so it#s fantastic that they got her out.He added: The lady of the house had been out walking her dog, but when she came back she was absolutely devastated.She left the dog with a neighbour and luckily the fire service were there very quickly. It#s just very dficult for her only to have left the house for a short time and to lose all your possessions.I#m just glad no one has been seriously injured but nonetheless I still feel for the family who have lost their house and possessions.You can always refurbish a house but the loss of a le is a dferent matter.He continued: These are dficult times at the very best and this is surely a body blow to the family, but I#m quite sure everybody will rally round.Certainly some of the folk I was speaking to know her very well. Standing in the street with only the clothes you#re wearing is very bad.But the big plus is that there hasn#t been any loss of le.Independent councillor Angela Mulholland said she was looking at how help for the family from the local community could be arranged in the coming days.It#s my understanding that all of their possessions have been completely destroyed which is terrible, she said.Sometimes there#s a certain amount that can be salvaged during house fires but it looks like nothing has been saved here.She said the impact of losing everything from a family home within minutes would be totally unbelievable.I know there was an ex-colleague of mine who went through a similar experience, losing everything in a fire. She had a small daughter at the time so I know how devastating that can be for a family.But I work in the community and voluntary sector and I know the good thing is that people out there are willing to help and support in any way that they can. I#m confident people will do their utmost.Adding her praise to the neighbour who intervened this morning she said: I know that a member of the family had only just gone out for a walk with the dog, so it just must have happened so quickly. If it hadn#t been for the quickness of the neighbour it could have been a totally dferent story. It#s totally horrendous.

Retailers like John Lewis, AO, Madee and Dunelm have all said they have put their deliveries on hold.One reader also reported a problem with deliveries from online homewares retailer Wayfair but it has not replied to a request for comment. But TK Maxx, which last week cancelled orders from customers here, said orders from here and delivery here had been restored. In an interview with the Belfasttoday, Secretary of State Brandon Lewis said there was no reason for companies shipping from Great Britain to put orders from customers here on hold.Read MoreBrandon Lewis: Stormont#s faults are obvious, but it is still a good thing it is backBrexit delivery issues: How Amazon, John Lewis, Dunelm and other companies have been affected by Irish Sea border He said he would contact Peloton as there#s no reason for them in terms of parcels deliveries to have any issue. Companies sending goods to Northern Ireland are required to complete new customs paperwork under the NI Protocol, which came into force as the transition period came to an end last week.While guidance from HMRC published on New Year#s Eve introduced a three-month grace period for parcels being sent to consumers, many companies had already decided to put Northern Ireland deliveries on hold before that point. A Belfastreader said they had tried to order a Peloton bike to be told by a worldwide company they cannot fulfil orders to Northern Ireland due to the Brexit situation.I tried to explain we are part of the UK but with no luck, they added.The hi-tech exercise bike, which costs around £, for the original model, has become a sought-after item for exercise at home - tapping into the surge in popularity of cycling and the closure of gyms during lockdown.The company, which was founded in the US, enables users to tune into intense spin classes or other forms of exercise online using a touchscreen integrated into the equipment.A spokeswoman for Peloton said: We have temporarily paused new sales of the Peloton Bike and Peloton Bike+ whilst we update our systems and processes in response to Brexit. Customers who placed an order on or before December ,  will still have their Peloton Bike or Peloton Bike+ delivered. We are working to resume full service and sales in Northern Ireland as soon as possible.She added: Our existing members in Northern Ireland are not affected by this pause to new sales and still have full access to our service, as well as the ability to arrange a service appointment or a refund for their Peloton Bike or Bike+. A spokeswoman for white goods and electricals retailer AO confirmed that its deliveries here were on hold.They added: Like some other online retailers, changes to customs arrangements for deliveries to Northern Ireland mean it will take a few weeks for us and our delivery partner to make the necessary adjustments. We expect that this will only affect the first few weeks of .Electricals retailer Currys also said it was business as usual for customers and deliveries.Belfast Most ReadPrivate hospital in Belfast steps in after NHS operations are cancelledCoronavirus: NI may neverto normality despite success of vaccine, warns Professor YoungBBC NI accused of #trolling# Jamie Bryson over Irish language street signs storyPoots in storm as Michael Gove warns Irish Sea Brexit border chaos will get worseCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Theatre capacity to be allocated to those most in need as  deaths and , new cases reportedLatest Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland records nine more Covid- deaths and , new casesMPs criticise fine for Birmingham pub bombings campaigners as ‘morally wrong’Man jailed over repeat ferry terminal incidentBelfast cops in car chase with New YorkerMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed cases of Covid- in your council areaLatest from Belfast Northern Ireland records nine more Covid- deaths and , new casesMPs criticise fine for Birmingham pub bombings campaigners as ‘morally wrong’Queue winds around corners in south London as GPs roll out vaccineFive arrested at anti-lockdown protest in LondonDuncan Ferguson admits Everton feared cup upset against Rotherham,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

During this time, we will work with our customers to validate and correct the data we have in our system, to reduce the delays and enable us to resume normal service.“This pause in our operation will be as short as possible and we intend to recommence this service on Wednesday January .”🔈STATEMENT, Thursday th January, :pm pic gGqOksKw— Seafood From ScotlandJanuary , Donna Fordyce, chief executive at Seafood Scotland, said exporters faced “new bureaucratic non-tarf barriers” with no one body able to fix the situation.“It’s a perfect storm for Scottish seafood exporters. Weakened by Covid-, and the closure of the French border before Christmas, the end of the Brexit transition period has unleashed layer upon layer of administrative problems, resulting in queues, border refusals and utter confusion,” she said.“IT problems in France meant consignments were erted from Boulogne sur Mer to Dunkirk, which was unprepared as it wasn’t supposed to be at the export front line. There have also been HMRC IT issues on the UK side that need to resolved ASAP regarding certication.“A lack of knowledge and understanding of the required paperwork means some companies are ill-prepared for the new checks, which are taking far longer because of the mistakes being uncovered. When the systems settle down, checks should be carried out on samples from each load but now entire consignments are having to be checked to satisfy requirements.”MS boss Steve Rowe warned that the trade agreement between the UK and the EU is causing problems with “potential tarfs on part of our range exported to the EU, together with very complex administrative processes”.Ministers have to get a grip on this and make sure essential workers are actually able to do their jobs, or we risk seeing a repeat of the chaos on our roads at ChristmasJim McMahon, shadow transport secretaryHaulier industry body Logistics UK said deliveries were being delayed as lorries arrived in Belfast with incomplete paperwork.In order to avoid a hard border with the Republic, Mr Johnson agreed Northern Ireland would remain in the EU single market – but that has meant checks on goods arriving from Great Britain.Irish customs authorities said they would temporarily relax regulations around goods moving from Great Britain.Labour accused the Government of failing to properly prepare for the end of the transition period on December .Shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: “The Government promised it had a plan to make sure things ran smoothly for businesses and hauliers post-Brexit.“It’s clear the problems caused by its poor preparation and delaying tactics have not gone away. Ministers have to get a grip on this and make sure essential workers are actually able to do their jobs, or we risk seeing a repeat of the chaos on our roads at Christmas.”A Government spokesman said: “Businesses and hauliers have made huge strides to get ready but we were always clear that there would be some disruption at the end of the transition period.“Although many businesses have moved goods successfully since January , we are aware of some issues, and are providing guidance and support.“Hauliers can use our ‘Check a HGV is ready’ service to make sure they have correct paperwork, and must obtain a Kent Access Permitthey plan to travel via Dover or Eurotunnel.”PAMost ReadPrivate hospital in Belfast steps in after NHS operations are cancelledCoronavirus: NI may neverto normality despite success of vaccine, warns Professor YoungBBC NI accused of #trolling# Jamie Bryson over Irish language street signs storyPoots in storm as Michael Gove warns Irish Sea Brexit border chaos will get worseCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Theatre capacity to be allocated to those most in need as  deaths and , new cases reportedLatest Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland records nine more Covid- deaths and , new casesMPs criticise fine for Birmingham pub bombings campaigners as ‘morally wrong’Man jailed over repeat ferry terminal incidentBelfast cops in car chase with New YorkerMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed cases of Covid- in your council areaLatest from Belfast Northern Ireland records nine more Covid- deaths and , new casesMPs criticise fine for Birmingham pub bombings campaigners as ‘morally wrong’Queue winds around corners in south London as GPs roll out vaccineFive arrested at anti-lockdown protest in LondonDuncan Ferguson admits Everton feared cup upset against Rotherham,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

million people who have been given the jab.In an unusual move, Buckingham Palace, which rarely comments on the private health matters of the monarch and duke, announced the -year-old head of state and her consort, , had been given the injection.It is understood the Queen decided the information should be made public to prevent inaccuracies and further speculation.A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: “The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have today received Covid- vaccinations.”A royal source confirmed the injections were administered by a household doctor at Windsor Castle.The Queen and Philip have been spending lockdown sheltering at their Windsor Castle home, and had a quiet Christmas at the Berkshire residence after deciding to forgo the traditional royal family gathering at Sandringham.It is not known which vaccine the Queen and duke were given but it is likely they will receive their second dose up to  weeks later.In America, key public figures have been photographed while being inoculated, with president-elect Joe Biden appearing on live television when he received a dose in December.Making the Queen and duke’s inoculations public is likely to have the added effect of giving sceptical members of the public more confidence in the vaccine.The Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge both contracted coronavirus during the first wave of the pandemic.Charles was described as having mild symptoms and lost his sense of taste and smell for a period, while it was reported his son William was hit “pretty hard” by the

Here we spotlight some of the deserving stars that Prime Minister Boris Johnson applauds as ldquoan inspiration to us all.Last year brought to the fore a new breed of community champions... including those working in the NHS to treat coronavirus patients, scientists developing effective vaccines and key workers keeping essential services operating.These ldquoordinary people who continue to go above and beyond have been recognised for sterling work delivered in extraordinary circumstances.The  New Years Honours has recognised champions of sport as well as stars of stage and screen but this year, more than ever, it is ordinary people who have been recognised alongside them. Among the deserving recipients are leading lights who have battled to save lives and keep the NHS afloat and those who have kept the country smiling by spreading kindness.The list includes medical experts as well as volunteers working with youngsters, the elderly and those with disabilities. Those working in libraries, education and community arts also received recognition. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ldquoIn a year when so many have made sacrices to protect our NHS and save peoplersquos lives, the outstanding efforts of those receiving honours are a welcome reminder of the strength of human spirit and of what can be achieved through courage and compassion. The  New Year Honours offer us an opportunity to salute their dedication and recognise many who have gone above and beyond in their contribution to our country. As we begin a new year and continue to come together to fight this virus, may their service and stories be an inspiration to us all.Jacquie WinningJacquie Winningrsquos award ldquorecognises the achievements of everyone at Forth Valley Sensory Centre following ldquoan exceptionally challenging year.The -year-old from Falkirk was recognised for going the extra mile to manage ldquowraparound services to people with sensory loss during the pandemic ldquoCOVID- has been challenging for everyone, but more so for people with sensory loss. Those with hearing loss face challenges due to face masks and social distancing interfering with their ability to lip read.ldquoThose with sight loss face signicant challenges managing to maintain physical distancing while undertaking essential trips out, explained the MBE recipient.Jacquiersquos support included providing Braille copies of virus information, establishing telephone, text and email befriending lelines to address isolation and producing podcasts providing vital updates.ldquoThe impact is that some of the most vulnerable people in society have been incredibly well supported during the most challenging of times. Thanks go to the dedication, enthusiasm and willingness to adapt by our team, volunteers and partners, and tremendous support of our board of directors.Tamas SzakmanyCabinet Office confirmation of Dr Tamas Szakmanyrsquos award made him ldquoastonished, touched and humbled. The -year-old from Newport explained: ldquoI thought I was doing my job like everybody . I didnrsquot think for one minute it would result in this. Irsquom really surprised. Once I was allowed to talk about it, the first thing I said was how fortunate I was to work with this team. ldquo was dficult professionally. Personally, I had many successes. It was a double-edged sword. The MBE is recognition for the enormous effort everyone has made to get us through the first wave. I hope we have similar success again.The Royal Gwent Hospital critical care consultant, recognised for exceptional service to the NHS, spearheaded Welsh Critical Care Network response during the pandemic, rapidly disseminating information on lessons learnt via traditional and social media s.

The  year-old continued: ldquoThere are so many stories from older people who say lsquoitrsquos just good to know people are thinking about us.Thinking the honour email was promotional, Michael initially ldquodidnrsquot actually take it seriously.He revealed: ldquoI nearly didnrsquot open it. Then I saw it was from the Cabinet Office. ldquoFor me, itrsquos about the efforts of other people as well.ldquoSo many people have been very supportive over the years. Irsquom the one who ends up getting the award, but other people have been involved in the success of my work.Golam ChowdhuryA British Red Cross refugee support staff emergency responder initially thought his honour announcement email was spam! Golam Chowdhury was then ldquohumbled when his British Empire Medal was confirmed. ldquoI had no idea I had even been nominated, said the -year-old from Portsmouth.ldquoItrsquos been challenging, both personally and professionally, but I am always amazed by human resilience and community spirit.

From mid-December  to early January , like the rest of the country, Derry experienced its coldest winter on record when temperatures stayed below  degrees centigrade for days on end. It was the third coldest winter in succession that brought heavy snowfalls, record low temperatures, travel chaos and school closures. The River Foyle, the fastest-flowing river in Europe for its size, froze over , City of Derry Airport was forced to close, sporting fixtures postponed and many Christmas parties and festive nights out with family and friends were cancelled. googletag.cmd.push  Speaking at the time, John Wylie, from the Met Office, said: Sub-zero tem- peratures, widespread deep snow and all of the correct factors coming together at the right time to give us this weather event which will probably go down in history. A temperature of -. degC was recorded in Ballykelly on December , . On the same day, Castlederg in County Tyrone was put firmly on the map - not only did it set a new record Northern Ireland lowest temperature, but it was also the coldest spot on the entire island as the thermometer fell to -.C. The Arctic weather conditions first struck in  . googletag.cmd.push This was followed by the winter of   which for much of the country was worst since  , bringing widespread and heavy snowfalls. Despite the entire country being covered in a blanket of snow,  was not regarded as a White Christmas as no snow fell on Christmas Day.  The scene in Brooke Park in   in a photo taken by Ashlene Joyce. However, just like today, Derry showed its kind nature as a number of community groups took the initiative in ensuring that vulnerable people were looked after during the wintery weather. Volunteers in a number of areas visited elderly people in their homes distributing food and winter clothing and helping with shopping.     Members of the Leafair Community Association  handed out Winter Health Packs to local residents. The packs – distributed in partnership with the Neighbourhood Health Improvement Project– included a thermal blanket, gloves and socks, five energy efficient light bulbs and a thermometer. Peter McDonald, co-ordinator with the LCA, said the scheme proved to be a vital measure in keeping those most at risk from the elements safe. Community volunteers in the Triaxtook part in ‘Operation Snowball,’ aimed at helping the elderly community get through the cold snap, helping old people get to the shops as well as Mass as well as salting salt and clearing the footpaths in Creggan Street, Oakfield and several of the steep streets off the Lone Moor Road. Volunteers also cleared pavements in the Top of the Hill and Shantallow areas. The severe cold spell in the run up to Christmas was estimated to have cost the British economy up to pound. billion a day, with a total cost of pound billion. Retailers were particularly badly hit by lost sales with footfall down nearly % compared to the same period the previous year. Comments by the chief executive of a major hospitality body in the North echoed those of today. Colin Neill, of Pubs of Ulster, which at the time represented % pf pubs in the North, described the situation for the local industry as critical after trade was badly hit by the harsh weather. Hundreds of s had to be cancelled after snow caused massive disruption. Mr Neill said: “This is probably the worst trading period over Christmas on record for our industry. We normally do % of our years turnover in December and we have people cancelling left, right and centre.” After the freeze came the thaw and within days tens of thousands of people were struggling to cope without water because of burst pipes. About  towns and villages across Northern Ireland were affected and many people had to queue every day to get water for drinking and washing. About , homes and businesses were cut off from the mains water supply during the Christmas period and NI Water was severely criticised for its response to those in need.    --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Michael OKane took on the role at St Colmcilles Primary School in Claudy after Easter this year, with schools already closed by the first Covid- lockdown. He was nominated for the award by parent Fiona Garrett, who told presenter Stephen Nolan that Mr OKane had helped her children with two particularly tricky transitions. “My son Matthew was transitioning from P to big school and my daughter Oacuterlagh-Janetransitioning from nursery to P,” she said. “My daughter has a statement of special educational needs. During lockdown, she became very distressed at the sudden change of routine and Mr OKane really helped with this. googletag.cmd.push “He did this by doing videos to show her where her new classroom was going to be, what it would look like, who her new classroom assistant was going to be and how to sanitise your hands properly. “He also helped my son with the P leaving transition. My son started becoming distressed at not seeing his friends and the fact they wouldnt get a last opportunity to all be together. “Mr OKane arranged a wonderful Year  leaving mass, where he shot a beautul photo and video of the group together with his drone. “Matthews short, but positive experience of Mr OKane actually inspired him to want to become a teacher now.” googletag.cmd.push Miss Garrett said Mr OKane had gone beyond the call of duty to make sure parents were looked after too, and said he was a special person. “He is so good with children who have special educational needs. He goes above and beyond, going that extra little step just to make everything run smoothly. That takes a special person,” she said. “He goes out of his way to be so approachable and friendly. “Hes in the thick of it with the children, showing them how to use their talents and getting the best out of everyone, including his staff. “He really cares for his school family. Absolutely anything is possible with the right support and Im so grateful.”     Michael admitted it was a shock to receive a call from Stephen Nolan, initially askinganything was wrong, but he regained his composure to pay tribute to the schools staff. “I only started here at Easter and I inherited a fantastic school with fantastic staff and I dont think Ive done too much myself – everybody in the school has really pulled together,” he said. “Im just looking out the window here on a dreary Monday morning and thats the sort of thing we need to hear. Im in shock here, but Id just like to thank the staff, and in particular Fionas childrens teachers. “Theres a fantastic team in Year  who made children feel comfortable in coming back to school. “Its been tough, but everybody has gone above and beyond from teachers, classroom assistants, our building supervisors and cleaners. “Im going to relay this to all the staff because it will lt everybodys spirits,” he added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Derry City and Strabane District Council is now looking to set up the new  to ask their opinion on the design quality of any planning applications which are made for these sites. One of the sites expected to be discussed is the derelict site of the former Tillie and Henderson shirt factory at the cityside end of the Craigavon Bridge. googletag.cmd.push It emerged recently that the current owner of the site is to apply for planning permission to build an apartment complex on the land. Speaking at a meeting yesterday of the local councils Planning Committee, Eamon Molloy, the councils Head of Planning Performance and Improvement, outlined the proposal for the new advisory .

He said he would bring a report on the matter to next months meeting of the Planning Committee. There has been much debate in recent years about the development of gateway sites in Derry. The Tillie and Henderson site, in particular, has been at the forefront of the discussions. The site has been unused since the derelict factory building was destroyed in a fire in . The owners of the site, Belfast-based Andras House, had originally planned to build a hotel on the site.     However, those plans never came to fruition and it emerged last month that Andras House has now teamed up with local developers, the Martin Property Group, to build an apartment complex on the site. Director of Andras House, Rajesh Rana, said a residential development is the most appropriate use that can be delivered at this time.

Caitlin Kelly, from Bellaghy, decided to take on the run to raise funds for the Magherafelt Adult Centre, where her uncle Gerard attended for over  years until his death last year. The centre provides day care for adults who have been assessed as having a learning disability, and Caitlin said she wanted to show her gratitude. “He loved it and they loved him,” she told Derry Now. “He spent most of his time there and they really looked after him, especially in the latter years, because he developed dementia and had more dficulties than he had previously. googletag.cmd.push  “They couldnt have done enough for him and I wanted to show recognition of that by raising some money for them. They work really hard. “They had so much time for him and we are so grateful he had that to go to every day. Other than seeing his family, he wouldnt really have seen anyone . “Its where he was stimulated and able to learn and develop.” Gerard was one of ten Devlin siblings, and made sure he shared his considerable love equally among them. “He was the centre of everybodys lives. They were just mad about him,” said Caitlin. googletag.cmd.push “There were nine brothers and sisters and he would have gone round each house and made time for everybody. “He was such good craic. During the lockdown, we only got to see him through the window or in gardens, but we were so glad to have him in our lives for so long. “When he turned  in April, during lockdown, we were able to have a wee Zoom birthday party for him.” It was a signicant birthday of her own that prompted Caitlin, whose beauty salon is currently closed due to Covid restrictions, to take on this fundraising challenge. “I turned  on New Years Eve, so I wanted to do a wee fundraiser, especially now because Im off. I thought I could challenge myself and raise money at the same time,” she said.     “Ive been running and walking it. Id planned on running most of it but the roads have been that bad I havent been able to run as much as I liked. “I started running during the first lockdown, back in March. I generally would just go to the gym but this was a challenge for me now to do it. “I love where I live we have such lovely scenery and thank God for the weather as well. Apart from the icy conditions, it hasnt rained, so its helped for seeing the views.” Caitlin has been braving the icy pavements to raise the funds. Since launching the fundraiser, Caitlin has surpassed her initial pound target with ease and has already amassed almost pound, for the Magherafelt Adult Centre. She said the huge generosity was testament not only to how loved her uncle was loved, but to how he himself interacted with others. “The Devlin family are so well known and because its so personal to the Magherafelt Adult Centre as well, people want to help out,” she said. “He was really well known too. He had a big smile for everybody and shook hands with everybody he met.” Caitlin will complete her K with a final run on Sunday, January , and you can donate to her fundraiser by visiting her Go Fund Me page - K for Uncle Gerard .  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It started off with the sporting fields thronged with activity, hopes and dreams. Until Covid- reached into our communities and pushed the pause button on everything. Sporting activity ed in a format nobody really recognised, before we were forced into a cycle of close, open, close, open...until we put up the Christmas stocking, sat down – inside our bubbles - and fogged mountains of turkey and champ into ourselves. One great positive of the lockdown was nostalgia and how we were able to revisit the past. Through the eyes of former players and managers, we lted the lid on their journey. Both in print and via the broadcast media, the heroes and heroines of yesterday became icons again. A reminder of where we came from and the importance of sport. googletag.cmd.push It gave them an identity and got the tongues wagging again. A is for attacking mark. Christy Young will be remembered as the first in the Derry championships. Lets hope someone in authority makes a move to bin it. It offers nothing but more hassle for overworked referees, cheap scores and shafts defenders. B is for break. The water break that was brought into our games is now a coaching break and a momentum changer. If your team is struggling, it is a Godsend, whereasyou are on a roll its as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike. Surely water bottles, clearly marked, can be laid at points behind the goals and along the sidelines for players to grab during a break in play. googletag.cmd.push C is for classic. One of the joys of this season was being present in Paacuteirc Esler in January to witness Slaughtneils All-Ireland hurling clash with Ballyhale. It is the best game, by far, that I have had the pleasure of reporting on. It had absolutely everything. Atmosphere. Passion. Skill. And entertainment by the lorry load. It was one of those days that makes sport so worthwhile. D is for Desertmartin. With the fruits of their underage coaching paying off, they made it through to the U and minor finals, on top of their seniors qualying for the junior decider with Craigbane. Then, with the second lockdown, all three games were put on the back burner. A season that couldve been the springboard for future progress was soon one of frustration.     E is for equality. One thing that  has given us, is the split season and the chance for club and county to be given an equal slice of the pie. Players know where they stand and managers can plan accordingly. If it can eradicate the lazy Derry suffer because of club rivalry myth, it will go a long way to getting Oakleaf county teams climbing back to the top. And it gives more media attention to the club game. In an interview before Christmas, Derry dual player Aine McAllister was hoping for a split season to allow her to play both football and camogie for Derry. F is for Faughanvale. After an entertaining clash with Limavady, they won a second intermediate ladies title in three seasons, thanks to Ellie McCaffreys clinching goal. Steelstown took the senior title with victory over Ballymaguigan. Coleraine were junior champions after their victory over Ballerin. G is for game...or in this case, more than a game. Local soccer club Draperstown Celtic continued to offer a sporting outlet to the youth of Ballinascreen and beyond. Its their insistence on all players getting their chance to shine – including their girls diamonds team – that deserves much credit. There is also their link with local mental health group STEPS, helping to reach out to the person inside the player. Their grassroots football club of the year award was well-deserved. H is for Hugh. In August this year, the Ballinascreen and Derry sporting community was rocked by the death of Hugh McWilliams. Derry GAA Chairman Stephen Barker said Hugh was a giant of generosity. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, who sponsored all Derry and Ballinascreen teams. I is for internet streaming. With restricted access to games, Derry GAA streamed a chunk of their games live, with the rest uploaded by midweek for subscribers to view. It raked in poundk to the Owenbeg coffers and offered those at home and overseas the chance to watch from the sofa. Alan Gunns commentary was a testament to his research and attention to detail. Along with a host of guests, the Derry PR team delivered a great service. J is for Josh. Following in Callum Devines footsteps, Kilreas Josh McErlean kept the local theme on the Irish motorsport front. McErlean was named as Irish Young Driver of the Year and recently made his mark on the international scene and made his World Rally Championship debut at Monza in December. K is for Kilrea – When you talk about reaching something into the pockets of the local community, Kilreas input was unrivalled. The GAA club clubbed together to raise poundk Chest, Heart and Stroke from a -hour relay. Then, when FIFA came calling with a pound, fine on Kilrea United, the community had it paid off inside  hours via a crowdfunding page, with the surplus used to buy kits for the local primary schools. L is for Lavey minors. After winning the Derry hurling and football championships in , they conquered Ulster last Christmas and carried on there they left off to defend their football title, but were denied a chance for another tilt at Ulster. With flawless ball retention and a maturity beyond their years, they have a bright future. M is for marathon. With a time of :., local athletics icon Tommy Hughes and his son Eoin officially became the fastest father and son marathon running duo in the world at the Frankfurt marathon. If that wasnt enough, Tommy smashed the world Over-s record at the Danny McDaid km event in Letterkenny. N is for needy. The local sporting clubs excelled this year in helping those stranded at home, in need of the essentials. They simply cant get enough praise. There was a great photo doing the rounds on social media of Ballyronan Marina centre, laid out with foot parcels as Loup delivered to the needy. Their neighbours in Ballymaguigan did something similar and it prompted one of the clubs senior citizens to write a letter of kindness to the committee, saying it was more important than any trophy. O is for Oz. Conor Glass made hisfrom a five-year career in Australia with AFL side Hawthorn and has made his debut for Derry already. He needs time to grow into the game before hopefully becoming a leader in the countys future. On the flipside, Callum Brown and Anton Tohill signed one-year deals with GWS Giants and Collingwood respectively. P is for Paddys Day. Once the year trickled into March, our sporting calendar shuddered to a halt, just as St Patricks Maghera and St Pius Magherafelt booked their places in the showpiece MacRory MacLarnon Final double header. The excitement in the schools was electric, as the players looked forward to one of the best days of their lives, only for all be pulled from their grasp. Being awarded their joint titles later in the year was a tiny consolation. Q is for quiz. With the social scene virtually non-existent,  became the year of the online quiz. We were lucky to have Joe McCloskey compiling an hour of goodness every week. Glen forward Paul Gunning, with help from his father and former Derry PRO Sean, ran online quizzes to engage club members. I am sure there were other clubs reaching out to their members in similar fashion. By the sound of recent Covid figures, we could be back to the video-conferencing mode of entertainment. R is for Rogers. It seems like ages ago when St Johns Swatragh boxer Paddy Rogers defeated Newrys Dennis Boriskins to become the Ulster Elite champion in Belfasts Ulster Hall. The affable Paddy joined his brother, Slaughtneil dual player Brendan, in the Ulster champion category, but joked that he didnt have an entire team to help him. Paddy was a very popular champion. S is for sin-bin. The black card forces a team to play with a player less for  minutes. It can lead to a tactical move, where teams can take the sting out of a game and leave it fragmented until they are back to the full . A better solution would be a  metre free regardless of where the cynical play took place. It would make teams think twice and clean the game up as a whole. T is for treble. After looking on from the outside, Slaughtneil senior footballers had their hands on the John McLaughlin Cup and took their tally of Derry championships to six. It sealed the treble. Just  hours earlier – with the hurling already won in September - the clubs camogs retained the Martin Mulholland Cup to secure another treble. U is for underage structures. Following a ruling that slipped through unchallenged to Croke Park, clubs all over Ireland have been told they must organise their teams in U, U and U gradings. And with it comes the huge void from the undeveloped underage player until the senior ranks and the physical challenges it will bring. V is for virus...and for vaccine. Covid- came along and robbed us of any degree of a normal le, tore our sporting landscape to pieces and left us going around in circles to stamp it out. Hopefully the vaccine will help  take a more familiar shape. W is for wheelie bin. There wasnt a home in the country that didnt have balls peppering towards them. Dungiven U player Ryan Moore was the king. Bouncing on a trampoline, he performed a backflip, with the ball between his legs before releasing it into the wheelie bin. Take a bow Ryan. There was also the example of McNicholl family of Glenullin, taking videos of three generations playing hurling camogie, before knitting it all into one nty movie. A lovely touch. X is for x-factor...well, this is close enough. What a year it was for county Derry. Dara McNicholl was wowing viewers on The Voice Kids. If that wasnt enough, Johnny Brooks and Brooke Scullion also took the Saturday night entertainment by storm, getting all the way to final of The Voice. They have all played on the sporting fields of Derry and it was amazing to see them put the county on the map. Brilliant. Y is for yelling. Once crowds began toto games, worryingly in more numbers than permitted, so too did the vitriol being yelled over the fence. The time away from sport didnt make one iota of dference to the level of respect on show. It was open season again, with referees, players and mentors labelled as fair game for those who paid their money to watch. Z is for Zoom. This time last year, we thought it was something you did in a car or on a camera. Now, its in every facet of our working and personal lives. And sport is no dferent. It became a tool for club AGMs, meetings and training sessions. Sideline View would like to wish all our readers, advertisers and contributors a happy new year. Lets hope we can kick Covid into touch and get back to thriving sporting arenas across Derry and beyond.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

O is for Oz. Conor Glass made hisfrom a five-year career in Australia with AFL side Hawthorn and has made his debut for Derry already. He needs time to grow into the game before hopefully becoming a leader in the countys future. On the flipside, Callum Brown and Anton Tohill signed one-year deals with GWS Giants and Collingwood respectively. P is for Paddys Day. Once the year trickled into March, our sporting calendar shuddered to a halt, just as St Patricks Maghera and St Pius Magherafelt booked their places in the showpiece MacRory MacLarnon Final double header. The excitement in the schools was electric, as the players looked forward to one of the best days of their lives, only for all be pulled from their grasp. Being awarded their joint titles later in the year was a tiny consolation. Q is for quiz. With the social scene virtually non-existent,  became the year of the online quiz. We were lucky to have Joe McCloskey compiling an hour of goodness every week. Glen forward Paul Gunning, with help from his father and former Derry PRO Sean, ran online quizzes to engage club members. I am sure there were other clubs reaching out to their members in similar fashion. By the sound of recent Covid figures, we could be back to the video-conferencing mode of entertainment. R is for Rogers. It seems like ages ago when St Johns Swatragh boxer Paddy Rogers defeated Newrys Dennis Boriskins to become the Ulster Elite champion in Belfasts Ulster Hall. The affable Paddy joined his brother, Slaughtneil dual player Brendan, in the Ulster champion category, but joked that he didnt have an entire team to help him. Paddy was a very popular champion. S is for sin-bin. The black card forces a team to play with a player less for  minutes. It can lead to a tactical move, where teams can take the sting out of a game and leave it fragmented until they are back to the full . A better solution would be a  metre free regardless of where the cynical play took place. It would make teams think twice and clean the game up as a whole. T is for treble. After looking on from the outside, Slaughtneil senior footballers had their hands on the John McLaughlin Cup and took their tally of Derry championships to six. It sealed the treble. Just  hours earlier – with the hurling already won in September - the clubs camogs retained the Martin Mulholland Cup to secure another treble. U is for underage structures. Following a ruling that slipped through unchallenged to Croke Park, clubs all over Ireland have been told they must organise their teams in U, U and U gradings. And with it comes the huge void from the undeveloped underage player until the senior ranks and the physical challenges it will bring. V is for virus...and for vaccine. Covid- came along and robbed us of any degree of a normal le, tore our sporting landscape to pieces and left us going around in circles to stamp it out. Hopefully the vaccine will help  take a more familiar shape. W is for wheelie bin. There wasnt a home in the country that didnt have balls peppering towards them. Dungiven U player Ryan Moore was the king. Bouncing on a trampoline, he performed a backflip, with the ball between his legs before releasing it into the wheelie bin. Take a bow Ryan. There was also the example of McNicholl family of Glenullin, taking videos of three generations playing hurling camogie, before knitting it all into one nty movie. A lovely touch. X is for x-factor...well, this is close enough. What a year it was for county Derry. Dara McNicholl was wowing viewers on The Voice Kids. If that wasnt enough, Johnny Brooks and Brooke Scullion also took the Saturday night entertainment by storm, getting all the way to final of The Voice. They have all played on the sporting fields of Derry and it was amazing to see them put the county on the map. Brilliant. Y is for yelling. Once crowds began toto games, worryingly in more numbers than permitted, so too did the vitriol being yelled over the fence. The time away from sport didnt make one iota of dference to the level of respect on show. It was open season again, with referees, players and mentors labelled as fair game for those who paid their money to watch. Z is for Zoom. This time last year, we thought it was something you did in a car or on a camera. Now, its in every facet of our working and personal lives. And sport is no dferent. It became a tool for club AGMs, meetings and training sessions. Sideline View would like to wish all our readers, advertisers and contributors a happy new year. Lets hope we can kick Covid into touch and get back to thriving sporting arenas across Derry and beyond.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The -year-old met with City boss Declan Devine last weekend, and it seemed that a move to the Brandywell was on the cards, but he has opted to stay on at Finn Park. The winger appeared  times for Harps last season, scoring two goals. Speaking after the signing, the Kerry man told club media he was keen to repay the faith shown in him by the management team and help the club kick on “I enjoyed my time with Harps last season, there were a great bunch of players with a lot of togetherness in the group. I suppose a lot of us felt we probably underachieved last year with the team we had so hopefully we can manage to kick on again next year. googletag.cmd.push “Ollie and Paul took a chance on me last year and gave me an opportunity to play in the Premier Division again so I owe them a lot. Overall, the players, staff and everyone at the club make you feel very welcome and Im looking forward to pushing on again this year.” Ollie Horgan said: “Karl is a good lad with a lot of talent. He was unlucky with a couple of knocks last year that kept him out of a few games especially towards the end of the season. Hopefully now he can get a good preseason under him and that will set him up well for the year ahead. We’re delighted he’s decided to re-sign with the club.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I thought this group without doubt deserved more. They are outstanding and deserve a Christmas performance so I went about to make this happen, he explained.ldquoI decided to put on a show for the children as for some of my class this would be their final hurrah in an eagerly anticipated Christmas play with a dference.Mr McGarrity said St Malachyrsquos had previously used green screen technology and he set about organising an ldquoamazing surprise to mash the school play and green screen technology together to make a Christmas show.ldquoThe boys and girls were so excited and overall delighted to be taking part in a somewhat dferent type of production, he said.And with only three weeksrsquo practice before the Christmas holidays they pulled it out of the bag, planning, ing and deliveringlsquoScroogehellipA Ghost of a Chance rsquo, which was screened via YouTube.Mr McGarrity said the link for the recent screening was shared with families, local community groups and care homes as the pupils wanted their story to be heard across the country in a time of need.The primary school teacher said the school was also keen to promote festive cheer and good old Christmas spirit, especially in these unprecedented times, bringing hope and joy to all families. young and old.The St Malachyrsquos production can be viewed at https:youtu.be vsNXbepVw and the school is hoping it will help put a smile on peoplersquos faces..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th January 2021 Ballykinlar.jpg","title":"Ballykinlar is key to future in Down  ","story":"DOWN GAA county secretary Sean Og McAteer has said there potential for ldquoimaginative funding ahead of what is likely to be a very testing year financially at inter-county level.All sporting bodies found their funds hit last year by the spread of covid- and the impact that had.With sport shelved for a large part of the year, and the same happening again in the early part of , it continues to be a trying time.With the virus still posing a signicant threat going into the new year, it is likely that sport at all levels will continue to see many dficulties going forward.Conor Murray, an Irish Research Council Postgraduate scholar at the School of History and Geography at Dublin City University, has been analysing numbers from the GAArsquos annual financial reports from -.He has calculated the levels of grant money given to each county to fund games development and expenses.Whilst at the top end of the scale, Dublinrsquos figure sits at euro. million for the period, for Down the figure is a much more modest euro,, putting them in bottom place.Mr McAteer said Downrsquos expenditure was in no way comparable with that of other counties.ldquoWe are on the low side of the money list, no doubt, he admitted. ldquoWe certainly have the ambition to begin to address the deficit. We want to be able to develop our coaching set-up, particularly in urban centres like Downpatrick, Newry, north Down, the Down parts of Belfast. Hopefully those opportunities will come up.Mr McAteer said the implementation of a Down training hub at Ballykinlar was a key aim when it comes to considering where spending will take place in Down GAA.ldquoThe development at Ballykinlar is a huge thing, both for Down and the community in Ballykinlar. That is one of the key fronts we are working on, he said.ldquoOf course though, we cannot take our eye of the importance of development in urban areas. We can see how much Dublin for example have benefited from utilising their urban areas, and the rewards they have reaped from that in recent years on the pitch, as well as financially.He did caution that, as ever, the availability of funding is major issue.ldquoThe GAA took a huge hit financially in  - that is likely to happen to some degree at least, again this year.ldquoIn terms of us here in Down though, we are in a stronger position to deal with the climate I would like to think, certainly when compared to other northern counties.ldquoWe have big urban centres which is vitally important. We can also explore the possibility of greater cross-border development with counties like Louth, and the use of the Dublin Institute of Technology. There is, going forward this year, a lot of potential for imaginative funding that we can use to our advantage here in Down.Another cornerstone of the approach to keeping Down GAA in good health is continuing to appeal to the younger generations coming through in the Mourne county.ldquoWe need to try to make Gaelic Games the number one sport of choice for young kids in Down, Mr McAteer said.ldquoIf you look at our record from July of  to the end of the year, we staged , games. A lot of those games were at an under-age level. Some clubs have got very very strong groups of kids at very young ages.ldquoWhat we need to do is to ensure that those young people who come into the GAA in Down at that stage stay with it into adulthood.ldquoOur games need to be attractive and innovative going forward.ldquoThat means we all need to keep pushing, keep the facilities as good as possible and promoting ourselves as well as we can..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th January 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Brexit deal is ‘best of both worlds’ for local fishermen  ","story":"THE Brexit fisheries deal with the European Union is good news for the Ardglass fishing industry.Thatrsquos the view of former fishermenrsquos leader Dick James, who says Ardglass and the other Co Down fishing ports can look to the future with confidence.Mr James, former chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fish Producersrsquo Organisation, says an increase in quotas for key catches will benefit fishermen.At the same time the non-imposition of tarfs on exported fish to EU markets, will underpin the future of the processing industry.Mr James that while some areas of the UK had done badly from the Brexit deal, local fishermen should be pleased with the outcome.ldquoThe deal is good news for our fishermen and should secure investment and new jobs in the industry, he said.In the Irish Sea the amount of herring which can be caught by UK fishermen will rise from the current figure of % to % in  and % in .In the crucial prawn sector, the UK quota for Area , which includes the Irish Sea, will go from % currently to % in  and % in .There will also be increases in the UK quotas for other types of fish, including haddock, cod and whiting.Mr James said: ldquoWe have got the best of both worlds. Our fishermen can land more fish and we can continue to trade with the Continent relatively unfettered.ldquoThis is particularly important when you consider that most of the prawns we catch locally are exported to Spain.Mr James said the deal has already boosted confidence. ldquoI know of one new boat coming to Ardglass and we are looking at another two, he said.ldquoThe increase in the herring quota secures the future of two herring processing factories in Ardglass and another in Kilkeel.ldquoThis deal guarantees the future of fishing in Ardglass and should encourage more local people to seek employment in the industry.Mr James said it would also add impetus to the campaign for improvements to the harbour in Ardglass.These include deepening the harbour, improving berthing and landing facilities and providing berthing pontoons for smaller vessels..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th January 2020 Call.jpg","title":"Calls on public to take coronavirus vaccine  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH man has become one of the first student nurses in the UK to receive the Covid- vaccine.James Savage is now urging local people and fellow health professionals to take up the offer of the potentially le-saving jab as soon as itrsquos made available to them.The  year-old student nurse got his vaccine over the weekend while working part-time as a senior staff member at Ringdufferin Nursing Home near Killyleagh.The former Member of the UK Youth Parliamentfor Strangford, James has recently been elected to the Students Committee of the Royal College of Nursing.He represents the North West region as he attends Liverpool John Moores University where he hopes to qualy in a few years time as a mental health nurse.His call to encourage others to take up the vaccine also comes from his own experience of contacting the virus last March and his sadness over losing his grandmother to Covid- last April, as well as some patients.James, who has worked as a carer in nursing homes since he was , said: ldquoThe vaccine is the best hope for us to overcome challenges currently facing the country.ldquoIrsquove worked in a nursing home during a major outbreak here after which I volunteered as a student nurse to take up a post in the NHS working on the wards helping to care for mental health patients.ldquoDuring my time working in health care and as a student nurse over the last five years, I have had to face many challenges.

Patients in care homes have been severely affected from Covid- during the pandemic and residents and their staff were chosen by the government to be amongst the first to be vaccinated.He explained: ldquoWhen it came to my attention that I was one of the few student nurses to have received the vaccine at this stage so with my new role as a student ambassador I believed it was important to encourage all student nurses and all NHS workers and of course, all local people, to take up the opportunity to have the vaccine.ldquoThese vaccines are the best chance we have to tackle this pandemic head on. I have personally seen the dedication and strength of our NHS and health care staff across the country.ldquoTheir fortitude and courage have propped up the country in what are indeed dire times. The ability of the nursing profession to overcome adversity is truly great.

Ellen had a close friendship group of about nine or ten girls who all grew up together and went on holidays together, she said.ldquoWhile the grief hit us all in dferent ways over the years, I was helped dealing with it as I had a lot of friends who were all going through the same thing as we all understood what we were going through.ldquoWe are a tight group of friends and now when we all come together itrsquos not about feeling sad about Ellen, itrsquos about look backing and being happy for her being there.

Ellen, of course, was still going through grief from the loss of her mother. There are people who can get up and get on with things but there are people, such as some of my friends, who did not cope so well, so MYMY provides services for people who are not coping ldquoWhile raising money was not the objective, the real reason was to get people out and about and moving in January as the month is grim enough, but even more so with the tight lockdown.ldquoI wanted it to be something that everybody could take part in, old or young people and you can run one day or walk the next.Cllr Laura Devlin, chairwoman of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, is just one of the local people taking part in the initiative.She said she was delighted to hear of Maireadrsquos challenge in memory of Ellen and her mother.ldquoEveryone locally knows the Finnegans and what a tragedy it was to lose two amazing people from our local community.ldquoThis challenge is great for a number of reasons. It is bringing all walks of le, ages and abilities together at what is already a trying time. Itrsquos remembering the fantastic contribution that Ellen and her mummy Nicola made, not just to Castlewellan but the wider area. It is raising funds for an amazing local charity and lastly shining a spotlight on the need to deal with grief.She added that with gyms closed and social interactions severely restricted, the challenge helped give the community a focus in one of the darker months of the year.To take part or donate to the event, visit K A DAY January on ww.gofundme..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th January 2020 Downpatrick.jpg","title":"Downpatrick couple welcome first baby on New Year’s Day  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK couple celebrated the birth of their first baby on New Yearrsquos Day.Mum Keely Brennan and dad Adam McKee welcomed their daughter, Willow-Grace, into the world at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald at .am on January Willow-Grace was the first baby to be born in the hospital in  and weighed in at seven pounds and six ounces.Keely , who works at the St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick, went into labour at her home on New Yearrsquos Eve.She said she decided to have a water birth and that it all happened very quickly.ldquoShe is just perfect.

And we donrsquot want to give coronavirus to our close family or friends.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people must show \"extreme caution\" during the Christmas period and consider whether it is wise to mix with families, and particularly elderly and vulnerable family members.He said that it had been \"unanimously agreed\" among the four UK nations that the approved relaxation of restrictions should remain, as \"we dont want to criminalise peoples long-made plans\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In , he was a member of a crew of just eight leboat volunteers from across the UK who flew out to aid the relief effort in flood-stricken Mozambique.Together, the team faced the dangers of crocodiles, hippos, poisonous snakes and anti-personnel mines, navigating rivers that had burst their banks, in a rescue mission to bring desperately needed medical relief to , people in villages marooned by flood waters.ldquoWe had five small D class inflatable leboats, and had to ferry doctors and medical supplies to areas that had been written off as impossible, as helicopters couldnrsquot land there and they were inaccessible by road, he said.ldquoIt was so hot that the soles of my boots melted. We had to spend the night on sandbars where we took turns to keep watch, as the crocodiles were very keen to join us.Since he joined the crew, Mike has combined his volunteering with his paid job in the South Wales Fire and Rescue service. He joined the service back in , at just , and progressed from his position as a firefighter, to the lead instructor for recruit training, finally finishing his career in  as Chair of the Water Rescue group, and a member of the servicersquos all Wales flood response team.Over the past four decades, -year-old Mr Kingston has seen huge changes in the way the RNLI operates.He has seen Penarth leboat station move from its original home in the deck chair store underneath the current Coffi Co building on the Esplanade, to its current location just up the road in a purpose built, modern leboat station.ldquoIrsquom sure the people of Penarth will remember the hand held maroons that were fired off by a leboat crew member to call the rest of us to the station for a launch, he said.ldquoBut even before that, I remember when the Pier Master would get us down to the station by firing the maroons out of a small cannon.ldquoNowadays, technology has moved on and we use pagers, mobiles phones and computer systems to respond to a shout.ldquoThese systems are a lot more sophisticated, but itrsquos still the same feeling when yoursquore called out of bed in the early hours of a freezing cold January morning.ldquoNo matter how times have moved on, one thing that remains constant is the unbelievable commitment of the whole RNLI team.ldquoThere have been so many highs and lows over the past  years. As all the team will know, itrsquos good to feel that yoursquore part of a team, giving something to your community.ldquoBut there have also been some sad times when people have lost their lives. Irsquom proud to have been a part of Penarth RNLI family.Thanking him for his  years of service, Jason Dunlop, Penarth Leboat Operations Manager said: ldquoOn behalf of all at Penarth leboat station, I would like to congratulate Mike on this fantastic achievement and thank him for his commitment and support to saving lives at sea over the last  years.

They have done an incredible job over the past few weeks to be ready for delivery.ldquoThe secretary of state said, crucially, that this is a UK-wide effort will he give a cast-iron guarantee that not only this tranche of vaccines but future tranches will be available on a completely equitable basis throughout the UK, so that we can bear down on this virus in every part of our country It was good to get a guarantee on that from the secretary of state. I also spoke this week on the worrying reversal in progress tackling global hunger and famine.With so many struggling to access basic food needs at home and abroad, wersquove seen an extraordinary lack of compassion from this Tory government in the run-up to Christmas by failing to tackle holiday hunger in England at the same time as slashing our humanitarian relief while millions face famine.Itrsquos time for a Christmas U-turn on both.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

They have done an incredible job over the past few weeks to be ready for delivery.ldquoThe secretary of state said, crucially, that this is a UK-wide effort will he give a cast-iron guarantee that not only this tranche of vaccines but future tranches will be available on a completely equitable basis throughout the UK, so that we can bear down on this virus in every part of our country It was good to get a guarantee on that from the secretary of state. I also spoke this week on the worrying reversal in progress tackling global hunger and famine.With so many struggling to access basic food needs at home and abroad, wersquove seen an extraordinary lack of compassion from this Tory government in the run-up to Christmas by failing to tackle holiday hunger in England at the same time as slashing our humanitarian relief while millions face famine.Itrsquos time for a Christmas U-turn on both.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

These projected figures are the highest we have ever seen in this County and are likely to reach almost , cases per , in the seven-day period up until Christmas Day.If you compare that with the figure of  cases per , when we entered the local lockdown, you can see how serious the current situation is. We can no longer be complacent.We know from the first and second waves that as case numbers increase, more people get seriously unwell, and we will inevitably see more deaths from Coronavirus - many of which can be avoided,we act now.We are deeply concerned that hospitals and primary care services across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan are now under unsustainable pressure due to COVID-, and sadly, but inevitably, the number of people who are becoming very sick is increasing daily.Each and every one of us has a responsibility to act now. We must all follow Welsh Government coronavirus regulations, butyou can also take further actions to protect those you love, then we urge you to do so.We should not meet with anyone outside our household bubble and keep contact with people outside our household to an absolute minimum until the current threat has passed, but especially in the run-up to Christmas.We know that staying away from loved ones will be painful for many, especially at this time of year, butwe do this now, we will be doing everything we can to protect our family and friends for the months to come.We know many people think that the vaccine is going to become more widely available, so everything is going to be okay. Regrettably, that is simply not the case. If we donrsquot change our behaviour now,many people will die before the vaccine is rolled out, people who donrsquot need to die, possibly people who you know.The full roll out of the vaccine will take many months, so now is not the time to be complacent. Very few of us are immune and the virus is still prevalent in our communities and our hospitals. By practising social distancing, washing our hands regularly and wearing face coverings we will all be doing our bit to help.So, our message is simple.Wash your hands regularly oryou canrsquot do that use sanitiser hand gel.Please try and stay at home and only go out for essential reasons andit is essential to go out, please do so in quieter periods.If you do go out, wear a mask when required and keep socially distanced by at least  metres, wherever possible.Please do not mix with other households or your friends.Work from home,you can do so.If you develop symptoms such as a new and continuous cough, a temperature, or a loss of taste or smell please self-isolate with your household and arrange a test.These small steps can really help us all to keep our communities safe.As a Health Board and Council, we are fully mobilised in the fight against COVID-. Doing so continues to be a huge challenge and is one that we will best achieve,we do it together, just as we did in the Spring.We are asking every one of you to achieve this challenge together.Letrsquos stop the spread, and letrsquos keep the Vale of Glamorgan, the NHS and our loved ones safe.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hospitality businesses would have joined them on pm Christmas Day, with a level four lockdown coming into place on Monday, December . The five day lsquorelaxationrsquo period would have still been in place according to these rules, but a change from three households mixing to two.But on Saturday, December , all this changed as prime minister Boris Johnson held a press conference to update the UK on the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus and announcing that the South East of England, including London would be moved into tier four.Tier four means residents must stay at home with some limited exemptions ndash which includes workunable to do so from home, however, working from home is strongly advisedit is possible. Non-essential services must also close.

He announced that the tier four lockdown would come into place from midnight on Saturday, December , meaning businesses had a matter of hours to come to terms with the news and people rushed out to do some last-minute Christmas shopping before all the non-essential retail closed.Some of the supermarkets across Wales have now taken their lsquonon-essentialrsquo items off sale.The festive period bubble rule has also changed, with a maximum of two households allowed to mix on Christmas Day.MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford said in a statement on Saturday evening that the pattern of transmission in London and the South East of England, which is linked to the new iant of coronavirus, is ldquoremarkably consistent with the rapid acceleration of transmission in Wales in recent weeks.Also in the statement, the first minister said that latest evidence had suggested the new strain is present throughout Wales and that it needed an ldquoimmediate response.After meeting with the Welsh Governmentrsquos Cabinet on Saturday and taking into consideration advice from senior medical and scientic advisors, he said: ldquoThe situation is incredibly serious.

And light does more than create a festive mood mdash light brings hope.ldquoFor Christians, Jesus is lsquothe light of the worldrsquo, but we canrsquot celebrate his birth today in quite the usual way. People of all faiths have been unable to gather as they would wish for their festivals, such as Passover, Easter, Eid and Vaisakhi. But we need le to go on.ldquoLast month, fireworks lit up the sky around Windsor, as Hindus, Sikhs and Jains celebrated Diwali, the festival of lights, providing joyous moments of hope and unity mdash despite social distancing.ldquoRemarkably, a year that has necessarily kept people apart has, in many ways, brought us closer. Across the Commonwealth, my family and I have been inspired by stories of people volunteering in their communities, helping those in need.ldquoIn the United Kingdom and around the world, people have risen magnicently to the challenges of the year, and I am so proud and moved by this quiet, indomitable spirit. To our young people in particular I say thank you for the part you have played.ldquoThis year, we celebrated International Nursesrsquo Day, on the th anniversary of the birth of Florence Nightingale. As with other nursing pioneers like Mary Seacole, Florence Nightingale shone a lamp of hope across the world.ldquoToday, our frontline services still shine that lamp for us ndash supported by the amazing achievements of modern science ndash and we owe them a debt of gratitude.ldquoWe continue to be inspired by the kindness of strangers and draw comfort that ndash even on the darkest nights ndash there is hope in the new dawn.MORE NEWS:Do you know what happened to this poor kitten How Sully came together at Christmas through the power of the artsAll the supermarket opening times over Christmas and New YearldquoJesus touched on this with the parable of the Good Samaritan. The man who is robbed and left at the roadside is saved by someone who did not share his religion or culture. This wonderful story of kindness is still as relevant today.ldquoGood Samaritans have emerged across society showing care and respect for all, regardless of gender, race or background, reminding us that each one of us is special and equal in the eyes of God.ldquoThe teachings of Christ have served as my inner light, as has the sense of purpose we can find in coming together to worship.ldquoIn November, we commemorated another hero ndash though nobody knows his name. The Tomb of the Unknown Warrior isnrsquot a large memorial, but everyone entering Westminster Abbey has to walk around his resting place, honouring this unnamed combatant of the First World War mdash a symbol of selfless duty and ultimate sacrice.ldquoThe Unknown Warrior was not exceptional. Thatrsquos the point. He represents millions like him who throughout our history have put the lives of others above their own, and will be doing so today. For me, this is a source of enduring hope in dficult and unpredictable times.ldquoOf course, for many, this time of year will be tinged with sadness: some mourning the loss of those dear to them, and others missing friends and family members distanced for safety, when all theyrsquod really want for Christmas is a simple hug or a squeeze of the hand.ldquoIf you are among them, you are not alone, and let me assure you of my thoughts and prayers.ldquoThe Bible tells how a star appeared in the sky, its light guiding the shepherds and wise men to the scene of Jesusrsquos birth. Let the light of Christmas mdash the spirit of selflessness, love and above all hope mdash guide us in the times ahead.ldquoIt is in that spirit that I wish you a very happy Christmas. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Wherersquos the robust plan to make sure our childrenrsquos education isnrsquot being ruined ldquoI donrsquot disagree at all with the decision to keep them off school, but there needs to be a plan in place.Mrs Lacey, who works full-time as well as her husband, said on Wednesday her son had received no face to face teaching by midday.ldquoI think schools are trying, but communication with parents needs to improve in our case.ldquoWersquove also had little clarity on whether the mock exams he did when he was in before Christmas will have a bearing on predicting grades later this year. Itrsquos very uncertain and the I do get the feeling the goodwill is starting to dwindle.Nikki LaceyOn Wednesday it was confirmed that internal assessments replacing next summerrsquos cancelled exams in Wales are scheduled to start in schools on February .Mother-of-three Clare Hollinshead, who has two children at primary school and one in secondary school, also says she felt the decision to extend the closure was the right one.Mrs Hollinshead ndash who is undergoing cancer treatment and is vulnerable ndash says she worried about relying on the actions of others to keep her family safe.Clare HollinsheadldquoI think the decisionhad to be made, but I do have concerns for my children, she said.ldquoThe impact on them not seeing their friends and not getting the education they deserve is something them makes me anxious.ldquoToo much time alone and in front of a screen is no good for anyone.ldquoIt will be more concerningit continues after January . Itrsquos dficult to maintain that motivation to keep going and keep balancing le with home-schooling.ldquoButitrsquos what we have to do then so be it. Itrsquos so important we protect the NHS. Irsquod hate for someone who was in my positionto not get the treatment they need because our hospitals are overwhelmed.On Tuesday Ms Williams said schools will only remain closed after January  ldquo thatrsquos the only thing we can do to suppress the virus.ldquoClearly any decision to close schools for face-to-face teaching contact for the majority of children is a really dficult decision, she said, ldquoand itrsquos a decision which has grave consequences for children.ldquoEducation has a role to play in helping suppress the virus and helping our NHS to cope, and helping those doctors and nurses and healthcare professionals who are on the front line and struggling so hard. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

She felt really ill on New Year’s Eve and she knew time was running out.“We got organised in two hours and married at pm.“She then fell asleep the same evening and never woke again.“She slipped away in her sleep,” said Lee.Writing on Facebook he revealed that the couple made the choice to bring their wedding forward.“She knew in herself that her time was getting shorter. We got married at home surrounded by close friends and family in a very intimate ceremony.“Jade passed away peacefully at home early on the nd of January with myself and Billyholding her hand. Our hearts are broken but at peace knowing Jade is no longer suffering,” wrote Lee, thanking everyone for their support.Before Christmas, Jade was not just planning her wedding but also her funeral.Lee said: “She has banned black from her funeral and she hates being the centre of attention,”Jade’s struggle started in November  with headaches and doctors said she had nasal polypsand gave her antibiotics.Later she was given an appointment with the ENT unit at Craigavon Hospital but the COVID- pandemic hit and all appointments were cancelled.Lee explained that she began to get very bad headaches and the polyps started to grow, so much so that her eyes were bulging from her head.After a CT scan in April last year, they diagnosed a tumour and Jade had an operation the following week.“About five weeks later the tumour came back and after a second operation they removed as much as they could.“She has had four blocks of chemotherapy, three times a week. “At the end of her chemo she started radiotherapy in September.

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.
