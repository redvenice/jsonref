Saying that picking up litter was used as a ‘punishment’ when she was a schoolgirl, she called on Britons to see the task as ‘not only the right thing to do ... but something which we are actually proud to do’.

The campaign has already been backed by the United Nations and a string of celebrities and campaigners, including Sir David Attenborough, Michael Palin and Jeremy Corbyn.Last year some 370,000 took part in the Spring Clean.

Some were so inspired by our campaign that they’ve been meeting up for regular events of their own, gathering friends, colleagues, relatives and neighbours to join the fight. But all are united in the conviction that this year’s Great British Spring Clean will be the biggest yet.We catch up with some of the litter heroes who’ll be returning for this year’s campaign. Why don’t you join them?NORTH WESTTown councillor Sue Helliwell, 56, has recruited more volunteers for a pick-up in Alsager, Cheshire. ‘Alsager’s litter is mainly plastic bottles and takeaway cups,’ she says.‘People drink on the hoof and, if there’s not a bin, they’re thrown out of cars. There needs to be more litter bins along routes.’          Dundee-based Shoaib Khan, 37, is a regional youth leader for the Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth Association. During the Great Plastic Pick Up, he took volunteers to Corrie Fee, AngusElaine Beesley, 45, a web developer at Edge Hill University, helps run the Burscough Litter Pickers in Lancashire. ‘We have never stopped meeting regularly and clearing up the town we all love,’ she says. ‘I want our community to be proud of the work we do and, in turn, be proud of where they live.’Retired police officer Andy Wright, 48, organised a pick-up at Fred Longworth High School in Tyldesley, near Wigan, during a ‘fun day’ last year that ‘no doubt’ raised awareness of litter.He says: ‘There were hundreds of families there and we filled bags and bags of plastic.’Wayne Dixon is half way through an 8,000-mile walk around Britain’s coastline with his dog, Koda. The Army veteran, 47, is litter-picking on his way to raise money and awareness.He says: ‘It doesn’t matter if it’s near a big city or a beautiful place — it will have the same type and amount of litter.’NORTH EASTStewart Hind drummed up support at Hartlepool Rugby Club, recruiting up to 40 people to pick up litter last year. ‘We had a number of volunteers who were willing to help the community,’ he says. ‘We’ve picked up food packaging from takeaways, plastic bottles, even metal and tyres.’Special needs students at Castle School, formerly The Centre, in Ashington, Northumberland, joined our campaign.Teacher Dawn Watson, 37, says: ‘We were really pleased with how it went. We’re a school for children with severe special needs, so going out into the community can be traumatic. But even our most profoundly disabled students really enjoyed it.’          Former teacher Paul Bridgewater has continued to collect litter since the Mail’s Great Plastic Pick UpNORTHCathy Brotherton held a clean-up last year after becoming frustrated at the piles of rubbish left on roads between Dewsbury and Huddersfield.‘The amount of takeaway containers, beer cans and bottles thrown out of car windows on to verges and into fields, which then get smashed, injuring the animals, is unbelievable,’ she says.‘We encourage people to go into the countryside, which always gets neglected.’WEST MIDLANDSChris Dunster, 50, from Olton, near Solihull, says: ‘The Spring Clean enables us to do a targeted approach and collect en masse a whole lot more litter than normal.‘In Solihull, litter-picking is going from strength to strength, so residents are really getting behind it and taking ownership of their local areas. It’s very encouraging.’Alan Preece, senior warden at the Saltwells Local Nature Reserve in Dudley, will be rallying volunteers to take part this year.‘As an urban nature reserve, we do get litter and fly-tipping, ranging from cigarette butts to three-piece suites,’ he says.‘Luckily, we are assisted by two great teams of volunteers who join us to make a difference.’EAST MIDLANDSJanice Cain, a stock controller from Northampton, became an ambassador for Keep Britain Tidy after joining last year’s Great Plastic Pick Up.‘I’m interested in protecting the environment and clearing up plastic,’ says Miss Cain, who this year will be joining The Great British Spring Clean.SCOTLANDDundee-based Shoaib Khan, 37, is a regional youth leader for the Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth Association. During the Great Plastic Pick Up, he took volunteers to Corrie Fee, Angus.He says: ‘Last year, we did one clean-up as part of the campaign. Hopefully, this year, we’ll do two or three.’WALESGrandmother of three Lynnette Knight has doubled her volunteer team from six to 12 people since last year’s Daily Mail plastic pick-up campaign.Recruited via a community Facebook page in Barry, South Wales, members raised money in order to buy their own litter-picking equipment.The retired conference manager, 65, says that for her five-year-old grandson, picking up rubbish has become second nature.‘My grandchildren took it really seriously,’ she explains.LONDONKaren Harrison, 64, took 6th A Headstone Girl Guides out litter-picking in North Harrow last year.‘It was really successful from our point of view,’ says teacher Karen.‘We got a whole unit involved and the girls really enjoyed doing it. We also got a lot of positive comments from local people when they saw what we were doing.’For former bank manager David Hewett, litter-picking is a retirement project. The 76-year-old walks between Putney Rowing Club and Kew Bridge Road once a week collecting rubbish on the pedestrian path, where dog litter bags, bottles and plastic bags are commonplace.He says: ‘Such items spoil the picturesque pedestrian path beside the Thames River.’          Town councillor Sue Helliwell, 56, has recruited more volunteers for a pick-up in Alsager, CheshireSOUTH EASTBradley Smith, 30, is a community warden supervisor at Sudbury Town Council.After last year’s successful plastic campaign, his team is aiming to make an even bigger impact in their area, starting with local schools.They are visiting six in the town and encouraging them to get involved in The Great British Spring Clean. ‘We’ll really push it this year because we did so well last year,’ he says.‘Litter is a big part of the community in Sudbury — it’s something we are all passionate about clearing.’                                                                                        To sign up to the campaign, visit gbspringclean.org                                                      Ian Hudson, 66, organised a pick-up in Bishops Stortford, Hertfordshire, last year and will be holding another in March as part of The Great British Spring Clean.‘We’re going to meet at the local football club and do a couple of the main roads that are pretty grotty,’ he says. ‘Part of the area we covered last time was the community hospital. I reckon we picked up about ten bags just from the car park.’Art worker Owen Burton, 20, gathered together 12 members of his family to clean an area of Shoeburyness, on the Thames Estuary, last year and he says that he will be joining The Great British Spring Clean campaign this year, too.‘Picking up litter is actually fun!’ he says. ‘I got my family involved as I didn’t want to do it alone. The Mail’s campaigns on this are brilliant.’SOUTHLast year, Jean-Louis Button incorporated litter-picking into his fitness regime, stopping to pick up rubbish every time he went running in Bletchley in Milton Keynes.The 26-year-old says: ‘The campaign definitely helps. It motivates people.’David Rawle, 67, organised a 20-man pick-up with Cranfield Tae Kwon Do Club last year and is keen to get behind this year’s campaign as well. ‘I can’t think of any reason why not!’ he says. ‘I know a lot of people who couldn’t make it last time — they would certainly join us.‘We found the usual things — crisp packets, rusty bottles — and then more unusual items such as a chair and half a motorbike.’Marine conservationist Lucy Agace led a successful litter crusade of 25 people in Brighton, East Sussex, last year. Lucy was inspired to join the Daily Mail’s Great Plastic Pick Up campaign after spending 30 years as an underwater photographer.‘Tiny microparticles of plastic are part of the sea now and affect everything that comes out of it, anywhere,’ she says.

IT’s JUST BIOLOGYKatharine Graves, hypnobirthing expertCradling a bump is something that’s hardwired into women from a biological perspective.Women are instinctively drawn to touching their babies because, even when they’re in the womb, it produces a hormone called oxytocin. This hormone is known as the bonding hormone, but it also affects the strength of your contractions in labour.The more oxytocin in your system, the stronger your contractions will be, which can lead to an easier birth. Placing your hands on your bump comforts the baby, comforts you, and helps create the optimum conditions for labour.kghypnobirthing.com  The left hand touch: Cusping baby in London last month (right), in Birkenhead, (centre), and with Harry in Australia (left)DUCHESS OF SHOWBIZ IS JUST SEEKING A PHOTO OP Jo Elvin, Editor of You MagazineI’ve tried not to find it annoying, but I’m sorry, it just is. A casual cradling of one’s bump is to be expected. It’s new, it’s exciting and there really is nothing like feeling that thing kick and jump around in there.But Meghan’s positioning is always so fixed into one singular, rigid pose that it’s becoming uncomfortable to watch. I’m getting arm aches just looking. It’s all very Baby Bump Barbie.Kinder people would point to an excited new mother’s natural, unconditional love already blossoming. True enough, in which case I hope its sibling isn’t far behind, or that poor kid’s clearly in for a smothering.But come on, this is the Duchess of Showbiz we have here. It smacks to me of a focus that’s contrived and relentlessly photo-op ready. Meghan would be well advised to take the ‘world’s only pregnant woman!’ vibes down a notch or two.  Talk to the bump! The Duchess seems to be including the baby in her conversations in London this month (right) and last month (left)A WOMAN SHOWING A NEW-FOUND RESERVE Harry Witchel, body language expert Meghan tends to cup her bump by knitting her fingers together – a sign of holding back and being more grounded. That’s quite a contrast to her usual behaviour, which involves dealing with the world with gusto. As a Royal she is expected to be more reserved, so is this a subconscious attempt to be so?This doesn’t look like acting. This looks like a woman aware of a change in her body.

Possibly, at 37, she wasn’t sure it would happen so quickly.But there may be another story. All Royals have a method of preventing their arms from flailing around in a chaotic fashion when they are out and about. Meghan is using her bump as a way to keep her hands calm, while showing how protective she is.SHE LOOKS AS DEMURE AS THE VIRGIN MARY Alison Jackson, photographer Meghan\u0027s arms framing the bump very clearly shows that she is pregnant, rather than just looking large. I think she’s also very consciously making the effort to break up the solid colour of her outfits.After years as an actress, she’ll be very aware of camera angles and how to work them, and how to create flattering shapes with her body.I also think she resembles the image of the Virgin Mary: demure and regal, carrying the most precious cargo. She’s definitely very pleased with herself about that.instagram.comalisonjacksonartist          Photographer Alison Jackson says Meghan\u0027s arms framing the bump very clearly shows that she is pregnantIGNORE THE BACKLASH, THIS IS A BIG POSITIVE Julianne Boutaleb, psycholgistIt’s interesting to see such a backlash against a woman who is interacting with her bump in this way. But I see it as a very positive thing. It indicates a good attachment to the unborn baby.I work with a lot of women who struggle to develop a bond with their child, whether due to difficulty conceiving, miscarriage, or birth trauma. But a woman who is cradling her bump is showing that she’s very engaged, both emotionally and physically, with her unborn child.parenthoodinmind.co.uk    Psychologist Julianne Boutaleb sees it as a very positive thing and it indicates a good attachment to the unborn babyIT’S MEGHAN’S CLOAK OF INVULNERABILITY Linda Kelsey, former editor of Cosmopolitan  Everyone else constantly paws you when you’re pregnant, so why shouldn’t Meghan take things into her own hands? Personally, I’ve never felt as strong and invulnerable as when my belly was ballooning.I would march into meetings with my Managing Director, who was not at all happy to have one of his editors about to go on maternity leave (I was editor of Cosmopolitan at the time), knowing there was nothing he could say to burst my sense of well-being. And in case he missed the point I’d cradle my belly one more time for added effect.  Meghan has had a hard time of it lately with attacks on a number of fronts. But when you’re pregnant and loving it nothing else really matters.Every time she cradles her bump, it’s a case of you and me against the world, babe – and she’s rocking it.IF THIS IS HER ACTING, IT’s A MASSIVE CLICHE Dee Cannon, acting coachWhen you’re teaching an actor to ‘play’ pregnant, the preparation involves holding the back. Cradling the bump is not really something you’d ask an actor to do – it’s such a demonstrative gesture that it could be seen as a cliche. So when a woman is doing that in real life, you can choose to interpret it in either a positive or a negative way – either it’s a subconscious, instinctive, nurturing, maternal gesture, or they’re proud and overly protective.deecannon.com          Acting coach Dee Cannon says cradling the bump is not really something you’d ask an actor to do – it’s such a demonstrative gesture that it could be seen as a clicheWHAT’S SO UNNATURAL IN LOVING YOUR BUMP?Bonita Turner, editor of Junior Magazine I imagine it’s reassuring for Meghan to put her hands on her baby. I don’t think she’s doing it to show off, and I imagine that people saying that have never been pregnant. It’s natural to be proud of your bump. You only have it for nine months and it is quite special.CONSTANT STROKING IS HELPING BABY LEARN Tamara Bugembe, paediatrician WE HAVE known for a long time that babies respond to voices and sounds from outside the womb, and they also move their arms, head and mouths more when the bump was stroked. Some babies would reach out and touch the walls of the uterus.Touching your bump is good for the baby’s development. Meghan may not know it, but her constant stroking and rubbing is helping develop the baby’s co-ordination and movements.drtamarab.comA POSITIVE SIGN SHE LOVES HER NEW BODY Holli Rubin, body image expertSome women love how they look when pregnant. Others hate it. A woman’s body image pre-pregnancy very much influences how she feels, looks and presents herself. When we feel good in ourselves, we tend to present ourselves in a very different way to when we don’t – and putting your hand on the bump in this way is a positive sign.hollirubin.com          Body image expert Holli Rubin says putting your hand on the bump in this way is a positive signMAKING THE MOST OF HER NEW SHAPE Renee Rispin, stylist \u0026amp blogger Some women find it hard to make the most of their changing body shape and hide their bumps – but Meghan isn’t one of them. Choosing to wear striking colours such as the purple dress and red coat she wore on a recent visit to Birkenhead is a clear message that not only does she want to show off her bump, but also that being pregnant doesn’t mean she’s taken her finger off the fashion pulse.mummystyle.co.ukSHE LOVES TO SHOW THAT SHE’S A ‘FAT LADY’ Katie Nicholl, royal authorHaving observed Meghan on official engagements, her bump patting seems to be second nature – it’s her new prop.It’s endearing, but a little distracting.

Mexico refused and now Trump wants U.S. taxpayers to pay for the barrier, which he sees as key to curbing illegal immigration and illegal drug flows into the country.Democrats say a wall would be too costly and ineffective. In addition to threatening another shutdown, Trump said he might declare a national emergency at the border and try to circumvent Congress\u0027s purse-string power by tapping Defense Department funds to pay for wall construction.Such a step would likely draw a prompt, time-consuming court challenge from congressional Democrats on constitutional ground.Rubio said on NBC the emergency option was \u0027a terrible idea.\u0027 A legal battle would put the administration \u0027at the mercy of a district court somewhere and ultimately an appellate court.\u0027The senator said it would set a bad precedent. \u0027It doesn\u0027t provide certainty.

On Sunday, the Booker Prize Foundation said that its trustees are already in discussions with a new sponsor “and are confident that new funding will be in place for 2020”. Australian novelist Thomas Keneally, who won the award in 1982 with Schindler’s Ark, told the  on Monday that he hoped the prize’s future would be guaranteed.“There is an emotional dependence on it, in a way that doesn’t attach to any other of the British prizes, as splendid as they are. Not having it there would be a little bit like navigating without a North Pole for fiction,” he said.“The Booker prize certainly makes a difference to one’s life. Peter Carey said it was like being run over by a bus – but it’s a bus many of us would put our hands out to be run over by … It is the lodestar of the literary year and if it vanished it would be a big adjustment. It looks as though they’ll get sponsorship but it would be an interesting climatic change over the book industry if they don’t.”While it is not the only financial corporation to take on a literary prize – investment management firms Baillie Gifford and Rathbones currently sponsor the Samuel Johnson and Folio prizes respectively – some have speculated that Man Group pulled out due to criticism of their role as a financial institution, as well as their influence on the prize. In July, author Sebastian Faulks branded Man Group “the enemy”, saying: “Man Group are not the sort of people who should be sponsoring literary prizes. They’re the kind of people literary prizes ought to be criticising.”Man oversaw several big changes to the prize, including the 2005 introduction of the Man Booker International prize, for translated writers, and a controversial change to eligibility rules that allowed writers from the US to enter for the first time in 2014. This led to widespread concerns that American authors would dominate, with two American winners in a row following soon after – Paul Beatty in 2016 and George Saunders in 2017.Irish novelist John Banville, author of The Sea, which won the Booker in 2005, suggested that a new sponsor could restore the prize to being only open to writers from Commonwealth countries.“As we know, public interest in the prize has seriously lapsed since eligibility was widened to allow in American writers. Indeed, this could be the chance to return the prize to what it used to be, an exclusively British institution – along with the Commonwealth and Ireland, that is – that the world regarded with keen if bemused interest, like cricket or the monarchy,” he said.“It’s one of the most effective literary prizes in the world, but it’s obviously a good time for there to be a more collegial attitude from the existing management and a proper rethink of what the prize is and can continue to be in the future.”Another inidual in publishing who asked not to be named said: “We knew they were coming up for 10-year renewal, and I think the feeling was, from Man’s point of view, that there were more negative stories that they were having to absorb than positive ones. Obviously the opening-up to Americans was the most controversial one. I think everyone agrees that was really pushed through by Man themselves. They spent £25m over 18 years they must have felt, ‘Is it really worth the hassle?’ It could be that for Booker this is a really positive thing, having a chance to reboot. There’s a lot of speculation they might return to the UK and Commonwealth parameters.”At Curtis Brown, leading literary agent Jonny Geller said the news was not a huge shock. “I don’t know where the suggestion to open it up to become a global prize came from, but wherever it did, I think it was seen as a mistake and to have slightly backfired,” said Geller. “Everyone in publishing needs whatever help they can get to get books into people’s hands, and these prizes do that, so we all want it to work.”Former Booker judge Alex Clark said: “There’s also been a feeling that some of the glitz and hoopla gets in the way of celebrating the writing itself – perhaps a new sponsor might decide to dial some of that down.”The Man Group’s withdrawal comes after drinks company Baileys announced it would no longer solely sponsor the Women’s prize for fiction, later agreeing to remain with assistance from entertainment company Fremantle and NatWest bank.In response to the news, Joanna Prior, chair of the board of the Women’s prize, said corporate support was vital for literary awards: “Without corporate sponsorship, the work of bringing books into the lives of as many people as possible becomes ever harder.” Despite the new sponsor remaining a mystery, most agreed that the prize’s future was guaranteed. “It sounds like they already have someone lined up,” said one former publisher. “The Booker brand is still the Booker brand, the most famous prize in the English speaking language, full stop.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ead1d6402c2c9a2f09172b58fdcb7e44dce780a/0_291_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2310d79c97a4ee229f98f394324b22bd","title":"did you work for a uk high street chain that has closed","story":"For an upcoming project, we would like to hear from former workers of chain shops that shut about how it affected their livesWith thousands of high street shops closing over the last decade, communities have been rightly concerned about the decline and what the future holds.If you worked for a high street chain that shut down, we’d like to hear from you.

An inidual’s chances in life varied greatly depending on there they lived.In particular, the erosion of the UK’s manufacturing base – further and faster than in other countries – had “destroyed the economic foundations of many communities, leaving them struggling to find a new role in the world. This has fuelled feelings of political alienation and, many would argue, lies behind the support for Brexit in so many disadvantaged communities”.Among the 29 recommendations, the report says Labour should supplement national support for training and skills by earmarking a substantial proportion of the replacement of EU structural funds for skills development in less prosperous local economies and also exploit any freedom offered by Brexit to set state aid rules that would lead to a better balanced economy.“In government, Labour has the chance to make a big difference to Britain’s fractured economy and to narrow the differences in prosperity between regions and local areas across the country,” it said.“In doing so it can restore hope to communities that presently feel left behind and ease the pressure on the most congested parts of London and the south-east where the growth of the economy and population is outstripping the ability of infrastructure and the housing market to cope.”Britain’s north-south ide has been widening for many decades and the Sheffield Hallam team warned that Labour should not expect rapid change overnight. Reversing the polarisation between the rich and poor parts of the country was a task that needed to be sustained for years across more than one parliament.“But there should never be any doubt that change is possible. Indeed, the long history of UK regional policy shows that in the absence of substantial regeneration efforts over the years the economies in much of the North, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would be in a far, far worse state than at present. Regional and local economic development policies do work – they just take time,” the report said.Long-Bailey said: “There is something fundamentally wrong when the fifth richest country in the world has the highest level of regional inequality in the whole of Europe. While some areas of the UK are doing well, vast swathes of the country are being held back with lower wages, lower output, higher unemployment and weaker local economies.“This report provides a detailed analysis of the UK’s regional problem and we will look closely at the recommendations as we seek to build on our existing policies to rebalance Britain.’’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3821194326263e6fde7a17bbf7cc214bb584e81c/0_23_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fde0cd3c99cb181d4b27421976e7e0e4","title":"no deal brexit price rises retailers sainsburys asda ms coop","story":"Bosses of Sainsbury’s, Asda, M\u0026ampS, Co-op and Waitrose write letter to governmentLeading retail bosses, including the chief executives of Sainsbury’s, Asda, Marks \u0026amp Spencer, the Co-op and Waitrose, have written to the government warning of significant disruption to food supplies in the event of a no-deal Brexit.The letter, from the British Retail Consortium, also warns that grocery prices are likely to rise, as nearly a third of the food eaten in Britain comes from the EU and would be subject to import tariffs if the UK exits without a trade deal in place.“We are extremely concerned that our customers will be among the first to experience the realities of a no-deal Brexit,” said the letter, which is signed by the retail trade body and 10 leading store bosses.“We anticipate significant risks to maintaining the choice, quality and durability of food that our customers have come to expect in our stores, and there will be inevitable pressure on food prices from higher transport costs, currency devaluation and tariffs.”The letter comes before another crucial day in parliament on Tuesday, as MPs vote on a series of amendments to Theresa May’s Brexit plan.The retailers expressed particular concern about fresh foods, saying it is “impossible” to stockpile fresh produce, such as salad leaves and fresh fruit. The retail bosses – who include the Sainsbury’s chief executive, Mike Coupe the Asda chief executive, Roger Burnley and the Marks \u0026amp Spencer CEO, Steve Rowe as well as the heads of the Co-op, Waitrose, Costcutter, KFC UK, Pret a Manger, Lidl and McDonald’s – said retailers typically store no more than two weeks’ stock.They said that “as prudent businesses” they are stockpiling in order to be prepared for no deal but with frozen and chilled storages nearing capacity, there is very little general warehousing space available in the UK.“While we have been working closely with our suppliers on contingency plans, it is not possible to mitigate all the risks to our supply chains and we fear significant disruption in the short-term as a result if there is no Brexit deal,” the letter said.“For consumers, this will reduce the availability and shelf life of many products in our stores,” the letter said.The letter emerged after the British Chambers of Commerce said that thousands of the firms it represented had already triggered contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit, including proposals to move operations out of the UK.A study by the advisory firm KPMG also found British firms are “praying for an extension to article 50” rather than face a no-deal Brexit as it emerged that foreign investment had fallen steeply and the outlook for growth had slumped to a six-year low."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bf1b26d49cd484595e5b1351cf18580ae1e980a/0_0_3713_2228/master/3713.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62d5fc105d30725c5d37d8ae88394aef","title":"tesco jobs fresh food counters supermarket  staff","story":"Supermarket says it hopes to redeploy up to half of staff affected by cost-cuttingTesco has confirmed that up to 9,000 jobs are at risk as it closes fresh food counters in about 90 of its stores, as well as some staff canteens, and makes cuts at its head office.The retailer, which has more than 300,000 UK employees and more than 3,400 stores, said it hoped to redeploy up to half of the staff affected into other customer service roles.Jason Tarry, the chief executive of Tesco’s UK and Irish business, said the market remained challenging and Tesco needed to adapt to remain competitive: “We’re making changes to our UK stores and head office to simplify what we do and how we do it, so we’re better able to meet the needs of our customers.”He said shoppers had less time to spend and so were using fresh food counters less frequently. Fish, meat and other fresh food counters will close in about 90 stores but remain trading in 700 more. Tesco said it did not plan any significant changes to its in-store bakeries this year.Staff canteens, which provide hot food in about a third of Tesco stores, are to be closed and replaced by self-service kitchen areas.The company, Britain’s biggest retailer, said it was also moving to a simpler and leaner structure at its head office.Pauline Foulkes, national officer for the Usdaw union, which represents thousands of Tesco staff, said: “Staff at Tesco are shocked and dismayed by the scale of yet another round of potential job losses, which clearly demonstrates the pressure retailers are under in the current very difficult and uncertain economic climate, as the cost-cutting continues. “This is devastating news for staff, who have played a crucial role in Tesco’s turnaround project, contributing to 12 successive quarters of growth, solid Christmas trading and over £1bn of profit.”The cuts are part of a plan to slash £1.5bn from Tesco’s cost base as the chief executive, Dave Lewis, tries to rebuild profits, which have never recovered from an accounting scandal in 2014. The company is also trying to simplify and cut costs to help it fight back against the discounters Aldi and Lidl, which are taking an increasing share of the market.Since Lewis took over five years ago, he has cut thousands of jobs. This time last year 1,700 employees were affected when Tesco stripped out a layer of middle management. It has also closed its Cardiff call centre, with the loss of 1,100 jobs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/936cb826e8c24b5b3a68de390b645b0695f0efaa/0_379_4146_2488/master/4146.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d31eae56dba1e81d86b01c2cfdff72a","title":"mugged by macaques the urban monkey gangs of kuala lumpur","story":"The next 15 megacities #10: As Malaysia’s ever-expanding capital swallows up their rainforest habitat, the macaques are turning to guerrilla warfare by  Jamie Fullerton in Kuala LumpurThe gang stop and stare, attention spiked by our car doors slamming. Ten pairs of eyes flit between our backpacks and our faces. Is it worth mugging us? Do our bags contain bananas or useless, inedible wallets and cameras? The monkeys of Kuala Lumpur’s Ampang district decide against it and head further down the road in the hunt for victims. The morning joggers here run with sticks.“Twenty years ago this was jungle,” says Viswa Hattan, an accountant jogging in the area. Gated high-rises loom ahead of us, the roads leading to them flanked by forest too dense to enter without machetes. Four macaques, babies clinging to their chests, loiter on a metal road barrier uphill from a construction site. “This was their area,” says Hattan as a nearby male macaque begins vigorously masturbating. “We’ve taken it from them.”By 2035 another 15 cities will have populations above 10 million, according to the latest United Nations projections, taking the total number of megacities to 48.

The long-tailed macaques, though, have stayed, with the city’s growing human population providing them with a tempting source of thrown-away food.In 1980 the (human) population of Kuala Lumpur was less than 1 million it is now estimated at 7.6 million, and United Nations projections suggest it will surpass 10 million by 2032. While some of that growth has been in the central city zone, in massive structures such as the 90s-built Petronas Towers, the most rampant expansion has been at the outskirts of the city and in the surrounding lush forest.At suburban campuses such as that of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), complaints of messy monkey bin raids are rife. “They chase lecturers to the toilets,” says Prof Siti Aminah Osman, a deputy dean, as she stifles a laugh. In 2015 students mixed shrimp paste, spicy chilli and peanuts to feed the monkeys, to repel them. Now staff are working on “anti-monkey bins” with heavy lids.In KL Forest Eco Park, a slab of city-centre rainforest protected as a reserve since 1906, the macaque population is celebrated via cartoons on information boards. At Batu Caves, a popular Hindu temple site in north Kuala Lumpur, monkeys probably attract more tourists than the site’s enormous gold-painted statues. The caves back on to jungle, and the macaques crowd the area’s garishly painted staircase, swiping bags and creating top content for vloggers.Sethu Pathy, Batu Caves’ secretary, says the monkeys here rely on tourists for food, seemingly abandoning jungle foraging for a diet of chewing gum, stolen flower necklaces and hurled fruit. He supports his claim by lobbing bananas on the ground, causing a monkey melee before a macaque tips over a full cup of coffee left on a table. On the stairs, a monkey scoops its hand into a splatter pool of brown human vomit, then licks it clean.“Now we can’t see elephants or tigers in this district,” says Pathy, as the banana supply ends and the monkeys move off to explore nearby wheelie bins. “Day by day, land is being cleared for housing and factories. Natural habitats have been disposed of, but monkeys are still around. We occupied their habitat.”It is not all happy monkey families in the caves. Pathy says locals complain about the macaques stealing from them, and that eight years ago the Malaysian government’s wildlife department relocated many monkeys from the site to the forest.Around that time the department, reacting to complaints from the public about macaques across the peninsula, got tough. More than 57,000 long-tailed macaques were culled in Malaysia in 2010 – double the number from the year before. The figure rose above 97,000 in 2012, prompting a backlash from animal rights groups who claimed monkeys were sometimes shot out of trees, or captured in cages before being shot.With an average of 3,800 complaints from the public about long-tailed macaques made nationwide every year, the wildlife department’s culls have continued, with up to 70,000 of the animals killed annually between 2013 and 2016. The department declined to speak to the  but Ahmad Ismail, a biology professor at Universiti Putra Malaysia and president of the Malaysian Nature Society, says culling has been reduced over the past couple of years.Animal rights groups such as Sahabat Alam Malaysia have called for monkeys to be sterilised rather than culled, but although the wildlife department has experimented with castrating macaques, mass sterilisation would be very expensive. Ismail believes that focusing efforts on educating humans about interacting with monkeys is the most realistic way of reducing conflict between the species.Organisations including the Malaysia Nature Society already organise talks in schools about behaving around monkeys. Prof Badrul Munir of the UKM’s School of Environmental and Natural Resource Sciences says that if enough people refrain from feeding macaques where they congregate, the snack association eventually fades and they harass humans less.Whether monkey handouts decline or not, with Kuala Lumpur’s population due to surpass 10 million within 15 years, its human and its monkey residents look likely to have to share more and more living space. Many people in Malaysia are hoping for a future in which slightly fewer monkeys chase lecturers into toilet blocks, harass joggers and steal confidential military documents from postmen.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, explore our archive or sign up to receive our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f066fed4d31e4ac422b97b9ebc1db16b9ac5714/0_50_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f0c7b4559f7eb4dd39ed2b918974cd9","title":"parliamentary system tories stifle brexit debate","story":"The government has used every knavish trick against its opponents. Let’s hope Tuesday’s vote can be a breakthroughOur winner-takes-all parliamentary system isn’t fit for purpose. It is failing the nation at a moment of true crisis. It builds in ision and prevents compromise. It leads ministers to believe in their ine right to govern unimpeded, because only the government gets precedence for its business only a minister can raise a tax or spend money and only a minister can determine when there will be a vote or even if there will be a vote.Paradoxically, despite the fact that this is a minority government, no modern predecessor enjoyed such an agglomeration of power. Prime ministers used to resign if they lost a vote on a major policy. But Theresa May ploughs on regardless of the largest defeat in history on her only policy.The Fixed-term Parliaments Act has made things worse. In the past the government would have given time for virtually any motion of no confidence – and would have declared key votes as proxy confidence votes. Now it refuses to do so unless it is couched in the precise terms of the act, which means it is impossible for the Commons to remove a prime minister without calling for an election. If that had been the rule in 1940, Churchill would never have become prime minister.The list of undemocratic parliamentary shenanigans engaged in by the government since 2010 would make a Tudor or a Stuart blush. By royal decree it has repeatedly extended the parliamentary session way beyond its normal one-year life . That has allowed it to slash the number of days available to the opposition, because standing orders only guarantee 20 days “a session” rather than a year. The last such day was in November – and there won’t be another until Brexit is done. When the government thinks it is going to lose, it either pulls the vote at the last minute (as it did in December) or it refuses to vote and simply ignores the unanimous view of the house. When it tried the same trick over the attorney general’s legal advice, the house found the government in contempt of parliament, something that has never happened before. That’s not all. Committee places are normally allocated in proportion to the numbers in the house, but the government has suspended the rules so that even though it doesn’t have a majority in the house, it does have a majority on every committee.Most perniciously of all, it has dramatically extended the unofficial payroll. The Ministerial and Other Salaries Act only allows 95 MPs to be ministers, but the government benches now include 39 parliamentary private secretaries, 20 trade envoys and 10 party vice chairs. For the first time in history more than half the governing party owes a debt to the prime minister – and that’s before you consider the knighthoods, the privy councillorships, the dinners at Chequers and the other baubles. That doesn’t sound like a free parliament.Sometimes we have confounded its knavish tricks. It wanted to Brexit without reference to parliament. Gina Miller saw that one off. It wanted parliament only to consider vacuous, “neutral” and therefore unamendable motions. Dominic Grieve slew that one.On Tuesday the Commons has a chance to open a tiny chink in the armour of autocracy. Of course there is only one person who can negotiate with the EU – the prime minister – and naturally the government should have the lion’s share of legislative time. But don’t believe the howls of anguish from the government about the amendments tabled by Yvette Cooper and Grieve. All they do is guarantee the Commons a few days – think of them as opposition days – to consider how to move forward in the absence of proposals or leadership from the prime minister. The government can, if it wants, table amendments of its own on those days.Whatever anyone thinks about Brexit, we have to make parliament fit for purpose. Otherwise we shall never unite the nation. If the government had any sense it would sit on its hands on Tuesday and let the Commons take back control (just a bit).• Chris Bryant is Labour MP for Rhondda"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06ec7f704767a3b813dd88c356eefac31807fc95/0_159_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0f7768b70ee3073355d45c36a061b20","title":"red panda loose belfast irish border","story":"Just let that sentence sit there for a moment. A panda. Loose. In Belfast. It’s impossible to hear it and not imagine the inevitable animated DreamWorks movie that will come out of this: a pampered red panda (voiced by Liam Neeson or Jamie Dornan, whoever’s available) dreams of seeing the “real” Northern Ireland. With the help of a tapir with moxie from the Republic of Ireland (played by Sharon Horgan or Saoirse Ronan), the two bust out of their enclosure, much to the anger of the evil British zookeeper (Tom HiddlestonMark Rylance), and lead the police on a merry march through Belfast’s most iconic sights (the Samson and Goliath cranes, the Titanic quarter, inexplicably the Giant’s Causeway even though it’s an hour’s drive away).Eventually Red Panda and Tapir end up in the middle of an Orange Order parade, defuse an escalating argument between Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill, restore the Stormont government and solve the 250-year-old crisis of sectarianism in Northern Ireland. Red Panda and Tapir realise that they actually love each other because there’s no such thing as a platonic heterosexual relationship in these films, and their panda-pir hybrid cub ends up being elected first minister of Northern Ireland.In reality, the red panda was found a while later in a residential garden near the zoo, where we can only assume it was trying to break into a garage to hotwire a car and drive up the Causeway coastal route. According to an exceptionally sarcastic police force, the panda spent most of its few hours of freedom taking in the sights of “beautiful Glengormley”. Now I’ve been to Glengormley a few times and, while I love bowling at the sportsbowl and getting a well-priced Chinese takeaway from Antrim Road as much as the next panda, I feel like it could have got a bus into the botanical gardens and made a day of it.There are still so many questions that need to be answered. How did the red panda escape? Did it visit Shankill Road? Did it go into a Catholic church? Does this panda adhere to the theory of transubstantiation? Did the panda interact in any way with a union jack while it was free? All I know for certain is, after months of ill-informed and arrogant British politicians wading into the debate on the Irish border, this is a news story involving Northern Ireland that I can get behind. After all, if we’re going to talk uninformed bollocks about the lives of nearly two million people in the newspapers, we might as well chuck a red panda in there to make it a bit more fun. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to call up DreamWorks and pitch “Panda-monium in Norn Iron” (working title).• Jack Bernhardt is a writer and occasional performer.

After the 2017 general election, Tusk discussed reversing Brexit. He said: “The European Union was built on dreams that seemed impossible”, and then quoted John Lennon’s Imagine, adding, “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I am not the only one.” But is the EU serious about this? Have Brussels and member states really thought things through?Stopping Brexit would almost certainly require a new referendum. Let’s put aside the fact there seems no clear parliamentary path to a second referendum at present (even if Jeremy Corbyn backed it, my Open Europe colleague Dominic Walsh believes it’s well short of a majority). Let’s assume the EU agreed to extend article 50 beyond June to make time for a referendum (something ex-European Council president Herman Van Rompuy and the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt both oppose). And let’s assume the ballot paper offers a choice of leaving the EU with Theresa May’s deal or remain (and so MPs have ensured no deal is not an option). Even if those hurdles were to be overcome, while some polls have shown small leads for remain, it’s impossible to know which way a second referendum would go – a fact often overlooked by advocates of a so-called people’s vote, who seem to forget that people voted the other way last time.Many Europeans may well be delighted if the UK voted to remain in a new referendum. Almost no one in the EU wanted Brexit, and many see in it a profound challenge to the project itself. There is a small contingent in Brussels who spied an opportunity to accelerate the path to closer union without the recalcitrant UK. But for most in EU institutions and member states, the reaction to the 2016 referendum was sorrow and disappointment.Yet there is concern among some members and in Brussels that if the UK voted to stay in after a second referendum, it could become a rather unstable member. There are worries there would be demands for yet another vote – a best of three. Or that a future government could simply take the UK out without a referendum at all (precisely what Labour’s 1983 manifesto committed to do, less than a decade after our 1975 referendum on membership). And above all there are major concerns about how the UK would behave in the EU, particularly if it was dealing with widespread domestic discord due to a perceived “establishment” betrayal of Brexit.There are already jokes in Brussels that the UK could elect 73 Nigel Farages if it took part in the European elections in May. But if the UK voted narrowly to remain in the EU, what would its ministers do in the EU council? Some member states are worried we could become very difficult partners, adding to their existing problems with Hungary, Poland and, to some extent, Italy.Of course, a second referendum could well go the same way as the first. And there’s been much less focus given to this. On the continent, the dominant narrative is that voters were lied to in 2016 and the facts about Brexit have only become clear since. As President Macron put it last September, Brexit was “a choice pushed by those who predicted easy solutions … they are liars”. He went on to warn: “It’s not so easy to leave the EU.” But if the UK voted again to leave, this argument would be holed below the waterline. And if the new remain campaign sought to focus on the benefits of EU membership rather than the economic risks of leaving, a new vote to leave would indicate a more definitive rejection. The campaign couldn’t even rely on David Cameron’s renegotiation – which fell away after the leave vote in 2016.In 2016, Cameron’s team were desperate to dissuade European figures from campaigning in Britain. Who could stop them this time? And it’s not as if the public’s image of Brussels has improved. From Jean-Claude Juncker’s bizarre hair-flicking antics to his silly comments that “English is losing importance” in Europe, it would be easy to see how personal things could turn. Since the 2016 vote, we have also seen a series of demands for more European integration – including in areas such as defence – for which there is no UK appetite. And while there are a few impressive MPs pushing for a second vote, the danger is that a new remain campaign would be dominated by its highest-profile backer, Tony Blair – with all the baggage that he brings.A new referendum still doesn’t seem likely. As a European diplomat put it to me, they are certainly “not putting their eggs” in that basket. They’re right not to – but not just because it seems unlikely. A second referendum would pose “formidable risks” for the UK, but also for the EU. The EU can clearly weather Brexit, but a second referendum campaign would likely be far more damaging, whichever way it went. It offers no safe path out of the current impasse. And so, member states should reflect carefully on how best to address the concerns of parliamentarians about the current agreement and decide what concessions can be made to get this deal over the line.• Henry Newman is the director of Open Europe.

I spent a summer season in the kitchen of a restaurant in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, when I was 18 and had the time of my life. The people, the countryside, the food, I loved it all, and I’ve longed to go back ever since. Last year, I finally returned on an epic six-week food tour of the country.When you think of Canada, I guess you think of mountains, forest, and bears, right? That’s only half the story, but it’s true: the country has a vast natural beauty on a scale we just don’t see in Europe. As I travelled all over, Canada’s vistas constantly stopped me in my tracks. Just when you think you have seen it all – “Nothing, surely, can top Lake Louise, this has to be Canada’s most breathtaking spot!” – two days later you’re on a ranch in Alberta, riding a stallion, hearing about a cougar or a grizzly bear sighting nearby. Canada makes you look at the world through the eyes of a child. Constantly fascinated, completely immersed.The wildlife I expected, what I was not prepared for was how vibrant and unique Canada’s cities are, and the rich foodie scene that each deserves to be proud of.Time and time again I experienced cultural centres humming and sparkling with the day-to-day life of food shopping, eating out or grabbing a coffee. I was astonished and delighted by the quality of the markets and shops, and Canada’s incredibly strong field-to-plate movement, which ensures the freshest, tastiest raw ingredients. Below are a few of my culinary highlights from the trip.Montréal is a befuddling enclave of Francophone culture in this mainly English-speaking country. The city practically fizzes with fierce French passion and values, which you can’t help but be charmed by. I fell in love with its French-style model economy of independent boulangerie, boucher and pâtisserie.Montréal to me was more than just foodie heaven, it was a blueprint for how a city could be. It’s a city that cares about the little things, such as bookshops, delicatessens, decent coffee and croissants the provenance of goods, and the importance of heritage. Montréal is full of independent shops that have been around for generations. From opening their doors every morning to closing at night, they are committed to the simple idea of creating just one thing of value – a coffee or a salt beef sandwich – and taking enjoyment and pride in the “means”.The aforementioned perfect salt beef sandwich was enjoyed at one of Montréal’s ultimate foodie landmarks, Schwartz’s. The smoked-meat experts have been trading on Saint-Laurent Boulevard since 1928, when established by Jewish immigrant Reuben Schwartz. Unlike many places, Schwartz’s still smokes its meat the old-fashioned way: with a 10-day marinade and then an eight-hour smoke before it’s sliced in front of your eyes. Frank Silva, the manager, has worked here since he was a boy, something I found time and again in Montréal. In an age when there is often little customer or staff loyalty to establishments, I found it truly enchanting.The city also lays claim to the world’s best bagel – or, rather, two of the world’s best. Locally, it is considered an undisputed fact that you won’t find a better bagel than the ones made here, but the jury is very much out over which Montréal institution is superior: St-Viateur Bagel or Fairmont Bagel. Some favour St-Viateur for the honey water they boil their bagels in, while Fairmont is so in demand it stays open 24 hours a day. Both, to me, were perfection – yet another example of the city’s impassioned, artisanal approach to food.Halifax, the capital of Nova Scotia, has a kicking live music scene, along with a fabulous market culture. The city’s Seaport Farmers’ Market on the waterfront is the oldest continuously operating farmers’ market in North America, the hub for a long list of cheese makers, fruit and vegetable producers, and wine growers from the plentiful farms in the nearby Annapolis valley. At the stall for That Dutchman’s Cheese Farm, I sampled Dragon’s Breath – one of the stinkiest, creamiest, most kick-ass blue cheeses you could imagine.But it is Halifax’s craft beer scene that rivals anything I’ve seen anywhere else. At the Good Robot Brewing Co, the female brew team of Erica Fraser and Kelly Costello create beers with locally foraged herbs and medicinal plants. The list of brews is extensive – on reflection, I may have investigated it a little too thoroughly.And the restaurants also punch way above their weight. I found classic comfort food at 2 Doors Down, where the braised Prince Edward Island beef short rib is knockout, while Halifax’s privileged coastal position also makes it a hotspot for seafood.Ontario in east-central Canada is the province I have spent the most time in over the years, since working here as a teen, and it still feels like a home away from home. Capital city Toronto is such an enthralling city, with so much going on. What sets it apart from other cities is the sheer wealth of its ethnic communities happily living and eating together. It is one of the world’s most multicultural cities – in fact, a survey by BBC Radio named it the most erse, ahead even of London. Just over half of its residents are foreign-born, hailing from 230 different nationalities. This shows in the food scene, a heavyweight collection of authentic ethnic cuisines alongside young chefs developing and modernising traditional flavours.Here, I had stand-out Indian and Vietnamese, while Mexican food is on the rise in a big way. My favourite restaurant, and the one that sums this all up, was Snack Bar 416 (pictured above). A small hipster joint near bohemian Kensington Market, it uses all the city’s main ethnic communities as inspiration, taking one hero dish from each cuisine. Often when this pick-and-mix approach is attempted it falls flat on its face, with compromise and inexperience resulting in bland creations. Not here, not in Toronto.One of the best ways to take the culinary temperature of a city is to see how its various establishments serve brunch. I hit two spots and became addicted to Chambar on the edge of Gastown, the hipster area of the city, and the waffle heaven of Medina, which served incredible dishes with imagination and attention to detail. And then came the holy grail: a killer cup of coffee. Revolver, again in Gastown, is the coffee shop St Peter would open outside the pearly gate. Trust me.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/597305e020ab2ad32cb503da49f25aff335f0cf4/0_432_5197_3118/master/5197.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a048cd5a81fdd7e6e30a6f0caf192af1","title":"the lowdown on nova scotia canadas seaside paradise","story":"Sandy beaches, snug harbours and (possibly) the best lobster roll in the world.

Kat’s Lobster Shack in Barrington). It is also one of Canada’s premier wine regions, with no fewer than 18 vineyards and wineries. The Wolfville Magic Winery Bus is the first of its kind in North America, a hop-on, hop-off bus tour of five scenic and storied wineries in the Annapolis Valley.The Nova Scotia lobster and chowder trails will spoil you with remarkably fresh seafood, offering the most authentic boat-to-table experience possible – from lobster dinners to hearty chowder and everything in between.And you can’t visit the region without trying the donair (a pitta filled with roasted shaved beef, tomatoes and onions, slathered in a sweet, garlic sauce). Go directly to the source: King Of Donair in Halifax, Nova Scotia’s capital and the biggest city in Atlantic Canada. Enjoy seaside dining at The Bicycle Thief, located on the thriving, ever-developing waterfront locals love the tuna carpaccio and meatballs stuffed with fior di latte mozzarella. The Wooden Monkey, meanwhile, is a sustainability-minded, award-winning eatery that prides itself on sourcing almost all of its ingredients, produce and drinks locally. Visit its Dartmouth location across the harbour for stunning views of the Halifax skyline, afterwards visit Edna in Halifax’s booming North End is great for tapas and cocktails.Nearby is Peggy’s Cove, one of the province’s most popular and most photographed destinations, thanks to its famous lighthouse and breathtaking coastal views. Enjoy the Oceanstone Resort’s Ultimate Lobster Feast and Peggy’s Cove Adventure, where the resort’s executive chef guides you as you choose your own lobster from Ryer’s Lobster Pound, and after experiencing Peggy’s Cove and craft beer tasting, feast on lobster at sunset.In September, Halifax hosts the FIN: Atlantic International Film Festival celebrating both local and international film-makers. Then, in October, 150 musicians, comedians and speakers come together for the Halifax Pop Explosion, showcasing emerging music and art. A popular draw in the summer, the Halifax Jazz Festival, the oldest in Atlantic Canada, attracts some of the best musicians in the world to a city-wide extravaganza.One of Nova Scotia’s most famous artists is Maud Lewis (played by Sally Hawkins in the award-winning 2016 film Maudie), many of whose naïve, child-like paintings depict rural Nova Scotia. Her work is on display at the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia. The province is also home to a rich and erse cultural heritage, including Mi’kmaq and First Nations, African Nova Scotian, Acadian and Celtic and Gaelic peoples, all of whom have shaped Nova Scotia’s story.There are many museums dotted around the province that bring to life the story of all these peoples. You can find out about African Nova Scotians at the Black Loyalist Heritage Centre in Birchtown on the South Shore – it takes visitors through the journey of early black settlers in Nova Scotia. And discover the history of the Acadian people – descendants from the French settlers – at the Grand-Pré national historic site and at Le Village Historique Acadien de la Nouvelle-Écosse. While, the Highland Village Museum is a living history museum and cultural centre that celebrates the Gaelic experience in Nova Scotia.The Bay of Fundy boasts the highest tides in the world – around 16 metres – and thanks to the Tidal Bore Rafting Resort you can – literally – ride that wave. The Shubenacadie River (don’t worry, the locals just call it “Shubie”) is known for its beauty and for regular sightings of bald eagles. Unforgettably, you can enjoy a seafood and wine tasting on a sandbar before 160bn tonnes of water fill up the estuary.Kejimkujik national park and national historic site is a special place to experience the outdoors with great camping, canoeing and hiking opportunities. Also, learn about the Mi’kmaq, a founding people of Nova Scotia and, to this day, the biggest indigenous group in the province. Hear their stories, see ancient petrogylphs (carvings in stone) and a re-created Mi’kmaw encampment, and paddle the ancient waterways.Biking is another great way to see the province. Train Station Bike \u0026amp Bean in St. Margaret’s Bay is a hidden gem where you can rent a bicycle and enjoy a magnificent ride along the Rum Runners Trail on a former railbed. You will get to see several seaside communities along the South Shore, including Mahone Bay and Chester all the way to Lunenburg.The world-famous Cabot Trail winds its way around and through Cape Breton Highlands national park the 185-mile loop is one of Canada’s genuine wonders. Save a few days to drive around and enjoy the cultural heritage sites and scenic coastal viewpoints. Leave time, though, to hike one of the many trails such as Skyline or Franey in the national park for glimpses of moose, bald eagles and other wildlife.While summer and autumn are the most popular times to visit, there’s plenty to enjoy all year round. The White Point Beach Resort is one of Nova Scotia’s four-season jewels. Enjoy the miles of pure white sand beach in the summer and cozy up to an inviting fireplace next to windows overlooking the ocean during the winter. June to September is whale-watching season head to Brier Island or Cape Breton for the best views.Many trails are open year-round, such as Rogart Mountain Trail in Earltown, ideal for winter snowshoeing and summer hiking. The trail climbs to the summit of Rogart Mountain, which offers spectacular views. After enjoying the trail, stop at Sugar Moon Farm to savour their signature pancakes topped with sweet maple syrup produced on site.Halifax is also home to one of the most architecturally impressive libraries in the world, a Titanic exhibit at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic (the survivors went to New York some of those who died came to Halifax), an impressive waterfront boardwalk, all matter of dining options and stellar art galleries.

Now she’s in a brutal sex-trafficking drama and speaking out about skin lightening and shortsighted directorsFreida Pinto’s role in her new film Love Sonia is shocking. She plays a desperate sex worker in a brutal tale of trafficking. Rashmi is complex, edgy and selfish – everything you wouldn’t expect of a Pinto character. After all, the Indian actor, who made her name in Danny Boyle’s phenomenally successful Slumdog Millionaire, has spent much of her career playing eye candy. And she is sick of it.Love Sonia is relentless. A debt-ridden father sells his teenage daughter Preeti to a landlord, who then trafficks her to a brothel in Mumbai. Her sister Sonia, brilliantly played by newcomer Mrunal Thakur, goes in search of her, and is also ensnared in the trafficking web. She is anally raped to preserve her value as a virgin. Having lost her virginity, she is stitched so she can once again be sold as untouched. Just when you think things can’t get worse, they do.Pinto’s older sex worker appears to befriend Sonia, but ultimately betrays her to protect herself. This is a world without love or loyalty and reflects a stark reality. Last year, India was named the most dangerous country for women in terms of human trafficking, by a Thomson Reuters Foundation survey of 550 experts on women’s issues. Love Sonia has been 10 years in the making. Pinto was first shown an early version of the script by director Tabrez Noorani the day after she finished shooting Slumdog Millionaire. Noorani, a line producer on Slumdog Millionaire, wrote Love Sonia after helping to rescue trafficked women from brothels. But it took another decade to finesse the script, get financial backing and find the right Sonia.After Slumdog Millionaire, in which Pinto played Latika, a street kid described as “the most beautiful girl in the world”, she was keen for a more demanding role. But in hindsight, she says she wasn’t ready for Love Sonia. She was too unworldly. “I thought it was exaggerated when I read the script. I couldn’t believe what I was reading.” Later, when she met trafficked sex workers advising on the film, she began to think that, if anything, the story had been understated. She winces when she recalls a question she asked one of them. “I said: ‘Hypothetically speaking, if you had a chance to leave this world, let’s say you fell in love and found somebody who’d treat you right for once, would you escape?’ And she said to me: ‘Madam, love only exists in your world. In my world, there is just betrayal.’”The trajectory of Pinto’s career in the years after Slumdog certainly didn’t suggest she would ever make a hard-hitting film about sex trafficking. Time after time, she played the vapid love interest, characters so underwritten that they struggled to be one-dimensional. So in Woody Allen’s You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger, Josh Brolin’s author, Roy, spends his time staring longingly out of the window at Pinto’s Dia in the flat opposite. When he confesses this to her, she says: “I’ve always wanted to be someone’s muse.” In Terence Mallick’s Knight of Cups, she is a pouting femme fatale who states: “I don’t want to wreak havoc in men’s lives any more.” In Miral, directed by Julian Schnabel, she plays a Palestinian heroine whose boyfriend tells her she has “beautiful eyes”, while an Israeli interrogator tells her: “You have a beautiful face … you won’t recognise it when you get out of here.” Some of the world’s best-known directors have been so fixated on her looks that they forgot to create a character for her. “They couldn’t go past what they saw on the outside,” Pinto says. “And that’s their problem, not mine, right, because I know what I can bring to the table as talent.”It has been a strange, decade-long career, including an unexplained extended break. Meanwhile, off-screen she has been an assertive force for good, consistently campaigning for the rights of women. Does she see a contradiction between her feminism and the films she has made? “Completely! There was no way I agreed with so much that I did in my early career.” Pinto takes me through some of her experiences, with jaw-dropping honesty. She loved working with Brolin on the Allen film (“Josh taught me to relax because I would get really worked up before each take – I was too nervous to breathe and my body would stiffen”), but has nothing positive to say of her part. “I was just the muse, the ingenue.” Would she work again with Allen, who has been accused by his daughter Dylan of sexual assault (an allegation he denies)? “No. Absolutely not. I wouldn’t work with him because I’m in solidarity with women who have come out with their stories, whether they are proven or not. I’m just going to stick to what my gut instinct tells me. I’m 34 years old, I’ve worked for 11 years in this industry, I’m not desperate and I will never be desperate.”Then it is on to another unhappy experience, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, made in 2011. Pinto was looking forward to playing a smart, independent-minded primatologist. But it didn’t work out that way. “I felt completely undermined as the only female perfomer in the film who wasn’t given a task other than to be a primatologist in frickin’ high heels and follow the men around. Have you seen Jane Goodall wearing high heels and running on the Golden Gate Bridge? I don’t think so. I spoke to one of the producers and asked why I was put in high heels because it didn’t make sense for my character – if she was so hands-on with animals, she needed freedom of movement and her body language needed to be different. I wish I’d been more confident in putting my case forward back then, but I remember asking him what his reference was and I was told Megan Fox from Transformers and I was like – that is a completely different film.” Again, she doesn’t write off the experience – she got to work with some of her favourite actors, including Andy Serkis and John Lithgow – but she does write off her role in the film.Pinto is not finished yet. Now we are on to Black Gold, a historical epic about the scramble for oil in the Arabian desert in the 1920s. “In Black Gold, what was I? Like a princess who had no say, who was just in love … I can’t even remember the story, that’s how bad it is.” And she is really trying hard to remember her character now. “Oh my God! What was my role? I have no frickin clue! Oh my God, that’s terrible.” In 30 years of interviewing, I have never heard somebody trash their career so comprehensively – or honestly.Pinto is on a brief visit to Britain from Los Angeles, where she now lives, to promote Love Sonia. We meet at the central London hotel where she is staying. She arrives quietly, orders a camomile tea and gets on with it. Pinto is, of course, gorgeous slightly built, but strong-looking. She is also bright, intense and combative. In her tracksuit top and bottoms and surprisingly large trainers (size eight and a half), she resembles a Hollywood action hero. Her accent is a weird global confection – cut-glass English, Indian, American, with an upward Aussie inflection. She says people tell her she sounds South African.Pinto was born in Mumbai (then still Bombay) to Mangalorean Catholics – her mother was a school principal, her father a bank manager. She went to convent school and was a confident, outspoken girl. She says she soon felt stymied by the dogma of the church. “I was 13 or 14 when I heard a priest talk about homosexuality in a sermon. He asked us to pray for them through this illness, this sickness, what they’re going through, hoping that they would come out the other side, finding the answer in Jesus. After mass, I questioned him. I said: ‘What makes you think it’s an illness?’”Her parents worried that she was too opinionated, and she admits at times she was. “I was very candid a bit too honest. When I was six or seven years old, there was this young boy, probably about 16, who sang a Christmas carol during Sunday mass, and he was terrible. He came over to wish the family happy Christmas and I said: ‘Hey, you sang terribly at mass today, you shouldn’t sing.’ And my mum was like: ‘Oh my God, I’m so embarrassed, I’m so sorry that my daughter is so rude.’” Would she do that now? “Of course not because I’ve been told not to do it, or I’ll find a better way of putting it, but I was a bit too blunt as a child, and that was terrible. I hurt the poor boy’s feelings.” How did he react? “Apparently he was very upset. My mum told me he never sang again after that.”She studied English literature, and after graduating in 2005 went into modelling. Two years later, she was cast in Slumdog Millionaire, despite having no acting experience. The film won eight Oscars, including best picture and director. She and her co-star, British actor Dev Patel, were suddenly world famous. Everybody wanted a share of their fairytale – they became a couple in real life, and were together for six years. Pinto found herself in demand across the world – not just as an actor, but also to flog products. In 2009, she signed a lucrative contract to became the face of L’Oréal.Life really was amazing. “I was riding the waves and going to all the fashion weeks on the front row. And travelling first class, and holidays and blah blah blah. And every director I wanted to meet wanted to meet me too.”And then they offered her parts. And time after time they disappointed. For the first time in her life, she lost confidence. Did she feel exposed because she hadn’t trained as an actor? “Yes, I felt like people around me knew more how to do things. All I had was instinct. I lost the innocence that comes with confidence. The blind faith. Spontaneity.”Even the films she was proud of prompted uncomfortable questions – in Michael Winterbottom’s Trishna, based on Tess of the D’urbervilles, she wanted to know why she had to be so passive. When she was cast as the eponymous Palestinian heroine of Miral, she wondered why. “I worried that I wasn’t Arab enough to play the role, so how were they going to convince the audience?” Again, she stresses the positives – Schnabel treated her with respect and she learned about the politics of the Middle East. In Desert Dancer, she was cast as an Iranian, and again asked why. But she knew the answer really. “It’s the same reason Ridley Scott was questioned on why they had non-Egyptian actors playing Egyptian roles in Gods of Egypt. To get the film financed and sold, they came to the person they thought was closest to that culture. Having said that, Iran and India have nothing in common. We’re two different parts of the world.”Did she ever think of sticking two fingers up at the film industry and walking way? “Yeah, I did. And it cost me two and a half years. I didn’t work for two and a half years.” At 28, she says, she had an existential crisis. “I thought: is this something I really want to do, or am I just doing it because I got this amazing start to my career and now this is all I know how to do?”So she waited for a good job to come along. And waited. “I didn’t know if I’d ever get a job again because out of sight could be so out of mind.” Was she offered lots of roles? “Yes, but – trust me – they were not worth my time.” Does she regret turning any of them down? “No. The films were big, but the roles were not good enough to regret.”I ask if she ever struggled for money. “No, no. That was the saving grace. I had a lucrative brand endorsement deal – a seven-year contract that kept me afloat. I’m grateful to L’Oréal for ever.” In 2011, her L’Oréal contract came under scrutiny when it was suggested that the company had lightened her skin in a campaign. Had they Photoshopped the image? L’Oréal denies altering her skin tone but she says: “I’m sure they did, because that’s not the colour of my skin you saw in a few of the campaigns.” Did she complain? “I said to my agent after the first controversy that I would like to see the pictures before, and I would like to be able to question them on colour correction.” She also insisted on having a clause written into her contract. “All the brands, including L’Oréal, have a skin-lightening range that they sell in India and I made them put it in my contract that I would not touch that with a barge pole. If you don’t put it in your contract before you sign on, they can come and you will be compelled to do it.” After she protested about the skin-lightening, she says, it never happened again. (L’Oréal has been approached for a comment.) Pinto has lived in Los Angeles for nine years, and says she feels at home there her boyfriend, adventure photographer Cory Tran, is also LA-based. She often spends time in Mumbai, where her parents and sister still live.In 2017, she returned to the screen with Guerrilla, a TV drama about Britain’s black power movement. Pinto’s underground activist Jas Mitra was a formidable character, leading from the front. She says this was the start of her reinvention as an actor. At one point Jas says to one of the men in her life: “The first chance you get, you reduce me to my looks.” I tell her it feels personal – that it could be aimed at directors such as Allen or Mallick. “Yep!” she says, with a broad smile. She says that bit of dialogue was the result of a conversation she had with Guerrilla director John Ridley. “I talked to John about looks and how they hold people back and I told him how crazy it is to be a little fed up to be told you’re beautiful. I know I sound ungrateful, but I’m not. I’m very grateful for what I have, but I’m fed up of hearing other people tell me that or remind me of that.”As for now, Pinto could not be happier that nobody is likely to come out of Love Sonia discussing her looks. On its release in India, the film was not been warmly received. “People haven’t welcomed a film that exposes the underbelly of the country. It hasn’t done well.” But she says she is not going to judge the film’s success by its box-office takings – highlighting the trafficking scandal is far more important.In many ways, Pinto is just starting out as an actor – and still has much to prove. But despite everything she has said today, she insists there is nothing she would change. If she hadn’t done all the naff work, she says, she wouldn’t be where she is now – and it’s great to have got her existential crisis out of the way. “I’m glad the reality check happened. Now I think I can finally say I’ve figured things out for myself.”Love Sonia is on general release"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df20d3a1a74de7232b56845d773b80c3cdb2c43e/406_129_1597_958/master/1597.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81cd9ed93631d73d32f8823491eb4caa","title":"the lego movie 2 the second part review chris pratt","story":"Duplo figures from outer space threaten the world of Lego in a ceaselessly inventive, eyeball-popping, nonstop gag-stormThe second Lego Movie is even better than the original: a sophisticated new adventure that gives us a new look at how the universality of the Lego universe was more gendered than we thought. There’s hilarious voice-work artistry, ceaselessly inventive pop-culture riffs (“Ooooh – reference!” says someone), eyeball-popping graphics and a 107-minute nonstop gag-storm of a screenplay from Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, with Michelle Morgan, Dominic Russo, Matthew Fogel and Raphael Bob-Waksberg.My favourite moment of superfluous script brilliance comes when an intensely annoying teenage vampire announces in a sensitive voice: “I also DJ on the side and wear women’s jeans.” My only qualification is that the Lego figures are permitted a supernatural ability to operate in the live-action real world of the family’s house, which is arguably a bit of a cheat – but that’s done with great wit, like everything else.We left the first movie on a note of existential anxiety. The kid in the real-world basement is informed that from now on his younger sister will be playing and the creatures of the Lego universe were horrified by the appearance of Duplo: great big blocks with new pinky-cutesy colours. The masculine world of Lego is threatened.The Duplo figures are, in fact, resident in a distant spaceship and make irregular incursions that the indigenous Lego creatures consider to be hugely aggressive. After years of bitter warfare, their hometown has been grimly renamed Apocalypseburg (“a heckish place to live”), no longer is everything awesome, and the chipper singing of Emmet (tremendously voiced by Chris Pratt) is out of joint with the times. He is increasingly considered inappropriate to what Apocalypseburg needs: a tough warrior. This is especially true of Lucy (Elizabeth Banks), a badass who not so secretly despises Emmet’s inability to master stereotypically manly mannerisms.Then the creatures of Duplo arrive with an order: Apocalypseburg’s foremost citizens must travel to the distant outpost of Sustar to attend a wedding. Their enemies’ leader Queen Watevra Wa’Nabi (voiced by Tiffany Haddish) has imperiously announced her desire to get hitched to Apocalypseburg’s most eligible unmarried man: Batman (growlingly voiced by Will Arnett) who furiously announces that he wishes to remain a “Bat-chelor”. Is this an overture of friendship or an insidious plan to undermine our heroes’ masculine toughness and self-reliance with the girly stratagem of a wedding?There is no doubt about it: some of the protagonists are beguiled by the avowedly feminised concept of a lavish wedding, but Emmet’s own crisis of masculinity appears solved by the appearance of tough, attractively stubbled adventurer Rex Dangervest (also voiced by Pratt), who keeps curtly telling everyone he doesn’t want to explain his backstory before doing just that.TLM2 is speckled with references to 2001: A Space Odyssey (the “stargate” has become the “stairgate”, which leads to the disturbing world beyond the basement), to the Toy Stories and to The Matrix. The characters are periodically besieged by worries about the reality of what they experience and by their own inevitable obsolescence. They are terrified of being banished to the exotic land of “storage”, pronounced like a French word. But the structure and themes of the film have to be perceived within a pointilliste spray of brilliant gags. Each inidual joke is the point the movie keeps delivering a dizzying rush of material. What a rush."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ec6bf6ff1fee0104b4ad06cde5332fc4ab1d8dd/0_359_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=980ec402a06d1f2a622f0ca387ca0eb3","title":"thomasina miers chickpea black pudding spinach ragu recipe","story":"This peasant-style dish uses humble ingredients of the best qualityThe origin of this dish is a tapas bar in Barcelona’s Boqueria food market, Pinotxo (named after its twinkly-eyed owner). For me, it epitomises the kind of peasant-style food I love, using humble ingredients of the best quality. Pinotxo uses wonderful dried chickpeas from a neighbouring stall, which are plump and succulent when cooked. As for the sauce, the black pudding melts into a silky, mineral-rich ragu.If you can, buy dried chickpeas from a specialist supplier – you will be amazed at their quality. Ditto the black pudding. This recipe is at least thrice the sum of its parts.300g dried chickpeas, soaked overnight75ml extra-virgin olive oil2 red onions, peeled and finely sliced1 leek, finely slicedSalt and black pepper3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped2-3 fresh bay leaves1 x 400g tin plum tomatoes150g black pudding, roughly chopped¾ tsp ground cinnamon1 heaped tsp smoked paprika2-3 tbsp sherry vinegar150g baby spinachLemon wedges, to serveDrain the soaked chickpeas, then cover with plenty of cold water and bring to a boil. Simmer for 40‑50 minutes, until tender, then add half a teaspoon of salt to the water, stir and leave to cool. (If you haven’t had time to soak them overnight, add one teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda to their cooking water, and simmer for approximately 80 minutes, until tender.)Warm the oil in a wide, deep pan over a medium-high heat, and add the onions and leek. Season generously, and fry gently for a few minutes before turning the heat down to medium and cooking until the vegetables soften, about 10 minutes.Add the garlic and bay, and cook for another few minutes, then add the tomatoes, black pudding, cinnamon, paprika and two tablespoons of vinegar. Break up the black pudding with a spoon, then cook for 15 minutes, leaving the ingredients to bubble away together gently.Drain the chickpeas, reserving a cup of the cooking water, then fold into the sauce. Taste, and adjust the seasoning, then continue to simmer for another five to 10 minutes, allowing the flavours to mingle. Add a little cooking water if the sauce looks too dry, and the remaining vinegar if it needs more sparkle.When you are ready to eat, stir in the spinach and cook for a few minutes, until it has wilted into the sauce. Serve in bowls with lemon wedges, a slosh of extra-virgin olive oil and bread to mop up the sauce.This ragu is also good with rice, pasta (I like pappardelle), a green salad or, best of all, homemade patatas bravas. Consider cooking double the amount of chickpeas and freezing half, ready to whip out of the freezer for a midweek fix. Fry any leftover black pudding until golden, and toss in a salad of bitter leaves and crisp bacon, topped with a poached egg."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ff18be23cb48c8497204dfbdfb84a72968f6a36/0_105_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab8a6dc5eabb7bf2e6e4698d2fddbf26","title":"chelsea investigated fifa more than 100 players","story":"Chelsea are set to hear from Fifa whether they will be banned from the transfer market after being investigated over potential rule breaches with regard to more than 100 foreign players under the age of 18.The governing body has overseen a long-running case against the club, which was started by the compliance unit of its transfer matching system (TMS). It flagged 25 player cases at the beginning of last year which it thought warranted further scrutiny.Fifa’s disciplinary committee has since conducted phase two of the investigation – a deep e into how Chelsea have registered players at their academy over a number of years. The club responded to a request for information by opening their books to the committee which, in turn, highlighted a high number of cases to examine.The committee is now considering its final decision, meaning that Chelsea should know soon whether they will face any sanctions. If found guilty, a transfer ban would be expected. The club would be able to appeal to Fifa and then to the court of arbitration for sport (Cas).The basic rule is that clubs cannot bring in players under 18 from other countries, unless their parents have emigrated for reasons not connected to football or both the player and club are based within 50km of a national border. Under Fifa’s article 19, the only other exception is for transfers within either the European Union or European Economic Area where the player is aged between 16 and 18.Chelsea contend that the majority of the 100-plus player cases involved short-term triallists at their academy, who did not go on to sign for them. They have argued there is no law against trialling under‑18 international players that it is common practice across Europe and, as such, they believe these cases ought not to be included in the final judgment. In others that led to them making signings, the club maintain they fully complied with Fifa’s rules.The investigation – the first of its kind into a Premier League club – has been complex, with a high degree of communication between Chelsea, Fifa and the Football Association. One of the key questions has been where the line is drawn between a player being on trial or spending time as a resident at the club academy.Chelsea did not want to comment but they referred to a statement from last November in which they said they had “fully cooperated with Fifa and provided comprehensive evidence demonstrating its compliance with the applicable Fifa regulations”.The club have signed Christian Pulisic this month from Borussia Dortmund for £58m, although he will not join them until the summer, and they have taken the striker Gonzalo Higuaín on loan from Juventus until the end of the season, with options to extend the loan or sign him permanently. Chelsea deny that the moves are in reaction to the threat of a transfer ban.Fifa, which says it cannot comment on ongoing investigations, stepped up its attempts to regulate transfers by introducing TMS in 2010 and its pursuit of these cases springs from a determination to help protect children from potential exploitation and trafficking.Fifa has investigated Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid for infringements related to the signing of minors and each of the Spanish clubs were given a two-window transfer ban, although Real served only one after a successful appeal to Cas. Chelsea are among five Premier League clubs currently under investigation and there are more worldwide.The French investigative website Mediapart reported last November as part of the Football Leaks expose that Fifa would seek to impose a four-window ban on Chelsea, together with a fine of 500,000 Swiss francs (£383,000). It also said that the club’s alleged offences related to the recruitment of 19 minors, including 14 who were illegally transferred. It was after this that Chelsea made their November statement. It is possible that Mediapart’s player numbers were obtained at an early stage in the investigation, most likely at TMS. Alternatively, they could relate to Chelsea’s most serious alleged transgressions.  understands that TMS pushed for Atlético to receive a four-window ban, but the disciplinary committee has the final say on sanctions.Fifa has established a principle which says a systemic breach of the rules should entail a transfer embargo, irrespective of the number of minors involved. The amount of cases does affect the severity of the sanction. It is also understood that Fifa worries that a one-window ban does not create harmful consequences, and can be worked around with sufficient planning.Fifa considered 183 player cases in its final judgment against Atlético 153 would be confirmed. Atlético’s numbers were inflated, in part, by their partnership with Dalian Wanda Group, a Chinese property company, that led to many Chinese players coming to train at their academy. Barcelona were found guilty of violating the rules on the registration of 31 minors in Real’s case it was 39of 70 investigated. Cas upheld 37 of the guilty verdicts.The severity of the infringements is key and Fifa deems there to be different levels, with the most serious being a breach of article 19. It is unclear how many of the alleged Chelsea cases would fit into the higher end of the scale, although it is believed to be a significant number.Chelsea would reject that, but one that would appear to do so is Bertrand Traoré, a forward now at Lyon, who was signed to professional terms by Chelsea on 1 January 2014, the first available day after his 18th birthday. Pictures emerged of him playing for the club against Arsenal in a “non-competitive” game on 23 October 2011, when he was 16. The pictures came to Fifa’s attention in January 2016 and it is believed that they were the trigger for the investigation.The club have argued that they had an option agreement, registered with and approved by the FA and Premier League, to secure Traoré’s registration after he turned 18 and which allowed them to play him in what were effectively trial games."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcde918a74b4731786c9b49046c6694b0426397a/0_104_4590_2755/master/4590.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b3e0a7cf918afdd84e2ff82bae9e627","title":"the fiver roy keane nottingham forest notts county alan hardy","story":"Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!It’s been a long time since an occasionally belligerent, labrador-walking football coach renowned for his straight talking and quick temper oversaw training at Nottingham Forest. While the club is unlikely to ever re-scale the preposterous heights scaled under Brian Clough, they have taken what they will hope is a step in the right direction by welcoming Roy Keane back to the City Ground. A Forest legend who once declared “my heart is in this club” six months before his inevitable departure for pastures more lucrative and successful, Keane has agreed to become the club’s assistant manager, resuming his gig as Even Worse Cop to Martin O’Neill’s Bad Cop in a reprise of the roles the duo performed for the Republic O’Ireland with varying degrees of success (and more latterly abject failure).Unlike most assistant managers, who tend to be appointed with a minimum of fuss and fanfare, Keane’s return is a major talking point, not least due to his O’Ireland time with O’Neill. Previously a manager with Sunderland and Ipswich Town but content for now as an assistant, Keane is renowned for generating conflicting emotions in – and conflict with – his charges. One suspects his decision to take the role will be the source of considerable dressing-room trepidation. “Basically, you’re $hit,” he once told his bemused players at Sunderland before a game at Aston Villa. “Try and enjoy the game. You’re probably going to get beat. But just enjoy being $hit.” And to be fair, while this stirring rhetoric would prove sufficiently inspirational to help his team earn a draw at the time, his assessment would ultimately prove correct. Clough and Taylor 2.0 or a Stan \u0026amp Ollie reboot? Either way, Forest fans are almost certainly guaranteed entertainment.Whether or not it will be of the car-crash variety endured by fans of neighbours Notts County remains to be seen. Adrift at the bottom of League Two, eight points off safety and looking likely to lose their status as the oldest club in the Football League after 156 years, Notts County have endured a torrid time of it in recent years, not least in the two years since they were bought by “Big Alan” Hardy. Criticised in Big Sunday Paper for misadventures on social media, including the goading of a local newspaper editor, assorted fans of his own club and more successful Midlands rivals, Big Alan responded by inadvertently posting a picture of “Little Alan” on Social Media Disgrace Twitter while attempting to pick yet another row. He has since announced he is selling the club.“After considerable soul-searching, I no longer feel I can continue as the owner of Notts County Football Club,” he said in a statement. “I would like to make it clear from the outset that the club’s current league position is not a factor in this decision, nor are any of the events which have unfolded in the media this weekend.” The man who declared promotion a “dead cert” before the season now wants out, following an extraordinary two-year masterclass in how Notts to run a football club.Join John Ashdown from 7pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of the FA Cup fifth-round draw, followed by Barnet 1-2 Brentford.The Football Weekly podcast will be in this general area.“OK, I admit to being a grumpy old man and  reader (sorry), but how can it be acceptable for Jesse Lingard to tell the ref to eff off not once, but twice, after being booked in Arsenal v Manchester United?

Hunt had been working on Kenshi, in which players navigate a tribe of people through a strange, low-tech alien world, for more than 10 years. You might think finishing it would be a huge milestone in Hunt’s career. But if anything, the opposite is true.“No one was really bothered by the official release, because nothing will change,” says Hunt, who speaks in a laid-back, laconic fashion that makes him seem affable and yet strangely distant. “People kept saying, ‘Ah, don’t release it too soon.’ I think they were worried that I was going to leave it buggy or incomplete.”This bizarre situation has emerged because, despite being a decade in the making, Kenshi has been playable for half that time, and already has thousands of fans. Kenshi belongs to a sub-group of “Early Access” games on the biggest online PC games storefront, Steam. Through the platform, developers can release their games in an unfinished state, and use the revenue raised from purchases to fund the remainder of development. It can be likened to crowdfunding, although rather than investing on a promise, purchasers of the games can play along as development progresses.Kenshi was one of 12 games selected to launch the initiative in March 2013. Of those, nine have been finished, two have ceased development, and one is stuck in limbo. Alongside Kenshi, the released games are Kerbal Space Program, ARMA 3, Prison Architect, Drunken Robot Pornography, Gnomoria , Gear Up, Starforge and Kinetic Void.Kenshi is a role-playing-game, although it interprets that idea more literally than most. Players don’t become some fantasy hero destined for glory, the familiar Dungeons and Dragons triptych of warrior, mage or rogue. Instead, they can be anything they like within Kenshi’s vast and strange world: a trader, a farmer, a bandit, a thief. It’s a game about forging your own path in a world indifferent to your success or failure. Opportunities are many, but risks are also high, and a character’s story can come to a swift end courtesy of vicious wildlife or roaming groups of bandits.Hunt had put five years into Kenshi before Steam launched its Early Access section, much of that time as a full-time solo developer. He had even started selling prototype copies, using services such as Desura and his own website. When Valve began searching for games to feature, Kenshi was ahead of the pack. “Kenshi looks really good on a store-page, because it’s just a huge list of dreamlike features,” says Hunt. “It had a fanbase, and it was pretty far along in development.”When customers are paying for an unfinished product, expectations are high. Hunt believes one of the reasons Kenshi has maintained its development for so long is through constant communication and regular updates. “If we did an update every four months, then everyone would get angry and during that gap would be saying, ‘The game’s abandoned!’” he says. “But if we did the same amount of work, but broke it up into an update every day, people felt it was really well maintained.’”But supporting an unfinished game’s development with its sales over several years is not easy. “There was one point in development where I handed everyone their notices,” Hunt says. “We were completely running out of money.” Hunt planned to continue working on the game alone, reducing its overall scope. Then sales suddenly picked up, and it was back to business as usual.Not every project has been so fortunate. Another game from the initial batch was Under the Ocean, a subaquatic survival game developed by New Zealand-based artist Paul Hart and programmer Mike Reitzenstein. Boasting a unique art style and a setting that distinguished it from other survival games at the time, Under the Ocean was one of Steam’s most interesting prospects.But the project ran into trouble about a year into development. “With previous games, Mike and I had a very focused vision, with little outside influence,” says Hart. “But with Early Access we modified our vision to fit feedback.” One of these modifications was to make each update to the game themed around a specific idea or feature, in the hopes of attracting an influx of new buyers. But the pair found the process disruptive, and in early 2015, Reitzenstein decided to leave the project. This left Hart without a programmer, and thereby without any realistic chance of finishing the game. Not long after, he made the decision to delist Under the Ocean from Steam.“A big part of why I hesitated cancelling the project earlier is the disappointment of letting the player-base down,” Hart says. This is the risk developers take with Early Access. An unfinished project is always disappointing for its creator. But when thousands of other people play a role in funding that project, the disappointment is magnified many times over, and with it comes a burden of neglected responsibility.Hart continued working on the game for the next three years, at weekends, but finally decided to cancel the project a couple of months ago. Throughout, Hart has tried to maintain goodwill with the game’s remaining fanbase, offering free copies of his other games to owners of Under the Ocean – and, more unusually, promising free copies of games he plans to make in the future.Under the Ocean may have failed, but Hart has done all he can to make the best of an unfortunate situation. The same cannot be said of every Early Access title. Patterns, a game by Second Life developer Linden Labs, unceremoniously ceased development in 2014, sparking much ire. But this is nothing compared to the confounding case of the bizarrely named 1…2…3…KICK IT! (Drop That Beat like an Ugly Baby).Kick It is a Guitar Hero-style music game developed by Boston-based outfit Dejobaan Games. It launched on Early Access in March 2013 alongside Kenshi, Under the Ocean and Patterns. Nearly six years later, the game remains available to purchase for £6.99 – but no progress has been made on its development.Dejobaan was contacted several times for comment, asking about the game’s current state and whether there were any plans for further release. There was no response. The last official update occurred in August 2014. Dejobaan’s founder, Ichiro Lambe, apologised for the delays in production, stating that the game’s code had “not been in a playable state”, and assuring owners that he was going to “keep on working on the game” until he was happy with it.Dejobaan has officially remained silent since that announcement, but one of its developers released new footage of the game in January 2017. Nonetheless, most of Kick It’s customer base is doubtful the game will ever be finished, convinced that it has been abandoned.Games like Kick It also raise questions about the potential for Early Access games to take advantage of their customer base. Should a developer be allowed to continue selling an unfinished game that hasn’t been updated in over five years? Hunt is disparaging. “I think it’s damaging to everyone in the long term,” he says. “At the very least, if a game hasn’t been updated enough, they could put a stamp on it that says ‘Possibly abandoned’”.Valve, for its part, places the onus of responsibility with the customer. The Steam page for every Early Access game features a boilerplate disclaimer that states: “This Early Access game is not complete and may or may not change further.” Meanwhile, on its About page for Early Access, Valve implores users not to buy a game unless they are happy to play it in its existing state.Such sweeping statements are indicative of Valve’s apparent approach to managing Steam. Valve employs a “desks-on-wheels” culture that encourages staff to work on whatever project they like. Rather than appoint staff of its own to watch over the storefront, Valve encourages users to leave reviews and create “curator” lists to highlight their favourites. Earlier this year, after multiple attempts at creating various automated gatekeeping systems, Valve’s Erik Johnson announced the decision to allow any developer to list games on the store with the vague exception of “things that we decide are illegal, or straight-up trolling”.At a time when big-tech companies are being increasingly scrutinised for their social responsibilities, Valve’s hands-off approach to managing Steam is not a good look. It’s hard to know precisely what percentage of Early Access projects have been successful, how many have failed, and how many linger on like Kick It. But even if only a small percentage of the fruit in a greengrocers is rotten, it shouldn’t be the customer’s responsibility to avoid it. It should be off the shelves.With Kenshi, there’s no question that Early Access has been of great benefit to the game. If Kick It! remains in limbo, Kenshi will be the last of the original 12 games to see a proper launch. For Hunt, it’s a curiously melancholy moment. “To me it means I can start a new game, finally. I’ll still continue fixing stuff, the important stuff, but it’s the point where I can find time for another project,” he says.“It’s kind of like the end.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b71daaa3997c702e85b3f30feb524df89542700/473_713_2691_1615/master/2691.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d31a837da72432099c6d93426ecda6e5","title":"breast ironing british peer to raise issue in parliament","story":"Leading QC Alex Carlile hopes to force wider scrutiny of the practice after  revealed ‘dozens’ of girls subjected to abusive custom A British peer is to table questions in parliament on the secretive practice of “breast-ironing”, after the  revealed that the abusive intervention is spreading in the UK.Alex Carlile, one of the UK’s leading QCs who is a former deputy high court judge and a member of the House of Lords, told the  that he hoped to trigger a wider scrutiny of the practice in the UK.“I hope that my parliamentary questions will lead to the UK authorities taking a close interest in these distressing cases, with a view to prosecution of those involved in what is a dreadful and abusive practice,” he said.His intervention came after the  revealed anecdotal evidence of dozens of recent cases of the practice, in which a girl’s chest is “ironed” with a hot stone to delay breast formation.The perpetrators, usually mothers, consider the practice a traditional measure that protects girls from unwanted male attention, sexual harassment and rape. Medical experts and victims regard it as child abuse that could lead to physical and psychological scars, infections, inability to breastfeed, deformities and breast cancer.Community workers in London, Yorkshire, Essex and the West Midlands have all reported cases, but the custom, which originates in west Africa, is extremely secretive and there is no official data on how widespread it is. One activist who was a victim in childhood, Margaret Nyuydzewira, has estimated that at least 1,000 women and girls have been subjected to the intervention. There has been no systematic study or formal data collection exercise.The government has said in the past that it is “absolutely committed” to stamping out the practice, but little action appears to have been taken.Helen Porter, executive member of the National Education Union, who has spoken out about breast-ironing at teachers’ conferences, said educators “may be the people who are best able to report it”.“They might notice changes in unwillingness to change for PE, or they might notice someone in discomfort when they are raising their hand. They might notice a child becoming more withdrawn,” she said.As such, there is a need for more training and more discussions about the practice, Porter said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03c7edf00adb1b1b9c357251d119bdffa41bb497/1_0_5280_3169/master/5280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81d7ce58aad9894ba0c06d0d19317bad","title":"my partner has started withdrawing before ejaculation why","story":"After many years, and dancing around the edges, my best friend and I have fallen for each other. We recently confessed our feelings, and are now together. We’re in our early 30s and feeling our way through our new relationship, and it’s wonderful. He is clear he does not want children, and I don’t see them in my future either. He knows this. Very recently during sex, he has started pulling out to ejaculate. I asked him about it, and he just said that he doesn’t want kids. I take oral contraceptives. We had sex a handful of times before our relationship, and it was not an issue then. I’m insulted, and worried that he thinks I would be careless or might “trap” him. We’re at a delicate stage in this transition, so I don’t want to make a fuss, but it’s really playing on my mind that he now doesn’t trust me. He says he loves me.You are right to judge this transition as delicate tread carefully, and try not to take his withdrawal personally. His opposition to having children may be rooted in deeply troubling aspects of his life, such as painful childhood memories – although perhaps he simply doesn’t feel ready for parenthood.Even though withdrawing is not a secure method of contraception, try to reframe his doing so as his way of protecting your relationship, or warding off what he may see as disaster for both of you. Perhaps he has been “trapped” in the past, in which case trust is at stake. In fact, many cases have shown that if there is even an unconscious desire on a woman’s part to have children, she might unconsciously “forget” to take her pill. Talk with him gently, seeking to understand his true feelings – and express yours. Also, examine your own feelings when he withholds his ejaculate – clearly, you feel distrusted, but do you also feel rejected? Punished? Dishonoured? Help him to understand and, hopefully, empathise. By the way, if you are hoping to have children at some point – and feel you need to do so at a biologically optimum time – it is essential to have that conversation pretty soon – in a frank and non-punitive manner.•Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.•If you would like advice from Pamela Stephenson Connolly on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@the (please don’t send attachments).

It was a reminder of his potent talentA hard-drinking, kaleidoscopically voiced jazz-folk voyager who flattened both genre boundaries and those who got on his bad side, John Martyn died in 2009, aged just 60. To mark the t10th anniversary of his death, his musical and occasional boxing partner Danny Thompson has recruited eight guest artists for a Celtic Connections tribute show in the city Martyn called home.Thompson, looking resplendent in a kilt, remains spry at 79 and is still capable of wringing pure poetry out of a double-bass, as evidenced by his dreamy version of Solid Air, where he matches the roaming rumble of dapper US bluesman Eric Bibb with an equally exploratory bassline. The lush, spacey sound of mid-period Martyn is later recreated with the help of keyboardist Foster Paterson and bassist Alan Thomson – both also veterans of his touring band – alongside drummer Arran Ahmun and a swooning 15-piece string section. The results are suitably cosmic and, like the man himself, unpredictable.The animated Ross Wilson AKA Blue Rose Code whips up a gorgeous version of Fine Lines that inspires an audience singalong, while English guitarist Rory Butler es into the cartwheeling instrumental A Day at the Sea with such rigour he springs off his stool. Lucy Rose’s heartbreaking solo Couldn’t Love You More is an early standout, while Eddi Reader brings both serenity and grit to Fairy Tale Lullaby, a deep pull from Martyn’s debut album and a song he apparently wrote when he was just 16.If the mood is freewheeling, Paul Weller initially seems all business, closing the first half with a raucous reading of Don’t Want to Know that highlights the song’s abrasive edges. But later he returns for a playfully insouciant version of Sweet Little Mystery alongside Rose that banishes any memories of the Wet Wet Wet cover.After a mob-handed, enjoyably chaotic rendition of May You Never with the house lights up, the gig closes with vintage footage of Martyn himself from 1986 performing a sweetly ravaged cover of Somewhere Over the Rainbow. After such a crammed evening of interpretation, it’s a potent reminder of the intimidating rawness of his talent, and leaves both the crowd and performers rapt.• Celtic Connections continues at various venues across Glasgow until 3 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bd6796a9d30d57abc0c4b54d22c6062c07df8b4/0_95_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=881d4f1c49b46159d7bc179ac8e7bdce","title":"planning for no deal on the brexit frontline podcast","story":"With less than 10 weeks to go until Britain leaves the EU and still no withdrawal deal agreed, businesses around the country are scrabbling to prepare for the worst-case scenario of a disorderly Brexit.

Asked which ones the government might back, May’s spokesman said it was impossible to say before they were selected.“We’ll have to see which amendments are chosen before any of those decisions can be taken,” he said.The debate will take up most of Tuesday’s Commons business. It will be opened by the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, and closed by May.There has been considerable focus on an amendment supported by the senior Conservative backbencher Graham Brady, which says the backstop should be replaced by “alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border”.While this would have no force, and Ireland and the EU have stressed that such a change cannot happen, the hope among MPs backing the move is that if it were passed, it would give May a tangible sign to take to Brussels. Speaking on Monday, Brady said this would give the prime minister “enormous firepower”.May’s spokesman declined to set out what changes might be sought to get a Brexit deal passed but he stressed the importance of addressing MPs’ concerns on the backstop and dismissed reports that the prime minister could ease back on her Brexit “red lines” – thus placing a heavy emphasis on Brussels to yield.“What is absolutely clear is that when parliament voted to reject the deal, and therefore the withdrawal agreement, the backstop was very significant among the concerns which were raised, and therefore we need to address those concerns if we to are get support for the deal,” he said.“What you have consistently heard from European leaders is that they want the United Kingdom to leave with a deal. I think there’s recognition that the United Kingdom leaving with a deal is in their best interests as well as those of the UK.“The deal that has been agreed was defeated in parliament, so therefore if we are going to leave with a deal, clearly we are going to need to make some changes in order to win parliamentary support.”The stage is thus set for a potential standoff between London and Brussels, with EU leaders equally insistent on the role of the backstop, which would keep Northern Ireland in customs alignment with the Irish Republic to avoid a hard border if there is not a permanent deal or other arrangement.If no agreement can be reached on the backstop, May will be left having to potentially put her deal to MPs again, with the only changes made to domestic issues, such as guarantees on workers’ rights and environmental protections.The prime minister is committed to returning to the Commons for a second meaningful vote “as soon as possible”, her spokesman said.He denied May was trying to run down the clock to force the hands of MPs or the EU. “What we’re working to do is to secure a deal which parliament can support,” the spokesman added.May is meeting Tory MPs and MEPs over the next couple of days, and is expected to make a statement to the Commons on the next steps after the votes on the amendments, whether that evening or the following day.Another amendment, tabled by the Labour MP Yvette Cooper, would oblige the government to extend the Brexit deadline if an agreement has not been struck by the end of next month.Nick Boles, the Tory backbencher who is pushing for the plan alongside Cooper, argued it was vital the amendment attracted enough support to be passed.“If we don’t seize the moment tomorrow afternoon then we’re at grave risk of just driving off the edge on 29 March, without really wanting to, and when there might be a compromise that we could achieve if we had a few more months,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Monday.It remains unclear whether either of these main amendments – or any of them – would be passed if they came to a vote.The Cooper plan has attracted scepticism from some Labour MPs in leave-voting seats, who could potentially vote against it in sufficient numbers.It also remains to be seen whether Tory Eurosceptics consider Brady’s proposal sufficiently robust to assuage their backstop fears. The European Research Group was due to meet on Monday afternoon to decide on a position."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cc4b9fbc0bb00e0987c310f02ed9cce991ac9cc/416_215_1662_997/master/1662.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=716c4695556876fc1c1f45a4cb17ab78","title":"labour support for yvette coopers brexit amendment in doubt","story":"Corbyn ally says it would smack of ‘ignoring views of millions of ordinary folk’Labour’s backing for Yvette Cooper’s anti no-deal Brexit amendment has been thrown into doubt, after a shadow cabinet ally of Jeremy Corbyn warned that supporting it would smack of “ignoring the views of millions of ordinary folk”.Labour had been widely expected to whip its MPs to support the amendment, tabled by Cooper and the former Conservative minister Nick Boles, which paves the way for a backbench bill mandating the government to seek a nine-month extension to article 50.But Jon Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, told the  voters in his constituency would regard support for the measure on Tuesday as a failure to respect the result of the 2016 referendum.“Over the weekend I was speaking to some people in my constituency. They weren’t actually people who voted for leave, though the majority of people in my constituency had voted for leave. What they said was people have struggled for the vote, people have died pursuing the vote. Other people have been sent to Australia or put in prison – and the vote actually is a precious thing, when you think about it,” Trickett said.“What they said is, look, we voted remain, but we’ve had a vote: get on with it. And I think that probably does capture a large swath of opinion in the country. That’s how I feel about this amendment. I feel that it may look to people as if we’re trying to somehow remove the earlier decision, which was to Brexit.”He suggested he might consider backing the measure if the time-period for extending article 50 was shortened – something Cooper and colleagues have suggested MPs could achieve by amending their bill when it comes forward, at a later date.“I think people might say, if it’s before the summer, it might be a reasonable kind of period of time. Nine months sounds like the British establishment doing what it always does, which is ignoring the views of millions of ordinary folk – and that I am not prepared to tolerate,” Trickett added.But he suggested Labour must continue to respect the result of the 2016 referendum – underlining the tensions in the party, with activists overwhelmingly supportive of a “people’s vote”.“It’s not how I see things: we are servants of the people, and it’s our job to implement, give effect to, what they want – and they clearly voted for Brexit.”The shadow cabinet is expected to discuss Brexit at its weekly meeting on Tuesday but another shadow minister who is sympathetic to the Cooper-Boles amendment said the leadership could yet decide not to whip MPs. “Free vote territory I suspect,” he said.Without the explicit support of the Labour leadership, the amendment may struggle to win a majority. A Labour spokesman said the party was looking closely at mechanisms to support no deal, but no final decision had been taken on specific amendments.Cooper was due to meet Labour MPs from leave-supporting areas on Monday to try to win their support for the measure – and convince them it is not an attempt to thwart Brexit but to avoid the UK leaving without a deal on 29 March, which remains the default position if an agreement is not reached and ratified before then.Trickett is one of Corbyn’s inner circle, alongside Diane Abbott and John McDonnell as well as key advisers including Labour’s head of strategy, Seumas Milne.Together with the party chair, Ian Lavery, he is one of the shadow cabinet figures who is most sceptical about the idea of Labour swinging its weight behind a second Brexit referendum.McDonnell had previously signalled that Labour could back the Cooper-Boles amendment, calling it “sensible”. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, has also spoken warmly about the proposal.Labour has tabled its own amendment, calling for MPs to be allowed to vote on options, including the party’s own Brexit policy and a second referendum. There are also alternative amendments in play, including one from Rachel Reeves calling for an extension to article 50.Another, from the Labour MP Jack Dromey and the Conservative Caroline Spelman, simply rejects the idea of no deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2de6b4540c1f403af453cd6008a0e58a08c947bc/0_214_6891_4135/master/6891.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b72ba0e969093479fb4159872b95584","title":"scientists create super thin sheet could charge our phones","story":"Breakthrough means large sheets of energy-harvesting material can be producedWe have all been there. In a rush to leave the house we grab our phones and head out the door, realising all too late that the battery is dead because we forgot to plug it into the tablecloth.Or perhaps we have not. But this could be the future that scientists hope to usher in with electronic sheets that charge our mobile phones, laptops and other gadgets by harvesting energy from the world around us.In a step in that direction, scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have created super-thin, bendy materials that absorb wireless internet and other electromagnetic waves in the air and turn them into electricity.The lead researcher, Tomás Palacios, said the breakthrough paved the way for energy-harvesting covers ranging from tablecloths to giant wrappers for buildings that extract energy from the environment to power sensors and other electronics. Details have been published in the journal Nature.“When you have one of these energy-harvesting devices you are collecting energy 247 and you could be storing that in a battery to use later,” Palacios said. “You could cover your desk with an electronic tablecloth and even though you’re only at the desk for so many hours a day, it would be harvesting energy the whole time.”Palacios and his colleagues connected a bendy antenna to a flexible semiconductor layer only three atoms thick. The antenna picks up wifi and other radio-frequency signals and turns them into an alternating current. This flows into the molybdenum disulphide semiconductor, where it is converted into a direct electrical current.“It doesn’t sound like much compared with the 60 watts that a computer needs, but you can still do a lot with it,” Palacios said. “You can design a wide range of sensors, for environmental monitoring or chemical and biological sensing, which operate at the single microwatt level. Or you could store the electricity in a battery to use later.”Medical devices are another potential application. Because wifi and similar radio-frequency signals pass through people, energy-harvesting covers could be applied to implants to provide them with enough power to beam health data to an outside receiver.Researchers have made energy-harvesting “rectennas” before, but existing devices are made from conventional semiconductors which are rigid, fragile and practically impossible to make in large sheets. By contrast, molybdenum disulphide film can be produced in sheets on industrial roll-to-roll machines, meaning they can be made large enough to capture useful amounts of energy.“In the future, everything is going to be covered with electronic systems and sensors. The question is going to be how do we power them?” said Palacios. “This is the missing building block that we need.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebb573281467845123c913d9421c2a30fed36dbb/0_0_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02c7b6e3c51370d323220fac24c7a5cd","title":"young people how do you feel about your future","story":"With 18-year-olds watching the outcome of Brexit unravel in front of them, we want to hear what you thinkFor years, it has been assumed that young people do not vote, do not take part in politics, and do not care.

A similar result was found when children’s screen time at three years old was compared with their development at five years.“What is new in this study is that we are studying really young children, so aged 2-5, when brain development is really rapidly progressing and also child development is unfolding so rapidly,” Dr Sheri Madigan, first author of the study from the University of Calgary, told the . “We are getting at these lasting effects,” she added of the study.The authors say parents should be cautious about how long children are allowed to spend with devices.“Excessive screen time can impinge on children’s ability to develop optimally,” they write. “It is recommended that paediatricians and healthcare practitioners guide parents on appropriate amounts of screen exposure and discuss potential consequences of excessive screen use.”But the results have been contested by others in the field who say the study did not take into account what the children were using the screens for, and that the influence of screens had a smaller effect than other factors such as family income, the child’s sleep and whether they were read to.Writing in the journal Jama Pediatrics, researchers from the University of Waterloo, the University of Calgary and Alberta Children’s Hospital Research Institute describe how they investigated the issue by looking at the screen time and development of more than 2,400 children between the ages of two and five. Data was collected at least once for each child.At two years, three years, and five years, mothers were asked to record how much time their child spent using screens, including time in front of the TV, computer or other devices. They also completed standard questionnaires to assess their child’s development, with questions including whether the child could complete tasks such as drawing particular shapes, copying certain behaviours or forming sentences – tasks covering areas from fine motor control to communication skills. Other aspects of the child’s life, such as their sleep and whether they had books read to them, were also considered.On average children spent about 17 hours a week in front of screens at two years old, increasing to almost 25 hours a week at three years, before falling to 11 hours a week at five years of age.The team say a clear trend emerged: the more time children were reported to be spending in front of screens, the worse they did on development tests. Those who spent longer with screens at 24 months showed worse performance on tests at 36 months, and a similar trend was seen for screen time at 36 months and test performance at five years.“When young children are observing screens, they may be missing important opportunities to practice and master interpersonal, motor, and communication skills,” the authors wrote.Others said a study that followed children over time, rather than just offering a snapshot of development and screen time, was welcome but they noted that the study had limitations, including that it did not consider developments in technology since 2016, or look at which types of screen were being used.The study also relied on questionnaires completed only by mothers and did not consider what the child was using the screen for, or whether they were using it alone. Furthermore, it did not show which areas of development in particular were most affected by screen time or give an idea of how much was too much when it came to using devices.The issue of whether screen time is bad for children has become a battlefield. While some argue screen time is harmful for children’s mental and physical health, others warn of moral panic, and say evidence on the issue is of poor quality and that there is no clear sign of harm.And there are other issues. “If parents think that their child is not making expected progress over time, they are likely to think their child spends a lot of time with screens,” said Prof Natalia Kucirkova of University College London.Dr Max Davie, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health agreed other factors had a larger impact on how children fared.“In fact the data shows that the association with screen time is weaker than that between developmental outcomes and good sleep, reading to the child, and maternal positivity,” he said.Nonetheless, he said, parents should balance screen time with other activities. “We would, in the light of this paper, reiterate our advice that families spend time interacting as a family, that screens are not allowed to interfere with sleep, and that screen-based interaction is no substitute for in-person contact,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afb4efe4c5116d8ae861336fb9912811debc88c8/0_0_4820_3214/master/4820.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=55d11c993cdf4a5fb2d8e94bff888fc9 1440w","title":"moon and me the new baby tv show from the genius behind teletubbies","story":"He’s been accused of ‘dumbing down’ toddlers, but Andrew Davenport is still the top hit-maker of preschool TV – and the name Pepi Nana is about to become very familiar to every parent in the worldWe’ve not even started watching Moon and Me, the new CBeebies show by Teletubbies creator Andrew Davenport, and it’s already a hit in our house.“I need that one! I need that one!” pleads my two-year-old daughter, pointing at a tiny thumbnail image of the show’s characters – Pepi Nana and Moon Baby – while it downloads for our test screening. Before I have time to explain to her once again the difference between “need” and “want” (you need food and oxygen, you only want to throw my umbrella in the bath), she’s dancing to the theme tune, talking to the characters like old friends and marvelling at the huge moon the show revolves around.Another child transfixed! Just how does Davenport do this? Sadly for those looking for a quick childcare fix, the answer seems to be: incredible instinct and a lot of painstaking research.For Moon and Me, Davenport, 53, teamed up with the University of Sheffield to develop a project in which cameras were set up all over a toy house, so they could observe a day in the life of a toy while they’re being played with.“It was like the Big Brother house only with toys,” he laughs.Their spying revealed some interesting findings – a fascination with stairs, and an insistence that there’s no better party than a tea party. Such things informed Moon and Me’s narrative, which is inspired by the Rumer Godden and Enid Blyton toyhouse stories of the 1930s and 40s. Pepi Nana is a toy who comes to life whenever the moon comes out (and her owner is asleep). Moon Baby visits them from the moon and, in what some people might deem a rude guest, proceeds to wake the rest of the toyhouse with an African thumb piano. He then guides them to Storyland for a story and a song. The whole thing retains the magical vibe of In the Night Garden, yet has a more traditional and homemade feel.It’s hard to imagine it causing the same uproar Teletubbies did when it arrived in 1997. Back then there were tabloid panics that it was turning toddlers’ brains to mush, or that the show contained secret gay messages (Tinky Winky carried – shock! Horror! – a handbag). Locals staged protests. Helicopters would fly over the field in which it was filmed, with photographers onboard hoping to reveal the faces of the actors in the costumes. Visitors to the set had to be blindfolded, for fear they might give away the location.“We just hadn’t prepared for that kind of interest at all,” says Davenport. “People’s relatives were getting doorstepped, which is a surprising place to be in thanks to a pre-school children’s television programme. And the show took on a meaning of its own in the culture that was a little uncontrollable, which in hindsight was fine, but did mean a lot of things were said about it that weren’t true.”When Davenport wrote In the Night Garden, a gently psychedelic affair conceived as a way of guiding children to bed, he was braced for more mayhem. But the only drama came when the BBC tried to move the broadcast time – the show was so popular with parents that it had already become an essential part of the bedtime routine.That hasn’t stopped people projecting wild meanings on to the show. Buzzfeed called it a “surrealist orgy of sex and death”, which seems a bit much given the claim was mainly centred around Upsy Daisy occasionally flashing her knickers. Elsewhere online, someone has constructed an ambitious theory that the show is all a dying hallucination in the mind of Iggle Piggle, who is actually a dehydrated sailor lost at sea. Has Davenport heard that one?There’s a pause. “Er ... no. In a word. I don’t know whether to look that up or not! But if you worry about stuff like that you’re in the wrong business. People are creative, they write their own jokes and obviously there are readings that are ... less savoury, that I probably wouldn’t want to know about.”I wonder if the murky world of the internet, which has taken over culture in the 20 years since Teletubbies landed, plays any part in his writing. Davenport says Moon and Me had to be versatile to different formats, and accepts that lots of viewers will be watching on phones and tablets. Teletubbies was actually conceived as a way of helping children understand the new world of screens, but it seems almost quaint compared to the technology today. What does Davenport make of it?“I think it’s a double edged sword,” he says. “I remember when my godson was younger, the first thing he’d say was ‘hello’ and then ‘can I have the iPad?’ and I wouldn’t see him again. It did slightly devalue the experience of going to see him.”In a way, Moon and Me is a reaction to such technology – a show about play that doesn’t involve screens. “The characters are constantly shown drawing, reading books, painting, making things, doing things with their hands,” explains Davenport. “Hands are a big theme of the show. There are over 500 objects in the toy house and every one is handmade, handpainted.”Davenport also banned any computer generated imagery (“quite a fight”), instead turning to puppetry, stop-motion animation and homemade effects. “Children are fascinated by real objects,” he says. “They will be able to see the weave of the fabric, the joins in the wallpaper, the printing on the wallpaper. There’s a joy in seeing the messiness.”Davenport’s background is an arty one: you can see him flinging his limbs around impressively on a Soho roof for Mehdi Norowzian’s short film Joy (which “inspired” the famous Guinness advert Anticipation – the whole thing ended up in court). And he was once a model for Gilbert and George, after he heard they were looking for a model with “big eyes”. They were paying £30 cash in hand – “which was significant back then” – so he found them in the Yellow Pages under “artists” and gave them a call. George answered, invited him for tea the next day, and he ended up staring out from one their artworks entitled Eyes. “I’ve never actually seen it in person,” he confesses. “But I remember sitting on a train reading a Big Issue feature about them, and suddenly realising that the piece of work I was looking at was me!”Yet it was his rather less arty degree course in speech sciences that proved the bigger influence on his TV work.“Back in the early 90s, a lot of teachers had become television makers and there was an emphasis towards schooling,” he says. “Where I came from, the focus was very much on the early years, the first three years of life, where the fundamental processes of becoming human are all happening – learning to speak, learning to walk and crawl. All of that happens in an incredibly short time, which is where my fascination with play comes from. You can largely tell what’s going on by the way a child is playing.”Davenport’s ideas were pretty radical at the time – incorporating the likes of Jean Piaget and Noam Chomsky into his surreal stories – but that didn’t stop people criticising Teletubbies. Stephen Byers, the schools minister at the time, even said it represented a “dumbing down” of British culture, due to its supposedly unintelligible language. “I think the rigour in which it was constructed was largely missed,” he says.Even now, Davenport is glad of the chance to explain how much thought goes into his hit shows. Yet despite his slightly terrifying insight into these unknowable little minds, he still gets extremely nervous before any new programme airs.“The whole thing only comes together fully at the very last minute, so you never really know how it’s going to go down until the audience get to see it.”Given that every morning since our interview, my daughter has woken up and asked “Where’s Pepi Nana?” repeatedly until we put it on, I think he’s probably going to be ok.Moon and Me starts on CBeebies on 4 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/418ad4a9b12340538da211463b6527940d4befa7/0_662_8765_5259/master/8765.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=094948fdd769dcd0652c0d7c7274b7be","title":"shipwrecked is back and its the love islandfyre festival mashup you need","story":"The first true reality show has reinvented itself. Frankly, there’s never been a more apt moment to throw a bunch of attractive nitwits into a tropical hellscapeThe return of Shipwrecked has come at the perfect time. Thanks to all the Fyre festival documentaries, there has never been a more apt moment to throw a bunch of gormlessly attractive nimrods into a tropical hellscape and make them fight each other for basic essentials. If producers were smart, they would re-edit tonight’s opening episode to include several clips of Ja Rule profoundly misunderstanding the concept of fraud. It would be a ratings winner. The whole world would watch.Unfortunately, it looks as if Shipwrecked might have another target in its sights. Most of the publicity afforded to the show’s return – this is the first series in almost a decade – seems to heavily nod towards Love Island being a primary influence. The popularity of ITV2’s series has clearly sparked something deep within the heart of Shipwrecked. If people go nuts for reality shows about swimwear-clad nitwits pawing at other swimwear-clad nitwits, the theory goes, then they should get a load of Shipwrecked, because Shipwrecked basically invented the idea.It seems cynical, but cynicism has always been Shipwrecked’s modus operandi. Most reality shows follow a simple trajectory: they start, they grow, they crater, then they drag on unwatched until an executive kindly kills them off. But Shipwrecked is different. Shipwrecked leaves huge gaps between series and re-emerges transformed, like a millennial version of Michael Apted’s Up documentaries.This week’s series marks the third revival of a show that first began two days before the turn of the century. Back then, when it beat BBC One’s Castaway 2000 to air by a matter of days (there’s that famous cynicism for you), it was widely hailed as one of the first true reality shows. It was a grand social experiment interested in the idea of how communities form. There was no cash prize, there was no automatic stepping stone to fame. There was just a bunch of fit young people toiling on a desert island.This approach lasted for just three series. But when it returned in 2006, Shipwrecked found itself stranded on a landscape of more sophisticated imitators. Reality television was now about Big Brother and The Apprentice and I’m A Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here shows that explicitly antagonised their participants. Compared to Shipwreck’s relative purity, these shows were cockfights. And so it was forced to fall in line, adding tribes, rules and voting, plus a cash prize and, very much in keeping with mid-noughties reality television, an out-and-out racist. Shipwrecked: Battle of the Islands, as it was known then, was a much more aggressive affair. And yet it only lasted for a handful of years.The last Shipwreck re-invention came back in 2011 a stripped-down, back-to-basics affair that overcompensated for the viciousness of Battle of the Islands by being relentlessly dull. Sure, the cast included a full-dressed, all-black goth, but that was too little too late. It clung to the schedules for a single series before drowning.And now here we are, in a world where Love Island rules the seas. As such, if I’ve read between the lines correctly, this new Shipwrecked will have much lower stakes. It will be intently designed as a Love Island-style screensaver, playing out images of beautiful youngsters barely doing anything in the blind hope that viewers will project their own feelings into the screen to pad out the abject nothingness of the show itself.It might work. It might not. But Shipwrecked is more than willing to change things up to reflect the television landscape, so maybe we will get the Fyre festival version next year. Please god, make it happen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4def8260020e2d2e7a4f946c6bd7106a438a15fb/0_150_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e37f1b4647bd9a6a4d10b58f813cf57","title":"government shutdown cost us economy 11bn","story":"The shutdown triggered by a fight over funding for Donald Trump’s proposed border wall with Mexico ended on Friday and was the longest in US history.According to the CBO the shutdown hurt economic growth because it affected roughly 800,000 workers and delayed federal spending on goods and services.Much of the money will be recouped now the government is open again but the CBO calculates $3bn will never be recovered and the full impact of the closure – which left hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors without pay – may be larger.The CBO warned “all of the estimated effects and their timing are subject to considerable uncertainty”.The five-week shutdown delayed approximately $18bn in federal discretionary spending for compensation and purchases of goods and services and suspended some federal services.“CBO’s estimates do not incorporate other, more indirect negative effects of the shutdown, which are more difficult to quantify but were probably becoming more significant as it continued,” the report said. “For example, some businesses could not obtain federal permits and certifications, and others faced reduced access to loans provided by the federal government. Such factors were probably beginning to lead firms to postpone investment and hiring decisions.”The impact of the shutdown may become clearer this week when the Federal Reserve meets to discuss interest rate policy and the latest jobs figures are released.The Fed is not expected to raise rates after its meeting but its chair, Jerome Powell, will hold a press conference and is expected to comment on the impact of the shutdown.On Friday the labor department releases its latest monthly jobs figures.

However, Denmark’s planned 42-mile (70km) fence along the German border is intended to keep out not people but wild boars, which authorities say threaten to bring disease to Danish pig farms.Construction on the fence was beginning on Monday along the northern edge of the German state of Schleswig-Holstein. Danish lawmakers and the country’s environmental agency approved the project last summer, arguing it would help farmers protect their pigs against African swine fever (ASF).The disease, lethal for pigs, has not yet been spotted in Denmark or Germany but it is common in eastern Europe and there was a small outbreak in Belgium last autumn.Though the threat of ASF may not sound alarming on its face, pigs and pork production are no joke in Denmark. The country has nearly twice as many pigs as people\u0026nbsp– it’s home to more than 12 million pigs across 3,000 farms, compared with a human population of just under 6 million – and pig exports account for billions of pounds annually.The wall will be electrified and will measure 1.5 metres (5ft) tall, theoretically low enough to allow larger animals such as deer to jump over but high enough to keep out the boars. It will cover fields and open land, leaving roads and path unblocked.On the German side of the border, there is scepticism about how effective such a fence will be. Research has shown that the biggest risk of spreading ASF comes from contaminated equipment or discarded food.Environmentalists have claimed the fence will disrupt the habitats of other wild animals, including wolves, otters and jackals. And at a time when Europe is debating the merits of borderless travel, erecting a physical barrier also sends a message. Denmark reinstituted border checks three years ago, and many other European countries including Germany have debated doing the same.“Such a fence creates a visible border,” Martin Ellermann, mayor of the German border town of Harrislee, told the regional broadcaster NDR. Ellermann and other local leaders have appealed to the state premier, Daniel Günther, imploring him to consider its local impact.Construction of the fence is expected to conclude later this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f683dac8affb4d46a26eb4601a5166f59a36d4d5/0_237_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15298e4d9f683a4be5a2683a59e06887","title":"fate of castles in the air in turkeys 151m ghost town","story":"Drone footage of 300 chateaux in abandoned development lays bare challenges facing Turkish economyDrone footage of an eerie abandoned urban development of mini castles in Turkey has shone a light on the troubles facing the country’s economy.Burj al Babas, billed as a luxury housing development near Mudurnu, a village roughly halfway between Istanbul and Ankara, was left unfinished last year after its developers Sarot Property Group went bankrupt.The future of the 300 closely packed chateaux – which cost an estimated £151m to build – is now uncertain and the project has become a cautionary tale for other developers in Turkey’s debt-laden construction sector.Work began in 2014 on units primarily designed as holiday homes for wealthy Gulf tourists. The plans also included Turkish baths and an entertainment complex.Only a handful of the £379,000 Disney-style homes were sold, however, and several investors have since pulled out, Mezher Yerdelen, deputy chair of the Sarot Property Group, told Agence France-Presse.Of 732 planned buildings, 587 were completed, and the company is now £20m in debt.The construction project has long been hated by Mudurnu locals, who say it is not in keeping with the area’s traditional architecture, characterised by Byzantine buildings, traditional Ottoman wooden houses and a 600-year-old mosque.Since Burj al Babas got the go-ahead, the Turkish government has introduced new building regulations designed to preserve local character and heritage. In several places, housing developments must now be low-rise and fit in with existing neighbourhoods.But it may be too late to undo some of the damage, said Yaşar Adnan Adanalı, an Istanbul-based urban development researcher. “I worry that projects like Burj al Babas opened Pandora’s box, in some respects,” he said. “Developments without proper planning that do not contextualise the geography and history of their surroundings have exploded in Turkey since.”The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has encouraged a construction boom during his time in office, hailing large, job-heavy infrastructure projects as the engine of the Turkish economy.However, the weakening Turkish lira has left many companies struggling to pay off the foreign currency debt borrowed to finance projects, stalling work and bankrupting companies. The collapsing construction bubble has resulted in half-finished high-rises and ghost towns all over the country.Atilla Yesilada, Turkey analyst for GlobalSource Partners, an emerging markets analysis firm, said Burj al Babas’s fate was a snapshot of the wider malaise plaguing the Turkish construction sector. “It’s not just the homebuilders who go bankrupt. The people who supply goods to those industries – the architects, the technicians, the glass makers – those people suffer too,” he said.Last year, Turkey slashed the financial and investment criteria for foreigners to become Turkish citizens, in a move it is hoped will double annual property investment by foreigners to around £7.6bn.Despite no sure indications that the country’s economic woes will reverse in the near future, Sarot Group is still hopeful Gulf investors, lured by the prospect of Turkish passports, will return and Burj al Babas will be finished.“We only need to sell 100 villas to pay off our debt,” said Yerdelen. “I believe we can get over this crisis in four to five months and partially inaugurate the project in 2019.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b84ce2724b1c86446f388091af16193e37d0a8b6/0_60_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02a01ccc26599c98124f662526d78fd0","title":"houthis withdrawal in yemen is delayed says un special envoy","story":"Plans for prisoner exchanges have also not gone to plan, says Martin GriffithsDeadlines for a retreat of Houthi troops in Yemen, agreed in talks last month, have had to be delayed, the UN special envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, has said. He also conceded plans for prisoner exchanges have not gone to plan.Griffiths also had to deny that the retired general Patrick Cammaert, appointed by the UN to implement the ceasefire in the Red Sea port of Hodeidah, had quit due to disagreements with Griffiths’s team.Griffiths confirmed Cammaert, a retired Dutch general, was leaving after only weeks in the job, but said he had always been on a short-term contract and there had been no dispute between the two men after the general’s convoy was fired upon in Hodeidah.Cammaert had been struggling to persuade the two sides to attend a regional coordination committee, seen as central to building trust, and ironing out disagreements over what was agreed in peace talks in Stockholm last month.Griffiths also rejected a call from the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis for the UN to declare the ceasefire is over. Such an announcement would be taken as a signal for the Saudi-backed forces to renew their offensive to capture the Houthi-held port city, seen by the Saudis as central to the Houthis’ effort to remain in power in the populated north of the country.For nearly four years, the Saudis and the United Arab Emirates have been giving financial and military backing to the UN-recognised government of Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi to regain power but have found the Iranian-backed Houthi resistance stronger than anticipated.Speaking to the Arab newspaper Asharq al-Awsat, Griffiths said “timelines have been extended. The original deadlines were rather ambitious. We are dealing with a complex situation on the ground.” But he said he “categorically rejected” calls to name the party obstructing the Stockholm agreement.“I believe that the political leadership of both parties is determined to put an end to the suffering of the Yemeni people.” He accepted “the situation was volatile”, but said “the ceasefire is generally holding despite any security incidents that have been taking place.“General Cammaert’s plan was to stay in Yemen for a rather short period of time to ... lay the ground for establishing the Hodeidah mission. All the speculations about other reasons for the general’s departure are not accurate.”The Yemeni foreign ministry said in a statement on Saturday that the Houthis had dodged the implementation of the Hodeidah agreement, refused to open safe corridors for the delivery of aid, and bombed Red Sea wheat silos, destroying badly needed aid.Yemeni government ministers personally met the UN secretary general, António Guterres, on Friday to demand he do more to enforce the agreement.Griffiths’s gloss on the state of the talks either reflects subtle progress towards a ceasefire only visible to those deeply involved in the talks, or the optimism required for a diplomat desperate to preserve the best and only chance for peace in Yemen. He is travelling to Yemen again this week to push for progress.In London 14 British-based aid groups urged both sides in the civil war to remember that the people of Yemen come first, adding commercial aid is not yet flowing to the level needed to restore vital imports of food and medicine. A large number of ships are waiting outside the port seeking permission to dock.Speaking from Hodeidah, Salem Baobaid, Islamic Relief’s head of office coordinator, said: “Until now, little has changed for ordinary people. After the months and months of bombing, shelling and starvation, it will take much more than a ceasefire to start breathing life into people who have been living on the edge of death for so long.“Things are so bad that large groups of people have started living in squalid, toxic conditions on the edge of the city’s main, highly contaminated garbage dump – just so they can forage for scraps.”He said members of his aid team had been killed by stray bullets and shelling was continuing.Baobaid said he had recently met Faiza, an 11-month-old girl weighing 5kg who had to come into the centre with her mother. “She barely moved, and had wide opened eyes … She barely cried. Her face was so pale it scared me. She had very bad diarrhoea and her mother was so exhausted that she could not breastfeed her properly.“When I first saw her, I thought she only had a few days left in this world. Luckily, we were able to help her and she is now out of danger.” He said there were 400,000 other children in the same state.In common with other aid workers, he said difficulties in getting permits to transport aid remained a huge problem with roadblocks every 20 minutes or so on the road between Hodeidah and Yemen’s capital, Sana’a.Other aid workers said the conflict was shifting from Hodeida and areas previously outside the fighting were now being sucked into the battles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6527950a053565ec910be5b4819bc7d0979a6914/0_52_1875_1125/master/1875.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a611767a694a814c19447ae347190083","title":"us and taliban reach framework peace deal reports","story":"Afghan president assured rights will not be compromised as US envoy reported progress in talks with insurgentsAshraf Ghani has assured his people their rights will not be compromised in the name of peace with the Taliban, after the US reported significant progress in talks with the insurgents.According to the Times, the “framework deal, which still has to be fleshed out before it becomes an agreement”, will see the Taliban commit to guaranteeing Afghan territory is not used as a “platform for international terrorist groups or iniduals”.The deal, the Times said, could lead to a full pullout of US troops in return for a ceasefire and Taliban talks with the Afghan government.On Monday, speaking after six days of talks in Qatar, a senior US government official told Reuters Washington was committed to withdrawing foreign forces and ending more than 17 years of war. The official, who declined to be identified, described “significant progress” but said more negotiations were needed on a ceasefire.“Of course we don’t seek a permanent military presence in Afghanistan,” the official said, from the capital Kabul. “Our goal is to help bring peace in Afghanistan and we would like a future partnership, newly defined with a post-peace government. We would like to leave a good legacy.”In an address to the nation, Ghani tried to assure Afghans no deals would be made without his full participation.“Our commitment is to provide peace and to prevent any possible disaster,” he said. “There are values that are not disputable, such as national unity, national sovereignty and territorial integrity.”Ghani and Khalilzad met late on Sunday in Kabul. Ghani’s office said on Monday the US envoy shared details of talks in Qatar. It quoted Khalilzad as saying he had discussed a ceasefire but that there was no progress on that issue. Khalilzad did not confirm the statement – or his remarks to the Times.The Taliban have been staging near-daily attacks against Afghan forces in an offensive that has not let up despite the severe winter. That has made peace an even more pressing issue.Monday’s statement from Ghani’s office claimed the Taliban demanded from Khalilzad the withdrawal of all foreign troops, but that there was no agreement on that issue. The statement added that Khalilzad had no authority to discuss issues such as a future Afghan administration but that his goal was to facilitate direct talks between the Taliban and Kabul.Abdul Hakim Mujahid, a former Taliban official and currently a member of the high peace council, an independent body of clerics and respected figures, said he believed the Qatar talks resulted in a “good understanding between both sides” but that more discussions were needed.“Afghanistan’s problem is not so simple that it can be solved in a day, week or month, it needs more time and more discussions,” Mujahid said.The Taliban have in the past refused to negotiate directly with Kabul, a stance that does not appear to have changed. They have maintained that they are prepared to talk with US officials only and only about the pullout of foreign forces.The Afghan political analyst Waheed Muzhda said he believed Khalilzad and the Taliban had reached agreement on both the withdrawal of US forces and a ceasefire deal, but that neither side was prepared to say so.“Peace talks are not possible unless both sides first agree on a ceasefire,” he said.The US led an international coalition that invaded Afghanistan after the 911 attacks in 2001, to topple the Taliban, who were harbouring Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida.The US has about 14,000 troops in Afghanistan as part of a Nato-led mission and a US counter-terrorism mission largely directed at groups such as Islamic State and al-Qaida. Some 8,000 troops from 38 other countries are participating in the operation, known as Resolute Support.Despite US-led foreign forces training, advising and assisting their Afghan counterparts, the Taliban control nearly half of the country and stage near-daily attacks against the western-backed Afghan government. Ghani said last week 45,000 members of the security forces have been killed since he took office in 2014.There were reports last month that the US was considering pulling out almost half of its forces, but a White House spokesman said Donald Trump had not issued orders. However, the administration has not denied the reports.Taliban sources told Reuters on Saturday that the US had agreed on the withdrawal of foreign troops within 18 months of the signing of a pact. The US official who spoke to Reuters said a timeline was not discussed."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Nikita Somerville from Dublin denies cruelty to \u0026lsquomalnourished\u0026rsquo Pomeranian at her homeFamily members travelled to Kuala Lumpur after Galway man (31) disappearedGarda cites \u0026lsquodata protection\u0026rsquo as it tells users to take down videos featuring registrationsLiam O\u0026rsquoDwyer (45) of Capparoe, Adare, sexually abused girl over course of five yearsGenomics Medicine Ireland says it cannot identify participants in children\u0026rsquos hospital studyJudge makes orders for transfer abroad as no appropriate facility to address condition hereINMO to attend hearing this afternoon but preparations for 24-hour strike will continueLate delivery of vessel from German shipbuilder led to thousands of cancellationsFour men from Gortahork, Falcarragh and Gweedore, killed in crash are named locallyDublin man charged after being arrested with \u0026euro23,000 in a suitcase at Belfast airportKeith Connorton sentenced to life imprisonment for death of Graham McKeeverPolice say animal has been found and is \u0026lsquobeing returned to its home at Belfast Zoo\u0026rsquoHamilton spent five years in the role and almost 34 years in police serviceJoseph Hillen (24) sentenced to six years for Co Louth manslaughter of Martin MulliganFormer basketball coach faces 171 charges relating to three complainants in 1970s and 1980sMet \u0026Eacuteireann issues a five-day weather warning with some \u0026lsquosignificant\u0026rsquo snow falls expectedPSNI launches murder investigation into attack at Cluan PlaceHSE outlines impact of proposed 24-hour work stoppage on WednesdayFifth road death on Sunday after four young men died in west DonegalMural part of \u0026lsquoIt Stops Now\u0026rsquo campaign to dispel popular myths about sexual violence"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3772634.1548622836!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit dublin says deal could be reopened if uk moves on red lines","story":"Speaking on The Andrew Marr Show on BBC, Tánaiste Simon Coveney has said the backstop isn\u0027t going to change in any renegotiations on Brexit.   Video: BBC The Andrew Marr ShowThe Government is willing to see the Brexit deal reopened if the United Kingdom wants to stay in a permanent customs union with the EU or allows for Northern Ireland-specific measures to avoid a hard border.Sources in Dublin said the withdrawal agreement – which the EU has publicly so far said is the only deal on the table – could be renegotiated if Britain moves from its own so-called “red lines”.The withdrawal agreement is one part of the overall package struck between the EU and UK last November. It is the 585 page, legally-binding element which spells out of the terms of how the UK leaves the EU.The second part is the looser joint political declaration, which sketches out the shape of the post-Brexit relationship between the UK and the bloc. Thus far, the EU has emphasised this element as the method by which it could respond to changing British priorities.Well-placed sources now acknowledge that the withdrawal agreement itself could be reopened, although it is maintained that this has always been a possibility.Such a move would require the article 50 negotiating period to be extended.While the UK has asked for changes on the backstop – the insurance policy to prevent a hard border if there is no future EU-UK trade deal – sources say they have offered nothing in return.“Nothing is being offered in return for a concession,” said a source, adding examples of UK concessions that could include “permanent customs union or NI (Northern Ireland) specific arrangement”.The customs union requires that its members impose no tariffs on goods traded among each other, and sets a common duty on the goods of non-members.Recent days have seen senior Irish figures strongly rule out any change to the backstop, the element of the withdrawal agreement which is the main stumbling block to it passing a vote in the House of Commons.Tánaiste Simon Coveney on Sunday said there will be no change to the backstop, and added it cannot be replaced with an “aspirational” hope or commitment. He told the BBC nobody has come up with an alternative to it.The backstop would see the entire UK remain in a common customs area with the EU, with adds-on in respect of both customs and regulations for Northern Ireland. Mr Coveney said it will not be changed.“The backstop is already a compromise,” he said. He said a review mechanism had already been stitched into it, and warned: “The European Parliament will not ratify a withdrawal agreement that doesn’t have a backstop in it. It’s as simple as that.”In the UK on Tuesday, MPs will debate the next steps the government should take on Brexit, with amendments proposing alternative courses of action. Senior Conservative backbenchers led by 1922 Committee chairman Graham Brady have tabled an amendment calling for prime minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal to be approved on condition that the backstop is replaced with alternative measures to prevent a hard border.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The delay in the delivery of the vessel from the German shipyard building it led to the cancellation of thousands of bookings on ferry crossings between Dublin and France between July and September last year with about 30,000 passengers caught up in the wave of cancellations.In a ruling published on Monday, the National Transport Authority (NTA) determined that the delay in delivery was not an “extraordinary circumstance” and could have been avoided. As a result the company can not use that as a get-out clause when asked to pay compensation to affected passengers. The sailings cancelled last summer have already cost Irish Continental Group (ICG), Irish Ferries parent, €13 million with most of that cost linked to re-accommodating customers. Passengers impacted by the cancellations may be entitled to payment of travel expenses and compensation with the level due depending on the cost of the ticket.A family made up of two adults and two children who paid €1,000 for their ferry crossing before facing signficant delays could expect to get around €500 back in compensation. The NTA saidaffected passengers should address potential claims with relevant details to Irish Ferries and it confirmed that it would carryout compliance checks in the months ahead.On April 21st last, Irish Ferries said the German shipyard FSG had told it delivery of its €147 million WB Yeats had been delayed due to receiving parts late from suppliers. It cancelled thousands of booking on sailings whcih from Dublin to Cherbourg and Cherbourg to Dublin had been scheduled in July .On June 12th, the company announced that “due to extraordinary circumstances beyond its control, the delivery of the WB Yeats has been further delayed by FSG” and said it had no option but to cancel all planned sailings to France on the ship for the summer. As the regulator overseeing ferry travel, the NTA launched an investigation. “The authority was not satisfied that the unavailability of WB Yeats is an extraordinary circumstance hindering the performance of the cancelled passenger services which could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken,” it said in a ruling published on Monday. It said Irish Ferries had failed - or is continuing to fail - to comply with notices served on which require it to pay impacted passengers who have already requested compensation. It also said passengers impacted by the cancelled sailings where such impacted passengers had to travel to and from Rosslare rather than Dublin andor to and from Roscoff rather than Cherbourg, would have to be reimbursed for any additional costs incurred.The authority has given Irish Ferries a period of two months to comply with its ruling.This is the first time EU regulations governing sea transport have been tested in a significant way as widespread cancellations are very rare on passenger ferries.Under EU Regulations 1177 2010, anyone affected by a ferry cancellation can choose between an alternative sailing or a full refund. They are also entitled to overnight accommodation if necessary, provided by the ferry company where possible, limited to €80 per night up to a maximum of three nights. The EU rules also state that passengers may be entitled to compensation depending on the length of the delay to or from a destination, as long as delays are not caused by severe weather or extraordinary circumstances. The amount to be paid is calculated as a percentage of the ticket cost.

Photograph: Tolga AkmenAFPGetty ImagesThe House of Commons is due to vote on Tuesday on a series of amendments relating to the Brexit process.This follows the defeat by 432 votes to 202 earlier this month of the withdrawal deal secured by prime minister Theresa May, and procedural moves by backbenchers ensuring that MPs got the opportunity to vote on amendments proposing other options.There are 19 currently submitted, including some amendments to amendments. However more can be submitted up to 10.30pm on Monday, and the Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow will then select a smaller number - expected to be in the range of four-to-six - on which MPs will vote on Tuesday evening.The British government’s tactics are also unclear. We do not yet know if the government is tabling its own amendment or whether it will encourage its MPs to back one of the anti-backstop amendments.Any successful amendments will not have the force of law, but will carry heavy political weight as a signal to Downing Street and Brussels of what kind of Brexit MPs are likely to approve. Here are some of the most prominent amendments and the view the Irish Government is likely to take of them:1. Grieve and Cooper amendments: In a bid to prevent a no-deal Brexit, the cross-party backed proposal from Conservative MP Dominic Grieve would effectively wrest control of Commons business from the government for six inidual days in the run-up to the UK’s scheduled withdrawal date of March 29th with the intention of getting MPs to reach a consensus on how to handle it.In a similar vein, a move by Labour former minister Yvette Cooper, supported by Tories such as Nick Boles, calls for a vote on a Bill that would give parliament control over the Brexit process if Mrs May fails to secure a deal by February 26th. MPs would get a vote on extending Article 50 to the end of the year and preventing a no-deal exit under the terms of the Bill. The Labour frontbench has been publicly flirting with throwing its weight behind the amendment. Irish view: As pressure grows on Dublin over its preparations for a possible no-deal at the end of March, the Government will welcome any move which stops a lurch towards a no-deal Brexit. The Government here would also hope that more discussion in the House of Commons might move the UK’s approach towards a softer version of Brexit, given the fact most MPs favour this outcome. An extension to Article 50 would be welcomed by the Government to avoid a no-deal.However Irish Ministers and officials are also conscious that this could also prolong the uncertainty. The debate in the UK also seems to take for granted that the EU would agree to an extension of Article 50 and thus a delay in the UK’s exit date. It probably would, but only if presented with a clear reason to do so and and the EU side may seek certain conditions on an extension.2. Brake on the backstop: Senior Conservative figures , including 1922 Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady and former minister Andrew Murrison want a deadline of the end of December 2021 put on the backstop proposal intended to avoid a hard border in Ireland. The amendment is believed to be viewed favourably by Downing Street as a way of showing Brussels that the withdrawal agreement could get through the Commons if concessions are made regarding Northern Ireland. Another amendment from the same two MPs seeks that the backstop is “replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border”, though it does not say what these alternatives might be.There are also proposed amendments calling for a six-month limit on the backstop or a right by the UK to exit it unilaterally. Irish view: The Government has said that the backstop, as included in the withdrawal agreement, must remain and cannot be time-limited. However, on Monday The  reported that the Government would consider re-opening the withdrawal agreement if the British red lines moved. Similarly, the EU has indicated it would be prepared to reexamine the issue if the UK changed its red lines – for example, as the Labour Party has called for, committing to remain in a customs union and aligned to single market regulations.However if, on the basis of a Commons vote, Mrs May just requests that the backstop be dropped or time-limited then the answer will be ‘No’ and the uncertainty will continue. Irish Government sources were clear on Monday that both Brady and Murrison amendments in their current form were a non-runner.3. No to no-deal: A cross-party effort headed by Tory Dame Caroline Spelman has widespread support and rejects the UK quitting the EU without a withdrawal agreement. This would probably be more palatable to Mrs May’s government than either the Grieve or Cooper bids for MPs to take back control.Ireland’s views: Ireland supports the withdrawal agreement so this approach would provide some comfort. However, the House of Commons still has to agree on a way forward if a no-deal exit is to be avoided. Just deciding that it should not happen will not be enough. “We are still at the stage of Westminster negotiating with itself,” said one Irish Government source.4. Labour’s twin track approach: This calls for MPs to be able to vote on options to stop a no-deal exit, such as a customs union with the EU, as well as the possibility of a new Brexit referendum. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, however, has been careful not to commit his party to officially back a second poll.Amendments have been tacked on to the Labour “options” proposal, with the Liberal Democrats calling for Remain to be on the ballot paper in any referendum, while Labour backbenchers want parliament to legislate for a public vote. Separately, the chairman of the Exiting the European Union select committee Hilary Benn wants a series of votes on various Brexit options to see where the most support lies.Ireland’s view: For Ireland, the prospect of a second referendum raises the possibility of the UK deciding to stay in the EU, clearly the ideal outcome for the Irish Government. However all sides say that the outcome of a vote cannot be taken for granted.With a majority in the House of Commons seeming to favour a softer Brexit, any mechanism allowing a series of votes may point in this direction. However time is running out.While Dublin may face difficult choices in the weeks, it now must wait to see what the House of Commons decides on Tuesday - and how this affects the British government’s position - before deciding how to proceed. - Additional reporting PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3773308.1548684854!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hundreds of castles abandoned in strange turkey ghost estate","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHundreds of houses in the Burj al Babas project, close to the town centre of Mudurnu in the Bolu northwestern region of Turkey, in December 2018. The project’s developers,  Sarot Property Group, went bankrupt. Photograph: Adem AltanAFPGetty Images)Drone footage of an eerie abandoned urban development of mini castles in Turkey has shone a light on the troubles facing the country’s economy.Burj al Babas, billed as a luxury housing development near Mudurnu, a village roughly halfway between Istanbul and Ankara, was left unfinished last year after its developers Sarot Property Group went bankrupt.The future of the 300 closely packed chateaux – which cost an estimated €174 million to build – is now uncertain, and the dystopian sight has become a cautionary tale for other developers in Turkey’s debt-laden construction sector.Work began on Burj al Babas in 2014, with units primarily designed as holiday homes for wealthy Gulf tourists. The town plans were also supposed to include Turkish baths and an entertainment complex.Only a handful of the €436,000 Disney castle style homes were sold, however, and several investors have since pulled out, Mezher Yerdelen, deputy chair of the Sarot Property Group, told Agence France-Presse.Of 732 planned homes, 587 were completed, and the company is now €23 milllion in debt.The construction project has long been hated by Mudurnu locals, who say it is not in keeping with the area’s traditional architecture, characterised by Byzantine buildings, traditional Ottoman wooden houses and a 600-year-old mosque.Since Burj al Babas got the go-ahead, the Turkish government has introduced new building regulations designed to preserve local character and heritage: in several places, housing developments must now be low-rise and fit in with existing neighbourhoods.But it may be too late to undo some of the damage, said Yasar Adnan Adanali, an Istanbul-based urban development researcher.“I worry that projects like Burj al Babas opened Pandora’s box, in some respects,” he said. “Developments without proper planning that do not contextualise the geography and history of their surroundings have exploded in Turkey since.”The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has encouraged a construction boom during his time in office, hailing large, job-heavy infrastructure projects as the engine of the Turkish economy.However, the weakening Turkish lira has left many companies struggling to pay off the foreign currency debt borrowed to finance projects, stalling work and bankrupting companies. The collapsing construction bubble has resulted in half-finished high-rises and ghost towns all over the country.Burj al Babas’s fate is a snapshot of the wider malaise plaguing the Turkish construction sector, said Atilla Yesilada, Turkey analyst for GlobalSource Partners, an emerging markets analysis firm.“It’s not just the homebuilders who go bankrupt. The people who supply goods to those industries – the architects, the technicians, the glass and steel makers – those people suffer too,” he said.Despite no indications Turkey’s economic woes will reverse in the near future, Sarot Group is still hopeful Gulf investors will return to Turkey and Burj al Babas will be finished.“We only need to sell 100 villas to pay off our debt,” said Yerdelen. “I believe we can get over this crisis in four to five months and partially inaugurate the project in 2019.” – "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3773612.1548694254!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit eu open to alternative arrangements to backstop","story":"Speaking on The Andrew Marr Show on BBC, Tánaiste Simon Coveney has said the backstop isn\u0027t going to change in any renegotiations on Brexit.

File photograph: Dario PignatelliBloomberg via Getty ImagesThe EU is open to “alternative arrangements” to the Irish backstop – as cited in a key British legislative proposal on the Brexit treaty – but for now no such alternatives exist, a senior EU negotiator said on Monday.Referring to an amendment to Brexit legislation proposed by a supporter of British prime minister Theresa May, Sir Graham Brady, who wants “alternative arrangements”, deputy chief EU negotiator Sabine Weyand said that the withdrawal agreement already contained that possibility.“We are open to alternative arrangements” on the Irish Border, she told a conference. “The problem with the Brady amendment is that it does not spell out what they are.“It’s not a criticism of them because they don’t exist.”However, she urged British politicians not to view the backstop, which would keep the UK in a customs arrangement with the EU until a better way is found to avoid checks on the Border, as pre-judging how a better trade deal may be struck:“The backstop is not a prerequisite for the future relationship,” she said. “We are open to alternative proposals.”She also said if and when EU leaders discuss delaying Brexit by agreeing to extend negotiations, they “will require certain elements of information . . . and one of them is the purpose of extension”.“They would want to be reassured about that at the end of the extension there will be clarity,” she said. “The idea of going into serial extensions is not very popular on the EU side.”Ms Weyand also said she was unsure the UK would be able to handle the consequences of leaving the EU without a deal.Meanwhile, Downing Street has refused to say which Brexit amendments it could support in the series of votes on Tuesday.The House of Commons will consider amendments to a motion on the prime minister’s Brexit plan on Tuesday evening, some seeking to avert a no-deal departure and others trying to water down the backstop.On Sunday, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said there would be no change to the backstop.

So it was apt that he was charged with skulduggery in part for threatening to kidnap a therapy dog – a fluffy, sweet-faced Coton de Tuléar, belonging to Randy Credico, a New York radio host.Robert Mueller believes that Credico, a pal of Julian Assange, served as an intermediary with WikiLeaks for Stone. Mueller’s indictment charges that Stone called Credico “a rat” and “a stoolie” because he believed that the radio host was not going to back up what the special counsel says is Stone’s false story about contacts with WikiLeaks, which disseminated Russia’s hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman.As the owner of two Yorkies, Stone clearly knows how scary it is when a beloved dog is in harm’s way. When he emerged from court on Friday, he immediately complained that FBI agents had “terrorised” his dogs when they came to arrest him at dawn at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.The last thing Stone posted on Instagram before his arrest was a video of a terrier, with a high-pitched voice-over, protesting, “Roger Stone did nothing wrong.”Always bespoke and natty, living by the mantra that it’s better to be infamous than never famous, Stone looked strangely unadorned as he came out of court to meet the press in a navy polo shirt and blue jeans.As the master of darkness who had been captured in darkness stepped into the bright light of Fort Lauderdale, he was his usual flamboyant, unapologetically meretricious self. He proclaimed his innocence, flashed the Nixon victory sign and reiterated the old saw from his mentor, Roy Cohn, that any attention is good attention.But it fell flat. Being Roger Stone had finally caught up with him.He has always said Florida suited him because “it was a sunny place for shady people” borrowing a Somerset Maugham line. But now the cat’s cradle of lies and dirty tricks had tripped up the putative dognapper. And it went down on the very same day that Paul Manafort – his former associate in a seamy lobbying firm with rancid dictators as clients, and then later his pal in the seamy campaign of Donald Trump – was also in federal court on charges related to the Mueller probe. Manafort’s hair is now almost completely white.One of Stone’s rules – along with soaking his martini olives in vermouth and never wearing a double-breasted suit with a button-down collar – is “Deny, deny, deny.” But his arrest for lying, obstructing and witness tampering raised the inevitable question about his on-and-off friend in the White House, the man who is the last jigsaw-puzzle piece in the investigation of Trumpworld’s alleged co-ordination with Russia: Is being Donald Trump finally about to catch up with Donald Trump?Stone, who famously has Nixon’s face tattooed on his back, is the agent provocateur who is the through line from Nixon, and his impeachment, to Trump, and his possible impeachment.As Manafort said in the 2017 documentary Get Me Roger Stone, Trump and Stone “see the world in a very similar way”. And that way is theatrical and cynical. Do whatever you have to do to get what you want playing by the rules is for suckers.In 1999, when I went on a trip to Miami to watch Trump test the presidential waters, Stone orchestrated Trump’s Castro-bashing speech to Cuban-Americans. The bodybuilding, swinging strategist, christened “the state-of-the-art sleazeball” by the New Republic in the 1980s, said he was “a jockey looking for a horse”.Stone, who was mixed up in Watergate at the tender age of 19, “made the transition from the Stone Age of dirty tricks to today”, as David Axelrod puts it.He watched Nixon rally the silent majority with a law-and-order message and racial dog whistling. He helped Ronald Reagan create Reagan Democrats.For decades, believing “past is prologue”, Stone urged Trump to be the successor to those pols, revving up angry, white working-class voters who felt belittled or scared of “the other”. It would be so easy to ide and stoke resentment, as Stone and Trump proved when they inflamed the birther controversy against Barack Obama.“Hate is a stronger motivator than love,” Stone told the documentarians. “Human nature has never changed.”The tribal tensions in America made Stone’s favourite tricks easier than ever he didn’t have to operate in the shadows. He wore a T-shirt with Bill Clinton and the word “Rape” at 2016 campaign rallies. As Stone boasted in the documentary, his “slash-and-burn” tactics “are now in vogue”.Trump has had periods of estrangement with Stone. In 2008, in an interview with the New Yorker, he called the strategist “a stone-cold loser”, a state Trump himself has been relegated to this past week, courtesy of Nancy Pelosi.Stone will not go gently. When he is asked about the tattoo of Nixon, he says he got it to remind himself, “A man is not finished when he is defeated he is only finished when he quits.”At the moment, though – dogged by Mueller – Stone and Manafort are the dog’s breakfast. The pair have given practising the dark arts a bad name."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Perceived to be boring and nerdy, it’s looked down upon by its “cooler” banking and investment brethren. It’s even less cool than accounting. Just imagine that existence… Which is why it is surprising to find someone like Amanda Blanc, CEO of EMEA for Swiss insurer Zurich, operating in this market. She is rare in financial services, never mind insurance. First of all, she is a woman – famously, there are more CEOs in the UK called Dave than there are female CEOs. But, more than that, she is not the kind of personality you expect to find operating in an insurance boardroom. There is little, if any, corporate front. She is driven, compassionate, outspoken, funny, challenging and infectious company. Even a bit sweary. And she talks at a mile a minute in her strong Welsh accent, so much so it is often hard to keep up.

To achieve all of that by the age of 50 while holding down a succession of high-pressure jobs must require a hard-nosed determination to succeed from the outset. But apparently being a high powered CEO was never part of the plan. In fact, if she’d had her way, she would have been a professional musician but freely admits she wasn’t good enough. The FCA\u0027s report into insurance pricing is deeply troubling City watchdog to probe home and car insurance marketsAdults carry out 109 \u0027life admin\u0027 tasks every year, research reveals“When I started working, I had two job offers,” she says. “One for the local council and one for the insurer, Commercial Union in Luton. I didn’t really know what insurance was. All I knew was that if I worked for the council, I would never leave Wales and I wanted to do something different.” Although she did indeed leave Wales, finally settling in Hampshire, she has made a point of maintaining her roots with regular visits “home”. “It’s still very important to me. I love Wales and the people there. It is completely grounded. When I go back home, I’m not a chief executive, I am who I’ve always been.”So how did a working class woman from the Rhondda Valley navigate her way to the top in what is a notoriously cutthroat and unforgiving environment? Blanc places a lot of the credit for her progress at the feet of some very supportive and encouraging mentors throughout her career, a role she in turn has assumed for others. Although she has never felt that either her gender or background has held her back, she is acutely aware that a lack of ersity in her industry is a problem and that women in particular require greater support and encouragement.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney being interviewed by host Andrew Marr on the BBC1 current affairs programme, Simon Coveney told the Show that the EU would not ratify a Brexit deal without a backstop.Michael Russell, the Scottish government\u0027s minister with responsibility for Brexit negotiations attends a Rally for Europe at Augustine United Church in Edinburgh, Scotland.

I see it in the women I mentor and the women I work with,” she says.“They’ll see a role they want to go for but if they can only fulfil nine out of the 10 requirements they will go away and create a development plan for that one thing. Only once they can tick that box will they think they can do the job. “You don’t see men respond in the same way. They think, ‘I can do five out of 10, I’m raring to go!’” A risk-averse culture within the industry is a major part of the problem, she says, and believes that without change, insurance will continue to be the land of men in dark\u0026nbspgrey suits and the boring alternative in financial services.“We need to encourage people to take risks – whether it’s headhunters, regulators, organisations or the women themselves. It’s like there is no room for error for women ... You don\u0027t see men respond in the same way“We need to work much harder at ensuring people get the opportunity to develop their careers in the way they want as it’s only then we will start to change the culture.”While she freely admits that changing the culture and the makeup of an organisation, never mind an industry, is incredibly difficult, she is adamant that the introduction of greater ersity is vital for the survival of both.“Any ersity changes things for the better. If you look back to the financial crisis of 2008, one of the main criticisms was, that around the boardrooms, everyone was the same. They indulged in group think.“The only way you can get away from group think is to introduce greater ersity, whether that is by age, gender, ethnicity or whatever. It doesn’t really matter.“What matters is having people that will come at things from a different perspective. Once you have that, you need to have an open enough mindset to listen to these iniduals and then act on what they are telling you.”Taking up the industry’s defence, she pushes against the perception that insurance is an old boys’ club cloistered in the heart of London’s financial district and is at pains to highlight the core role it plays in the country’s economy. “There are hundreds of thousands of people working in insurance across the country, doing a fantastic job every day. “The country would not function without insurance. Planes would not take off. Schools would not open. Public transport wouldn’t leave the depot. Without insurance, how does the infrastructure of the world operate?”\u0026nbspshe asks. It is a compelling defence, but insurance continues to labour under its boring and old-fashioned personality and accusations of poor practice. However, if Blanc can walk the talk and others like her can drive change from within, perhaps insurance can indeed move out of the shadows of its financial services peers and finally get its house in order.A View from the TopOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Currently WhatsApp users are not required to provide their name or any other identifying information beyond their phone number to use the messaging app.Merging with Facebook Messenger and Instagram could force WhatsApp users to reveal information about themselves that they would prefer to keep private.Data privacy expert Tim Mackey, who works at the software firm Synopsys, told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspthat Facebook should take considerable care in how the integration ws handled given the firm\u0027s spotty history with user privacy.Merging personal information and privacy configurations from three significant applications won’t be trivial, he said. Facebook development teams would do well to look at this precedent and prioritise user privacy.With the integration project currently expected to take a year to complete, and with end-to-end encryption as part of the plan, we should expect the Facebook engineering teams to focus attention on uniform data security both in their platform and in the apps themselves.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That hasn\u0027t ever been possible before.At the moment, the three are entirely separate. Though they are all developed by the same company, and so share some data between themselves and work together, they are in practise three different apps that can\u0027t talk to each other.But this state of affairs has been gradually changing, even before this news. WhatsApp years ago started sharing data with Facebook, and the founders of both WhatsApp and Instagram have left the company in recent months amid suggestions they were concerned about their apps being subsumed into the parent company.Mark Zuckerberg hopes the decision will make each of the apps more useful, according to the original\u0026nbspNew York Times\u0026nbspreport. That in turn should make people engage with them more – and potentially encourage them to stop using rivals, like Apple\u0027s iMessage.“We want to build the best messaging experiences we can and people want messaging to be fast, simple, reliable and private, a Facebook spokesperon said.\u0026nbspWe\u0027re working on making more of our messaging products end-to-end encrypted and considering ways to make it easier to reach friends and family across networks. As you would expect, there is a lot of discussion and debate as we begin the long process of figuring out all the details of how this will work.”In short, Facebook believes the combined infrastructure will make the apps better, and therefore more likely to be used that, in turn, will help generate more of the data and advertising opportunities that Facebook relies on to make its money. But there might be other less obvious reasons to bring the three together, as well.Until now, the apps have been kept separate, and so the data they each collect has been partly compartmentalised too.People have also been able to share different data with the companies themselves. WhatsApp only requires a phone number for people to use it, allowing them to stay relatively anonymous if they wish on Facebook, people have to use their real name and are asked to give over far more personal information.Many people choose to share more on WhatsApp or even entirely forego Facebook, because the latter has always had a more lax approach to people\u0027s personal data. WhatsApp has repeatedly stressed how important it is safeguard people\u0027s privacy – but that was largely led by its founders, who have left the company, and is thought to be getting eroded as it is subsumed by Facebook.\u0026nbspIn short, the move could be a concern for anyone who prefers to keep their data separate – and away from Facebook. The sense of having some contacts, information or messages safe on WhatsApp and away from its owner, or vice versa, will be lost.It\u0027s possible that same data will be used for advertising, and there have already been rumours about WhatsApp using information for marketing or showing ads within the app itself. No final decision on how the integrated services will be monetised has been decided yet, the\u0026nbspNew York Times\u0026nbspreported.Regulators are likely to share those concerns, and it\u0027s almost certain there will be yet more questions about whether Facebook should be more restrained than it is now.Facebook is still in the early stages of the work, according to the reports. But the plan is set to be finished by the end of this year or the beginning of 2020.As with most Facebook projects, the rollout will probably be small at the beginning and gradually take place across users. It\u0027s likely that such a major update will be made available to a small number of beta testers initially before being added in stages.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

For Diane Abbott, a politician with extensive media experience, the show was a “horrible experience”, the worst of her many appearances on the programme. Having appeared on something like 30 episodes, that’s significant. After all, some of her early experiences were almost as eventful. \u0026nbspHer appearance on Question Time in July 1987 was particularly memorable. Abbott shared a panel with Liberal MP Cyril Smith and Conservative minister Michael Heseltine, with Robin Day in the chair. Then, as now, it was the discussion of opinion polls that caused uproar. The polls, Smith commented forcefully, showed that Labour was unelectable, “and one of the reasons for it,”\u0026nbsphe added, “is Diane Abbott and people like her...”\u0026nbspThe largely white audience applauded, and after a moment’s delay chuckled, seeming to get some unspoken joke. Abbott called him out:\u0026nbsp“If Mr Smith believes that having black people in parliament for the first time is in some sense a backward step, thousands of people that voted for me in Hackney North would disagree.”\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe response was immediate. For Heseltine this was beyond the pale. He appealed to Day to intervene. The audience protested vocally. “I honestly believe,”\u0026nbspsaid one white man, “that the vast majority of the audience here do not see Diane as a black person.”\u0026nbspThis went down well, as did his thought that Abbott was the panellist showing true prejudice for assuming that white people perceived race. Day wrapped up the discussion apologising to the audience for calling Abbott black, his implication being that unless he had said so, none of the white people in the crowd would have been able to tell.The way I was treated on Question Time was a disgraceThe 1987 episode exposes the nature of the assumptions of many white Britons about race in Thatcher’s Britain. Britain was, as Heseltine put it, a harmonious and tolerant country, white people were effectively “colourblind”, and black people who claimed otherwise were either deluded or harbouring their own anti-white prejudice.In the same way, last week’s Question Time says something important about the nature of our politics, its entrenched biases, and which political figures are taken seriously.Evidence of bias on the show is best illustrated through comparison. Abbott was interrupted twice as often as prisons minister Rory Stewart, even though Stewart spoke more often, and for more of the show. The introductions at the top of the show were far from even-handed. Stewart’s introduction covered his ministerial career, past and present, as well as his governorships in Iraq.For all her achievements, for all of her experience, Abbott was not treated with the same degree of respect as Stewart or Oakeshott, her voice was not given as much weightBy comparison, Abbott’s introduction was short on detail. What is more, by linking her position as shadow home secretary to her relationship with Jeremy Corbyn, there was an implication that Abbott owed her job to a personal relationship, rather than merit. Indeed, according to several audience members, this was precisely the point made by Fiona Bruce before the show. Equally, in introducing Abbott, Bruce failed to mention her time as shadow minister for public health, her years on the Foreign Affairs Select Committee or the Treasury Select Committee, nor did she mention that Abbott is the first black woman to be elected to the Commons.Then there was Bruce’s decision to side with journalist Isabel Oakeshott’s wholly inaccurate statement that Labour was “way behind... miles behind” in the polls. At the same time, she was quick to assure the audience that Abbott was “definitely” wrong in her contention that the two main parties were essentially “level pegging”. In reality, as the BBC has subsequently acknowledged, Abbott was correct.Although this was never said explicitly, the constant interruptions (21 times compared to nine interruptions of Stewart and eight of the SNP’s Kirsty Blackman), the minimisation of Abbott’s achievements, the willingness to “correct” Abbott when she was in the right, all indicate that in some important sense, Abbott was out of place. For all her achievements, for all of her experience, Abbott was not treated with the same degree of respect as Stewart or Oakeshott, her voice was not given as much weight:\u0026nbspin short, she was not treated as a serious political figure.Why not? Abbott’s treatment is perplexing. In some ways, her biography is similar to many of our political leaders. Educated at an elite university, she went on to have a career in Whitehall, then the media, and then parliament. But the fact that Abbott is a black woman, from a working-class family gives each stage of this story a different significance.She won her place at Cambridge in 1973, at a time when only 10 per cent of the university’s students were women. While the university did not collect data on student ethnicity at the time, recent research shows that she was the second black person to study at Newnham in its century-long history, and only the third black person to study history at Cambridge in the 750 years since the university’s foundation.For politicians such as Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson, success in university politics was part of their path to Westminster. Not so for Abbott, who had little time for college debating societies. Her antipathy to university politics is easy to explain. Enoch Powell was honorary president of the university’s Conservative Society when Abbott started at Cambridge, and women were excluded from many of Cambridge’s student societies. But more than that, Abbott found the concerns of student politics essentially elitist.Abbott’s path from university to parliament was anything but straightforward. She entered the Commons in 1987, at a time when there were no black people in the house, at a time when fewer than 5 per cent of MPs were women, and at a time when there was widespread suspicion of black radicalism. Abbott’s historic success was the result of a decade of activism, working with black organisations, and within the Labour Party.Accusing the BBC of bias over Diane Abbott is a step too farDiane Abbott rejects BBC response to Question Time rowLabour demands BBC footage and apology amid Abbott Question Time rowDiane Abbott accuses BBC of anti-Corbyn bias in stinging attackDiane Abbott accuses Question Time of legitimising ‘bias and abuse’In 1978 Abbott became involved with the Organisation of Women of African and Asian Descent (OWAAD), an umbrella organisation for black and Asian women’s groups. Founded by radicals including Stella Dadzie and Olive Morris, Abbott believed that the black womanism she encountered at OWAAD was far more sophisticated and rooted in the concerns of working-class black women\u0026nbspthan the student politics she had experienced at Cambridge. \u0026nbspIn 1983 Labour politics and black radicalism came together. Together with Russell Proffit, Elaine Foster, Marc Wadsworth\u0026nbspand others, Abbott founded the Labour Party Black Sections movement, which fought for black representation at all levels of the party, with a view to gaining black representation at all levels of government. Black Sections was\u0026nbspextraordinarily controversial. The right-wing press dubbed Abbott, Paul Boateng, Linda Bellos, Bernie Grant, Sharon Atkin and other LPBS activists “Black Extremists”, “Black Militants” and “Loony Left”.\u0026nbspIn 1997, Abbott led the first backbench rebellion against Tony Blair’s cuts to lone parent benefits. She was credited at the time for being the first MP to damage the new prime ministerThe movement was\u0026nbspno less controversial inside the Labour Party, and in the run-up to the 1987 election, black candidates were regularly deselected –\u0026nbspthe party leadership seemed to feel that white voters would not turn out for black candidates. In spite of this apparent hostility from the party leadership, in spite of constant attacks in the media, four Black Sections candidates won seats in the 1987 election, Abbott\u0026nbsp(the only woman) among them.Since 1987, Abbott has had a distinguished parliamentary career. Her first major campaign\u0026nbspas an MP\u0026nbspwas against the imprisoning of refugees on Britain’s first private jail, the Earl William, a recently privatised and hastily repurposed car ferry. Abbott visited the Tamil refugees, many of whom had fled torture, highlighting their squalid conditions, and the absence of medical care. The Thatcher government refused to back down, even when the floating prison, nicknamed “the hulk” due to its obvious disrepair, broke its moorings and ran aground in the great storm of October 1987.In 1997, Abbott led the first backbench rebellion against Tony Blair’s cuts to lone parent benefits. She was credited at the time for being the first MP to damage the new prime minister. Abbott also played an important role in exposing evidence of government complicity in the “arms to Africa” scandal. Someone at the top of government was clearly irked by Abbott’s efforts on the Foreign Affair Select Committee, for a government dossier on Abbott was leaked, containing material stolen from her a decade earlier.Abbott’s skill as a parliamentarian was not lost on The Spectator. The venerable right-wing journal awarded her parliamentary speech of the year in 2008, for her forensic critique of Gordon Brown’s proposed anti-terror laws. Abbott stood for the leadership of the Labour Party in 2010, and since joining the shadow cabinet she led Labour’s attack on the government over last year’s Windrush scandal.The first thing my staff have to do in the morning is go online and delete and block all the stuffIn spite of this long, pioneering and successful career, in spite of all of her experience in parliament, and working with grassroots campaigns, Abbott was treated with derision on Question Time.Anti-politics, and a generalised distrust of politicians is part of the current zeitgeist. Yet, even in an age of distrust some politicians are derided more than others. Privilege insulates some iniduals and groups at the expense of others. So, Oakeshott can get polling data wrong and still be taken seriously. Stewart can pull figures out of the air, and still expect to be treated with respect. But as a black woman, Abbott is routinely ridiculed, and her infrequent gaffs are seized upon as “proof”\u0026nbspthat she has no right to be at the centre of British politics.Boris Johnson is, perhaps the best example of a British politician insulated by privilege. As an exceptionally wealthy, white man he can get away with accusing the Turkish president of having sex with a goat he can brush off criticism following his use of the word “piccaninnies” he was even able to accuse Barack Obama of “ancestral dislike” of Britain, and still be given the job of foreign secretary – one of the highest offices of state.None of this is without personal consequences for Abbott, who experiences more racism now than at any time in her 35 years in politics. “Twitter has put racists into overdrive,” Abbott remarked in response to research published by Amnesty International in December 2018. The research showed that black women in journalism and politics were 84 per cent more likely than white women to be mentioned in abusive tweets. “The first thing my staff have to do in the morning is go online and delete and block all the stuff,” she said.\u0026nbspAn earlier study by Amnesty of 900,223 tweets sent in the six months before the 2017 election\u0026nbsprevealed that Abbott received 45 per cent of all abusive tweets sent to women MPs, 10 times more than other women in parliament. According to Abbott: “It’s highly racialised and it’s also gendered because people talk about rape and they talk about my physical appearance in a way they wouldn’t talk about a man. I’m abused as a female politician and I’m abused as a black politician.”During the 2016 US election, Trump claimed infamously\u0026nbspthat he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue without losing any voters. He was so insulated by his status that “his people” would still support him, even if he was guilty of murder. Sadly, as last week’s Question Time shows, a similar relationship between privilege and bias is at work in British politics.Robin Bunce is a historian based at Homerton College, University of Cambridge Paul Field is a lawyer, writer and human rights activistOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

agreement, we are going to have make changes to that.”Asked, again, if the prime minister could now seek a deal without the backstop, the spokesman added: “Our position is that we must avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland and that absolutely remains the case.”The comments come ahead of a series of crunch votes on Tuesday, including a cross-party attempt to force an extension of the Article 50 deadline, to avoid a no-deal Brexit.No 10 is expected to back the amendment, put forward by Graham Brady, the Tory backbenchers’ leader, to replace the backstop altogether.It is seen by some ministers as a way of delivering an ultimatum to the EU, by offering firm proof of the concessions needed in order for the orce deal to pass.However, in Brussels, the European Commission ruled out reopening the agreement, saying: “We have a unanimous EU27 position on the withdrawal agreement which reflects the common EU position.May’s Brexit deal is the only option for Northern Ireland Brexit fears drag UK

agreement has been agreed with the UK government, it is endorsed by leaders and is not open for renegotiation.”Meanwhile, some leading Brexiteers backed away from the Brady amendment, suggesting it will struggle to pass on Tuesday, even if selected.Iain Duncan Smith told the BBC that Ms May must announce “her intentions”, saying: “We need more than backbench amendments with nods and winks from the government. We need clarity and purpose.”And Bernard Jenkin told ITV News he would not support it as it currently stood, adding: “It\u0027s deliberately vague because it\u0027s meant to mean different things to different people.”\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The best way to do this is to support a people’s vote on the Brexit deal, and to truly give us a final say.”The fall in student support for Labour could be explained by several different reasons, but the concurrent rise in support for a new vote just as Mr Corbyn’s own MPs accuse him of prevarication over the issue is stark.At an event on the steps of parliament last week Labour and Tory MPs announced they would not table a cross-party amendment for a second referendum because it stood no chance of passing the Commons without Mr Corbyn’s support.Created with Sketch.Final Say petition delivered to Downing Street Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Today the Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivered to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit dealL to R:  Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Holly Baxter, Co-Editor Independent Voices and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote hand in a petition to Downing StreetFront row L to R: Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for PutneyThe Independent\u0027s editor Christian Broughton delivered over one million Final Say signatures and People\u0027s Vote spokesman Chuka Umunna MP delivered 300,000 signatures to Downing Street on Monday December 3 at middayA supporter of the second referendum helps Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham out of the rain during a protestL to R:  Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote on their way to hand in a petition to Downing StreetChristian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna hand in the petition to Downing StreetCaroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney hand in petitions to Downing StreetToday the Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivered to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit dealL to R:  Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Holly Baxter, Co-Editor Independent Voices and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote hand in a petition to Downing StreetFront row L to R: Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for PutneyThe Independent\u0027s editor Christian Broughton delivered over one million Final Say signatures and People\u0027s Vote spokesman Chuka Umunna MP delivered 300,000 signatures to Downing Street on Monday December 3 at middayA supporter of the second referendum helps Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham out of the rain during a protestL to R:  Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote on their way to hand in a petition to Downing StreetChristian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna hand in the petition to Downing StreetCaroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney hand in petitions to Downing StreetLuciana Berger, a former shadow health minister,\u0026nbspsaid: “Regrettably the Labour leadership won’t commit to an achievable policy and yet we know that the majority of Labour voters, supporters and members want a final say on any Brexit deal.“Yet at a time when Labour should be championing a people’s vote, the leadership avoids answering that call.”She added: “There are millions of young people in our country that supported the Labour Party at the last general election. Over two million of them were under the age of 18 in 2016. They would today now have a vote. And so many whom I speak to cannot understand why Labour is standing in the way of the younger generation having a say on this.”Three of Mr Corbyn’s MPs later moved in parliament to redraft his strategy, so it ties Labour unambiguously to giving Britain a new referendum.The leader has already submitted the Labour Party’s own amendment setting out how he thinks the country should proceed, but it disappointed many backers of the People’s Vote campaign because it failed to fully commit the party to backing a new referendum.Mr Corbyn’s approach would require ministers to find time for MPs only to “consider and vote on options” including renegotiating the withdrawal agreement and also then “legislating to hold a public vote” on any deal that successfully passes through the Commons.The Labour Party has been contacted for comment.HEPI sponsored Wave 5 of the HEPIYouthSight Monitor, which was answered by 1,048 full-time undergraduate students and undertaken between 4-8\u0026nbspJanuary.

Much of my career was spent working on Provisional IRA, the loyalist terrorist groups in Northern Ireland, she said.I can remember when it was thoroughly unpleasant to go through the border and now, if we go back to that, it cuts off the increasing links between Northern Ireland and the Republic which are an important part of the message of the peace process.It will alter dramatically the whole sentiment and politics of Northern Ireland.Throughout the time there has been those who don\u0027t agree with the peace process, who are continuing to mount attacks - generally small scale.But I don\u0027t think it is over in Northern Ireland. The danger is that it gets much worse again.Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u0027s The World At One, Baroness Manningham-Buller\u0026nbspsaid:\u0026nbspIf we leave without a deal we are going to be less safe.We have a very serious terrorist problem in this country, very serious other security issues - the rise of Russia, its interference in our elections.I am pretty queasy that Putin is so in favour of\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbsp- I think that should give us all pause.There is a range of other security issues - we all face the same ones - which are dealt with better in a European context than not.Britain will be less safe in the event of a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit, a former head of MI5 has said.Baroness Manningham-Buller said there was a wide range of security issues - from terrorism to the threat from Russia - which were best dealt with in a European context.She said that she believed a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspshould be avoided at all costs.\u0026nbspTheresa May\u0026nbspis ready to demand the removal of the\u0026nbspIrish\u0026nbspbackstop\u0026nbspfrom her\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspdeal, in a significant toughening of her stance ahead of a fresh Commons showdown.Downing Street refused, multiple times, to say the prime minister still accepted the withdrawal agreement must include the insurance policy laid down by the EU, to avoid border checks.Instead, No 10 said the commitment was only to avoiding a hard border by some means – arguing the crushing\u0026nbsp230-vote defeat of her deal\u0026nbspa fortnight ago meant “changes are going to have to be made”.European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas has again insisted that Brussels would not reopen the withdrawal agreement negotiations.We have a unanimous EU27 position on the withdrawal agreement which reflects the common EU position, he said.This withdrawal agreement has been agreed with the UK government, it is endorsed by leaders and is not open for renegotiation.The DUP\u0027s Brexit spokesperson added pressure on Ms May calling on the prime minister to face down the stubborness of Dublin and Brussels and\u0026nbspexploit the cracks that have emerged.It is time to expose that rather than protect the Belfast Agreement, the backstop drives a coach and horses through the principle of consent and would ignore the democratic will of the NI Assembly, Mr Wilson said.We always knew it would come to this when Brussels was faced with a situation of its own intransigence. It is one of the reasons why the 29th March date must not be moved, otherwise the pressure which the EU and the Irish are now facing will be removed.Now is the time for the Government to be tough and to face down the stubbornness of Dublin and Brussels.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

at Westminster.“In fact, over the past two-and-a-half years Scotland has become more united than ever in support for our continuing place in Europe and against the damage that Brexit will inflict.”He said the UK government needs to “face reality”, adding: “Tinkering around the edges of their deal is a doomed strategy, no-deal brinkmanship is reckless and leaving that option on the table with just over 60 days until we’re due to leave the EU is unconscionable.“We face the political challenge of our times, and we mustn’t allow the Brexiteer Tories to run down the clock and drag us all into

party conference, should be to support a people’s vote, and it’s time for the leadership to come off the fence and get fully behind this.“All political parties should be working together in the national interest, so that we can offer the people of the UK the opportunity to keep the best deal we already have as a member of the EU.”Glasgow University principal Sir Anton Muscatelli will also

There was the time a shisha cafe owner quickly ushered him out a back door amid anti-American murmurs by customers. There were the numerous checkpoints manned by suspicious teens armed with assault rifles peering into his vehicle. But the worst day had to be when he narrowly missed being surrounded and possibly captured by Isis militants on the outskirts of the eastern Libyan city of Derna. For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“We’ve had some bad days,” he acknowledged during a phone interview. For Mr Guidry, perseverance paid off. This month the Libyan seaport authority agreed to grant the former security contractor the $1.5bn deal to build the country’s first port suitable for the world’s largest cargo vessels at the eastern Libyan city of Susah. \u0026nbsp“If we’re lucky, this will be the jewel of North Africa,” he told The Independent. Libya sinks into poverty as the oil money disappears into foreign bankVast, oil-rich Libya, which toppled its longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi in a 2011 Nato-backed uprising, is in tatters.\u0026nbspSeparate governments claim\u0026nbspauthority in the east and west and armed groups sometimes don\u0027t recognise either of them. Security in the capital, Tripoli, hit a new low last week with clashes in the southern suburbs between rival militias vying for control of the country’s largest city. Residents complain of a lack of any public services.The de facto ruler of Libya’s east, army officer Khalifa Haftar, has made a\u0026nbspmove\u0026nbspon the country’s southern oil fields, sparking clashes in the country’s most impoverished region and claims that the eastern army was engaged in acts of intimidation, kidnapping and looting.Foreign powers – primarily the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Turkey and Qatar\u0026nbsp– are meddling, even allegedly sending arms to their favoured clients in violation of a UN embargo, something they deny.\u0026nbspThe UN hopes for a June election, an aspiration many Libya observers consider unrealistic. But some see the country eventually settling down. Despite the political isions and failed attempts to create rival regional institutions, the country’s Central Bank, finance ministry, national petroleum company, utility authorities, and several other institutions still strive to operate as single units. The IMF said Libya grew 11 per cent last year. The Falanx Group, a London-based security and risk advisory firm, said in an assessment this month that Libya would this year achieve a maximum oil output of 1.6mn barrels per day for the first time since the fall of Gaddafi. Mr Guidry is also optimistic, because, he said,\u0026nbspthe Susah port project shows the country can still come together when something significant is at stake. “What’s happened is that the seaport authority of the east has talked to the seaport authority of the west, convinced them this is a national priority,” he said. In a statement, Hassan Jwaili, one of the seaport chairman in eastern Libya, said both sides of the country were “working closely together on everything related to the ports and\u0026nbspmaritime capabilities.”The Susah port, located 25 northeast of the east’s de facto administrative headquarters in Bayda, will be situated in a natural harbour 18 metres deep and suitable for the modern supertankers considered the most cost-effective vessels\u0026nbspfor\u0026nbsptransporting goods across oceans. The project has already caught the attention of port and maritime specialists. Despite 1,100 miles of Mediterranean coastline, Libya’s ports are badly outdated, with antiquated technology for moving shipping containers on and off freighters. Mr Guidry said the new port will equipped with the most up-to-date technology, surpassing the speed and efficiency of major Mediterranean ports in Egypt and Tunisia. Sudan and land-locked Chad have already voiced interest in using the Susah port to import goods. Mr Guidry estimates the port will generate at least $60m\u0026nbspin annual revenue by 2022 and twice that by 2040. “Now it’s time to bring the economy where it needs to be,” said Mr Guidry.Ceasefire agreed to end fighting in Libya\u0027s Tripoli, says UN30 dead in Tripoli militia clashes Libya sinks into poverty as the oil money disappears into foreign bankAt least 33 dead after double car bombing in LibyaThe Susah port project is on a design, build, operate and transfer model that would allow Mr Guidry’s firm to run it for at least its first 25 years. He and his eight-person team won the deal in a bidding competition, beating eight proposals from firms in China, Russia, France, and Italy. He said he received no help other than security warnings from US consular officials holed up at a temporary embassy in neighbouring Tunisia.Mr Guidry came to Libya as a security contractor four years ago and said he fell in love with the country, and wanted to invest in something that would also create work for the people who welcomed him into their homes. He said he put his own money into the project, even drawing from his retirement savings. He noted that Susah lies near an ancient archeological site where legend has it Mark Antony built his love Cleopatra a swimming pool. “Five years ago people would have said, ‘He’s crazy. They’re going to cave in on him,’ or, ‘He’s gonna break.’ But it’s real and it is happening.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Keir resigned as a consultant to the academy when he was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet.”A spokesman for Starmer’s office said: “MPs are required to register and declare fees received since the May  election even where those fees were earned before the election.“The register makes it very clear that in the case of Keir Starmer, the vast majority of his declared earnings represent payment for work undertaken by him as a lawyer before he became MP.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And I think just because we’re saying ‘birds aren’t real,’ that should be true with the same respect as when people say birds are real.”Although they are predominantly based in the US, the group has recently come over to the UK, with seagulls arent real stickers appearing around Brighton in October last year.The Birds Arent Real movement havent as of yet addressed the question of eating chicken - or any other bird meat for that matter.And while the theory that all birds are faked may seem far-fetched, last year it was revealed in the South China Morning Post that  Chinese military and government agencies were deploying drones that looked like doves to spy on citizens.The programme, code-named Dove, is led by Northwestern Polytechnical University in Xian, and each bird is built with GPS technology, a high-definition camera and a flight control system.The scientists behind it say they replicate  per cent of the movements of a real dove.In , German engineering company Festo launched a flying machine that looked like a herring gull.Named SmartBird, the drone is so realistic that real seagulls actually fly alongside it believing it is one of their group.So while the conspiracy theory - which Birds Arent Real describe as a nightmare that makes the Illuminati look like a toddler playing in the Burger King play place - seems incredibly bonkers, there is a slight amount of truth in it.So be careful next time you look up to the skies... Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At least one of them needs to pass.If one does get the support of a majority of MPs, then Theresa May can go back to Brussels and say, look, this is what will get the deal through my parliament.It will strengthen her negotiating hand, make the EU engage and give her a chance of securing some changes.As one secretary of state says: “She needs to demonstrate she can carry something through.”No insiders tell me that May will only go back to Brussels “when we have a very clear set of proposals”. Butnone of these amendments can muster a majority, then the EU will just sit tight.It knows this parliament is fiercely opposed to No Deal and so isn’t concerned that the UK will actually go down that route.Instead, the EU will wait, confident that the UK will request either an extension to the Brexit process or a softening of it.So far, there are a iety of amendments down. One from the shop steward of backbench Tory MPs, Graham Brady, says the Commons will support the withdrawal agreementthe backstop is replaced by “alternative arrangements” to prevent a hard border in Ireland.Another from the Tory chairman of the Northern Ireland Select Committee, Andrew ­Murrison, seeks to time-limit the backstop. Influential cabinet ministers have also been pushing for the Government to put down its own amendment.They are confident that they are winning that argument and one will go down before Tuesday — though some in Number  still prefer to put their faith in the Murrison amendment.The signicance of a Government amendment would be that Speaker John Bercow would have no choice but to call it. One indispensable minister involved in these discussions tells me: “A Government amendment could well be a more objective exit mechanism which would allow us to ­demonstrate that this is not going to be permanent.”The outline of this amendment has, I understand, been discussed with the DUP and ministers believe that the “likelihood” is that they will support it. But one cautions that “what may seem a given one day can suddenly unravel”.No won’t be drawn on whether a Government amendment will be tabled or not. But leading cabinet ministers are confident it will be. One says: “This is the best chance of moving everyone forward together.”One option being discussed is for a series of clear tests which,met, would allow the UK to exit the backstop. The aim is to make it clear that the EU couldn’t keep the UK — or Northern Ireland — in the backstop forever.There is also, I understand, “a parallel conversation” going on about what the EU will accept in terms of changes to the backstop. If a Government-backed amendment passed the Common it would also, in the words of one source, give the Government “half a chance of stopping Cooper-Boles”.The amendment from Labour’s Yvette ­Cooper and former Tory minister Nick Boles would require the Government to ask for an extension to Article  to avoid No Dealthe UK and the EU can’t come to an agreement.As this source points out: “Cooper-Boles does best when people think there isn’t an alternative.” There is no guarantee that a Government amendment will carry the day.“To pull this off, you need the ERGto come in behind it — and that’s quite a big ask,” says one of those intimately involved in these discussions.This source warns that “emotionally a lot of them will find it very dficult”. But these Brexiteer MPs need to realise thatnothing passes on Tuesday, then parliamentary efforts to extend Article  will gather more support.Brexit itself will be in danger and this country will end up with a super soft Andrex Brexit — or no Brexit at all.MPs should not do anything to suggest that they want to take No Deal off the table. This week, the EU and the Irish government have been all over the place about what No Deal would mean for the Irish border.The contradiction at the heart of the backstop is beginning to become apparent. It is, the EU and ­Ireland say, necessary to prevent a hard border. Butthe backstop results in there being No Deal, then it will lead to precisely what it is meant to avoid: A hard border.As this inconsistency becomes more and more obvious, there is more chance of member states pressing the EU to move on this issue.One minister who has been talking to his ­counterparts across the EU in the last few days tells me: “They’re ­definitely budging.”So, this would be precisely the wrong moment for MPs to undermine May’s negotiating position by talking about taking No Deal off the table. As one of those close to the PM puts it: “This has been a dficult week for the EU. Don’t make it easy for them.”This is one of the reasons why MPs MUST REJECT the Yvette Cooper amendment. At the moment, this amendment looks like it will probably pass. But given how many Labour MPs in leave-voting seats have qualms about it, this is far from certain.Tory MPs, let alone ministers, shouldn’t help it through as doing so would pull the rug from under the UK’s negotiating position.VENEZUELA is a sorry tale of where state socialism leads. In an oil-rich country, people are starving. It is embarrassing, and shaming, that Jeremy Corbyn’s ideological blinders mean that he can’t see what is happening there.Labour talk about opposing “outside interference” in Venezuela even as a slew of democracies in the region recognise the head of the national assembly, Juan Guaido, as the legitimate president.Labour’s opposition to outside interference puts them in the same position as Russia, China, Turkey, Bolivia and Cuba. This is the company we’d be keepingCorbyn became Prime Minister.AT Cabinet this week, Theresa May told ministers that to get the deal through she would have to go to the Commons and “present a changed backstop”.This is signicant because it is her recognising that she needs substantive – not just cosmetic – changes to the backstopshe is to get her deal through.TALK of an early election just won’t go away at Westminster. It is not that the Tories want one, but that there is a sense that the Commons is so deadlocked on Brexit that it might end up as the only option.One possible route to an election is that Yvette Cooper’s plan to extend Article  passes the Commons, a deal is then eventually agreed but can only pass with the rider that there is a second referendum. I understand that, in these circumstances, the Government would rather go for an early election.One senior Cabinet Minister says that Theresa May’s “reddest of red lines is we have to leave the EU”. A ­referendum with Remain on the ballot paper would threaten that.“Political parties ought to make sure they are ready to fight an ­election”, a member of the Tory party board tells me as he explains why they are rapidly stepping up candidate selection and the like. But I am told that “no one is planning an election”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Taxes will rise. We’ll even run out of Mars bars.But across the Atlantic, something has been ­happening that should give us all some perspective.Over the past decade, Venezuela has plunged into the abyss — but there’s been no civil war, no earthquakes or hurricanes.Just a brutal, corrupt government that has turned what was once Latin America’s richest country into a hellhole.Starvation rations plunged millions into hunger and ­malnutrition, with some resorting to eating dogs, cats, even zoo animals.People got into kne fights over the right to scavenge from a dumpster.Its economy is more than three times smaller than in . Inflation climbed into the thousands, then millions of per cent.The result has been a refugee crisis on the scale of the Syria conflict.No wonder tens of ­thousands of people took to the streets of the capital Caracas this week, declaring national assembly head Juan Guaido the legitimate president.All this is awful for the poor bloody Venezuelans.But what does it have to do with Britain The answer is that Venezuela wasn’t just a ­disaster. It was an experiment — cheered on by Jeremy Corbyn and his cronies.In , Hugo Chavez took over Venezuela.He ruled until his death in , when he was succeeded by his hand-picked protege Nicolas Maduro.Chavez modelled himself on Latin American ­revolutionaries like Fidel Castro and Simon Boli. He nationalised much of the oil industry — which dominates the ­Venezuelan economy — and imposed punitive taxes on foreign firms.He introduced price controls and later currency controls. He declared “economic war” on the “stateless ­bourgeoisie” and seized the goods of private companies he denounced as saboteurs.For Corbyn, the Chavez regime was an inspiration — a chance to see true socialism brought to le.Venezuela, Corbyn has said, “showed us that there is a dferent, and a better, way of doing things. It’s called socialism”.It wasn’t just Corbyn. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott and Corbyn’s media chief Seumas Milne have all praised the ­Venezuelan revolution.That “better way of doing things” has ruined tens of millions of lives but there has not been a hint of an apology from Corbyn.Normally, the fact that people are taking to the streets to free themselves of a vicious regime would be cheered to the rafters by the Left.Instead, there is the silence of those who find themselves ­hideously embarrassed.The few who are not ­staring at their shoes claim that Venezuela has been the ­victim of an American plot.That Maduro took, in McDonnell’s words, a “wrong turn” from Chavez’s true socialism.That it was all down to a falling oil price.Yes, Maduro took a wrong turn. But that turn was to follow the path laid out by Chavez.From the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela, there is a long and shabby history of British left-wingers acclaiming a workers’ paradise — only to declare, once its ­failure is clear, that it wasn’t really socialist after all.Never mind the millions of lives ruined — let’s have another go!If he became Prime ­Minister, Corbyn might not succeed in turning Britain into Venezuela.

In fact, they are tinkering at the margins with farm fertilisers and log fires instead of making the big decisions that are needed.”Mr Gove’s spokesman said last night: “Ammonium nitrate has been used in fertilisers for years. It is better for air quality as it emits less ammonia,  per cent of which comes from farming.“Labour must think they know better than the World Health Organisation, which praised our plans as ‘an example for the rest of the world to follow’.“Labour should apologise for the harm to health caused by their dash to diesel, which has directly led to breaches in air pollution limits.

They are paid to inspire you to buy stuff.Most insist they only endorse ­products they actually believe in — and we’d all hope they take their responsibility seriously.But it is easy to see how an offer of, say, £, to endorse something they “sort of” believe in might make it harder to hang on to those principles.Equally,guidelines aren’t strictly enforced, you can understand the temptation to convey the impression that you just happen to really like a particular laxative herbal tea, say, or a moisturiser that gives you a “glow”.It’s a grey area. And you might ask why it matters.But given recent news about the ­negative impact social media can have on the mental health of young people — and young women in particular — regulation of this brave new world affects us all.I need only point to another big story this week.Schoolgirl Molly Russell was  when she took her own le after showing “no obvious signs” of severe mental health issues.Her family later found she had been viewing material on social media linked to anxiety, depression, self-harm and suicide.Her father even went as far as accusing Instagram of “helping to kill her”.Social media makes it so easy to tap into someone’s daily le, their home-decor proclivities and their innermost thoughts.The intimate nature of Instagram lets you feel like these influencers are your friends, and the products they rave about their personal ­recommendations, not the outcome of a business deal.This is a real problem. But the mistake is much harder to makeadverts are clearly labelled as such.Part of the problem is how obsessed with celebrities our young people have become.When I was growing up, my main influenceswere my parents and my friends.Now, young people are influenced by people they will never meet.Some of these people, dare I say it, are talentless nobodies.You might argue you would have to be naive not to realise they are selling you something.Perhaps young people are not as cynical as the likes of me.And that is why regulation is key.IT’S hard to sympathise with Fungi, a “star” of hit telly documentary Benefits Street, who says universal credit is “the worst thing in the world”.Tracked down by this paper, James Clarkeclaimed his monthly payments had been more than halved and the all-in-one benefit was causing “hell” for him and others like him . . . because their booze budget has been cut.Fungi was claiming £ a month to spend on food and sundries. But this was slashed to £ – which doesn’t cover the £ a month he and his partner spend on strong cider.His rent, meanwhile, is paid in full via a separate taxpayer-funded handout.Fungi also says his drinking habit means he can’t work. Sorry, what Here’s another way of looking at it. People who work for eight hours a day don’t have the time to down three litres of cider a day.If Mr Clarke got a job, he might recover some of his self-esteem – and probably save his le in the process.Just to be clear – I BELIEVE in the benefits system.But it was invented to help people get back on their feet, to help those who can’t help themselves because of illness or disability.It should be a short-term measure, not a lestyle choice.In the meantime, the rest of us go to work to pay for this man’s rent and booze.All because he can’t be bothered to sort himself out.No wonder people get angry.In fact, I suspect most readers will have steam coming out of their ears.This man must start taking responsibility for himself.I SUPPOSE it was worth a shot for Diane Abbott to complain that Fiona Bruce was “badly briefed” and that her treatment as a list on Question Time was racist.But she can’t blame Fiona for her own incompetence in answering questions – and not just on Question Time.There are so many car-crash interviews to choose from . . . although the one in which Diane suggested police officers could be paid £ a year springs to mind.WHAT a nasty piece of work Dancing On Ice judge Jason Gardiner seems.We expect the judges to give feedback.And we know it won’t all be good.But his comment to Gemma Collins last week – “We are not going to see big lts from you” – came across as body-shaming.Because his real point is that she is overweight, right It’s shocking, really. I’m surprised ITV allowed it.THE secret behind Elle Macpherson’s phenomenal bod has been revealed.In an interview, she said it all comes down to . . . late breakfasts.Hmmm. No matter when we eat breakfast, most of us will never come close to looking how she does at .Actually, forget breakfast times. What struck me is her diet seems to contain just FIVE ingredients . . . one of which is nut cheese.And the only liquid is water.Elle looks great.But by God, she must be miserable.THE Premier League’s popularity continues to soar, as a study into attendances across Europe proves.And I was immensely proud to see West Ham ranked seventh by attendance in all of Europe last year.We are up there with the Continent’s elite, in a table headed by Barcelona.And that will only get better now the capacity of the London Stadium is up to , – adding to the incredible support we get from what I believe are the league’s best fans.This week, accountancy firm EY published a report on the impact the Premier League has on our economy.It generates £.billion a year in tax for the Exchequer, supporting , jobs and contributing £.billion overall to the country’s GDP.Last season, Premier League players paid more than £billion in taxes.But never mind the money.It’s still the best league in the world.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A clear commitment to a once-in-a-generation investment into the Leave-voting areas that have long been starved of our fair shares — those former coal, iron and steel industrial heartlands, the unfashionable places, the areas still manufacturing. I think, as well, that union bosses and industrialists can be brought to act as advisers to the trade negotiations when we have left the EU, bringing their expertise into play to ensure a jobs-first Brexit for Britain.A country, proud and independent, standing on its own two feet, ­confident again in our democracy, bold enough to compete by being the best, British workers making high- quality products and delivering high-quality services.A country that says it will be the best by having better pay, conditions and a healthier environment than anyone  in Europe or worldwide.Is that not something to be confident in voting for, my fellow MPs  Let’s get on with it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Immigration came second.What they objected to was a supranational government ­making some of their laws and lting all immigration controls on the inhabitants of  other countries.”Another Remainer fiction is that Brexiters are narrow-minded Little Englanders.Yet the Daily Mail found space for a German view that Brussels should stop “insulting Britain” and honour us as champions of peace in Europe.“Such blinkered and sour responses are wrong-headed,” says Alexander von Schoenburg, a senior editor of Germany’s biggest newspaper, Bild.“They ignore the great debt Germany and the whole ­Continent owes our friends across the Channel.“We must always remember that throughout your history, independence and sovereignty have been paramount.“Germany in particular should tread lightly when it comes to dealing with your proud nation. It was Great Britain that first stood up to Hitler in .And it was Britain that opened its doors to thousands of ­Jewish refugees fleeing certain death during the Holocaust.“Put simply, there would be no free Europe without you and the bloody sacrice you made to rescue the Continent.”This remarkable tribute ­follows a recent love letter to the UK from Germany’s next Chancellor calling for a friendly Brexit orce and an end to bitterness.It is now clear hardline Remainers have over-reached themselves. The worm has turned.Talk of a second referendum is dead and voters are on the warpath against MPs plotting to scupper Brexit in tomorrow’s Commons showdown.Brussels is in chaos over the Northern Ireland backstop.Michel Barnier has started muttering about new tech- nology to police post-Brexit ­frontiers — a UK idea initially dismissed as “magical thinking”.EU allies are breaking ranks to demand a decent deal — for their sake as much as ours.It is way past time now for Theresa May to scrap the backstop and tell Brussels exactly what she needs to get her deal through Parliament.“There is absolutely no truth in speculation that ­passengers are being advised not to book,” stormed Brittany Ferries as it announced plans to INCREASE services.Meanwhile, mischief-making aviation giant Airbus admits it was asked by Downing Street to warn – incredibly – that it would shut up shopBritain left without a deal.Project Fear is shameless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The evidence is so heavily weighted to involvement by one of the aircrew taking this aircraft down.“That aircraft has probably depressurised, the people died of asphyxiation, it was premeditated murder. It was highly planned. The bodies have never been found.”But despite experts’ observations, the Malaysian government, which has signed a “no cure, no fee” deal with Texas-based company Ocean Infinity to resume the hunt for the plane, remains silent on the question of Zaharie’s possible involvement.Ocean Infinity started the search on January  this year, following a failed £million search for the plane.  At the time, experts said they expected to have answers within a matter of weeks.The company has  search days to look for the plane, which has been spread over several months. Officials said there was roughly an  per cent chance of finding traces of the wreckage in a new , square mile search area.The investigation is expected to end in mid-June but those on the TV show said they feared MH may never be found."},{"url":null,"title":"beautician sneezes out ring nose 12 years","story":"The stunned woman only noticed when she saw something glistening in her snot after a sneezing fit.Abigail Thompson had no idea the piece of jewellery, a gt for her eighth birthday, was up her nose the whole time.The -year-old said she noticed it had gone missing a few months later and assumed someone had taken it.She said: “I never ever in a million years would have guessed it had got stuck up my nose.”“I always had a few friends over, we always would sit on my bed and she thought one of them must have just taken it when they were over at my house.“Mum thought one of them must have stolen it.“There was no other explanation as to where it could have gone.”Abigail, of Keighley, West Yorks, said she was shocked when she saw the silver ring fly out of her conk after a particularly bad sneezing fit.She said: “Well it was just a normal day, I was sat on my sofa and I started sneezing loads and then I looked in the tissue and I was like ‘What the hell is that ’“I felt a sharp feeling but I didn’t think of it until I looked in the tissue.“Then I looked at it and I went: ‘Oh My God, that’s the ring!’”“My mum was so shocked, I called her straight away when it happened.“I said ‘You’ll never guess what ’ and she said: ‘Oh my God, never’.”After speaking with her mum, Abigail came to the conclusion that the ring must have got stuck up there when her younger self picked her nose.She said: “Maybe I was picking my nose and it got washed back up there.

Three of the four crew members aboard the Russian Tu-M were killed in the tragic incident in the Arctic last week. During the dramatic footage - which shows the full scale of the terrying incident - the plane approaches the runway at speed and touches down. However, the aircraft bounces and starts breaking up and quickly erupts into two fireballs - one in the cockpit section which breaks away from the rest of the plane. The clip was taken at the Olenya air base above the arctic circle and clearly shows the planes heavy impact with the runway. Russian defence officials say the plane was on a training flight and was unarmed - however unconfirmed reports suggest there was a missile on board.    Reports also suggest that the commander Major Alexey Guryev lost control as he landed at a remote airbase. The damaged cockpit was later seen lying on its side in a snowfield an unknown distance from the rest of the wreckage which is visibly charred. Guryev, , died at the scene. A tribute has been set up to the captain and the two other airmen who perished in the crash - co-pilot Konstantin Mazunin and navigator Viktor Greyf. An emotional message honouring Greyf, , who died as he was rushed to hospital, was posted his teenage son on social media. Kirill, , wrote: “You are my hero! You are the very best!” Another navigator Maxim Rylkov survived the crash but was reported to be in a grave condition. Guryev - a father of one - was from a dynasty of Russian air force pilots and had followed in the footsteps of his father German.   His eight year old son was named German after his grandfather. There is implied criticism of the crew in an official accident report that leaked two days after the crash. It claimed the captain “allowed the landing of the aircraft without levelling”. The unbalanced plane then broke apart with impact and began to “destroy”, said the report. The cockpit and the rest of the aircraft which erupted in flames were detached. “The crew did not respond the commands of flight management team,” said the leaked report. “The fuselage burned down.”    There were also claims the captain insisted on landing despite being urged to use another air base. “Currently, all possible versions of the incident, including a technical mal, are being considered,” said a military source. The crash was at Olenya air base, near Olenegrosk, on the Kola Peninsula some  miles south of Murmansk city. Aviation expert Vadim Lukashevich believed that the crash was likely caused by a vertical wind gust that suddenly hit the plane before touchdown, according to the RIA Novosti news agency. Accounts at the time suggested blizzard conditions.  The Tupolev bomber - an aircraft in service since the Soviet era - can strike targets , miles from base, and is a key war plane for potential deployment against the West. It has a crew of four. The crashed aircraft was reported to be  years old. It underwent a major overhaul in .

Audience members had claimed the joke centred on Ms Abbott’s shyrelationship with Jeremy Corbyn in the s, implying her role was as a result of their closeness. The BBC branded reports about the warm-up “inaccurate”, adding: “We firmly reject claims any of the  were treated unfairly.” A spokesman for the Labour MP said: “If they’ve nothing to hide, tell us what was said.”   The BBC had previously refused to confirm or deny whether Ms Bruce had made a joke at the Labour frontbencher’s expense. The new host has been embroiled in a row with the Labour Party since her second outing on the flagship show, which she took over presenting earlier this month. Last week she made an on-air clarication about polling after she suggested that the Conservatives were ahead in the polls, even though several put Labour ahead. But Labour had also made an official complaint for remarks allegedly made by her to the studio audience before the cameras started broadcasting.

MPs who voted down the Brexit deal by a record two weeks ago could now back it tomorrow -she replaces the Irish backstop with alternative arrangements. The backstop is an insurance clause to keep the Irish border open, but Brexiteers fear it will trap the UK in EU customs rules. So the government is considering backing a bid by senior Tory Sir Graham Brady to tweak the backstop. Brexiteer Boris Johnson claimed he had heard “from the lips of very senior sources” that the Prime Minister is planning to go to Brussels and renegotiate the backstop to insert a so-called freedom clause. Graham Brady, the Tory MP behind the amendment, said it would be legally binding and give enormous firepower to force Brussels to change. Yet he admitted it might not actually mean reopening the -page Brexit deal which contains the backstop - a red line for many Brexiteers. Instead itd be a codicil clause attached to the deal. And Ireland has reacted with fury to the proposal saying the backstop is non-negotiable.  That means eventhe bid passes tomorrow night, Theresa May could end up once again stuck in deadlock with the EU less than two months before Brexit.Members of the government even told The Times the Brady amendment was ludicrous. Remain-backing Tory MP Anna Soubry said it was a farce and she would abstain in the vote. And Tory Remainer Sarah Wollaston said: It’s not only ludicrous, the Brady amendment would put us in direct conflict with international treaty obligations under the Withdrawal Agreement.Only an incoherent Govt could back it. I will be voting for realism rather than more fantasy Brexit. MPs will vote on a string of amendments to the Brexit plan tomorrow night, just  days before the UK leaves the EU.  Theresa May will close the debate personally tomorrow night before votes at pm. MPs will then get a second meaningful vote on Theresa Mays full Brexit deal in the coming weeks. Despite the obvious problems with it, the Government is thought to be inching closer to backing the so-called backstop amendment. Downing Street said: If we are going to secure Parliamentary approval for the withdrawal agreement, some changes will have to be made. Tory MP Sir Graham said: “I had also spoken to people in the DUP too and I’m hoping that the way in which the amendment is crafted can attract that very broad support. Andwe can win the vote on my amendment then I think it gives the Prime Minister enormous firepower.” But the Irish have repeated their warnings that there is little room for manoeuvre on the issue.   Deputy PM Simon Coveney said: “Even in a no-deal Brexit situation every party and every MP in the UK will have a responsibility to ensure there is noto a hard border and Northern Ireland is protected. That won’t be easy and those who misrepresent the backstop don’t have an alternative to it.” Downing Street insisted a priority would be to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland - exactly what the backstop is designed to stop. In what is shaping-up to be Brexit’s “Super Tuesday” showdown in the Commons, ious factions of MPs are competing to stamp their mark on the Brexit agenda.Labour is expected to back a move by Yvette Cooper to delay Brexit Day for at least three months, although two dozen Labour MPs are thought to be against it.That meansit does pass it may be by a very slim margin.  Tory Nick Boles, who has signed the amendment, claimed today the plan had “a great deal of support among ministers”. It comes amid suggestions that some plan to abstain in the vote, although this could put their ministerial jobs on the line. Mr Boles claimed the amendment was the “last chance” for Parliament to avoid a clf-edge Brexit - although Mrs May’s allies are privately denying that is the case. The PM will face down her ided Cabinet ahead of the vote and is expected to warn them they must get into line. A group of Remainer ministers - including Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd and Justice Secretary David Gauke - were said to have agreed not to rebel against her - but only as long as she agreed to give MPs a second meaningful vote within a fortnight.

This is an outrageous claim, both muddle-headed and nasty. It is a Labour amendment to the government’s Bill.I am happy to stand by it because it protects human rights and the rule of law. Our amendment would prevent authorities in this country sharing data with overseas agencies where there is a risk of the imposition of the death penalty. More than  years ago parliament as a whole passed a law which ‘opposes the death penalty in all circumstances’. That is the law of the land.   It means we do not co-operate with any governmentthe consequence could be capital punishment. Parliament has for a long time believed that the death penalty is so abhorrent, and the risks of a miscarriage of justice so awful, that we outlaw it. Our ban applies to all countries where the death penalty is still on the statute books. But government Ministers are desperate to cosy up to Donald Trump’s administration in the US, where the death penalty is still imposed. Our amendment simply blocks data sharing co-operation with all countriesthe death penalty is a risk. The reason Ministers seem to be so keen to tear up our laws and ignore our human rights is because they are in a terrible mess in refusing to rule out a No Deal Brexit.  Among other things this will end all our very close co-operation with all the EU countries in the areas of security and justice. Under Tory plans, we will actually be severing the agreement which allow us to co-ordinate with the EU on combating terrorism, organised crime, people traffickers, and fugitives from justice, including paedophiles. There is almost nothing this government is doing that is not associated with Brexit, and its madcap refusal to rule out crashing out with No Deal. And because this is such a major threat to all of us Tory Ministers are resorting to ever more outrageous claims and smears to justy their actions. It is this government which is putting our security at risk. And it is resorting to the lowest form of insults to cover up for that fact.

The Government is raising employers’ pension contributions in the health sector. NHS Trusts will get extra cash to deal with the increase. But charity hospices, where terminally ill people are cared for in their final days, won’t get additional money to ease the transition and care homes will not get any money either. Tory ministers risk being accused of sneaking out the plans after they appeared online in a -page document just a week before Christmas.  Health sector employers – including hospices – currently pay .% of a worker’s pensionable pay into the NHS pension scheme. That is set to rise to .% from this April under plans revealed in a consultation due to close today. Hospice UK CEO Tracey Bleakley said: “We are deeply concerned about the impact that current proposals to signicantly increase employer contributions to the NHS pension scheme would have on charitable hospices across the UK.” She added they are “likely to create additional costs of up to poundmillion each year”.  Ms Bleakley said: “This comes on the back of the NHS pay increases, which will create similarly punishing extra costs for hospices. The net effect of these two changes could add up to poundmillion per year in extra costs for hospices. “This double whammy of what are effectively stealth taxes is likely to take a big hit on the sector and will jeopardise the future of some hospice services “All UK governments must take action to protect the care provided by hospices.” There are about  hospices in England and Wales giving care to , people every year. Labour MP James Frith said: “It is right that the Government tackles the growing deficit in the NHS pension pot, but this cannot come at the expense of patient care.

Turning Britons against other Europeans by lying and inventing  promises,while at the same time demonising foreigners, smacks of a Right-wing plot to replace rights with a new serfdom. How much it’s a poisonous ersion by the reactionaries scheming their way to Brexit was shown when campaigning Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh detailed outrageous pay unfairnesses in a debate. Typical FTSE  Fat Cats on pound.-million aren’t worth in four days what an average worker earns in a year.  We’re going backwards when these gluttons receive  times more than a typical employee, compared with  times two decades ago. McDonagh detailed eye-watering ratios in Westminster Hall of up to  in privatised Royal Mail, Tesco , Ladbrokes’ owner , housebuilder Persimmon’s  and , at speculator Melrose Industries. The MP strikes a chord arguing a big company executive isn’t worth  police officers,  teachers,  nurses or  carers. I’ve long said a -to- ratio between highest and lowest is ample to reward ability, effort and responsibility.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn favours a doubly generous -to- for firms profiting from public contracts. The European Union didn’t block these Fat Cat bonanzas – but it does guarantee, for example, paid holidays and maternity entitlements which unchained future Tory Governments would threaten. Brexit is to Britain what Trump is to the US, chaos deliberately inflicted – and an opportunity for self-interested ideological masters to pursue naked self-interest. Boosting the incomes of Wetherspoon’s poorly paid staff isn’t Brexit pub bore Tim Martin’s priority when the skinflint, worth pound million, has criticised higher minimum wages. And James Dyson isn’t hanging around for Britain to become a new Singapore, a state without an NHS. Feathering their own nests, Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage are joining the wealthy elite, not challenging it. Britain needs fundamental, dare I say revolutionary, change.

Supermarkets including Sainsburys Co-op and Lidl could also run short of some fresh foods because of disruptions to the supply chain. Bosses from some of the UK’s biggest food outlets, including Marks  Spencer and Waitrose have said prices could spiketheres no deal. The letter to MPs was organised by the British Retail Consortium was sent on the eve of an important vote on the next steps for Brexit .  Retail bosses warned that millions of consumers could be hit by “signicant disruption” to supply chains of goods due to no deal. “Our supply chains are closely linked to Europe — nearly one third of the food we eat in the UK comes from the EU. It added: “As this produce is fresh and perishable, it needs to bemoved quickly from farms to our stores.” Fears have been raised as % of lettuces, % of tomatoes and % of soft fruit is imported from the EU around the time the UK is due to leave. TheBRChas previously warned that a clf edge Brexit would clog up food supplies, raise prices and throw retailers out of business.   In July last year it said food and beverage products would face an average increase of up to  percent in the cost of importing from the EU from non-tarf barriers alone. Many of these increases would be passed on to consumers in higher prices, it said at the time. Earlier this month Tesco and Sainsburys, Britains two biggest food retailers, said the country faced a fresh food bottleneckit dropped out of the EU without a deal. The letter continued: “As prudent businesses we are stockpiling where possible. But all frozen and chilled storage is already being used and there is very little general warehousing space available in the UK. “Eventhere were more space it is impossible to stockpile fresh produce, such as salad leaves and fresh fruit.”   Best for Britain supporter Tonia Antoniazzi MP said the letter shows up the lies of Brexiteers who promised lower food prices and greater prosperity after Brexit. She added: Now we’re seeing study after study saying food prices will rise and our top supermarkets worried about empty shelves.“Enough is enough.This letter makes a stark observation that food security is at risk.At a time when food bank usage stands at an all-time high, it’s not on that the Prime Minister has so far refused to take away the no deal threat in an attempt to boost support for her awful deal.Parliament must act now to block the government’s reckless blackmail.” Letter in full: Dear Member of Parliament, On behalf of our businesses and the wider food industry we want to highlight to you the challenges for retailers and the consequences for millions of UK consumers of leaving the European Union without a deal at the end of March. While we have been working closely with our suppliers on contingency plans it is not possible to mitigate all the risks to our supply chains and we fear signicant disruption in the short term as a resultthere is no Brexit deal. We wanted to share with you some practical examples of the challenges we are facing.Our supply chains are closely linked to Europe — nearly one third of the food we eat in the UK comes from the EU. ln March the situation is more acute as UK produce is out of season: % of our lettuces, % of our tomatoes and % of our soft fruit is sourced from the EU at that time of year. As this produce is fresh and perishable, it needs to be moved quickly from farms to our stores.This complex, just in time supply chain will be signicantly disrupted in the event of no deal. Eventhe UK government does not undertake checks on products at the border, there will still be major disruption at Calais as the French government has said it will enforce sanitary and customs checks on exports from the EU, which will lead to long delays Government data suggest freight trade between Calais and Dover may reduce by % against current levels as a result. For consumers. this will reduce the availability and shelf le of many products in our stores.We are also extremely concerned about the impact of tarfs. Only around % of our food imports, a fraction of the products we sell, is currently subject to tarfs sothe UK were to revert to WTO Most Favoured Nation Status, as currently envisaged in the no-deal scenario, it would greatly increase import costs, which could in turn put upward pressure on food prices. The UK could set import tarfs at zero but that would have a devastating impact on our own farmers, a key part of our supply chains.Our ability to mitigate these risks is limited. As prudent businesses we are stockpiling where possible, but all frozen and chilled storage is already being used and there is very little general warehousing space available in the UK. Eventhere were more space it is impossible to stockpile fresh produce, such as salad leaves and fresh fruit. Retailers typically store no more than two weeks inventory and it becomes dficult to restock storesthe supply chain is disrupted. We are also attempting to find alternative supply routes but there are limited options and not enough ferries, so this could only replace a fraction of the current capactiy.We are extremely concerned that our customers will be among the first to experience the realities of a no deal Brexit. We anticipate signicant risks to maintaining the choice, quality and durability of food that our customers have come to expect in our stores, and there will be inevitable pressure on food prices from higher transport costs, currency devaluation and tarfs.We are therefore asking you to work with your colleagues in Parliament urgently to find a solution that avoids the shock of a no deal Brexit on  March and removes these risks for UK consumers.Signatories:Mike Coupe, Chief ExecutiveJ Sainsbury Plc  Roger Burnley, Chief ExecutiveAsdaLtdSteve Rowe, Chief ExecutiveMarks  Spencer plc Jo Whitfield, Retail Chief ExecutiveThe Co-op Paula MacKenzie , CEOKFC UKI Rob Collins, Managing DirectorWaitrose Clive Schlee, Chief Executive Pret A Manger Darcy Willson- Rymer, Chief ExecutiveCostcutter SupermarketsChristian Hartnagel, Chief ExecutiveLidl Paul Pomroy, Chief ExecutiveMcDonalds Restaurants Ltd.Richard Pennycook, ChairmanBritish Retail Consortium Helen Dickinson, Chief Executive British Retail Consortium  "},{"url":null,"title":"what no deal brexit what","story":"NewsWhat is a No Deal Brexit   ways youll be affectedUK leaves EU with no dealThe UK is due to leave the EU on  March  - and No Deal Brexit is becoming a bigger threat.

A Brexit deal was agreed between the UK and the EU, but it was voted down in the House of Commons. So with time running out, plans are being put into action in case a deal doesnt happen. The government has published  technical notices outlining the practical effects of No Deal - from driving licences to cats. Meanwhile ministers have , troops held at readiness, could call up Army reserves and declare martial law. Ministers could quit in protestNo Deal happens while supermarkets and hospitals are stockpiling food and medicine. If theres no arrangement in time, well lose  international trade deals in a blink, shed access to EU criminal databases and troops couldto the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.   A lot of the effects are on business. UK farmers face a nine-month wait for approval to export organic goods to the EU. Fishermen could be blocked from EU waters. And manufacturers fear their supply chains drying up. But businesses are not what whove written this guide for. Instead we have tried to establish  ways No Deal Brexit will affect you, the reader and your everyday le. Of course, these are worst case scenarios. Theyre not exhaustive. They may never happen. But youd better wise up...   What is a No Deal Brexit  No Deal is the default optionMPs, the EU and the UK government cant agree a Brexit Withdrawal Agreement by  March . The -page deal on the table will ensure businesses arent cut off by continuing rules in a transition period until December . But it comes at a cost - a backstop that could trap the UK in an EU customs union from . That means MPs have opposed it. Leaving with no deal will mean falling back on World Trade Organisation trade tarfs - increasing the price of imports and exports - and could leave legal black holes where EU law stood before. The UK government has been ramping up preparations for no deal since the beginning of summer . MPs believe they can find a way to block No Deal through Parliament - including by delaying the March  date - butthey dont its still the default option at pm on March .  More than , troops are being held at readiness in case there is a disastrous no-deal Brexit. Army reserves are also legally able to be called upthere is civil unrest, while councils are braced for possible runs on banks, fuel and food. Local Resilience Forums are reporting back to Whitehall and expect several months of disruptionthere is no deal. The government has plans in case it needs to impose martial law - military law - and curfews to restore order. Cabinet minister Matt Hancock admitted the plans existed but insisted the government was not specically looking at martial law and it was not the focus of our attention.  At the moment, British citizens can enter Schengen area countries with a valid passport eventhey only have a day left before they expire. But in a no deal Brexit, after  March  you may not be able to travel to these countriesyou have less than six months left on your passport. The government is advising travellers to renew any passports older than nine years and six months. . Usually this means renewing six months before your passport expires. Butyour passport had more than  years validity, youll have to renew earlier, because the extra months on top of  years dont count. The following are members of the Schengen Agreement: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.  There is a huge surge in red tape for pet owners who want to take their beloved animals abroad. Currently dogs , cats and ferrets can travel anywhere in the EU as long as they have a pet passport. The main requirement is that three weeks before the first visit, owners must go to the vet to have their pet vaccinated against rabies and microchipped. But in the worst case no-deal Brexit, pet owners must visit a vet at least four months before taking their pet the EU. And because talks are ongoing, that means youd better book in now. The animal must have a rabies vaccination followed by a blood test at least  days later, to prove the vaccination worked. Pet owners must then wait at least three months before visiting the vet to obtain a health certicate. But this cannot be done more than  days before the date the holiday starts.  Food is being stockpiled forwe crash out of the EU without a deal, and ministers have promised an adequate supply. But thats not the same as having the range of food we do now. Leaked plans in December warned Brits could have to y their diet. And in January, big names KFC, Pret, Lidl, Co-Op, MS, Waitrose, Sainsburys, Asda and McDonalds signed a damning letter warning food supplies could run short because of disruptions to the supply chain.They wrote in a joint letter to MPs: Our ability to mitigate these risks is limited. As prudent businesses we are stockpiling where possible, but all frozen and chilled storage is already being used and there is very little general warehousing space available in the UK. They added: Retailers typically store no more than two weeks inventory and it becomes dficult to restock storesthe supply chain is disrupted.  A string of firms have either moved jobs out of the UK or are threatening to do so in a no-deal situation. Airbus, which employs , people in the UK with around , more jobs in supply chains, warned it may move where. Car plants are moving forward standard shutdowns to be around Brexit in case there are supply chain issues. And critics fear new investment will not come the UKs way, hitting jobs in generations to come.  Major motorways in the South of England are set for serious disruption in case of a no-deal Brexit. From early  the Mwill be closed as needed from junctions -, with a contraflow of both directions on the opposite side, so it can be used as a lorry parkthere is gridlock at Dover. A backup lorry park will be in place at Manston Airport. The M in Kent is also expected to be used as a holding area for lorries. And a similar fate could befall a -mile stretch of the M towards Southampton.  The International Air Transport Associationwarn up to million plane tickets could be cancelledthere is no deal. Currently it is not known exactly which tickets could be hit, or how passengers would find outthey are at risk. The situation arose because in a no deal, there will be no automatic legal basis for flights between the EU and UK after pm on  March . Under a pact struck between the UK and EU in December, basic connectivity will be maintained for a -month periodtheres No Deal. But according to the IATA - which represents  airlines including British Airways - that only means maintaining the number of flights in . It does not allow an increase in services - yet tickets have already been sold based on a predicted increase. Talks are ongoing, but Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, previously warned flights could be groundedgoodwill fails.  Currently a UK driving licence is the only thing visitors need to get behind the wheel on the continent. But under a no-deal Brexit, you should get an International Driving Permit. The pound. documents were due to be sold at , post offices from February. Before they were sold at fewer than . The number of permits issued would have to soar from , a year to million. Meanwhile you will also be forced to apply for a green card to prove you have the right car insurance. The certicates are free of charge and available from insurance companies. But the government warns firms may increase administration fees in order to cope with the extra bureaucracy. Those who forget their green cards would be forced to buy expensive frontier insurance in the country they are visiting. . Up to a million Brits may be forced to take a new driving test  British people driving in Europe could be forced to take a new driving testtheres a no deal Brexit. Up to a million Brits living in Europe were told to replace their driving licence with a local permit immediately. Guidance issued by the Department for Transport said: If you are aUKlicence holder living in theEUorEEAyou should exchange your UK driving licence for a local EU driving licence before  March . From that date, in the event that there is noEUExit deal, you may have to pass a driving test in theEU country you live in to be able to carry on driving there.  More than million EU citizens living in the UK will have less concrete rights to stay. Whether theres a Brexit deal or not, EU citizens can stay in Britainthey register for settled status with the government. But the rules are stricter in a No Deal Brexit. In No Deal, only EU citizens arriving before  March can apply, not those arriving by December . The deadline to apply will be  December , instead of  June there is a Brexit deal. And family members will only be able to join settled EU citizens in the UK before  March . As for the other way round - major EU nations have inidually said theyll allow UK ex-pats to stay, but this could y by country.  Pharmacists have requested special powers to ration medicinesthere is no Brexit deal. Under plans by the Healthcare Distribution Association, they would have special powers to y doctors prescriptions and offer something a drug is unavailable.  million packs of medicines are imported to the UK from the EU every month, and the NHS is preparing for a doomsday scenario to prevent supplies running dry. Government and NHS chiefs have set up a war room called the Operational Response Centre and industry firms are creating six-week stockpiles of medicine. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has chartered a plane to fly in short-shelf-le products, like isotopes for cancer treatment, from Maastricht. Insulin could also be stockpiled. Mr Hancock claimed hes become the biggest buyer of fridges in the world, after fitting out facilities for storage of the crucial drugs. NHS staff are being directed to urge patients not to stockpile medicines personally to avoid shortages throughout the system.  Mobile phone roaming charges could be hiked - less than two years after they were slashed across the EU. Costs were cut in June , meaning there is no extra fee for using a British device on the continent for calls, texts and data. Operators would not be bound by the agreementthe UK crashes out without a deal. The biggest companies, servicing % of customers - Three, EE, O and Vodafone - have no plans to reimpose roaming charges after Brexit. But in terms of the entire mobile market, surcharge-free roaming when you travel to the EU could no longer be guaranteed, the government has warned. . You should get insurance and flexible tickets for Eurostar disruption  Eurostar services could be suspended in a worst-case no deal Brexit. The government has told international train passengers - including the Eurostar - to make sure they have insurance and ticket terms and conditions that are sufficient to cover possible disruption. That implies passengers should buy FLEXIBLE tickets - not the fixed cheap ones that are popular for their low cost. The UK will need bilateral deals with France, Belgium and the Netherlands to ensure international trains keep running. Without such a deal, Britain has proposed recognising EU operator licences until March  to ensure services can continue. But this isnt guaranteed, and UK operators would have to reapply with the EU. Former Transport Secretary Andrew Adonis claimed the notice seems to be saying that the vital train link between Britain and Europe could be severed. . You might have to go through airport security twice  Air passengers changing flights in the EU may have to undergo two security screenings under a no-deal exit. Travellers boarding a plane in the UK to fly to a European airport, before changing flights for an onward destination, would be screened in Britain as they are now. But they might have to have a second check in the EU before getting their connecting flight. “Currently passengers flying from the UK and transferring at an EU airport for an onward flight do not have to be re-screened at that EU airport, because the UK applies, and exceeds, the EU baseline aviation security measures,” says a Department for Transport briefing note. “If there is no deal, and the EU decides not to recognise the UK aviation security system, then passengers and their luggage will have to be re-screened when changing flights in EU hub airports.” . You could be barred from using Netflix and Spoty on holiday  Britons could be barred from accessing their accounts for Netflix, Spoty and other online entertainment while travelling to EU statestheres a no-deal Brexit. Under the EU-wide portability regulation, which took force in April, citizens can access accounts set up and based in one country while visiting other member states. But a government technical notice said: The portability regulation will cease to apply to UK nationals when they travel to the EU. This means online content service providers will not be required or able to offer cross-border access to UK consumers under the EU Regulation. UK consumers may see restrictions to their online content services when they temporarily visit the EU. . If you live in Northern Ireland, you face electricity blackouts  Northern Ireland will be forced to take drastic measures to stop the lights going out. A worst-case No Deal Brexit would scupper the all-island electricity market shared by Northern Ireland and the Republic - leaving it without any legal basis. This would make both markets less efficient, with potential effects for producers and consumers on both sides of the border, the government warns. And it may be necessary to seek additional [legal] powers to preserve security of supply. To stop the lights going out, Northern Ireland would have to take more electricity from British power stations through an interconnector running under the Irish Sea. But Northern Irelands Transmission System Operator may need to rely on fall-back arrangements to ensure power keeps flowing, the government warns. That is why, eventheres a no deal, the government will take all possible measures to keep the all-island market running. There has been talk of barges in the Irish Sea. Dustin Benton of Green Alliance warned:Any emergency action to keep the lights on, both in Northern Ireland and across the rest of the UK, would likely be highly polluting and expensive. . You could be stranded on your package holiday  Package holidaymakers could be left with no legal protectionthe firm they booked with goes bust. Currently Brits have insolvency protectionthey book with a package holiday provider thats based anywhere in the EU. But in a No Deal Brexit, that protection would only applythe firms are targeting the UK market. That means those booking with, say, a cheaper Spanish firm online that has no UK presence could be unprotected. Eventhe UK government could act, in practice it will be much harder to take enforcement action against foreign firms because other countries will no longer recognise UK courts. . Youll lose rights to take action over dangerous products  Government documents reveal the same problem - UK courts not being recognised - will strip Brits of their consumer rights for EU goods bought online. Alex Neill of consumer group Which  warned: A no-deal Brexit would massively weaken peoples rights to take action when they purchase faulty or dangerous products from outside the UK. The Governments advice that we all become experts in international consumer law is hopelessly unrealistic. Securing a good deal with the EU is vital to ensure that Brexit doesnt result in a bonfire of consumer rights and protections.” . Your cigarette packets will change  Graphic warnings on cigarette packets will be replaced by Australian versions in a no-deal Brexit. And in some ways they are even more gruesome than the ones we have now. The grim pictures show a foot ridden with peripheral vascular disease, a clogged artery, a bleeding brain and high-resolution teeth stained black. The photos will be changed in a No Deal Brexit because the European Commission owns theon ones we currently use. That means the UK would be unable to use them after  March . . If youre going through a family breakdown, you could be trapped in limbo  Families who are midway through orce or child custody cases involving another EU country could find themselves trapped in limbo. If there’s a no deal Brexit, the UK will cease to be part of co-operation between EU family courts on  March . Instead the UK will fall back on legal conventions drawn up in The Hague. But these are complicated and do not cover every area of the law. The government has advised families with ongoing cases to seek legal advicethey will not finish by Brexit Day. A government technical note says: Broadly speaking, cases ongoing on exit day will continue to proceed under the current rules. However, we cannot guarantee that EU courts will follow the same principle, nor that EU courts will accept or recognise any judgments stemming from these cases.” . Your everyday medicines and perfumes could become more expensive  Currently, popular ingredients in cold medicines can usually be traded within the EU without a licence. In a no deal, a licence will be required to trade these so-called precursors. Sowe leave without a deal, firms who want to trade such chemicals with the EU will have to register with the Home Office, which can cost between pound and pound,. They will also need an import export license, which costs pound. Critics say this could push up prices for consumers in the shops. Similarly, cosmetics firms will be slapped with more red tape to prove their products are safe for human health. Currently they can use one legal “nominated person” to certy a product for the whole EU market. Butthere’s a no deal Brexit, UK checks won’t be recognised in the EU - and EU checks wont be recognised in the UK. That means two sets of checks. Labour MP Owen Smith claimed drug giants will look to pass on the costs. And finally... your regular caviar parties are doomed!  Caviar imports will be snarled up or stop completely in a No Deal Brexit. Sturgeon eggs join snowdrops, orchids and reptiles in endangered species that would need import and export permits to cross an EU border. Youd only be allowed to bring in g of caviar for personal use. A tragedy.

Amber Peats body was discovered three days after she went missing from her home in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on May , . Nottingham Coroners Court heard the dispute was about cleaning a cool box which was used to store food on a recent family holiday in Cornwall - where the the -year-old hatched plans to run away with her cousin. The youngsters mother Kelly Peat had heard the front door slam shut shortly after the dispute at around .pm. She was reported missing to police by her mum eight hours after the argument. The inquest heard a passer-by had seen somebody of Ambers description enter a hedgerow area near the address around  minutes later. Although up to  police staff were involved in the search for Amber, her body was recovered on June .   The youngster - who had a history of running away - was reported missing at .am on May . Detective Constable Tina Gilfoyle, of Nottinghamshire Police, said Mrs Peat and Ambers stepfather Danny Peat had been to Tesco and had tea while the youngster was missing. Providing background of the the teenagers disappearance, Ms Gilfoyle said the family had moved  times in Ambers letime. The Peats decided to move to Mansfield after concerns about Amber running away and that she may have been groomed by a paedophile. Ms Gilfoyle said: The reason for wanting to move was that Amber had been running away and there were concerns the she may have been groomed by a paedophile.   There were no social workers allocated in her letime but there had been an assessment of the family. Addressing statements given by the younger members on the extended family holiday, Ms Gilfoyle said: They reported Amber had been troubled quite a lot there. There had been lots of arguments - she had been prevented from going to the beach, and together with her cousin she had written a run away list.was a wig, a torch and some rope to run away and her cousin thought it was a joke. Ms Gilfoyle said Ambers stepfather had threatened to hit her after she had scowled at him on the way back from the holiday.  She said: In the car on the way home, she had taken some cherryade without asking and had been scowling at Danny Peat. She was made to sit in the very rear of the family car. Danny Peat saidshe scowled at him again he would hit her. Summarising what had happened on the day Amber disappeared, Ms Gilfoyle said: She was trying to get her mums attention but her mum shuts the door on her, leaving Amber alone in the hallway. A short while later, the door slams and Amber is gone. They went up the street and Kelly thought she saw someone in the bushes but when they went, there was no-one there. Detailing what Mr and Mrs Peat did before they called the police, Ms Gilfoyle said: They went to Tescos and did some shopping and had their tea.  The matter was reported to police by Kelly Peat at .am on May , . Ambers former teacher at John Davies Primary School in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Joanna Holt, said the teenager had always seemed unhappy. Mrs Holt said: She was quite an unhappy child, that stands out most in my head. She never really seemed happy. She felt very put upon at home. She said she had a lot of jobs to do that her siblings werent expected to do... and she wasnt treated fairly in comparison to her siblings.  She would be a little bit dramatic about things. She was quite emotional at times as well. Mrs Holt added: She told me that she felt her mum loved her sister more than she loved her and that her sibling was the favourite. The inquest heard there was no evidence of physical neglect and no sign that Amber was malnourished at the time of her death. Home Office pathologist Frances Hollingbury said there were no traces of alcohol or drugs in her body and no suggestion of a mental illness. The inquest continues.

But sometimes the bants can be taken too far, as one man pointed out this weekend.Johnathan Benson visited Caffeine and Cocktails bar in Reading earlier this week, only to find himself horried by misogynistic phrases written all over the establishment on signs and walls. These included jokes about oral sex and a sign which lists reasons why beer is better than a woman. The list featured phrases such as frigid beer is good beer and beer doesnt get jealous when you grab another beer.Another piece of artwork in the bar read: My girlfriend caught me blow-drying my penis and asked what I was doing. Apparently heating you dinner was not the right answer.Johnathan, , shared his disgust at the remarks on Twitter .In a post he wrote: It has overstepped the boundary between banter or lightheartedness and actual offence.  It looks like it was done in jest, but in this day and age, post Harvey Weinstein and the #MeToo movement, I dont see why anyone - male or female, customer or punter - would think its ok to write those statements.He added: Also, its a venue that has kids going in there on a Saturday or Sunday with their mum or dad for food and they would see that. Im all for tongue-in-cheek [and] a bit of fun, but the messages in the mens loos swing from grossly misogynistic to shockingly poor soft lad jibes. According to one of Johnathans female friends, the bar does have empowering quotes on body image in the womens toilets, with one saying women without thigh gaps are like mermaids.   Many who saw Johnathans post on social media were equally as appalled. One person commented: Horric. Another wrote: This is disgusting and so degrading. I think a toilet make-over is the least of their worriesthey have staff with these views! However not everyone was sympathetic, with a dferent user claiming that in a world full of PC snowflakes the bars signs were hilarious and refreshing.   Caffeine  Cocktails have since responded to Johnathans post, promising to sort the situation out. A spokesperson for the company tweeted: Hi Johnathan, firstly we would like to apologise for making you feel uncomfortable in an environment where you are meant to relax and have fun.

Shai Winn, nine, has a “V-shaped pocket” at the back of her throat meaning food or drink can pass into her airway and kill her. The little girl was born premature at just  weeks and her condition is so serious even swallowing a tiny bit of toothpaste could prove to be fatal. Her mother Lindsey set up a charity called Shai’s Smile last year to help other kids who have a Laryngeal Cleft - what Lindsey has . However, when she tried to post a picture on Facebook to promote it she was told it could not run because it contains an image with shocking, sensational or violent content.  Lindsey, from Chelmsford, told Essex Live : There is no way that picture should have been disapproved. There is nothing that should upset people, it should just make someone feel good because Shai has such a beautul smile.Its supposed to be a positive message from a little girl that fights every day to stay alive. Facebook you should be ashamed. How can this been seen as anything but positive  There is nothing shocking, sensational or excessively violent in this picture.  The advert has since been approved by Facebook. Shai has been tube fed since  and lovingly refers to her tube as Piggy. She spends most of the day connected to a machine to feed her and keep her hydrated. Lindsey said: She wakes up in the morning and has to be really careful about brushing her teeth, becauseshe swallows any toothpaste it could be fatal. She doesnt have breakfast, when she gets to school she has a water feed of ml through her gravity set, which is a big syringe leading to a tube in her tummy.  Then between . and . she is back on the machine which feeds her directly into her bowel. Shai will continue to be fed at ious points through the day before being put back on the machine at .pm. She also has to take four dferent types of medication for ious other health conditions. Lindsey said: When she has the medicine she says to me mummy that tastes horrible which is bizarre because you would think you need your tongue and taste buds to taste.  She longs for the day she can try pizza and coffee for the first time. She added: If we go out for a family meal I feel guilty because Shai cant eat, you can see the look of longing on her face. But she continues to inspire all that know her. Her bravery and courage put many to shame. Her kindness and sense of humour steals the hearts of everyone she meets. Her smile truly captivates your heart.  Lindsey, who also has two sons and another daughter, set up the charity Shais Smile as a legacy to her daughter and hopes it will help raise as much money for childrens charities as possible.

Devastatingly, she has been given just two to four years to live.Heartbroken mum Marie said Natalie began to slur her speech in May and doctors initially thought she had suffered a stroke, the Liverpool Echo reports.However, after undergoing tests, she was told in December she had a devastating muscle wasting disease and given only years to live. Now mum Marie is on a mission to help her beloved daughter complete a bucket list of wishes, before the cruel disease takes hold.   The mum-of-four, from Warrington, said: She thought she would have time to meet someone and get married and have kids, learn to drive and go abroad, all these things she should have been able to do. Her speech has got worse over the past few months and she is finding it hard to eat now, because the muscles in her neck and tongue are getting weaker, so she will need a stomach peg fitted. We are getting her an iPad too so that she can use it for communicating. Doctors have said she will probably be able to live this year able bodied but after that she will need -hour care.   Words cant express how Im feeling, its just heartbreaking and devastating. Le will never be the same again. Before her tragic diagnosis, Natalie worked full-time at a call centre in Runcorn and lived in a flat in Warrington, with her three cats. In her final year living independently, Natalie wants to fulfill a bucket list of wishes including doing a skye with her dad, going abroad for the first time and swimming with sharks. She also wants to make memories with her niece and nephew and two younger sisters and brother - who Marie said are all so close. Marie, , said: She is so strong and is going to keep fighting and fighting until the disease takes over.   She wants to go on holidays with family members inidually to make memories with them. Her brother is taking her to Amsterdam and she said she wants to go to a log cabin with her sisters. She wants to go to Australia to meet relatives she has never met before and wants to watch the sunset in Greece. She wants to swim with sharks and dolphins and do a skye with her dad. I need to try and raise what I can for her possible last year of being able bodied. Dawsons Tattoo shop in Stockton Heath has also kicked off her list of wishes by offering to complete her sleeve tattoo for free.   Marie said: I am so proud of Natalie, even before this, she is so much stronger than me. She is very independent, kind and beautul. Everyone is trying to be strong for her but it is very hard. She doesnt want anyone crying. She added: I think when something like this happens it just makes you think - dont take le for granted, because anything can happen. Natalie was a healthy young woman, she went to the gym, worked all her le right from leaving school. She was independent with her own flat - everything was hunky-dory and then this happened.   It isnt hereditary and it was nothing she has done that has caused it, it has just happened and unfortunately happened to her. In order to help raise money and give Natalie a year to remember, a JustGiving page has been launched. Marie is also organising fundraising events. The page has already raised close to half the pound, target. Marie added: It doesnt matterits pound, every little bit really does help and will go towards what she wants to do.

It has stood empty ever since and is usually patrolled by guards - but an urban explorer crept in to get photos of what it looks like now.

There are still murals on the walls of the former secure unit, including one of an upset child with the words all I wanted for my birthday was my dad back....I got a bike.   There are pool tables in the games room, and educational posters about the human body on the walls, as well as a filthy kitchen and what looks like a woodwork room.

The home also held Mary Bell who strangled two boys, aged three and four, when she was -years-old in .

There is loads of stuff just left there. Old games and snooker tables and all sorts.   Its strange. Its aspeople just got up and left one day. To be honest I just wanted to get out because it was eerie in there with all of its history. It was completely creepy.  Because of its history and who had been detained there, it had a weird feeling about being there. It was weird to see everything just left there. The centre opened in  and was one of several juvenile detention facilities in England.  Its still owned by the local authority, but nobody has cleared up after the door was officially shut, leaving bikes, photos and kids personal belongings behind. A poster explaining the dangers of drugs was also photographed, along with artwork on the wall which says guns dont kill people, they kill families.

Plummer, from Hull, was convicted of drug smuggling after a search of her luggage in an Egyptian airport revealed  Tramadol tablets. The Brit swore they were for her Egyptian husband Omar who suffered chronic back pain however she was prosecuted by the authorities. Laura, who says she did not know the drugs were illegal, has now made an unusual vow after she was granted a presidential pardon and was yesterday moved to a police station.  The -year-old is due to begin her journey home to Hull today.She told The Sun: “I’m so happy to be going home. I mean, who goes on holiday for two weeks and then stays  months ”“I just wish I wasn’t being deported. But I promise you — I’ll never set foot in an airport again.”   Laura was arrested in October  after flying into the country from Manchester. Tramadol is a prescription-only painkiller in the UK and is banned in Egypt because it can be used as a heroin substitute. Customs officers found the  Tramadol pills sitting at the top of her case. They were not hidden and Laura claimed she had been given the pills by a workmate. Laura spent over a year in Cairos notorious AlQanaterprison.

It was revealed today that the Duke of Sussex, , will be in Norway on official duties on the most romantic day of the year. Kensington Palace tweeted that Harry will be visiting a remote training camp  miles inside the Arctic Circle on February . He will be there to celebrate the th anniversary of Exercise Clockwork in Bardufoss - the traditional name of the annual winter exercise that trains Royal Marines and Royal Navy sailors and airmen. The Palace also tweeted: “The Duke of Sussex will meet military personnel living and training on the base, view some of the specialist outdoor severe weather equipment and training that is conducted at Clockwork and talk with expert aircrews and engineers.”   The Duchess of Sussex, who is around six months pregnant with their first child, will be unlikely to join Harry on the royal trip as the visit will include spending time in one of “the world’s most demanding environments”. Meanwhile, a body language experts has weighed in on why the pregnant duchess is constantly cradling her bump. According to Harry Witchel it is the -year-old’s attempt at reserved royal behaviour. He told the Mail on Sunday: Meghan tends to cup her bump by knitting her fingers together – a sign of holding back and being more grounded.  Thats quite a contrast to her usual behaviour, which involves dealing with the world with gusto. As a Royal she is expected to be more reserved, so is this a subconscious attempt to be so  This doesnt look like acting. This looks like a woman aware of a change in her body. Meghan will give birth in the spring, but her exact due date has not been made public. The new arrival will be seventh in line to the throne, but it is unlikely that the baby boy or girl will be given the title of Prince or Princess. Instead they will probably become a Lord or a Lady as they are too far down the line of succession.   Ahead of the birth, Meghan and Harry will leave Kensington Palace and London and move to their new home Frogmore Cottage in Windsor.

We cannot understand why he is only eating that and not losing weight.”   The average ten-year-old boy should weigh just under five stone, experts say, but the boy weighs nearly four stone more than the average British man. The -year-old, from Hertfordshire, is on a reduced timetable at school, reportedly because his size means he cannot manage a full day. His mum is also overweight at  stone and she also has a fat daughter.   She claims that her son had been active, gone swimming and boxed but his weight still went up.

His creepy behaviour strikes unerring parallels with that of Joe Goldberg, who finds out everything about graduate Guinevere Beck in the popular drama You. Salih was jailed for four years at Hove Crown Court in October  for stalking Ms Mitchell, but is now set to be freed later this year. His upcoming release has left mum-of-three Ms Mitchell, from St Leonards, East Sussex, frightened he could strike again.   She said: The memory of being stalked never leaves you and I stay vigilant. I am worried he might go after my daughter. I dont want to move because I know he will go after my kids. The thing with stalking is that its not one big thing - the police were looking at each incident as isolated events. But with stalking its about the bigger picture - on their own each event may seem unremarkable, but when you put them all together its a totally dferent picture. Salih first approached Ms Mitchell in her office car park in June  when he asked her for a date.  But the stalker, originally from Iran, had already found out everything about the orced counsellor. Ms Mitchell claims over the next ten years he made her le a misery. She said: When I hung up he would keep calling, calling me  to  times an hour. At one point, my cat was killed and placed underneath my neighbours car tires. It has never been proved that Salih had anything to do with the killing. Ms Mitchell continued: He was sending me inappropriate messages all the time, he was following me at the supermarket, he would sit in his car outside my house. I was terried. I was carrying a red alarm with me at all times and I became afraid to go out - I stopped wearing high heels and I was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.  She only found out about Salihs  previous convictions when he appeared in court. The driver has a letime restraining order against her but a history of breaching them.A spokesman for Sussex Police said: After the case we asked Lorraine to help this force and others to better understand stalking behaviours from a victims perspective.She had a valuable input, with many people and groups, in delivering some multi agency training to police and the CPS in .  Our training in this area of work is continuing. PC Jenna Boyd, from the force, added: This woman has endured a gradually escalating campaign of systematic stalking by Salih. The experience left her terried for the safety of both herself and her family. Although Salih did not overtly threaten her or attempt any physical attack, his actions have had a signicant emotional impact on her, and we are glad that the court has reflected this in the sentence. We hope that the sentence and the Restraining Order will give Salih a dose of reality, and that the victim will now be able to move on with her le without fear of his presence in it.

He also tried to punch her. Miss Loan said thatthe injury had been even a fraction higher, she would have been blinded. The -year-old was at Derby Crown Court to see Declan Potter jailed for the attack, which took place outside Sinfin Moor Social Club in Derby.Potter, , was sentenced to six months behind bars, reports the Derby .  Miss Loan said: “It was completely unprovoked. “He approached me in the smoking area and asked me what my problem was. “I said what are you on about  And he came towards me and stubbed the cigarette out in my face. “Had it been a couple of millimetres higher he would have blinded me in one eye.” Luc Chignall, prosecuting, said the attack happened in the smoking area outside the club, in Arleston Lane, during the early hours of February , last year. He said Miss Loan, who was  at the time, was talking to a friend when Potter approached her. Mr Chignall said: “They did not know each other, this was completely unprovoked. “There seems to have been some kind of argument or dispute.   “During it, he jabbed her in the eye with the cigarette and then follows it up with a couple of punches which he tries to land.” Mr Chignall said the police were called and Potter, of Macauley Street, Sinfin, left.

In her victim personal statement, Miss Loan, who was supported by family and friends in court, said: “The injury was right under my eye in an obvious place and I had to disguise it at first using make up and by wearing sunglasses.

In , police had about eight Tinder-related calls a week, or a total of .

Ms Rowe, from Canterbury, Kent, spoke to Anthony Ray for six months before he disappeared and she now wants the Government to make posing as someone online to forge a fake relationship illegal. “This man used me like a personal hotel with benefits under the guise of wanting the romantic, loving relationship he knew I craved,” Rowe told Kent Online . “He broke my trust, took away my right to choose. I did not consent to having a relationship with a married man, or a man who was actively having relations with multiple women simultaneously.” The jump in reports follows a spate of high-profile crimes in which fraudsters, rapists and killers have used the smartphone app to trawl for victims, reports the Daily Mail.

Researchers suggested that taking a soak in the tub has several very real health benefits for both men and women. As part of their study, half of the volunteers took a bath in C temperature water, while the other half did an hour of cycling.The cycling group were found to burn more calories, but those in the bath still burned some, and experienced other advantages. They found the hot bath also helped to maintain healthy blood sugar levels and improve the quality of their sleep.  Dr Steve Faulkner, an exercise physiologist from Nottingham Trent University, explained: When you get into a hot bath, your body has to try to prevent itself from overheating. It does this by widening blood vessels to try to transfer some of the heat from the blood into the surrounding atmosphere.This change then has an impact on blood pressure , so to maintain stable pressure, your heart rate increases too.He added: When you take a hot bath, you see a number of physiological responses that are very similar to what you see in exercise.   The study also found that people who treat themselves to some time in a sauna or hot tub also have a reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. While the results and findings may please those who hate going to the gym, Dr Faulkner warns that proper exercise still needs to be done regularly.Its not a shortcut to fitness or a replacement for exercise, he said. It can mimic some of the benefits of exercise but not everything.But for people who cant exercise, perhaps because of a specic health condition or disability, it could be a useful option.

That’s cultural, it’s not on the map, and it should be.“There are loads of dferent things that could be on the map and I hope it gets people thinking about their own ideas of what should be there.“It’s a real strength that our city is considered an equal alongside cities like Bilbao, Helsinki and Barcelona.“We can’t create jobs and investment unless we extend outwith Scotland – culture is a really good way of doing that.“The map is another string to our bow.”Aside from the commode additions in Broughty Ferry, the City of Discovery’s scores of cultural highlights are all present and correct.Key buildings such as the DCA, The McManus, Dundee Rep and the VA all make the cut in the city centre – as do dozens of city churches, statues and sculptures.Assurances have been given Dundee will still feature on the map post-Brexit. vw, px\"  Dundee isn’t alone in having public loos accidentally highlighted as “cultural gems”.Glasgow has one, in the northern suburb of Stepps, while UK capital London boasts of no fewer than  “culturally signicant” toilets on the Cultural Gems map.Paris has four, while Barcelona has one. In Scandanavia, Danish capital Copenhagen has listings for five.However, Portguese capital Lisbon takes the cultural loo crown with  listed public facilities on the guide.The reasons for toilets being picked up alongside sculptures, art galleries and theatres, isn’t all that clear.Upon the project website’s launch last year, European Commission bosses said the data was based on locations listed in OpenStreetMap as “points of interest”.As a result, it appears any item listed as a “point of interest” made it into the guide without being checked.The European Commission said: “The map is crowd-sourced.“Therefore citizens, local administrators and not-for-profit-organisations are key to uploading content about their cities.“Nevertheless, the programme comes with maps providing an initial set of points of interest for European cities in the app from OpenStreetMap.”Toilets aside, the guide is a highly detailed way of finding out about a city’s achievements and its contributions to art.The comprehensive database already offers up thousands of cinemas, art galleries, sites of historical signicance and music venues.Alongside the big hitters, it lists churches and community

When did two players from Mid Argyll help Rangers win the Scottish Cup The answer is # . Local girls Jasmine McPhie and Carla Todd were both key players in Rangers Girls triumphant run in the Girls Under  Scottish Cup.In their run to the final, Rangers played the top four under  girls teams in Scotland beating Aberdeen - in the first round, then Hamilton - and Central Girls - in rounds two and three. A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -. Rangers took the lead again in extra time with a deserved winner to secure the cup.Jasmine and Carla came through the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre from primary one age to primary seven, playing in local festivals.In   the girls were important members of the successful Lochgilphead Red Star  team which won the DFDL league cup and finished second in their league. At the end of that season they joined Rangers Girls where they are in their second season playing mostly in the Paisley League against boys teams but also in national girls# competitions.Both girls have also been involved in Scotland national squads for their age group and the Soccer Centre is delighted to see them thriving with a big club.With more than  girls now playing football through the Soccer Centre, the success of Jasmine and Carla should be a real inspiration for local girls.So girls, you may live out in rural Mid Argyll but with talent, hard work and the right attitude you could be creating your own football opportunities."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries 9","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowDrawn on Monday January , Kilmory Camanachd Club#s lottery numbers were ,  and .

It was written for Count Friedrich Wilhelm, supposedly simplied for amateurs to play. However, Jamal and Jâms being master musicians showed the power of this often disregarded piece, to be immense. One of the first works to make piano and cello equal musical partners, it is full of ingenious dialogue between the instruments. The structure is unusual, but with such expert performers it delighted the audience who were moved by every turn and twist of this deeply emotional work.Jâms, from North Wales, after remarking on the three ferry crossings required to get to Ardrishaig via Bute, introduced the next piece, Ernest Bloch’s work ‘From Jewish Le’. In a style close to Jamal’s heart and heritage, having been born in Baku Azerbaijan, its three elements, ‘Prayer’, ‘Supplication’ and ‘Jewish Song’, are full of the pathos and sorrow felt by the Jewish nation and also full of the signature augmented intervals and minor key tonality of much of middle eastern musics. How beautully these pieces demonstrated the lyrical qualities of the cello. Jamal’s bow searched for all possible nuances of tone and dynamic as his instrument sang from its lowest notes to a seductive soprano register.The concert continued after the interval with a second Beethoven work. The audience may have noticed a minor kerfuffle at the piano as many pages were rapidly turned before starting. Would it be the ‘Seven Variations’ for cello and piano or the ‘Twelve’, both based on themes from Mozart’s Magic Flute  The ‘Seven Variations’ won, being on the theme from the ‘Pamina’ and ‘Papageno’ duet entitled ‘In men, who know the feeling of love’. This work exhibits Beethoven’s practised ingenuity in the iation form and brought a lighter mood to the programme.Jâms Coleman introduced the final work, Frank Bridge’s Cello Sonata. He told of the four years of torment for the composer as he struggled to express his feelings about the First World War, finally finishing the composition in . The adagio in the piece caused the composer the most dficulty as he struggled with ambivalence about his own pacist views. Jâms and Jamal dealt with the challenges of this complex work which tracks huge changes in the world of music composition that were under way at that time. Again, the lyrical powers of the cello came to the fore as did the virtuosic requirements heaped on the pianist. Despite its undoubted innovations, this piece generously reaches out to its audience. Bridge uses the new musical freedoms only when justied, being happy toto more traditional tonal stability in the lyrical sections.Fulfilled, but not overburdened by the weightiness of the final piece, the audience applauded Jamal and Jâms back to the concert room to perform the ‘Swan’ from Saint-Saens ‘Carnival of the Animals’ as encore. This piece so beautully confirmed the excellence of Jamal’s playing and the superb quality of his quite special instrument.PIC:Jamal Aliyev and Jâms Coleman. no_aJamalandJam"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray carpet bowling club festive pairs competition","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Inveraray Carpet Bowling Club held its annual festive pairs competition.The first prize of turkeys was won by George Morrison and Alan Cameron.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"caravan caught alight sparks major","story":"NewsCaravan which caught alight sparks major fire operationThe derelict property on Kilmarnock Road in Monkton went up in flames last Thursday night as the caravan attached to it caught fire.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  JAN NewsThe fire spread to the adjacent property \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA caravan which caught alight sparked a large scale fire operation as it set ablaze to a neighbouring house.

And Somerset boss McCall reckons the defender could even go on to eclipse goal king Lawrence Shankland - who is wanted by a string of top English clubs. He told the Ayrshire Post: You never want to lose players but Im delighted for the boy on a personal level. Everyone talks about Lawrence but, in my opinion, Michael Rose could go on to achieve just as much -not more -he wants to.

Of course wed have loved to keep him, but we have to be realistic. Rose is one of a number of players to reinvent their careers under McCall following his failure to break through as a youth at Aberdeen. And McCall said: It is further proof to boys thatthey come here and develop themselves, they will get their reward. Michael is an outstanding player with a very bright future and we wish him all the best.

Georgies was the first confirmed case in the Borders.Lynsay said: \"The only way that you can be sure it is Alabama rot is to have a post mortem so Georgie was then taken to the Dick Vet in Edinburgh where it was confirmed that she had had Alabama rot. My other dog was tested for it but thankfully the results were clear.\"The Kennel Club is warning dog owners to be extra vigilant at this time of year as the peak season for the disease is between November and May.Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club Secretary said: ldquoAlthough the disease is very rare, affecting an extremely low percentage of dogs in the UK, the condition is very serious and potentially le-threatening. It is therefore vital that owners understand and recognise the warning signs, especially as time plays a signicant part in successfully treating the disease.ldquoWe are asking owners to look out for any signs of Alabama rot during the winter months and to remember to take action right away. Any dogs with unexplained or concerning skin lesions which typically look like sores, ulcers, or red, swollen, bruised areas, commonly with an infected appearance should be taken to their vet as soon as possible. These skin changes are usually found on their paws or lower legs, but may also appear on their head, face or lower body. Dogs who have contracted the disease may also become tired, disinterested in food, or present other signs of illness like vomiting or diarrhoea.ldquoAlthough these signs may not necessarily mean your dog has Alabama rot, acting quickly and speaking to a vet to determine what is wrong is the best course of action to protect your petrsquos health.While large amounts of research have been carried out over the last six years, the cause of the disease remains unknown. As yet, no evidence has been found to suggest that CRGV is caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, toxins, or radiation. There is speculation that it is related to mud or water, due to the higher prevalence in winter and spring, and relatively low case numbers seen in the summer.Caroline continued: ldquoTo lower any risk of your dog contracting Alabama rot, itrsquos also advisable to keep your dog away from very muddy areas, wash wet or muddy dogs straight after a walk and regularly check your dogrsquos body for anything thatrsquos dferent.,params: .pushldquoWhile a distinct seasonal pattern is suggested, we must continue to research this deadly disease and ensure all dog owners are aware of the signs and symptoms so they are able to seek veterinary advice immediately.Despite what happened, Lynsay still s to walk Taffy along the river in Gattonside.

It was a cold day but my friend, who is skilled in bushcraft, had brought his portable fire pit with him.We searched for drtwood and sat by the fire, roasting marshmallows and warming our hands. It was a short walk but dramatic rock formations loomed above us, making it feel like a real adventure. The kids climbed them and explored the rocky beach, where once there had been an open-air bathing pool.On our , we went through a small tunnel-like arch. I stopped for a moment, suddenly taken by the view. The ruins of Dunbar Castle were beautully framed by the archway. Locals call this archway the keyhole and I reflected that the term is a perfect name.When we look through a keyhole, our vision is narrowly focussed. Such was the effect here. It cast a visual spotlight on what is left of what was once a mighty fortress.The kids trundled on before me, noticing smaller wonders: a frozen worm on the path, a sea shell and interesting-looking stones. But I stood for some moments, taking in the view beyond and thinking of what stories those old stones of the castle could tell.Many people pass this way every day, both locals and visitors. Itrsquos a section of the John Muir Way. I have often been with my family to Dunbar Leisure Pool and the harbour and town. But somehow I had missed this short but spectacular nearby walk until this day.Dunbar Castle is now but a fallen-down ruin. Indeed, itrsquos dficult to imagine what it once was. But the weathered sandstone castles on the shoreline built by nature still stand defiant, somehow reminding us of their greater permanence in the face of human transience. But as I stood looking at the ruins, the keyhole focussed my thoughts as well as my vision.History is also viewed through a keyhole, a very narrow one. The lives and events of the castle were lived in most part unrecorded by it. The spotlight of history has illuminated only brief moments, and even then the characters have been only those deemed lsquoimportantrsquo.There are moments where the view through the narrow keyhole of history has included insights to untold stories. The bravery of Black Agnes, as she defied the siege in , is one of those. With her husband away, she was in charge of this important fortress during war with England. She refused to give up the castle, even in the face of bombardment and attempts to starve her small garrison into submission. Her mocking of her besiegers by dusting down the battlements with her maids after a bombardment is an image seared in legend.But itrsquos a chink of light on a huge untold story we are led to believe by historyrsquos silence that women were insignicant players in events. For sure they were oppressed and put down by a system that centred on male power, but they are half of humanity and at least half the story.As the actions of Black Agnes reveal, even with such constraints put on them, women were there, part of events and often refusing to accept their assigned role.The le of Mary Queen of Scots has always been for me an example of this. Yes, she was privileged and powerful by birth, but because of this history took notice of her.Despite all the political and religious challenges she faced, it was her womanhood which men deemed her main failing. And so she was judged by dferent standards. Had she behaved with the morals of her father she would not have lasted five minutes in power. But no one raised an eyebrow because he was a man.But more than this, even though Mary was the monarch, her royal authority was deemed diluted and even less legitimate merely because she was a woman.So she understood she needed to find a husband to bring her royal authority to full strength in a country full of powerful and bullying misogynist men.She chose the dashing young Darnley, and the fact that he turned out to be dross was not, in my opinion, Maryrsquos fault. How easy it is to blame a woman for a manrsquos failings. She was taken in by him it was he who was the failure, not her.Thatrsquos what Irsquove always maintained, despite the protestations of my tutors at university. And her third husband Bothwell, well he was a disappointment as well.It is the stones of Dunbar,they could speak, who could tell us of the truth of his forced union with Mary. She had been taken there by him in April . The circumstances of this still remain debated. Was she abducted by him as later claimed, or did she go willingly It was also claimed she was raped and forced to marry Bothwell soon afterwards to save her honour . This idea has been disputed by some because Mary is said to have miscarried with twins while imprisoned at Lochleven Castle some months after, suggesting a relationship with Bothwell even before Darnleyrsquos murder. So a woman cannot be abused by a man she has had a relationship with  Really If they could talk, the stones of Dunbar would whisper the truths of those events in , and the despair and desperation of a strong and clever woman whose destiny was stolen mainly because of her sex.These were my thoughts as I stood looking through the keyhole towards Dunbar Castle. Suddenly, my daughter Manja broke my trance by wiggling the frozen worm in front of me. I smiled and thought to myself that thankfully times have changed since the days when the castle was a fortress.But sometimes, I fear, not as much as we think they have."},{"url":null,"title":"new-fidra-gin-hoping-for-east-lothian-base","story":"Fidra Gin is the brainchild of Emma Bouglet and Jo Brydie and is currently based at Ballencrieff and Aviemore.The duo came together to create the juniper berry-based drink and have already enjoyed immediate success, with the product already available in a number of Edinburgh restaurants.Now they are hoping to make it  per cent based in the county, with plans under way to find suitable premises.Emma said: ldquoWe pick all the botanicals in East Lothian and, at the moment, we use a still in Aviemore.ldquoA friend has lent us his still for the time being so we can get enough momentum behind us and bring the whole operation to East Lothian.ldquoWe have potentially secured a premise in East Lothian.

As a key member of the European Convention, Kerr wrote Article  of the Lisbon Treaty ndash the clause which triggered Brexit. He was permanent undersecretary at the Foreign Office ndash making him effectively the UKrsquos chief diplomat - and he was also our man in Washington and Brussels, serving as Ambassador to the United States and as the British representative to the European Union. He also negotiated the Maastricht Treaty with John Major, securing the UKrsquos opt out from the euro, and negotiated nuclear armaments for Margaret Thatcher at Nato.THE MISTAKES\"We didnrsquot know our foe very well,\" he says of the negotiations ndash not that Kerr sees the EU as an enemy, quite the opposite. \"We didnrsquot study the other side. We thought we could have our cake and eat it. We thought they needed us more than we needed them, that we could pick them off one by one, that the deal could be done in Berlin over a weekend.\"He speaks incredulously of Brexiteer ministers who \"didnrsquot understand that [the  EU member states] would stick together, would stick up for Ireland, would defend the integrity of the single market. These were basic mistakes\".A bigger mistake, though, was that \"we didnrsquot have a clear vision of where we wanted to end up. We didnrsquot decide how close or far away from the EU we wanted to be\". Theresa May, says Kerr, avoided that discussion in Cabinet as ministers would have disagreed ndashuntil at Chequers last July when she did put forward her proposals resulting in the resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson, as Brexit Secretary and Foreign Secretary.Kerr continues with his withering assessment of May: \"She didnrsquot reach out to Parliament, shersquos never tried talking to the opposition to find a common position, shersquos never reached out to the country and explained we canrsquot have our cake and eat it, and shersquos never reached out to Edinburgh, Cardf and Belfast and tried to form a consensus of the four nations.\"It was \"muddling along\", he says. \"Getting involved in tactical battles without an overall strategy is a big mistake ndash and one that we made.\"If therersquos been worse negotiations in history, then Kerr \"canrsquot think of one at the moment\". Mayrsquos deal is \"very humiliating\" and its parliamentary defeat \"unprecedented\", he says. \"With some of my friends in Brussels, itrsquos quite awkward talking to them now as theyrsquore embarrassed by the scale of their success and our humiliation\".Kerr believes civil servants from the Foreign Office should have played a central role in negotiations. He turns his attention to Johnson, Davis and Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary. \"I donrsquot think it was a good idea to put Johnson, Fox and Davis in charge of this negotiation,\" he says. \"I think that meant the Prime Minister was slightly cut off from official advice.\"In comparison, EU officials involved in negotiations \"were professionals who knew the European institutions very well\". Kerr says the Foreign Office was cut out as it \"was not really trusted because it was seen as having been in the past rather in favour of remaining in the EU\".\"A very serious mistake was made putting Mr Johnson in charge of the Foreign Office,\" he adds, \"because the Prime Minister clearly didnrsquot trust Mr Johnson, but advice coming from the Foreign Office obviously had to come through Mr Johnson and that probably reduces the chances of that advice being listened to.\"Kerr points out that \"the unity of the  has been remarkable, and thatrsquos partly down to us making it easier for them by never coming forward with any proposals at any stage of the negotiation. We always reacted to proposals from the other side. In negotiation, the power of holding the pen is real ndashyou set the agenda by putting forward the proposals, you donrsquot necessarily get everything you put forward but yoursquore off to a good start. The inability to decide in Cabinet where we wanted to end up meant we never actually put a proposal on the table. We made speeches in London but we didnrsquot put forward any negotiating documents.\"WHAT NEXTKerr now believes that we are heading \"for extra time\" ndash which could only be done through an extension of Article  delaying Brexit ndash and then a second referendum.\"I think the muddle wersquore in now is one which canrsquot be sorted by March . I think it may well end up in a second referendum, and I think it should end up in a second referendum as itrsquos now been established that a lot of the promises made in  canrsquot be kept, and people have tumbled to the fact that leaving without a deal would be a very serious economic disruption. Therersquos also been a very clear rejection of the deal that Mrs May brought back. It follows there should either be a better deal or no Brexit. I think wersquore probably heading for a second referendum.\"Renegotiation is unlikely. \"Itrsquos possible a dferent form of Brexit will emerge from Parliament and be negotiated with the EU,\" says Kerr, \"but I donrsquot think so. I think the EU isnrsquot going to make many changes to the deal it spent two years negotiating.\"As to how a second referendum would go, Kerr says we are in the lap of the gods. \"At present, opinion polls say thattherersquos a referendum tomorrow Remainers would win - but David Cameron was ahead with his remain campaign at the start of the  referendum and he lost.\"If he was advising the Government hersquod tell them \"wersquore in a bad mess, the best thing to do is stop and think and ask the people what they want now they can see what leaving means: do they want Mrs Mayrsquos deal, no deal ndash which would be a complete disaster ndash or do they want to stick with the deal wersquove got, full membership of the EU\".If Britain chose to remain in Europe \"no-one could make us pay a price by taking off our rebate or forcing us to join the euro. These threats the leavers talk about, none of them are true. We would pay no price, political or financial,we decided to stay. So I think wersquore heading for a pause for thought, an extension of Article , and a referendum.\"SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCEKerr got involved in the independence referendum because of Europe. \"I campaigned against Alex Salmond as I didnrsquot believe him when he saidwe Scots went independent while the UK was in the EU that wersquod be allowed to just pull up another chair at the table,\" he says.Kerr argued that an independent Scotland would need to apply for EU membership. \"I thought that would be perfectly doable, but when Scotland got in it would be on new members terms,\" he said ndash that would mean no UK-style rebate. \"Scots would therefore be paying more per head that any Englishman,\" said Kerr.However, Kerr accepts that \"this argument is irrelevant\"the UK leaves the EU ndash and that means a big part of the Better Together case collapses.Nevertheless, Kerr remains a strong supporter of the union. \"Being members of the UK multiples Scottish influence. If we Scots left the UK, the economic disruption would be even greater than the economic disruptionas members of the UK we leave the EU.\" He adds: \"Economists say the effect of leaving the single market of the UK, in terms of the damage to the Scottish economy, would be five times as great as the damage to the UK of leaving the EU.\"Personally, Kerr says, he wants to be \"very Scottish, pretty British, and rather European\".NORTHERN IRELANDKerr is hoping that peace holds in Northern Ireland amid the destabilisation of Brexit. \"Wersquore in a very dangerous country when wersquove stories like the Government thinking of going for some amendment to the Good Friday Agreement as a way of getting around the need for the backstop,\" he says.\"The Good Friday Agreement is a hugely important achievement and for  years itrsquos worked and we havenrsquot had ato the Troubles. We need to tip toe around this very carefully and Irsquom not sure all the politicians in London quite understand how fragile the situation is.\"I think itrsquos also a pity that the Government is relying for its majority on the DUP. I think itrsquos quite hard to play the role that John Major and Tony Blair played of being the mediator, the honest broker,yoursquore relying for your political survival on the support of one party which is very sectarian in its support.\"THE FAR RIGHTKerr says that a second referendum would \"bring some social tensions\" with hardcore Leavers angry at another vote, but he feels \"the social tensions over time of dragging us out of the EU without giving us the chance to say what we want, now the terms are known, would be even more socially disruptive\".\"Young people,\" he says, \"would be deeply resentfulthe golden oldies refused them the chance to have another say.\"Kerr also worries about the effect of English nationalism on the rest of the country. \"Itrsquos the case that in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, that to be dragged out because of an English nationalist vote against the EU would breed resentment unless there was another fair test of what the public as a whole wants.\"\"You get social tension either way,\" he says. However, we need to face down the worst of it.\"If you look at the history of countries where right-wing populist movements gained force ndash say, the history of s Germany ndash the unwillingness to stand up to thugs, thatrsquos really very dangerous to society. The worst reason for not having a second referendum would bewe were frightened of right-wing populist gangs in the street ndash you have to take a stand against that sort of thing. We live in a liberal democratic country and people should not be blackmailed or bludgeoned into a particular political course by threats from thugs.\"WHAT THE WORLD MAKES OF IT ALLKerr knows the corridors of power the world over. Today, governments around the globe are bewildered by the UK chucking away influence and prestige.\"The world doesnrsquot quite understand whatrsquos going on,\" he says. \"It seems to be some breakdown in the UK.\" He adds: \"The fact we were one of the two most influential states in the EU meant that American presidents listened to us quite a lot as they knewthey could do a deal with us we could probably sell that deal to the EU. It was a multiplier of our influence.\"We were more powerful in Brussels as we were known to be influential in Washington, and we were more influential in Washington as were known to be powerful in Brussels. Our friends in Canberra, Delhi, and Ottawa attached considerable importance to the help we could give them in Brussels, so our friends around the world are a bit confused as to why we would want to give all that up.\"I donrsquot think the die is yet cast, though. I think we could well draw back ndash in which case this would be seen as a very odd episode, where we seem to have gone through some sort of crisis but come through it okay.\"If we go ahead and leave the EU I think wersquoll pay a price that wonrsquot just be economic ndash and itrsquoll be a serious economic price, particularly for poorer people in our society ndash it would also be political. I think our influence in the world as a whole would shrink.\"THE ROOTS OF BREXITFew,any, of the main drivers of Brexit had much to do with Europe, in Kerrrsquos opinion. First and foremost is \"the way the British political machine and successive governments tended to connive with Fleet Street in presenting Brussels as a place of endless battles and ambushes, that Britain was alone against these horrible continentals\".In fact, he says, \"we were the most influential state in Brussels. We had more influence on the commission than any other member state, the single market was ised by Margaret Thatcher ndash but ministers liked to pretend that it was a struggle between the forces of light, the British, and the forces of darkness on the continent\".Secondly, comes the toxic subject of immigration. \"Political elites underestimated the effects of immigration on particular bits of the country. Although immigration is very good for the country, it clearly puts strains on health, education and housing in particular areas, and that was ruthlessly exploited by the Leave campaign.\"Peoplersquos concern wasnrsquot with young people from Poland coming to earn some money and then go home, it was more with immigration from the subcontinent, from India and Pakistan, and there was that nasty link made between Muslim immigration and a terrorist threat ndash a  link in my view.\"EU membership doesnrsquot in any way restrain what our immigration rules are in respect of non-EU citizens, sopeople had wanted to restrict immigration from the subcontinent they could have done so at any time and the EU would have had nothing to say about it.\"Finally, therersquos the economic component. \"The huge wealth of financial Britain, particularly the City of London, contrasted with some left behind bits of the country, and that contrast was deepened by the austerity policies of George Osborne.\"Saying lsquowe are all in this togetherrsquo sounded good but it didnrsquot feel like that for people who saw tax cuts for the rich and huge cuts in support for local government, the NHS, education, and the closure of libraries. That too had nothing to do with the EU. It wasnrsquot EU rules which meant we had to go through austerity, it was the decision after the  crisis that we needed to tighten our belts, and the way we tightened our belt was seen in some parts of the country as pretty unfair.\"Itrsquos a pity then, Kerr adds wryly, that the standard bearers for the remain campaign in  ended up being David Cameron and George Osborne."},{"url":null,"title":"removing-irish-backstop-from-brexit-deal-would-not-be-acceptable-to-eu","story":"Simon Coveney said the European Parliament would not raty an agreement without it, adding: ldquoItrsquos as simple as that.It comes as Mrs May faces another crunch week in Westminster as her deal s to the Commons tomorrow, with a number of MPs tabling amendments to try to change the course of Brexit.The Prime Ministerrsquos deal was dramatically defeated by  votes earlier this month, with much of the criticism focused on the backstop ndash a measure aimed at avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.Speaking on the BBCrsquos Andrew Marr Show, Mr Coveney said: ldquoThe backstop is already a compromise.

A few weeks earlier Canadas Globe and Mail had declared: ldquoA self-destructive madness grips the UK\".And it is not just Brexiteers who stand accused. Remainers and campaigners for a Peoplersquos Vote or a second referendum have been branded deluded and dangerous enemies of the people.Butwe have all taken leave of our senses, there may be a psychological explanation. And while research carried out in Scotland and published this week gives fresh insight into this collective act of self-harm, the original theories date back to the work of a Scottish journalist, poet and songwriter born  years ago and raised in an orphanage for Scots children in London.Charles Mackay is best remembered for his  book Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, which is still cited today as one of the earliest studies of how large numbers of people can participate in very bad decisions.So what is the Madness of Crowds Mackayrsquos three-volume work highlighted examples of mass hysteria, from economic booms and subsequent busts such as the South Sea Bubble to witch hunts and the popular expectation that alchemists might one day turn base metals into gold. It looked to explain why large populations or communities sometimes embrace irrational beliefs and ideas, often in defiance of a blindingly obvious reality.ldquoWe find that whole communities suddenly fix their minds upon one object and go mad in its pursuit, Mackay wrote. ldquoMillions of people become simultaneously impressed with one delusion and run after it, till their attention is caught by some new folly more captivating than the first.The theory has been much studied, including in a more recent work part inspired by Mackay, US journalist James Surowieckirsquos  book The Wisdom of Crowds, Why the Many are Smarter than the Few. Surowiecki argued that through sharing information, groups can make better collective decisions than any inidual within them could.But they canrsquot both be right The problem is there are good examples to support both theories, but we donrsquot know how or why \"collective wisdom sometimes works and sometimes goes badly wrong.That is why new research carried out at St Andrews University is so timely. It explains not only how collective madness can grip a population, leading to bad decisions, but also why the more complex the task, the more likely humans will act like animals, resorting to mimicry and \"groupthink\".According to lead author Wataru Toyokawa, postdoctoral research fellow at St Andrews University, the natural world can help explain a puzzle which has long troubled social scientists. \"Many people have studied how iniduals become more stupid when they behave collectively, he says. ldquoSeeking the opinion of others is normally beneficial,information gathering is good. We rely on that for the democratic process,\" he says. \"But it is a double-edged sword. Copying can be healthy butall the people are copying each other the system collapses.\"Along with Professor Kevin Laland of St Andrews School of Biology and PhD student Andrew Whalen, Toyokawa used an online experiment and population dynamics to explore the point at which the benefits of sharing information and collaborating to find solutions can tip over into a phenomenon known to psychologists as \"maladaptive herding\".Participants were given a iety of tasks and researchers discovered that the larger and more complex the task, the more likely people were to copy those around them, leading to poor decisions.\"With Brexit the task is very dficult because each inidual has dferent preferences, making it hard to reach consensus. In such a political situation, the danger is bad ideas can flourish,\" Toyokawa says.Whatrsquos happening to decision-making Over the years, research into Mackays ideas has consolidated around an understanding that conformity has a big influence on decision making. Soenough people believe leaving the EU will lead to a poundm idend for the NHS, or reduce overall migration rather than just the numbers coming from EU countries, others are likely to embrace the same ideas more readily, eventhey are irrational. This applies especiallythe suspect ideas chime with their own views or prejudices.Science writer Philip Ball is author of Critical Mass, which considers whether physics and chemistry can tell us as much about crowd behaviour as psychology and social science. This applies to physical crowds and traffic which can move about in ways which are similar to those of atoms in a confined space, he suggests, but can also apply to opinion formation.\"There is a large body of work highlighting the way that crowds can collectively make a good decision but can also reach a horrendously wrong one,\" he says.A good example is a \"guess the weight of the cake\" competition at a country fair. If people know what others have guessed there will often be a conformity effect, with people clustering their guesses close to one of those made earlier. But that earlier guess may be entirely wrong, distorting the outcome. Meanwhile, studies have found thatpeople guess \"blind\" in such a contest, averaging out their guesses usually provides a remarkably accurate estimate of the true answer. That is the wisdom of crowds.\"What this tells us is that once you start introducing interaction between people you are much more likely to find herding behaviour, reducing the chance of a good guess,\" Ball says.Social media and sophisticated online manipulation feed into the problemThe rise of the internet and social media has exacerbated the dangers, and polarised debate. This was perhaps seen most markedly in October  when the Supreme Court ruled against the UK Government, saying parliament should have a say over the triggering of Article .Newspapers suggested this was a clash between the courts and the populace, with the Daily Mail picturing the three judges who made the ruling, lined up like criminals mugshots, under the headline \"Enemies of the people\".This was the birth of the now widely-discussed view that any deviation from Brexit will be a betrayal of voters in the referendum. It was ridiculed by others as an extraordinary over-reaction to an entirely legitimate ruling from the English courts ndash which is where Brexiteers apparently want legal decisions to be made in future.Ball says. \"The questions now are about how these opinion dynamics play out when an overall bias in society can tilt things so markedly in one direction or another.\"Advertising does that but with social media you see it even more strongly. The echo chamber effect is huge, with people getting feedback from like-minded people. People repost ideas that tally with their own perceptions and fake news can spread like wildfire. Little things can set in train an avalanche effect.\"This is why we have representative democracy rather than plebiscites. If you dont have a robust system referenda are vulnerable because it only takes a small nudge to send people herding in a certain way.\"But it raises questions about how long democracy can continue to , he says, especially in light of the fact that many politicians have been slow to realise the game is changing.\"It isnt just huge billboards, it is the fact that a Cambridge Analytica can understand and predict the effects of targeting certain people, but they also know how to predict and manipulate them.Are we ants  Or bees In the insect world, the models for the wisdom of the crowd are creatures like ants and bees, both generally regarded as shining examples of collective decision-making. But bees have the edge, Toyokawa explains, and ants are more vulnerable to moments of \"madness\".\"Ants normally do very well. They copy and make very accurate decisions ndash for example when finding good food and a site for a nest. But sometimes a stupid ant can find a mediocre place. He or she may start advertising this option as good, and other ants react to that and follow.\"So the ants do really well when an environment is stable, but find it dferent to switch to a new environment. The honey bee generates collective intelligence very well, even in a changing environment.\"When the task is easy, humans behave more like a honey bee. When the group size increases and the task is dficult, we behave more like ants.\"Drting to the rightThis week Neil Basu, assistant commissioner of the politan Police, warned Brexit could lead to another surge in far-right extremist groups, views and actions. The Brexit vote itself was followed by a surge in racist attacks, he pointed out, claiming that leaving the EU with no deal would be very bad for policing.\"We saw a spike in hate crime after the referendum ndash thats never really receded. So theres always a possibility people are being radicalised by the kind of febrile atmosphere weve got at the moment,\" he explained.Toyokawa says group dynamics can explain how people on both sides are draw into face-offs in the street, or the heckling and harassment of politicians and journalists, when they would not otherwise be.\"Shouting in the street may affect other peoples decision-making ndash we dont know the answer to that. But the idea of maladaptive herding could certainly apply to demonstrations,\" the researcher says. \"People who might not usually get involved can end up copying the behaviour of others, just because they have seen there is a demo going on.\"This may be more a case of people being emboldened in their original views and prejudices, Ball says, as opposed to flocking mistakenly to bad ideas. \"There are ideas in some quarters such as the far right which are being played on and manipulated.\"Just as Donald Trump has to a degree legitimised racism in America,people see their views endorsed they can be emboldened.\"If people at the top say its OK to send out vans with messages on the side, there is the opportunity for people on the far right to manipulate the same sentiments. Im not sure you need a lot of psychology to explain that.\"And he warns that we can no longer ignore the increasing prevalence of such collective irrationality.\"We need to recognise these kind of dynamics in order to figure out what a democracy means and how it can operate in this networked age. Does it still have the same meaning \"The Madness of Crowds - three lessons from historyThe South Sea Bubble: Thousands of people invested in no-hope and sometimes fraudulent companies, in many cases losing their le savings.While encouraging people to invest in firms which promised profits from overseas trade which had little prospect of taking place, traders also engaged insider trading, while isions of the South Sea Company took money from those caught up in the speculation for wild projects ranging from paving the streets of London, digging for lead in Derbyshire and \"trading in hair\".The Dot Com Bubble: In the mid-s, investor fascination with the phenomenon known as the \"internet\" reached new peaks.

We have been calling for more parking enforcement in Wick for a while now.\"High Street and Bridge Street are far too regularly packed with cars parked where they shouldnt be. Its an issue that has been raised time and time again by both drivers and pedestrians. Some people think they are above the rules and for too long theyve got away with it.\"He added: \"Under the current proposals Bridge Street and much of High Street will essentially become double yellows, meaning no parking at any time. This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

The government recognises that it will cost £. million to operate our ageing fleet of ferries during - — and that is what we are asking the government to provide.”OIC is also looking to the government to fund the replacement of the current inter-island fleet. The council has been working with the government on this for a number of years and is currently developing a business case setting out the service levels local communities require, and the engineering options needed to achieve these.Councillor Stockan added: “We would object in the strongest possible termswe end up with a reduction in our ferries funding. This would place a wholly disproportionate and unfair burden on the smallest council in Scotland and would mean us having to make cuts to other vital services.“The ferries are a leline for remote and fragile communities across our islands. Orkney has the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — an inequality we cannot address without proper financial support from the Scottish Government.We are calling on the government to take an honourable approach to fulfilling the will of the Scottish Parliament that we should receive fair and equitable funding for our inter-island ferry service. The principle of transferring Orkney’s internal ferry service to the Scottish Government, at no net detriment to OIC, has already been approved by the council. That is a route we will have to take unless we are provided with the funds to run the service over the year ahead.”For the full story, pick up a copy of The Orcadian, this Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The success of the Dingwall BID depends upon our local businessesrsquo support.ldquoWe are working hard to gather information from all the businesses in Dingwall and we need to hear from everyone. This is your chance to have your say and add to the overall business plan. Then all you have to do is vote yes in the ballot and we can make these projects happen.ldquoWe really want to make sure that nobody is missed and that everyone gets their opportunity to vote because this could be a monumental time in our townrsquos history. This could become the year when Dingwall businesses take control over the townrsquos economic future.Mr Murray said: ldquoWe are aware that there must be a decenton their investment. I believe Highland Council currently collect a wee bit more than pound million per annum from non-domestic ratepayers and Irsquove calculated that the levy would need to be between . to three per cent.ldquoThis would allow us to invoice the council for approximately pound,. Itrsquos also possible we would be able to almost match fund this figure from other sources. This would be an amazing amount banked in Dingwall to be spent on Dingwall. This is how we would fund the five-year plan ready to start after a yes vote.He wants remaining surveys, seeking feedback from businesses to a number of questions, ed by Friday, February .Survey results will then be collated with a five-year business plan set to be drafted by the end of March. A yes no vote on BID would then be held in May.Gordon McIntosh, practice manager of Munro  Noble, is a director of BID Inverness and believes the scheme can pay idends for Dingwall too.He said ldquocoach ambassadors had brought more tourists into the city, increasing spend. It meant local businesses were stakeholders in any centre development plans and have the ability to lobby the council over issues of interest. The scheme also paved the way for successful events such as classic car shows, Easter egg hunts and bar and business awards.He said: ldquoWith representatives from a cross section of businesses on the board the strong advocacy we have provided has achieved some notable results. These results have been for the betterment of our business and social community.

It is the first joint prospectus between government agencies and industry, showing the genuine strength and depth of partnership around the financial sector in Scotland.: Piers Morgan attacks Greens MSP Ross Greer over anti-Churchill tweet“It is also the first sectoral prospectus promoted under the Scotland Is Now brand, deliberately linking the quality of le available in Scotland to the quality of work and investment available in the sector.“Additionally, it is also the first prospectus to be supported directly by both the UK and Scottish governments, clearly illustrating Scotland’s signicant role in the UK’s overall strength in financial services.“I am very grateful to Scottish Financial Enterprise for driving the collaboration and I look forward to using the prospectus to showcase Scotland’s strength to the world.”UK Government Minister Lord Duncan said the financial sector in Scotland “punches above its weight” and promised the UK would continue to work with the Scottish Government and the sector in growing the economy.Mr Estlin described Scotland as “one of the most vibrant elements of the UK’s financial services ecosystem” and said the document would help to create jobs and prosperity.Scottish Financial Enterprise chief executive Graeme Jones said: “This fantastic document is the result of extensive collaboration within our industry by people and organisations dedicated to driving the continued success of Scotland’s financial services industry.“This document sets out a compelling case for establishing or expanding businesses within our enviable financial services ecosytem.“Most importantly, this document is a statement of intent for further success and realising our collective potential.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4863346.1548678893!/image/image.jpg","title":"something has to give if brexit is going to be delivered brian monteith","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Yvette Cooper#s amendment will not make an agreement on the backstop any more likely, writes Brian Monteith Another week and another Westminster clfhanger. This time it is whether or not the government’s motion on its Plan B for Brexit, up for discussion tomorrow, will be successfully altered by an amendment lodged by Labour Remainer Yvette Cooper. If passed the effect will be to give Parliament the power to bring forward a proposal to extend Article  for possibly three months – even until the end of this year.Whatever the outcome, the fact is thatthe UK is to leave the EU with a transitional arrangement then something needs to give for Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement to become acceptable or it will not be passed. With Parliament having invoked Article  of the Lisbon Treaty and passed the Withdrawal Act the existing law is simple. If there is no alternative procedure made law then the United Kingdom leaves at pm on  March and immediately becomes a sovereign country again, trading under World Trade Organisation rules rather than EU regulations on a supposed temporary basis.Last week was notable for a number of statements from all sides seeking to find agreement that might deliver the referendum result – even before Her Majesty suggested the importance of establishing common ground. First Brexiteers such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, Iain Duncan Smith and Boris Johnson, who have been appealing for the Prime Minister and her Cabinet to stick to past commitments, indicated they could be willing to support her Withdrawal Agreementshe can get the EU to time-limit or even delete the ‘backstop’. Given there is a great deal more wrong with the Prime Minister’s proposal than just the backstop this was a generous concession. Their real concern is that without finding some consensus Brexit will never happen. Yet, as the Irish Deputy Prime Minister, Simon Coveney, demonstrated on the Andrew Marr Show yesterday, a compromise on the backstop will not come from the Irish Republic. To win such a prize would therefore require the EU having to hang out Ireland – either by agreeing to previously dismissed technical solutions it has insisted are unworkable or by moving the ‘border’ to the continental mainland such as the ports of Calais and Zeebrugge . Irish politicians have every right to be worried about being hung out to dry following statements from the EU’s chief spokesman Margaritis Schinas and then its chief negotiator Michel Barnier. Schinas caught the Irish by surprise and set hares running by stating at a media briefing there would indeed be a “hard border” between the Republic and the UKno transition arrangement could be agreed. This was completely at odds with what EU Commission President Jean Claude Junker had said when last visiting Dublin. Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was then reported as suggesting a risk that the EU might choose to locate border checks away from the Irish border and to the French and Dutch ports, thus treating the UK and Ireland as a single block. For those believing it could never happen the example of Ireland and the UK being outside the Schengen Area and therefore sharing joint security and passport checks provides a dose of reality.Varadkar was not finished, for when pressed on the border issue later in Davos he claimed Irish police or even the army would have to man any hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. If the comment was designed to panic the UK government into concessions it was a misjudgment for the response was, as it has consistently been, that the UK would not install or operate any physical border infrastructure or controls. It is only the EU and Irish politicians who are now talking about physical infrastructure. What they misunderstandis not that Brexit-supporting Unionists say there will be no border, they say there is indeed a border already for many thingsbut it is essentially invisible and should remain so.If the UK ends up trading under WTO rules, using the past experience and already existing technology means we shall be able to work invisibly for trade, even including animals and foodstuffs, by managing any checks before and after the border – just as already happens in other parts of Europe. That Varadkar, Coveney, Barnier – and British politicians who support remain – cannot admit to recognising solutions exist, when an endless number of papers and articles have been produced showing how an invisible trade border can work, suggests they either choose to remain ignorant or are intentionally mendacious.What is also missed is that existing EU regulations are not impervious to fraud and deceit and cannot be bettered. Such arrogance and complacency was exposed as dangerously naïve during the  Irish horsemeat scandal, when some Irish-made burgers were found to have up to  per cent horsemeat in them when labelled as pure beef.The problem with Cooper’s amendment remains that delaying the departure date for Brexit will not in itself make arriving at an agreement on the border or other obstacles any more likely. MPs shall simply be taking the pressure off both themselves and the EU and end up with nothing much happening for the next three months – ing to a flurry of brinkmanship and suggested compromises as the clock ticks down again to pm on say,  June or even the end of December. We thus have two paradoxes. The first is how the backstop insisted upon by EU and Irish politicians to avoid an imagined hard border is now proving to be the most likely cause of the UK leaving the EU without a transition agreement – so a hard border is delivered. The second is that the approach of the last few days and hours of time left for negotiation – before the UK concedes there will be no agreement and WTO trading rules must be put in place as the expected outcome – is what is resulting in a drive by all parties to find a solution. Take the imperative of the clock ticking down removes the pressure to find a solution.Yvette Cooper’s amendment needs to be rejected and the focus of politicians on all sides shouldto improving the Withdrawal Agreement so that it becomes acceptable to all parties – or acknowledging it will indeed be a very bad deal the UK cannot work with and instead move to improve the circumstances for leaving the EU without a transition agreement.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4863716.1548690223!/image/image.jpg","title":"block london tube to secure indyref2 suggests former snp mp","story":"A rush hour blockade of London Underground stations could be staged as part of a \"civil disobedience\" campaign to push for a second independence referendum, a former SNP MP has said.George Kerevan, the former East Lothian MP, even says Holyrood could be declare itself a \"sovereign assembly\"another independence majority is secured,in a blog for the Bella Caledonia website.Westminster has control over the constitution in the UK and Theresa May has already rejected calls for Nicola Sturgeons calls for a section  order to hold a fresh vote on the leaving the UK in light of Brexit.\u2028\"It is certain – in the current Brexit crisis – that the Tory government in London will refuse to agree a fresh referendum and veto a new Section  Order,\" he states.\"This refusal must be met by a phased escalation of public civil disobedience and Westminster parliamentary obstruction by SNP MPs.

Having taken a wide range of evidence on the implications of a no-deal Brexit, the committee is clear this cannot be allowed to happen.”The Leeds Central Labour MP continued: “The suggestion that the UK might opt for a no-deal outcome but assume that the EU will continue to act in a co-operative manner to avoid disruption, cannot seriously constitute the policy of any responsible Government.“MPs must be able to vote on extending Article Parliament cannot reach agreement on a way forward before  March.”Cabinet isions over a no-deal exit from the EU have resurfaced, with the Education Secretary Damian Hinds saying he could not envisage the government supporting a no-deal Brexit.His comments came after Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom branded attempts by MPs to kill no deal as an option, through a series of Commons amendments on Tuesday, as a “thinly veiled attempt to stop Brexit”.“I don’t envisage no deal becoming Government policy,” Mr Hinds told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge On Sunday. “We want to avoid a no deal. No deal would not be a good outcome.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"minister hears plea for debts to be written off","story":"Locum costs, hospital bed closures because of staffing shortages and staff retention were among the issues discussed at NHS Shetland#s annual review meeting.The Scottish government#s mental health minister Clare Haughey was attending the meeting, which was held on Monday afternoon.It came after NHS Shetland was forced to close six beds at the Gilbert Bain Hospital because of a recruitment shortfall.Director of nursing Kathleen Carolan said she hoped to have the shortage addressed within three months.Ms Haughey#s visit came after the crippling costs of travel and accommodation connected to locum medical cover was highlighted late last year.During the meeting she was challenged by Shetland integration joint board vice-chairman Allison Duncan.He warned that Shetland had spent £ million on locum cover over  months.#We already know that other local authorities like Dundee and other NHS debts are going to be written off.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/INDOOR-SHINTY-19-P4-7-FINAL-2.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players fromthroughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams fromBun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/INDOOR-SHINTY-19-P4-7-FINAL-5-1.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face.to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

But, after representations from his solicitor, it was agreed that the fine would be waived when it was learned that no tax book had been available for the vehicle.He was held for an hour and a half in Dunmurry and was released when a relative arrived and paid the fine.The RUC men – one of whom was in plain clothes – had arrived in the area in a red Vauxhall car without markings.One Twinbrook resident said later: “So much for the RUC’s concern about the peace talks. They wouldn’t have done that sort of thing before the ceasefire.”Order is expected soon for new IRA ceasefireA NEW ceasefire order is expected to be issued to all IRA units within the next  hours. But a formal announcement by the Republican Army Council is not expected until early next week.The decision to order a ceasefire came after a second round of talks between senior Stormont and republican officials at a secret venue about five miles from Belfast on Wednesday night.In a statement issued late on Wednesday Britain’s supremo here, Merlyn Rees, said: “I am sure that the people of Northern Ireland would wish to see effective arrangements made to ensure that the ceasefire did not break down. I attach very great importance to this, and practical arrangements would be necessary.”Republican leaders are now believed to regard this as a sufficient gesture to allow them to order another ceasefire.But it is believed that they will want meaningful talks on a number of issues shortly after their ceasefire is publicly announced. Another reason why a new ceasefire is possible has been the low profile approach adopted by the British Army since the shock announcement last week that the truce was off.A key factor in the decision to call off the Christmas ceasefire was the behaviour of British units in Belfast and several rural areas where they stepped up their activity to take advantage of the ceasefire.British leaders in London are known to have been surprised at the IRA decision and there has been speculation that advice from their military leaders – who had claimed that the IRA ceasefire was certain to continue because the IRA was beaten – is now being ignored by Westminster leaders.British Premier Wilson is said to have been furious that the much-vaunted military intelligence network in Ireland was totally unaware that the ceasefire was in danger.And parallels are being drawn between the military intelligence blunder of last week and similar blunders before Internment Day and Operation Motorman – when politicians were advised that both moves would “help solve the Irish question”. IN a front page article in the Sunday World this week reporter John Keane disclosed that the , political prisoners in the Long Kesh internment camp are being held in huts which would be regarded by the EEC farming officials as unsuitable for pighouses.AdvertisementsHUNTING LODGEScotch from £.Vodka from £.Gin from £.Double litre Italian wine £.Full range of winesCans Skol p  doz Packs Lager pBrandy from £.Hennessy Brandy at £.Plus an extensive range of LiquersLámh Dearg GAC Social Club Behind Watters old pub at the top of Hannahstown Hill.A great night of singing and dancing on Sunday.ROMANOSSaturday  January - – From the top of the charts KENNYSaturday  February GLITTER BAND."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"our playground was upton cottages and arizona street","story":"IN March , an ‘Arizona Street and Upton Cottages reunion party’ was held in the Glenowen. It was a great event, with fantastic music provided by the McCourt brothers, and some equally impressive socialising done by the McKays, McDonalds, Quinns, McAteers, Pattersons, Monaghans, Lintons# and plenty of others, including a couple of Deedses.The oldest party-goer was Mrs Sheila Deane, at a brave  years of age. I got speaking to MrsDeane that night and as always, she had a smile on her face and was in good spirits. Sadly, MrsDeane passed away on January this year.The street was our playground growing up in Arizona Street Upton Cottage in the ‘s and ‘s. We were never in. While our parents probably appreciated this, I’m not sure that all of the older residents enjoyed the noise and occasional nuisance as much. Some of our older neighbours when passing might have greeted us young ones with no more than a scowl, a grunt, or even worse . Mrs Deane however, was friendly and approachable every time you saw her. Uniquely as well, she always remembered my name. My brothers and I were very good friends with MrsDeane’s grandsons Neil, David and Mark, just down the street. Every night since I can remember, their dad Seamus made the short trek up the street past our house to visit his mum in the cottages. I spoke to Seamus recently and he kindly shared some of his own, earlier childhood memories of our wee street.Mr and Mrs Deane moved in to number  Upton Cottages on the Glen Road in , and at that time the street was still not too dissimilar from the way it looked when the houses were first built. Upton Cottages first appears in Belfast Street directories in , when they formed the only small terrace resembling a street anywhere in West Belfast beyond the Falls Road. At that time, and for almost another  years, the area beyond Upton Cottages marked the start of the country, and there was very little to be found after it going up the Glen Road apart from farms and fields. The single-sided Arizona Driveappears in the street directories for the first time in , with the opposite side and new name of Arizona Street listed the following year. Several other homes of ying size soon began to spring up along the Glen Road around the growing parish of St Teresa’s. Gransha and Andersonstown estates followed shortly after and the whole area became much less rural in character. One former resident of Woodland House on the Upper Springfield Road remembered walking down the Turf Loney to go to Sunday school on the Glen Road in the s, only to be chased back across the stream at Upton Cottages for being ‘country children’!Still, in  the area was unrecognisable from how it looks today. Beyond the cottages was all fields going right up from the Falls to Hannahstown Hill. Before Turf Lodge was built to meet the rapidly increasing demand for social housing in West Belfast, Seamus Deane remembers playing from dawn to dusk in the meadows there throughout his childhood. Arizona Street, Seamus recalls, was still only three quarters built in the ‘s. In fact, the house that I grew up in near the top, and any others after number , were built around a decade later. These were known as the ‘corporation houses’, having been appended to the existing houses by the council in the ‘s. In the s Sheila Deane and her family looked out at a single four bedroom house – number  Upton Cottages and the first on that side – beside which was Sherf’s timber yard . Both sites would later be taken up by McErlean’s Bakery that employed generations of the area’s youth. Before the bakery was built however, long piles of timber from Sherf’s yard lay in the field between the Deanes’ house and the bottom half of Arizona Street. The vacant ground beside it, part of which would one day become our back garden, was the site of the annual bonfire. According to one older resident, there had been an orchard there in even earlier times. Geraldine Mallonwho told me this was someone I was heart scared of as a child. She and the neighbour facing her, Jim Butler, were tortured by us kids kicking balls and hitting sliotars around their doors. And they were never too slow in coming out to tell us to take them away to hell’s gates. Ironically, both Jim and Geraldine became good neighbours of mine when I got older and moved in beside them, and we stayed friendly until they passed away in recent years.Other former residents of Upton Cottages include members of the RIC, a private in the Free State Army and two soldiers who lost their lives in the First World War, one of whom is among the Canadian Infantry buried in the City Cemetery.And the street keeps changing. Like so many other families, MrsDeane’s children and grandchildren are scattered near and far. Her sons Paul and Seamus continued to make their daily pilgrimage up our street back home to see their mum until her final days. This special lady won’t be forgotten, nor will our memories of a grand wee community – one of the last of its kind – that has spread out across our beautul former meadows from the Falls to Hannahstown, and further afield."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"toibin to host new party belfast meeting","story":"FORMER Sinn Féin TD Peadar Tóibín has said that his new party hopes to select candidates for the North’s upcoming Council elections by early February.The Meath TD left Sinn Féin in November over the party’s decision to back legislation allowing for abortion.The as yet unnamed party is set to host a meeting at the Malone Lodge in Belfast this Monday with a view to setting up local branches.Speaking to the Daily Belfast ahead of the meeting, Mr Tóibín said it was not his intention to “clip the ear off” Sinn Féin based on his past experience, but rather to build a “broader” republican party.“I believe over the last year that Sinn Féin has narrowed its ideological space, both economically and socially,” he said.“It has flipped its policy on a number of social issues. In , the party would have been openly pro-le. In , they’ve gone the opposite direction.“I also battled internally for the last two years to make sure I could be part of the Oireachtas team on an equal basis, but because I had a dference of opinion on the issue of abortion that just wasn’t allowed. I wasn’t given the chance to equally participate in the organisation.“For example, the leadership of Sinn Féin, Michelle O’Neill and Mary Lou, went to London recently and asked Westminster to legislate on three separate areas for the North of Ireland – that’s unheard of in republican terms. For  years republicans have tried to stop them legislating on Ireland.”He continued: “The party is also caught in a way in that it wants to reach middle-Ireland more, maybe looking at winning seats in leafy liberal Dublinit can, reaching out to the media too, but there is a big danger that it will lose its grassroots base. I think the Presidential campaign was an example of where the grassroots became so disempowered that they didn’t come out for the organisation.”Mr Tóibín insists that Sinn Féin, the SDLP, Fianna Fáil, and Labour have positioned themselves on the same space, and that his party hopes to attract disillusioned members. Asked about his party’s policies, beyond being pro-le, Mr Tóibín said: “We are for the unity of the Irish people North and South and we will be reaching out the hand of friendship to people from a Protestant background, people who wouldn’t have been able to vote for Sinn Féin in the past, for many reasons. “We’ll also be reaching out to people who believe that the Tories have made such balderdash of Brexit, and have had their rights to self-determination taken away with regards to remaining in the EU. For us, economic justice issues are very important. Right now we have people in the North who are in food poverty, housing poverty, health poverty and yet we have stalemate at Stormont.”He contined: “We need the governments to institute joint authority in the North. We also need to make sure that there is serious work done on the All-Ireland economy. It was sold to us as part of the Good Friday Agreement, but it had fallen off the agenda for many political parties. It will be one of the greatest tools toameliorate the effects of Brexit. “Another point, and I think, Sinn Féin have been remiss on this, we want an independence referendum, but we can start to deconstruct the border in the meantime. “The border is made up of thousands of dferent bricks, which stand for a practical experience in someone’s le. It could be a cross-border ambulance service, a cross-border health service, cross-border education, or corporation tax – a cross-border soccer team. Every time we fix those issues, we create convergence North and South, we improve the delivery of services and the quality of le for people, and the height of the border starts to reduce in height.”Mr Tóibín has said his party hopes to stand between  to  candidates across Ireland, and has already attracted nine elected councillors. Asked about the number of candidates standing in Belfast, Mr Tóibín said: “We won’t get into the micro details just yet. Hundreds of people are joining us on a weekly basis. New cumainn are being set up around the country, and we have new cumainn that will be set up in Belfast. “We want to make sure that we are an activist based grassroots organisation. If we get that infrastructure set up around the six counties then we hope to be selecting candidates by early February in places we believe we can win seats.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-24-at-16.25.07.png","title":"womens place in national debate","story":"LAST year was a year to remember for women’s rights. ‘Me Too’ was a phrase heard around the globe as artists in many spheres made sexual harassment, abuse and discrimination visible. It was a lesson that went way beyond the arts.The referendum on the th Amendment to the Irish constitution made the experience of women visible in multiple ways. It was not merely about the personal heartbreak of inidual women, it was also about systemic oppression of Irish women and children, and reached into the earth of Tuam, County Galway, where babies’ bodies had been buried in an unconsecrated septic tank by nuns and priests.It was the year that celebrated  years of some women’s franchise and paid homage to suffragettes and the first woman MP, Constance Markievitz.With the election of Clare Bailey as leader of the Green Party we now have women leaders of four of the six mainparties. In many ways it all seemed seminal. That women’s agendas could no longer be ignored. However, we are all too aware of its limitations too. The words ‘The North is Next’ regarding access to full choices in pregnancy clearly require the addition of ‘at some point’.Women’s participation in politics, while improving, remains poor. In the forthcoming council election watch how many women are standing in winnable seats and watch which parties do what. A fair enough group photo of gender balance announcing candidates is often at quite a distance from the elected officials’ photograph afterwards.Just as in , contemporary strides on women’s rights need to be carefully looked after in the years to come. While Cumann na mBan and feminism were integral to the operation of the First Dáil and the appropriation of public le during the Tan War, what we witnessed afterwards was an assault on women’s rights, from the constitution to the maternity ward afterwards. In the north the oppression of women went hand in glove with the oppression of the nationalist population in the right wing statelet.Right now, there is a conversation happening about what a new Ireland might look like. The conversation focuses on constitutional rights, economic interests and demographics. Campaigns feed into it with social and cultural rights featuring intermittently.What we have failed to do is insert the vibrant and rich debate last year on women’s rights into this national debate in the meaningful way. For instance, women who cannot be equal participants in our society because their citizenship and culture are denied to them are doubly oppressed as women are unequal participants in so many avenues of le.Just as in - when Irish suffragettes gave expression to their fight for self-determination being linked to their country’s fight for self-determination, we need to seek out space and language for a modern Irish women’s vision. Indeed, in those years Irish suffragettes’ colours were not purple white and green – they were orange, white and green. It was a bold statement of intent: that women would not be written out of the Proclamation or a new Ireland.That new Ireland was never realised with the imposition of partition. Specic attention must now be paid to women’s participation, needs and aspirations as we build our new vision for a transformed Ireland."},{"url":null,"title":"dup must see the benefits of mays brexit deal northern irish groups urge","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

As a young Provisional IRA member you bombed Derry into the ground in the s. What is your response to the recent New IRA attack on the citys courthouse .pushA. It makes me incredibly sad that another generation of young men and women are going down that path. There will be older people mentoring them who are exploiting them. I believe they are cannon fodder for a leadership that will use them.It is reckless revisiting violence. The nationalist community in Derry, who have suffered so much and have gained nothing from the peace process, deserve better than starting this endless cycle all over again.Nobody was killed this time but planting bombs inevitably leads to injuries and deaths. I would say to young dissidents that you lose a universe by taking le, and dont gain a single speck of territory. If you go down this route, you end up a civil and human rights abuser.Q. Given your past history, theyll say youre a hypocrite.A. Well, Ive publicly condemned all my own past activities. Ive apologised to my victims and worked tirelessly to try to convince paramilitaries to give up violence.Q. Are todays dissident republican groups any dferent from the IRA you belonged to A. No, theyre not. Just as that IRA was no dferent to the one that fought the War of Independence and the Irish Civil War. I suppose the only dference between the dissidents and the Provos is that so far the dissidents havent chained anyone to a bomb.Q. Why do you think dissident republican groups in Derry can attract members  years after the IRA ceasefire A. One reason is anger at the corruption in the Provisional IRA which has seen some leaders get rich and run businesses not through their own graft.There has also been a failure to deliver anything to the west bank of Derry in terms of jobs, a motorway and a proper railway line. But the British presence in Northern Ireland remains the main driving force for dissidents, its certainly not Brexit.Q. Tell me about your family background.A. I was born in , the second youngest of eight children. We were a middle-class family. My father was a school teacher and my mother came from a prominent business family. We lived in a Georgian terrace in what would be regarded as a snobby street.There was some history of republicanism on my fathers side but we were definitely not a republican family.Q. So why did you join the IRA A. As a boy I devoured books on Irish history in my fathers library. I found  and Pearse and Connolly particularly spellbinding. I wrote a pledge on a sheet of paper when I was  vowing to \"fight andnecessary die for Irelands freedom\". I hid it under the floor boards. Years later when I was arrested the police brought me this yellowed strip of paper and I was deeply embarrassed.My actual joining, though, was very spur of the moment. I was walking home from school and a friend said he was doing it the next day and askedI wanted to. I said I would. A rapid decision that had horrendous consequences. I was  years old, and I think the use of child soldiers by the IRA, or any army, is immoral.Q. What did you do as a young IRA member A. I learned to make incendiaries with condoms, acid and other chemicals. I didnt even know the real purpose of condoms. I thought they actually were intended for incendiary devices.I burned down shops. Myself and others took on Army patrols with handguns. It was crazy.Q. Did you have any doubts about what you were doing A. I fell away from the IRA for a bit, but Bloody Sundayhappened a week after my th birthday and it brought me back. I was with a friend, dawdling along like at any other civil rights march, looking at the girls from Thornhill College. Then the Paras started shooting.Bodies of civilians were lying on the ground. I ran like the blazes and hid behind a wall. I went with a priest to the morgue at Altnagelvin Hospital. Senior Army and police officers were laughing and joking about the dead outside. I thought Id rather be lying on a mortuary slab for doing something than for doing nothing.Q. But the IRA wouldnt take you back A. They had so many adults they didnt need me. I was being hassled by the British Army and I moved down South. I wanted back into the IRA. I went to see Martin McGuinness who was being held in the Bridewell . I had red hair and I pretended to be his younger brother to get in. I told him: \"I want to go back to the North to rock and roll.\" He said: \"Away you go.\"Q. What was the young Martin McGuinness like A. He was very idealistic, and a straight-up character who didnt drink or smoke. He was extremely shy. People laughed when he got his first girlfriend, Bernie. On a personal level, I liked him.I find it very hard to reconcile that Martin with the one who sanctioned human bombs, the torture of informers, the murder of census collector Joanne Mathers and many other atrocities.He served only two very brief prison sentences. I think it would have been better had he done a long stretch in jail. That causes people to reflect. Guys who did time confront what they did. Theyre not in denial.Martin told lies too. He was active on Bloody Sunday. He did not leave the IRA in . Im tremendously sorry that he never managed to be reconciled to his victims. Right up until the end he had the chance to tell the truth about atrocities like Claudy and to clear his conscience. He chose not to.Q. Back in IRA ranks, what did you do A. I tried shooting but I wasnt much good at it. I was great with explosives and not a lot of people wanted to work in that area given the risks. I bombed shops, banks, and police stations.I developed the letter bomb in . Id seen an article in The Sunday Times about how the PLO used them. I actually blew myself up in a house in the Creggan - went right through the window and into the garden. I damaged my eye and a finger.I was treated in a Dublin hospital. When I was there Martin visited and introduced me to the IRA GHQ figure in charge of bombing England. They said they wanted me to go to London. Hugh Feeney, Gerry Kelly and the Price sisters had just been captured after bombing the Old Bailey.Q. Tell me about bombing England.A. I sent dozens and dozens of letter bombs. To Downing Street, the Bank of England, the Stock Exchange, judges, generals, and the Home Secretary Reginald Maudling, whom I held responsible for Bloody Sunday. He was injured opening it. This was the politics of revenge. An eye for an eye.Q. How do you view those actions now A. With horror. I was arrested and charged in  and at my trial those who were injured made statements.I had never considered that some of my targets mightnt open the letters, that secretaries would. An Irish woman in the British embassy in Washington lost a hand. Other people were blinded.I apologised in court to the \"innocent working-class victims who were accidentally injured\".I think it was the first time an IRA man had done this.But what I am most ashamed of was planting a bomb in an Oxford Street shop. I had phoned a warning to police twice but they didnt take it seriously and told me to \"f*** off\". I should have gone back to the store and cleared out the customers. I didnt. It could have been an atrocity.Q. Describe how your views on violence changed.A. It wasnt a road to Damascus conversion, it was much more gradual. I had doubts back in Derry and Id voted for the  IRA ceasefire. But it was a Jesuit priest in Wormwood Scrubs who changed my le. He was known as an anti-Irish bigot and we were always arguing. During one big row I said to him: \"Wheres the proof your God exists \" He gave me a copy of the Bible. Reading the four gospels about JCchanged my le. The holy fear of God blew me away.Eddie Dalysent me a book about a former SAS soldier who discovered Padre Pio and that affected me too. I repented.Q. What did your religious conversion lead you to do A. I wrote to my victims to apologise. Some of them gave those letters to the News of the World and I was all over the media. In  I sent a letter to Republican News saying the armed struggle was immoral. I said the war should be ended in favour of democratic politics. They refused to print it but Eddie Daly gave it to the Derry Journal, who did.It was a very big step for an IRA member to take. There was one IRA figure on the wing who wanted me killed in my cell.Q. How long were you in jail A. I received  le sentences plus  years. I spent  years in jail in England. One of the most positive experiences there was meeting some of the Birmingham Six and Guildford Four.They were very down and didnt know how to campaign to prove their innocence. I helped them write letters to the media. I put them in touch with the solicitor Gareth Peirce.In  I was repatriated to Northern Ireland where I spent four years in jail. I was sent to Long Kesh, where I refused to go onto the IRA wing. I didnt want to live under paramilitary control.I was put in with sex offenders, but I think I was an example to lots of other prisoners and soon the wing was full of both republican and loyalist conforming prisoners. We were eventually moved to Maghaberry.Q. Tell me about le after jail.A. I went to study English at Trinity College Dublin. I later did an MSc in computer science. In  I married Michelle Sweeney, a student from Chicago I had met at Trinity.I got a job in computer software. I also edited the Big Issue and worked with the homeless. Michelle got a job in the US and moved back there. I tried to join her but I couldnt get a visa because of my IRA record.Id been in and out of the US for years, but after   everything changed. Michelle sought a orce and the marriage was later annulled.Q. What did you do after that A. I worked in Stockholm in IT and earned great money, but I wanted toto Dublin. I believed I had a vocation to become a priest and entered Maynooth in , but I left two years later.I ed to working with a homeless service dealing with drug and heroin addictions.In  I married Suzie Sweeney, a Scots woman who was a medical practice manager in Co Westmeath.Two years ago I decided to give up my job in the homeless sector to work on faith issues. Suzie did the same. We lived in Roscommon for a while, but now we move around. We are currently based in Spain.I give talks about my le story and repentance to students on behalf of a Spanish charity whose patron is tennis star Rafael Nadal.Q. In a  RTE interview, while continuing to oppose \"armed struggle\", you voiced strong republican views against partition and spoke of \"the territorial integrity of Ireland\". You said you didnt vote Sinn Fein but expressed admiration for those in the party who \"risked their lives to bring peace\". You now oppose republican politics and denounce Sinn Fein. Why have your opinions changed A. Ive outgrown the territory argument of republicanism. Its a very powerful one but I think politics should be about uniting hearts and minds, not a piece of land. John Hume nailed it a long time ago.I was a strong supporter of the peace process and gave Sinn Fein the benefit of the doubt. I became very disillusioned with them when they pulled out of Stormont. They continue to stay out at a time nationalists most need a voice.Also, I made a programme for RTE which led families of people killed in IRA bombs to approach me seeking help. I was shocked to find Sinn Fein was doing nothing for them.

academics for centuries.The University of St Andrews said third-year inity undergraduate Jonny Woods has now become the first person in the world to read some of the pages after using a longhand version as a kind of Rosetta stone.Fuller, the son of a poor tenant farmer in Cambridgeshire, became a leader of the British Baptist denomination and, despite minimal schooling, published a hugely influential text, The Gospel Worthy of All Acceptation, which is said to have changed the history of the Baptists.It is such an honour to be the first person to read Andrew Fuller’s sermons and to allow people to get an insight into this incredible man and the amazing stories he has to shareJonny WoodsFacebookTwitterMr Woods, from Coleraine, Co Londonderry, said it was exciting to crack the code enabling people to finally read documents Fuller left in shorthand.The -year-old said: “To be able to read something that no-one  has read in more than  years, it’s not something I thought I would ever be able to do and it was an incredible moment.“It was quite a few weeks of tough and not very successful work, but eventually it paid off.”He added: “It is such an honour to be the first person to read Andrew Fuller’s sermons and to allow people to get an insight into this incredible man and the amazing stories he has to share.“I’m excited to continue working on the vast collection of work that he has left to us, in the hope that we can understand more about his thinking and how this developed throughout his ministry.”The breakthrough came after Dr Steve Holmes, head of the School of Divinity at the university, found a shorthand document with the heading in longhand in the archive of Bristol Baptist College, which holds hundreds of pages of Fuller’s sermons.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Andrew Fuller left hundreds of pages of notes in shorthand Dr Holmes found one headed in longhand “Confessions of Faith, Oct.  ” with the rest of the document in shorthand.Knowing this was the date of Fuller’s induction into the pastorate of a church in Kettering and that he would have been required to give a confession of faith as part of that service, Dr Holmes wondereda copy of the confession printed in a biography might help him crack the code.After discovering the two texts were the same, Dr Holmes recruited Mr Woods through the university’s undergraduate research assistant scheme to help.After a few weeks, the student was able to translate the shorthand using the longhand version as a kind of Rosetta stone, allowing him to read two of the most historically signicant sermons from the collection.It is hoped that being able to finally read the documents will offer insight into Fuller’s meteoric rise within the Baptist denomination, by revealing the early development of his thought.Dr Holmes said: “When Jonny told me he could read these documents, it was an astonishing moment.“Andrew Fuller stands as the figurehead, the ‘patron saint’ almost, of the church tradition of which I am a part.“To be reading words of his that no-one had read since he preached them in  – it’s one of those moments you live for as an academic.”The translations of two sermons are now with the Baptist Quarterly under consideration for publication while Dr Holmes is continuing to edit Fuller’s wider collection of sermons for a major new critical edition of his works."},{"url":null,"title":"charles gets behind wheel of electric london black cab","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

And that is why it took two years to get the backstop agreed and that is why I believe the Prime Minister is correct when she defends it.\""},{"url":null,"title":"irish government rejects mays bid for brexit backstop concessions","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It’s as simple as that.“The backstop is already a compromise. It is a series of compromises. It was designed around British red lines.“Ireland has the same position as the European Union now, I think, when we say that the backstop as part of the Withdrawal Agreement is part of a balanced package that isn’t going to change.”Health Secretary Matt Hancock denied Mr Coveney’s comments meant Mrs May’s Brexit deal was “dead in the water”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Damian Hinds “Not at all,” said Mr Hancock. “That’s a negotiating position the Irish are taking, but I think it’s also extremely clear from that interview and the tone… Ireland doesn’t want to have a no-deal Brexit.“The whole purpose of the backstop is to avoid a hard border, which risks being a consequence of a no-deal Brexit.“The idea the EU and the Irish Government would drive this process to a no-deal exit in order to try to achieve something which is intended to avoid no-deal Brexit, that is not going to happen.”Education Secretary Damian Hinds told Sky News: “There are multiple reasons to believe the backstop would never come into place.“And, evenit did, actually there are some advantages to the backstop as well as drawbacks.”However, Brexiteer Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns said she wanted the PM to abandon the backstop, telling Sky News: “I’d like to see her bin the backstop. I think we need to bin it completely.”The backstop would see the UK remain under EU customs rulesa wider trade agreement had not been reached after a transition period.Tory Brexiteers have tabled Commons amendments calling for major changes to the backstop, including the imposition of an end date for it.Commons Speaker John Bercow will decidethe backstop amendments get to be voted on by MPs when the PM’s Brexit stance is again considered in Parliament on Tuesday.And the PM faced problems on a second Brexit front as Cabinet isions over a no-deal withdrawal from the EU broke to the surface again.Mr Hinds said: “I don’t envisage no deal becoming Government policy.“We want to avoid a no deal. No deal would not be a good outcomeThe comments came after Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom branded attempts by MPs to kill no deal as an option, through a series of Commons amendments on Tuesday, as a “thinly veiled attempt to stop Brexit”.The tensions emerged as it was revealed preparations are being looked at for the possible imposition of martial law after a no-deal Brexit.The move has been described by sources as the civil service “prepping” for all possibilities.“The PM needs to hold her nerve.

We’ve said that all along.“Theresa May will not budge on her red lines, she’s forcing us and trying to bully us into a no-deal scenario.“We will do whatever it takes, through Parliament, to stop that no-deal scenario from happening.

There’s almost an air of the Prime Minister and her Government being in complete denial about this. Yesterday there were reports in the media about how she might be close to getting a majority behind her deal by making a commitment to removing the backstop – ignoring the reality that the EU have shown no signs of being prepared to agree to that.“That’s why I think now Article  should be extended, there should be a request made for that and the SNP were the first party to call for that. “That is now pressing and urgent and SNP MPs on Tuesday this week will vote for Yvette Cooper’s amendment. We think that request should be made now, but nevertheless I think Yvette Cooper’s amendment takes us in the right direction.”On Saturday the Scottish Constitutional Relations Secretary Mike Russell spoke at a Rally for Europe in support of a People’s Vote.He said it would be “physically possible” to organise another referendum in the time available before the Brexit due date, however it remains one of the lesser considered options in Westminster.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  When Ms Sturgeon was asked about its chances, she told Mr Marr: “I don’t think it’s off the table. I do accept that as things stand right now there doesn’t appear to be a majority in the House of Commons and that’s because for reasons that only he can or can’t explain, Jeremy Corbyn is fixedly on the fence on this issue. He said he wanted to try to get a general election, he tried that and failed. “It seems to me it’s incumbent on Labour to make its position on this clear –it does so then I do think there would possibly be a majority in the House of Commons so Labour, at the moment, are the block to that and I think that’s deeply regrettable. “We’ll have to wait and see what Labour’s position would be. Firstly we’d have to wait and seethere would be a general election.

I’ve always said – I said in the  general electionyou recall, I said it in the  general election – that the SNP would want to be part of a progressive alternative to a Conservative governmentthe arithmetic leant itself to that. That remains the case. “Obviously Labour have to be willing to work with the SNP as well as the SNP being willing to work with Labour. “Until now the blockage to working together like that has come from the Labour side but I would always do whatever I could as leader of the SNP to keep the Tories out of Downing Street.”"},{"url":null,"title":"meet mr uekusa the comedian who hilariously reinvented the tablecloth trick","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The resulting m scrum led to a succession of drives for the line and when the ball was recycled a loose pass missed its intended target, but Rory Campbell took the ball smartly on the bounce to score in the corner for an early Malone lead.After Paddy Wright missed a long-range penalty, Ballynahinch earned an excellent attacking position with a m line out following an excellent Ross Adair touch-finder. The line out was won, but Malone forced a crucial turnover and the chance went begging.Both sides continued to be careless in possession in a niggly match, which was low on quality.On  minutes a Malone breakdown penalty gave lsquoHinch a chance to drive for the line and as they progressed, Malone blatantly killed the ball and could count themselves lucky not to receive a yellow. Wright slotted the penalty to close the gap to two points.Following a Malone penalty miss, lsquoHinch botched their own line out allowing the home side to pile into the . Zack McCall was penalised for offside as Malone looked to sweep the ball wide and was given a yellow card. Malone then scored from a tap penalty to take a - half-time lead.The second half followed a similar pattern to the first with Ballynahinch going further behind to another try from the prolic Campbell after another lsquoHinch mistake on their own line out.Ross Adair reduced the arrears on  minutes with a converted try to put lsquoHinch in bonus point territory and the away side belatedly roused themselves to pile the pressure on Malone during the final ten minutes.However, the home defence held and lsquoHinch had to settle for a point, earned largely through the woes of the Malone place kicker, who failed to land any of his attempts on goal.A disappointing start to  for the locals and they will need to be more accurate this week as Ballymena come to Ballymacarn Park.Malone Ballynahinch AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygowan’s Emma hoping to make waves at Abu Dhabi Special Olympics  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN swimmer is hoping to make a big splash when she goes to the Middle East in March.Twenty three year-old Emma Carlisle will be going for gold when she swims for Ireland at the  Special Olympics World Summer Games in Abu Dhabi.Emma is one of seven athletes from Co Down included in the -strong Team Ireland squad for the Games which take place over March -.Newry is well represented with four athletes selected.

He defeated the Irish at Downpatrick and gave these families who followed him large estates.Their strongholds were no match, however, for the energy and enthusiasm of the locals and eventually it was easier for them to adopt Irish manners and dress and conform to the customs of Down.According to Irish custom, land didnrsquot belong to the king mdash it belonged to the people and usually went to the strongest chieftain. The residents are reported to have disliked taxes, not much change there down the centuries.McBride dedicates a chapter to the United Irishman mdash immortalised as lsquoThe Man From God Knows Wherersquo mdash who was hanged outside Downpatrick Gaol .And where would society beit wasnrsquot for the humble rubber tyre, whose inventor, John Boyd Dunlop, worked for several years in his brotherrsquos veterinary practice in Downpatrick.Of course no book on the history of Co Down would be complete without a chapter on some of our ghosts and ghouls.McBride has included some of the most interesting. The book tells the story of Noel Killen, originally from Loughinisland, who rode his bike passed the old derelict Ballydugan Flour Mill, near Downpatrick, when he was a young lad and dreamt of restoring it.His dream came true. By virtue of his hard work he recaptured the millrsquos former glory and turned it into an award-winning wedding venue, complete with three happy ghosts who attend weddings and bring luck.Therersquos a Presbyterian minister who loiters around the basement and sometimes appears on the ground floor in the corner near the fire. Then there is Bobby, who danders across the first floor. He can be unpredictable as he is often said to slam the occasional door.Then there is the young girl dressed in sackcloth who loves to dance. She can sometimes be seen to be dancing to the music provided at the wedding breakfast.The book also notes the fable of Maggie who leapt across a deep chasm between the clfs near Newcastle in a bid to outrun a group of soldiers while carrying a basket of stolen birdrsquos eggs.Not an egg was broken in her successful attempt to clear the clf and she lived to see a ripe old age. Her ghost is said to loiter around the area know to locals as Maggiersquos Leap.Every quirky illustration that appears in the -page book has been drawn by the hand of the multi-talented Doreen.bull The Little Book of County Down can can be found on Amazon and in all good book stores..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Children and senior citizens  together in residential day  ","story":"ITrsquoS not often children have the opportunity to show others how to do something but thatrsquos exactly what happens when pupils from St Nicholasrsquo Primary School in Ardlgass Primary School visited a residential home for the elderly.P children from the school were chosen to work alongside residents of Ardview Residential Home in a cross-generational art project with local artist Fionnuala Duffin.The children began twice-weekly sessions before the Chrismas break and will continue until the mid term break.Funding for the project came from the Play Resource Centre.

Local people have sought a meeting with Department of Health officials on this matter and I will be happy to pursue and facilitate this.ldquoThere is a need for such a crucially important service for parents and indeed the wider family circle to be delivered regionally.Three weeks ago, local politicians called on the Permanent Secretary to reduce the ldquoalready enormous burden from parents suffering from bereavement and come up with a better solution than sending babies to Liverpool.Politicians said they were not averse to an all island service, insisting the reinstatement of the Belfast-based paediatric pathologist who retied is also vitally important moving forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New £217k play park welcome boost for Meadowlands estate  ","story":"MEADOWLANDS estate in Downpatrick is at last to get a new play park costing pound,.Work on the park should start within weeks and be ready by the end of March.A proposal to proceed with the scheme was approved by Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee on Monday night.The new park is a joint project with the council and Downpatrick Neighbourhood Renewal with % funding from the Department of the Communities.The council will be responsible for managing its construction and its maintenance.The new park is to be located in front of Drumcloon Walk and adjacent to the Quoile Crescent housing development.According to the Northern Ireland Neighbourhood Information Service statistics, Meadowlands is ranked th out of  areas of high health deprivation.The need for the park has also been supported by statistics from the Northern Ireland Research and Information Agency which show that there are  children under the age of  living in the Quoile Ward area who could avail of the park.It is also hoped that the park will help with the regeneration of the area and improve its overall look.The siting of the park was moved after some local concern was expressed that it would too close to pensionersrsquo homes in Drumcloon Park.Meadowlands Community Association, which was formed with help from local councillor Cadogan Enright, last week welcomed the move and the fact that the council listened to its representations.At Mondayrsquos meeting, Cllr Billy Walker proposed that the committee agree to go ahead with the park.He said: ldquoI really welcome this play park, as will the residents, he said. ldquoBeing the last chairman of the old district council, I know that a park for Meadowlands was a legacy issue.ldquoThere is real need for this as Meadowlands is one of the most deprived areas in the Downpatrick DEA and itrsquos to good see that that hard work is at last bearing fruit.Cllr Cadogan, who seconded the proposal, added: ldquoI am delighted that this play park can go ahead as I have been working with the residents for years and itrsquos at last getting over the line..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New amenity centre set for spring opening  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS new ultra-modern civic amenity centre could open as early as the spring, council officials have confirmed.The new facility at Flying Horse Road will replace the existing centre at nearby Cloonagh Road, which continues to struggle with the increasing demands being placed upon it.Over the Christmas and New Year holiday period, the centre was forced to close early due to the volume of waste.The early closure annoyed many ratepayers with council officials confident the new centre mdash which is signicantly larger mdash will be able to handle more recyclable material.Over recent years, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has invested signicant sums building new civic amenity sites in Ballynahinch and Castlewellan, with the Flying Horse Road facility set to be one of the most modern of its kind.Confirmation that the new Downpatrick centre could open as early as the spring will be given at this eveningrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.There was a delay in building the new facility as a suitable site could not be identied and when work did eventually get underway, progress was temporarily halted as equipment belonging to contractors was targeted by vandals.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed news then the new centre could open for business as early as the spring.The local authorityrsquos lease of the Cloonagh Road facility has been extended until the end of March but it has been recognised for some time that this facility has passed its sell-by-date.Cllr Curran said it was important Downpatrick had a recycling centre which was fit-for-purpose and could meet the needs of ratepayers across a wide area.He said the facility was not solely used by people in the town.

Credit is also due to the coaches and senior members of the club for their part in the planning of operations.This weekendItrsquos NI and Ulster Intermediate and Masters Championships races in Barnettrsquos Park on Saturday, beginning at pm.Please, ladies in particular, note the revised schedule as due to the numbers involved the intermediate ladiesrsquo race will be a separate race at pm, and will not be combined with theMasters Women, as originally planned.See you there..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Reception celebrates 45 years’ service  ","story":"THE contribution of the provincersquos longest serving councillor to the district and its people was recognised at a civic reception in his honour last weekend.Dermot Curran has served the people of the district for an incredible  years and his letime of public service recognised by Newry, Mourne and Down Council at a celebratory event at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel in Ballynahinch.Joined by his we Karen, family friends, former and current council colleagues and Northern Ireland Local Government representatives, Cllr Curran was overwhelmed by the good wishes of around  people who attended the event.Also in attendance were representatives from regional and national governments and non-governmental organisations who joined together to celebrate a remarkable achievement.Tributes were paid by current council chairman Mark Murnin, local authority chief executive Liam Hannaway and Northern Ireland Local Government Associationvice-president Fred Donnelly.The council presented him with a beautul James G Miles painting of Ballyhornan beach where he revealed he played as a boy, while Cllr Curranrsquos SDLP colleagues presented him with a portrait oh himself by Killyleagh artist Leo Casement.Cllr Murnin said his council colleague has been dedicated to public service since his first election in , serving two terms as Down Council chairman and then being elected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council in .ldquoOur council has been fortunate to have many hard working and exemplary councillors who strive to make this district a better place to live and work in, he continued. ldquoNo one demonstrates this more clearly than Dermot and during his first term as council chairman, he had the vision to work with councils across Ireland to develop relationships and encourage co-operative projects.ldquoBut we are not the only body to recognise the contribution that Dermot has made to our district.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before her move to London she had worked for Paul Rankin at Roscoff’s.Mary-Anne said she had always intended to come home from London and her original intention was to open a café deli. She said the market stall was designed to be a stopgap while she looked for premises but she ended up spending ten years there until she had her twins three years ago.“I was self-employed so I couldn’t take maternity leave from the market for more than eight weeks or I would lose the pitch,” she said.“I was already doing some midweek cookery classes at home in Moy, so I decided to expand on that and convert the garage into a state of the art facility. I really enjoy it and it allows me to work from home.”Courses cost from £ and include tea coffee and scones. Mary-Anne delivers savoury cookery classes as well but explained that baking is far and away the most popular.“I wasn’t actually trained as a pastry chef but there has been such a resurgence in the popularity of baking. That is where the demand is. I would love to do more cookery classes where people can learn to do savoury foods too, however the majority of bookings are for those sweet treats we all love. I like to combine traditional recipes and new flavours. Local, seasonal and organic ingredients are key.”Each course can accommodate - people and are booked out weeks in advance. All recipes andequipment are provided and you get to take home what you make.“My style is informal, it’s all about having fun. I do hands-on and demonstration classes and cater for all levels from complete beginners to more experienced cooks. The aim is to get stuck in.

Ulster Business takes a further look A few years back, the options were fairly limited for NI firms when it came to venture capital funding.Now, between private funds, investors and those backed by Invest NI, the options have widened signicantly for companies – especially those which are high-growth – to seek a cash injection, and get to the next level.Jayne Brady is partner at the Bank of Ireland Kernel Capital Growth Fund NI.“We have been operating in Northern Ireland for five years, and in that period we have seen a growing momentum in the Northern Ireland ecosystem,” she told Ulster Business.“We have  companies in our portfolio, and have invested in eight companies in Northern Ireland as part of that.”And a lot has changed in the last few years, particularly with the sheer number of avenues in which businesses can find access to funding.“There wasn’t an availability of local funds, and it was dficult to get that level from GB, because you needed to reach a certain level.”And where is the investment now going in Northern Ireland  “It’s very strong sectors of expertise, and there is a big FDI element – medical technology, cyber-security. It’s not created in isolation, andan availability of skills.”“More recently, there has been more external investors. We would co-invest, and there is a level of investment from outside players – there are good opportunities.”Jayne says that Kernel Capital tracks investments, and the level and size of deals here has grown. A lot of that has been down to the growth of the Knowledge Economy – which has expanded seven or eight-fold in the last few years.For businesses looking towards funds like Kernel, a typical deal size is from around £m up to £m.One of the largest investments was secured by B-Secur, which has created a biometric technology which uses the human heartbeat to unlock everything from finance and healthcare through to cars and buildings.The company, based at Catalyst Inc, secured £.m from investors including Kernel Capital and ADV.For Jayne, Kernel is looking at companies with turnover of more than £m, which have the ability and scope to be scaled.“We see investment where there is a scaling potential. We look at companies where we are generating £m plus –– which you can scale rapidly, or those with a deep IPfocus. Some companies in services won’t have that level of scale.”Then, there’s the Growth Finance Fund, and Growth Loan Fund II, which provide a total of £m of funding for Northern Ireland’s SMEs.The two new funds are being managed by WhiteRock Capital Partners, a homegrown fund manager set up in  to manage the first Growth Loan Fund, which has committed £m of loans to more than  businesses over the last six years.There’s also the Growth Finance Fund. That will see loans from £, up to £m going to growing businesses. It’s also the first time the British Business Bank has invested in a fund aimed solely at supporting Northern Ireland businesses. The latest figures from the Irish Venture Capital Association, which covers businesses across the island, show venture capital funding has slumped, with a fall-off in major deals and seed funding.Investment was down by almost a third to €min the first nine months of the , confirming a signicant slowdown on .The drop-off in cash accelerated during the year, with the amount raised by tech firms and startups in the last three months just half what it was a year earlier.The figures suggested that the largest segment of funding to see a decline is in deals was above €m .But a Northern Ireland report by Catalyst Inc, published last year, showed companies raised over £m in equity capital in .Elsewhere, flying the flag for venture capital in Northern Ireland for more than  years is Crescent Capital.Run by Colin Walsh, former CBI chairman in Northern Ireland, it’s invested in a raft of the most successful and leading companies here.That includes Andor Technology and Belfast-based biotech firm Fusion Antibodies, which is based at Springbank Industrial Estate in the west of the city.According to Jayne, it’s not just about backing Belfast firms, or FDIs setting up shop in the heart of the city.“We look towards the strong sectoral focuses, and outside Belfast as well. We are very conscious to go to our customers.” That includes holding regular open events across areas such as Newry, Co Tyrone and Londonderry. “We are very open to meeting any companies, and our door is open,” she says.But will Brexit play a part in the future of venture capital funding in Northern Ireland  “We need to be cognisant of any particular indication of any change in regulation,” Jayne says.“From our perspective, because we invest in deep tech, they are somewhat removed from that direct impact.” Elsewhere, there are other revenue streams which firms can look towards, especially when it comes to working capital.That includes Upstream – an alternative finance company run by Judith Totten, which specialises in funding for SMEs.“As Northern Ireland’s largest independently owned and managed provider of working capital, Upstream works collaboratively with organisations’ existing lenders to provide additional capital in a more flexible way to help businesses thrive,” sales director Alan Wardlow says.“Businesses come to us for our responsiveness – our formal credit approvals are achieved in days rather than weeks or months. Upstream has long standing relationships with many local venture capitaland private equity providers as well as the ious Invest NI-backed loan funds and we work closely together to provide solutions for business owners across Northern Ireland“We recently incorporated a trade finance solution into our product range to bridge the gap for organisations who require additional growth funding, quickly, to deliver orders beyond their current capability. This funding is proving incredibly popular alongside our long-standing invoice finance option which gives organisations the ability to release funds against their debtor book thereby freeing up cash flow for businesses to seize growth opportunities as they become available.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/steve_web.jpg","title":"the catalyst to putting northern ireland on the global map","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Ulster Business speaks to Catalyst Inc chief executive Steve Orr about his hugely ambitious plans for growth, expansion and moulding NI into a world-leader in tech ‘We aren’t going to follow anyone , and we need toto becoming leaders in the world.’It’s immediately clear that Steve Orr has big ambitions for Catalyst Inc. He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit could cost ni economy bn by ","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s economy could suffer a £bn drop in output by  in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, it’s been claimed. According to the CBI, its analysis of government figures published at the end of last year showsthe UK fails to secure a deal with the EU, by , GVA could be “.% lower than under the UK’s current arrangements with the EU according to government analysis”. The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come. It’s time to put prosperity before party politics and dogma.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tud_1.jpg","title":"lifestyle a rolex for the next generation","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business John Mulgrew gets hands-on with the flagship of watchmaker Tudor’s revamped line-up and examines the lineage of the luxury Swiss brand While Tudor’s fresh line-up of watches is somewhat of a deviation from its roots, it’s important to understand where the independent Swiss brand sits in the world of horology.The brand dates back as far as , when it was transferred to Rolex founder Hans Wilsdorf. It’s still lovingly referred to as the Swiss watch stalwart’s sister brand.From there, following the Second World War, he decided now was the time to expand and give the brand an identity of its own.The primary dference between the brands back then, was that Rolex watches carried in-house movements, and that Tudor would offer familiar watch styles, such as the Oyster and Submariner, at a more affordable cost, while its big brother would guarantee the technical, aesthetic and al characteristics, along with distribution and after sales service.But the brand back then, and the company now, has changed radically. Just a few years ago, it tore up the rulebook on its traditional line – moving away from historically similar watches to Rolex, and a few changes from its classical lines, towards a tight range of watches, bringing in the old and the new.The core model is the Black Bay. A millimetre larger than the Rolex Submariner, it’s a slightly chunkier affair, without treading into the excessive sizes of some other brand’s modern timepieces. It also offers a new ‘’ –  a smaller mm watch, which fits right in as a cheaper alternative to the Submariner, a Black Bay Chronograph and the Pelagos – a larger, more modern affair made out of titanium.The brand also comes in at a time when Rolex prices have shot up, considerably. Many of the most desirable models in the Rolex line have a waiting list – with second-hand prices outpacing the new book price.Tudor itself has also embraced this burgeoning demand, releasing its own GMT watch – with so-called ‘Pepsi’ blue and red bezel. Currently, Rolex’s own model – aside from the sizeable price dference – will mean joining a waiting list. A WEEK ON THE WRIST Tudor Heritage Black Bay Sitting as Tudor’s poster-boy or flagship in its range, the Black Bay is a e watch which melds the styling and inspiration of, possibly the most recognisable watch in the world, the Rolex Submariner, with a larger case, while adding patina on the hands and markers.There’s no crown-guard, ala Rolex. This time, it’s a larger, screw-down, with an etched Tudor rose – formerly the brand’s logo.Overall, the Black Bay’s case is brushed, including the caseback, with the finish smoothly transitioning into a polish around the sides and crown.The sapphire crystal glass is slightly domed, sitting around a millimetre off the face off the watch. Around the edge, the bezel is a solid, thick and satisfyingly sold -click version, with red triangle and lume dot.This version is on a steel bracelet, but is also available on a leather or fabric band, along with red dial and blue – the latter without the patina on the markers and hands.The bracelet is a stand-out characteristic of the piece, certainly in terms of build quality. The three-piece links have a lug width of mm, tapering to around mm. It’s brushed, but polished and riveted along the side. On the clasp, there’s a double-locking system, with a thoughtful inclusion of the Tudor shield logo into the mechanism, along with three points of micro-adjustment.This watch, available from jeweller Lunn’s, spent several days on my wrist – from the office, to out-and-about and around the house. It’s a comfortable piece to wear – balanced between a bit more heft than its more expensive sibling, but never straying into the realm of gaudy or garish.After a few hours, it felt very much like one of my own. I did miss the date, however, but those after additional complications or ality could look to the chronograph version, or the larger Pelagos.The Black Bay is a well-balanced piece – easily sitting at the centre of a Venn diagram between casual and formal.The brand itself is firing everything at the new range, with endorsements from David Beckham and Lady Gaga, aimed at a younger generation with disposable income to spare. While that may not appeal or speak to the horological purists, with the in-house movement, attention to detail, provenance and mixture of the traditional and modern, it’s likely to build a fresh reputation as a ‘watch fan’ timepiece, and for those who have no issue explaining to those admiring the chunk of steel on their wrists, that it isn’t a Rolex.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Air-1.jpg","title":"eight part belfast made airbus passenger jets delivered","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Eight part-Belfast made Bombardier Airbus passenger jets were delivered at the end of last year – bringing the total number to  during .

I love the mutual ethos, and that we are fundamentally there to help the community,” she told Ulster Business.“We have to make a , but fundamentally we are there for the good of society. I passionately believe that home ownership is a good thing. And I passionately believe that savings are a good thing, and that’s what our business has been doing for more than  years.”According to its latest full-year figures, ending in December , Progressive posted pre-tax profit of £.m.In the last year, it helped more than , people buy their home and almost  to build a new home, with overall new mortgage lending of around £m.It’s weathered some of the most dficult years in the residential property market here, with Northern Ireland prices plummeting in the wake of the recession in .“We are battling our way through that – the housing market hasn’t fully recovered through it. The number of new developments probably aren’t servicing the needs of the demand. We still have an issue out there.“Slow, and modest growth is happening at the minute. But that’s good, and that’s sustainable. Affordability is very good in Northern Ireland and the economic factors, even with Brexit, are good.”Progressive now has  branches and more than  staff spread throughout Northern Ireland.For Darina, it’s about working hand-in-hand with the customer, and ensuring everyone in the team in the same mindset.“For me, it has to be doing right by the customer. Once your staff are fully on that journey too, they know they are doing the right thing,” Darina says. “They aren’t forced into sales targets – they want to get the right product fro the person, and making it as easy as they possibly can.“In part, to hand hold. There are some cases where deadlines don’t happen, things don’t go according to plans – for example, in a housing chain, someone can drop out. It’s about being there, and being able to help.“There is still a demand for people to buy houses – that hasn’t changed at all.”Darina took over at the helm in , while the property market in Northern Ireland, and throughout the UK, was still going through tough times. But she believes it has normalised since then.“Things are picking up,” she says. “We have the experience here to keep going in a direction that suits the demographic that we serve.“We are here for the long-term, and factor that in. Ultimately, it has to be right for the consumer.“It’s also about the whole of Northern Ireland. It’s not just Belfast-centric, and we have to extend our reach. There’s good activity in dferent parts of Northern Ireland, and that’s where our roots are.”And after more than  years with the organisation, Darina says she has no plans to jump ship to another financial business.“I am totally bought in to the mutual ethos. For me, it’s all about the customer.
