Over the next few days that’s exactly what we’ll do.”His only reference to what are anticipated to be heated debates on the climate crisis was to say the leaders would be “talking about the future of our environment” as part of their discussions, as well as the future of our economies and jobs.Morrison cited his government’s renewed focus on the region, the so-called Pacific Step-Up, saying, as he has several times before: “If you’re going to step up you have to show up, and Australia’s going to show up, we’re not just going to show up here, we’re going to show up for the hard conversations, the good conversations, the family conversations that we have, that’s very much the spirit with which we’re engaging.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21b7951eebf764e07b0ca69b056432f69be56076/135_1506_2758_1655/master/2758.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=caa034737814e0d2a3e0fb98373b7d0a","title":"book clinic what would you like to ask our experts","story":"In our weekly series you can ask experts in the books industry any questions you want answeredBook Clinic is a weekly series in the pages of the New Review section of the Observer where we will turn to experts in their field to answer any book, reading or publishing questions you may have.

One of the witnesses, Emma, hears words: “dig”, “bridge”, “wild”. For days afterwards, Emma, Cowley and Adam experience powerful sensations of wellbeing and contentment, despite their troubled lives. For these are Niall Griffiths characters, the kind of people previously seen in novels such as Grits, Sheepshagger and Kelly + Victor: troubled souls, freethinking outsiders pushing psychic or sexual boundaries, anarchist crusties and new age festival heads, corralled by poverty and withered opportunities.Adam is a recovering addict, precariously clean after time in a rural rehab facility (which is about to be axed by austerity cuts). Emma has spells of anxiety and is addicted to bouts of promiscuity, escaping into the crush of anonymous bodies she is also a loving if flawed single mother to Tomos. Cowley is a violent, volatile building-site labourer with a sideline in bare-knuckle boxing who is barely able to read. His trauma and bitterness are empathetically portrayed and connected to the sexual abuse he suffered in childhood. Griffiths memorably conveys these main characters and others through an energetic, immersive mix of phonetic inner thought and long flights of authorial lyricism.We sweep through the charged days of a broiling post-referendum Welsh summer. Emma’s casual online posts about the collective vision prompt a massive and unintended internet response the news goes viral, and a mighty gathering of people - in search of meaning or God - begins to assemble on the slopes where it occurred. All three main characters are slowly drawn back there. This is a subversive, compelling concept that easily carries the momentum of the novel to a menacing climax. One of the many trolls who respond online writes: “Yes, these are our witnesses a slut and a junkie and a thug … these three are our Lucia and Jacinta and Francisco. Our innocent peasants.”By drawing a clear parallel with the Fátima visions, in which three young Portuguese shepherds claimed to see a Marian apparition in 1917, Griffiths taps into a fecund myth. If the rapture of Good News were to come, would it not be – as before – to the troubled and downtrodden? What makes the recipient of a vision worthy of it? The disciples who witnessed Christ’s resurrection were terrified and traumatised by it. By exploring such a theme – though never in an exclusively Christian way – Griffiths has forged a chimerical piece of radical fiction, a Blake-like reverie on the possibility (or not) of spiritual regeneration in our time.Though we never wholly grasp the fundamental sources of Emma and Adam’s existential malaise, poverty and addiction are enough to account for their behaviour. Adam reminds us that “temptation isn’t so much everywhere as everything”. They are both dependent on benefits, risking eviction from their rented homes as their initial experiences of wellbeing fade and they unravel into self-destruction. But sometimes authorial detail gets a little lost in the headlong hedonism. Emma drinks gin and tonic in pubs, night after night on her solo sexual manoeuvres. With “racks of clothes” at home, she boards a bus and gives over “some coins” but would a single mother on benefits not know what the bus fare was? Adam accompanies his mate Brownie to Wolverhampton for a doomed drug deal, but before they have even scored any money they are buying alcohol from the train trolley – one of the most overpriced outlets that exist.Beverage quibbles aside, what triumphs in Broken Ghost is the treasurable ecstasy of its lyrical flights. Griffiths’ prose can explode into vatic communication with the Earth around us – it is a pantheistic celebration, a Dionysian prayer to organic life and decay. As well as a wry observer of human foible, Griffiths is a nature writer with a matchless eye for metaphor, whether he is looking at a dying sheep or a feeding dragonfly. So we find here, among all the extremes of human behaviour, the measuredness of an author who can communicate great beauty: “the hills remaking themselves within the gauzy mist … the land itself reaching towards self-awareness and flicking out from itself flecks of life that sing and that fly”. River eddies are “smudged under gnats and syrupy in their coilings”. Scents include “the vanilla of gorse, the pine’s turpentine”.This important novel comes from a tradition: from the green fuse of Dylan Thomas and Caradoc Evans, the unstable religiosity of RS Thomas. The result, though, is something new, a profane, passionate response to nature and to the countryside, which is rarely encountered in contemporary British fiction any more. In its singular and unfashionable way, Broken Ghost is also a religious novel. A nonconformist sermon, it begs us all to let some sort of transforming spectre – holy or not – enter our lesser selves, or we will not be saved.• Alan Warner’s next novel, Kitchenly 434, will be published in 2020.

Penman always understood the pitfalls of nomenclature, as here in a consideration of Prince: “Most boys grow up with some kind of childish ambition to be king of this or that world, but what happens when a child is baptised Prince before he’s said or done a thing? Right from the start of his career, names and naming, signs and alphabets, seemed to matter deeply to Prince. But what is a name, when you get down to it? It isn’t something you can hold squarely in your hand like a lump of gold. It’s wholly immaterial. It can make you feel like a god before your time – but equally, maybe, a ghost in your own life.”Penman came of age during the heyday of NME in the late 1970s, just as the enfant terrible double-act of Julie Burchill and Tony Parsons were putting a rocket beneath the paper’s old guard. Penman was their coeval, but even then stood apart, being less a cheerleader for punk than a magpie for soul and jazz, dub and reggae. A “shy and gawky” teenager from flattest Norfolk he came to London in 1977 and hung out for a while with Scritti Politti during their squat-dwelling, anarchist phase, even going on stage with the band and blowing freeform sax. But he was evidently more at home writing about music than playing it. And talk about formative. His was the first piece I ever read about Tom Waits, and I recall equally compelling accounts of Elvis Costello, Rickie Lee Jones, Dennis Bovell and Tim Buckley. He was also a pretty handy film reviewer, and composed a small epic on the mystique of Robert De Niro (in 1984, when he still had mystique). Burchill admitted to envying Penman’s “gorgeous” prose style in her foreword to his first collection of essays and reviews, Vital Signs (1998).Since then, he has been a more elusive presence in print. For a while he seemed to disappear altogether. But lo! a second collection of Penmania is here, bearing the sweet, James Taylor-ish title of It Gets Me Home, This Curving Track.The eight pieces have a depth and expansiveness that transcend their origin as book reviews, several of them cannily commissioned by someone at the London Review of Books who saw his potential as a long-form essayist. They are linked in their search for “a vanished world”, in which black and white musicians intermingled and distilled a “cross-colour” alchemy of sound. Whether that idea holds up or not isn’t important. What gets us home, as it were, is Penman’s verve, and his eagerness to make us listen to the records as attentively as he does. Consider this, on the “unshowy” personality of Sinatra’s singing – “at times his song is closer to a resplendent anonymity he never makes things too obvious, italicising what he thinks the listener ought to be feeling”. Or this on Elvis’s alleged rip-off of black music: “Presley’s early Sun-side rhythms are all train-whistle country and sickle-moon bluegrass. The black rhythm and blues originals of songs like ‘Hound Dog’ and ‘Mystery Train’ are taken far more slowly – they have an undulant, rough-tongued chug.”His piece on Donald Fagen of Steely Dan is a bracing and brilliant investigation of west coast cool, New York hip and perhaps the greatest songwriting duo since Lennon and McCartney. He keeps tossing out magical little trills and riffs that cut to the heart of Fagen’s swooning sound: “Drums skip and skim like speedboats leaving a summer jetty the electric piano nudges you with a conspiratorial grin. The chorus rises and falls like sun motes on a holiday balcony.” He can be funny, too, in a feline way. Finding an audiobook of Pete Townshend’s autobiography – all 15 CDs’ worth – he balks: “I’m sorry, no one, not even a freelancer, has that much leisure time.” Elsewhere, his essays on James Brown, Charlie Parker and Prince aren’t definitive they are only inimitable.Penman is one of a talented generation of male “rock scribes” – Paul Du Noyer, Richard Williams, Mark Ellen, Danny Baker, the late Ian MacDonald – whose constituency has more or less vanished. I heard a sad story recently of one old NME star who now flogs his record collection from a table outside a tube station. To quote Steely Dan: “Hard times befallen  The soul survivors …” This neat volume shows there is still life in the back pages of one survivor, and should be snapped up by anyone who loves genius phrasemaking. Frank Zappa’s famous quote will never die: “Rock journalism is people who can’t write interviewing people who can’t talk for people who can’t read.” But he plainly never encountered Ian Penman.• It Gets Me Home, This Curving Track is published by Fitzcarraldo (£12.99).

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Let’s start with a beautiful example of nominative determinism. Isabella Tree’s Wilding has affected Wellfitbooty “more than any book I’ve read in many years”:It’s the story of a large farm in Sussex, England, which chose about 20 years ago to stop intensive farming and allow its lands to return to nature. It is now home to many threatened species, including the turtle dove and emperor butterfly is home to all 5 species of British owl, 11 species of bats – and countless other insects and birds.The author is one of the owners and the style is very readable and engaging – in fact I couldn’t put it down. The principles in the book can be applied to gardens of any size … I wholeheartedly recommend it.The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13 and ¾ by Sue Townsend still works for writeronthestorm:Taking me back to my childhood when I borrowed this off my older brother and thought it was hilarious… It still stands up as a funny and enjoyable read. I’ve got the next couple of books in the series and will move onto them at some point.For the 15th time I think. I call it my summer book. It never fails to delight me.Mission To Tashkent by Frederick Marshman Bailey has impressed SchwarzwaldBummel:An incredible true-story romp about an English spy hired by Lenin’s Cheka to capture himself. Bailey a national treasure who deserves more recognition.“Thank you to everyone on here who recommended Elizabeth Taylor,” says Rick2016. “Without Tips, Links and Suggestions I’d never have discovered Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont, which proved wonderful”:It’s a quiet, understated book, but every line is so well crafted and has such power. The lessons it teaches are, when you write them down, obvious. Everyone needs love, physical contact, to feel wanted and like their company is a pleasure, not a burden. And yet it’s so easy to forget that everybody else feels these things in the cavalcade and clamour of everyday life.. Elizabeth Taylor’s empathy, compassion and ability to portray the irreducible human core of her characters are utterly remarkable and I thoroughly recommend Mrs Palfrey ... to anyone who hasn’t read it.More good work by you guys: FrogC has started reading When Mystical Creatures Attack by Kathleen Founds, “following a tip from a reader of this column”:It’s a series of linked short stories about a high-school class in Texas, most of them troubled, and their teacher who is equally so, being confined in a sort of capitalist asylum where they give Wellness Points(TM) for fulfilling various therapeutic tasks. The construction is ingenious - you might say gimmicky, but I like that kind of thing: the title story, for example, consists of the essays written by the students on how their favourite mythical creature might solve some world problem (though a lot of the problems chosen, inevitably, are on a more personal scale). Funny and moving. I love the fact that the most feared teacher is referred to simply as “The Sir”.Alexia_R has been pleased to pick up The Runaways by Fatima Bhutto:I picked this up on a whim in Foyles because it was a beautiful, signed copy. It’s a fast-paced story of three Pakistani young people (one of them British-Pakistani), negotiating their culture, religion etc. One of them is gay and struggling to accept it, another is from a very privileged background, another is from a slum of Karachi. I can’t say too much about the plot without giving it away. I was absolutely loving this and was about to praise it to the skies but I wasn’t too sure about the ending. Still, very good.RedmonT has almost finished Purity by Jonathan Franzen:Not quite as good as The Corrections and Freedom, but then that might only be because of how the account of Tom and Annabel’s relationship makes me feel. It’s awful – the feeling of dread I felt throughout that section, the nerves, the butterflies, the absurd behaviour. It’s been a long time since a book made me feel that way.He is amazing at threading stories together. It doesn’t even matter that it’s occasionally haphazard - realising things in a non-linear order affects the way you realise them (and changes what you thought you knew). There have been two or three moments that made me sit up and exclaim “FUCK” or “OH MY GOD”.I think he does something inwith his books that no other living writer does.Catch-22 attracts all the plaudits but this is well worth checking out as a study of the office environment and the feeling of ‘Is this all there is?’ It’s as sharp as TV’s Mad Men, which I suspect was influenced by it. I read about one third of the book in a single evening until the early hours. It’s that good.It is that good.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

There are Instagram accounts, podcasts and even subscription boxes dedicated to reading. Chances are you’ve noticed your friends joining book clubs or posting beautifully lit bookstagram photos. Reading is – if it ever was – cool again.Why? Perhaps for the same reason we’ve seen a surge in interest in hobbies such as jigsaws and cross-stitch: right now, our brains are saturated with digital information so it’s no surprise that we’re returning to unplugged hobbies. (But also going online to talk about them.)Being overwhelmed by information has shattered a lot of our attention. As a child with undiagnosed ADHD, I read voraciously because my brain needed constant stimulation and I didn’t yet have a phone to distract me. But as the internet became part of my life, reading lost ground and in my early 20s, I went a year without reading a book at all. But by making a conscious effort to read – partly, I confess, because of recommendations on Instagram – I’m back up to at least one book a week.It hasn’t been easy. I’m still busy, I still have ADHD and I still have myriad distractions. But here is what I’ve learned, and what might help you to fall back in love with reading in a way that fits in with our ever-online world.1. Follow book accounts on social mediaIf you’ve been away from reading for a while, it can be hard to know where to start. It can also be really tough to go from living your life online to building a separate one. By following Instagram accounts that regularly post about books, you’ll get ideas: try Book of the Month, Books on the Subway and Strand Bookstore for beautifully shot recommendations. 2. Read what you want toIf you haven’t read in a while, it can be tempting to set yourself lofty goals. For many of us that’s unrealistic, so instead: are there particular topics you’d love to read a non-fiction book about? Is there an author you’ve found easy to read before who has other books? Is there a favourite you can reread? When I’m finding it tough, I often punish myself by trying to slog through something hard before I let myself enjoy something that’s 200 pages and a laugh. But it’s enjoying the 200-pager that gets me in the swing of things, and makes it easier to concentrate on something tougher.3. Join a libraryLibraries are dying, and it’s partly because a lot of people don’t seem to consider them an option. But if finances are holding you back and you can trek to a library, it’s worth it. You can get recommendations, read for free and give up on books you can’t get into. Many have book clubs, too. For readers in the UK, you can find your nearest library here.4. Make a TBR (to be read) listHaving a realistic to-do list can be a great motivator. You can easily put one together on Goodreads, where you record what you’ve read, want to read and have read. You can also add friends, which introduces a competitive element and holds you accountable. 5. Try audiobooksIf you really can’t concentrate on reading – or set the time aside – maybe it’s a good idea to try a service such as Audible. Sure, people can be snobs about audiobooks, but they shouldn’t be. You still get the exact same information, and can participate in all the chats about the biggest book of the summer – but you can get it done while cooking dinner or out walking.6. Can’t escape your phone? Put books on itBetween work, friends and everything else, it can be hard to imagine finding time every day to read. The chances are, though, that you could. Do you commute? If you’re not forced to work on it, you can read. Lunch break? Read! I’m guilty of flicking between social media accounts whenever I get a spare five minutes. But it is just as easy for me to open the Kindle app on my phone as Twitter. Reading ebooks can be more expensive than secondhand books – but reading on my phone is often the only way I can commit.• Do you have any tips on overcoming distractions or finding your love of reading again?

The line, which links the capital with cities including Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool, has been run since privatisation by Virgin Rail.The First-Trenitalia bid was chosen over a Chinese consortium led by the Hong Kong operator MTR, First’s partner on South Western.Trenitalia has been named “shadow operator” for HS2, with responsibility for introducing new services but with a caveat that it may not go ahead, depending on the outcome of reviews into the construction of the high-speed network and the shape of the entire rail industry.First-Trenitalia will pay £1.6bn in premiums to run Britain’s most lucrative line from this December until 2026, with a second phase of payments to depend on HS2. The contract could run until 2034 with an extension.Although Keith Williams, who is leading the rail review, has said that franchising must change, he has endorsed the West Coast Partnership contract as “a step forward that is firmly in line with the review … capable of incorporating the reforms needed for the future”.The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said the contract was “a decisive shift towards a new model for rail … built with the flexibility to respond to his recommendations and deliver fundamental reform to a flawed system”.Shapps also confirmed he would proceed with a white paper for reforming rail, based on Williams’ findings, which are due in the autumn – continuing a review commissioned by his predecessor, Chris Grayling.The Department for Transport has pressed ahead with the west coast award despite a high court case being brought by Stagecoach, Sir Richard Branson’s partner in Virgin Rail. Branson said he was “devastated” by the decision.Stagecoach was disqualified for a non-compliant bid, refusing to accept pension liabilities, but sought to have the decision overturned – a legal action that recalls the fiasco in 2012 when the west coast contract was awarded to FirstGroup before being rescinded after Virgin’s complaints.Stagecoach said the award of the franchise would not have an impact on its continuing litigation against the DfT.First’s biggest shareholder, Coast Capital, has also threatened to sue the board of the company if it enters into a new rail franchise. James Rasteh, partner at Coast, told the  earlier this year it would “hold each member of management team and board member personally and fully accountable if the company enters any new rail franchise – especially in light of the value already destroyed by that ision, and the added and unknowable pension liabilities”.The previous two UK rail franchise competitions won by First – TransPennine and South Western – have proved far more costly than expected to the company. Although directors vehemently denied overbidding, First wrote down by £106m the value of its TransPennine franchise last year and last month followed up with an “onerous contract provision” of £102m for South Western.Earlier this year, First indicated it could turn its back on UK rail after the expiry of its current contracts, which also include Great Western Railway and the small, open access Hull Trains. On Wednesday First said its board “remains very aware of concerns expressed by shareholders regarding rail … however, it has unanimously concluded that signing the partnership agreement is in the best interests of all shareholders”.Labour queried the award, given the scale of First’s debts and recent losses, and coming after the cancellation of the Southeastern franchise competition. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said that awarding First such a complex contract was “a gross error of judgment”.The contract will involve handling the first HS2 services from 2026 until 2031, should the project survive despite budget challenges. High-speed trains are planned to run north on the existing mainline after the first phase of the high-speed network opens between London and Birmingham.

The Bank has said it could be forced to raise interest rates if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, saying the pound would plunge to drive up the cost of imports. However, most analysts believe it would need to cut rates to support jobs and growth. In an ironic twist amid the public anger over British rail fares, the ONS said that little change in the price of an international train ticket over the past year prevented UK inflation from rising by a greater extent in June.

In view of the subdued outlook for world trade and the automotive industry and lingering elevated political uncertainty around trade, Italy and Brexit, at best mini-growth rates can be expected in the coming quarters.It is particularly worrying that the weakness in industry is increasingly affecting domestic demand.

Cabinet minsters, the press, members of the public rightly demand answers: why was Newcastle airport plunged into darkness? Who is responsible for rail services being halted for hours? Threats are issued of a whopping fine, an official inquiry, heads rolling. Days of rage for a power cut of less than an hour.When it works, infrastructure is invisible. Point out the crumbliness, by all means, and lament the dangerous compromises – but as long as the wretched system judders on, voters shrug and politicians look the other way. Until the day the bridges collapse, the trains seize up and the lights no longer come on. By which time it is too late for anything but blame in 24-point headlines.Between these two extremes lies a much rarer phenomenon, which blights Britain today. We are right in the middle of an infrastructure breakdown – we just haven’t named it yet. You’ll know what I mean when we list the component parts. More than 760 youth clubs have shut across the UK since 2012. A pub closes every 12 hours. Nearly 130 libraries were scrapped last year, and those that survive in England have lopped off 230,000 opening hours.Each of the above is a news story. Each stings a different group: the books trade, the real-ale aficionados, the trade unions. But knit them together and a far darker picture emerges. Britain is being stripped of its social infrastructure: the institutions that make up its daily life, the buildings and spaces that host friends and gently push strangers together. Public parks are disappearing. Playgrounds are being sold off. High streets are fast turning to desert. These trends are national, but their greatest force is felt in the poorest towns and suburbs, the most remote parts of the countryside, where there isn’t the footfall to lure in the businesses or household wealth to save the local boozer.When I am out reporting it is not uncommon to go into a suburban postcode short of money yet still bustling with people – but the banks have nearly all cleared out, the church has gone and all that’s left of the last pub is an empty hulk. The private sector has buggered off, the state is a remote and vengeful god who dispenses benefits or sanctions, and the “big society” never made it out of the pages of a report from a Westminster thinktank. I’ve seen this in the suburbs of London and in the valleys of south Wales, and the word that most comes to mind is “abandoned”.Politicians bemoan the loss of community, but that resonant word is not precise enough. A large part of what’s missing is social infrastructure. It can be public or private. It is often slightly dog-eared and usually overlooked. But when it vanishes, the social damage can be huge.The American sociologist Eric Klinenberg lists some in his recent book, Palaces for the People: “People reduce the time they spend in public settings and hunker down in their safe houses. Social networks weaken. Crime rises. Older and sick people grow isolated. Younger people get addicted to drugs … Distrust rises and civic participation wanes.” A New York University professor, Klinenberg’s observations hold as true for Brexit Britain as they do for Trump’s America. How often have you read about a grandmother found dead in her own home, with no one popping by for days? How many news stories do you read about teenagers experiencing mental illness as they compare themselves to the images on their screens? And how many times have you complained that everyone is so stuck in their own bubble that politics is hopelessly polarised?When it comes to transport or energy or sewage, Britain has a National Infrastructure Commission that monitors the country’s needs and guides parliament on where to direct spending. After all, the quality of such hard infrastructure influences where multinationals set up shop: it is money-making. But parks and libraries don’t generate cash. Social infrastructure has no lobby, no registry of assets and certainly no government agency. No Whitehall official monitors how much of it has closed or withered away – that relies on civil society groups to file freedom of information requests or badger town halls with survey. Everyone knows we need it, yet just as our economic model prizes shareholder returns over investment in the National Grid, so our politics relies on drawing in the voters with unfeasibly low taxes. Until one day, something breaks and all hell breaks loose.So here is a suggestion for Jeremy Corbyn or Nicola Sturgeon or Adam Price or whoever else fancies it. Talk about the importance of social infrastructure. Promise to set up a commission explicitly to audit what we have and help protect it. Commit public money to it, alongside gentle pressure on the private sector to do its bit. That way, we can publicly mark the public institutions we all know we need – and show the esteem due to the people who keep them going and use them. The spirit we need is that summed up by the librarian who rhapsodises to Klinenberg about his branch: “The library really is a palace. It bestows nobility on people who can’t otherwise afford a shred of it. People need to have nobility and dignity in their lives. And, you know, they need other people to recognise it in them too.”Our people deserve palaces."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69a1f52971e35427022135ccbe0672f133916ac5/0_32_4888_2932/master/4888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b712b47153468f2c336856ee21b1abbc","title":"labour scrap predicted grades university admissions fairer","story":"Hundreds of thousands of students will receive their A-level results on Thursday. It is the end product of two years of hard work, and many will be hoping it is also the start of their next educational journey.Unfortunately, not all of them will have a fair chance to take that next step. Our higher education admissions process is neither fair nor effective.That is why the next Labour government will scrap predicted grades and introduce post-qualification admissions (PQA). This means that students will apply for higher education courses after they receive their exam results. It will make our higher education system fairer, giving all students the chance to reach their potential regardless of their background, instead of a system that reinforces privilege and inequality.Underestimating grades has serious consequences for a student’s choice of university, and their future. Students who are highly able but whose grades are underpredicted are unlikely to apply to the most selective universities. Their options, therefore, are unfairly limited – and far too many are held back from reaching their full potential.This unfairness is not random and it is certainly not equally felt by all students. Errors in grade prediction hit working-class students particularly hard, because students from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to have their grades underpredicted. In its current form, our higher education admissions system is a barrier to students’ success instead of supporting them.The Sutton Trust found that almost 3,000 disadvantaged, high-achieving students have had their grades underpredicted. Working-class students have already borne the brunt of the Tories’ cuts losing their educational maintenance allowance in England and university grants, quite apart from the trebling of university tuition fees.Our admissions system should be a vehicle for justice, but it is failing working-class students, especially those who are the first in their family to go to university. Working-class students more often lack the advice, guidance and support needed to navigate the tricky application process, whereas their wealthy peers at top public schools have admissions tutors to help their students game the system. There is similar evidence that the system works against ethnic minority applicants too.The current system of predicted grades has also led to the rise of unconditional offers, and “conditional-unconditional” offers, where an offer is only made unconditional if a student makes that university their firm choice. While some unconditional offers may be justified, it is clear that they too add to the inequality we see in the opportunities that are available to students from different backgrounds.Our education system must work for students and it must be driven by fairness, not market forces. Scrapping predicted grades and introducing post-qualification admissions will bring England in line with the rest of the world. As it stands, it is the only country with over a million students where a pre-qualification system is used.Reforming admissions is a key part of our plan to transform higher education to make it genuinely accessible to all. This includes restoring the educational maintenance allowance and maintenance grants in England, as well as scrapping tuition fees for both college and universities.Only the Labour party is committed to making education – from the early years to lifelong learning – both free and genuinely accessible to all.• Angela Rayner is Labour MP for Ashton-under-Lyne and shadow education secretary"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d366f8136095b66824c71315e1d09b4fa016f5e2/97_84_2765_1659/master/2765.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8e20d3cd0a9fdb070e85f1da7daed5d","title":"alan partridge saves steve coogan from lengthy driving ban","story":"Actor barred for two months after arguing longer ban would mean cancelling new seriesSteve Coogan has escaped a lengthy driving ban after successfully arguing that a new series featuring his Alan Partridge character could not be filmed on public transport.The comedian was clocked driving his Porsche at 36mph in a 30mph zone close to his mansion in East Sussex, earning him a three-point endorsement on his driving licence. Because he already had nine points from previous offences he faced an automatic six-month ban.Magistrates in Crawley instead decided to ban him from driving for two months after hearing that a lengthier time off the road would force him to cancel an Alan Partridge travelogue series he is set to make for the BBC.Coogan told the court that in the series, which he is due to film in October, Partridge drives to various locations around Britain meeting people: “I’m producing a travelogue follow-on TV series where I’m basically driving around Britain. The whole nature of the series is that it is a travelogue and it’s an artistic thing that he drives and that defines his character.”The actor argued that his Partridge character, who in one series drove barefoot to Dundee after gorging on Toblerone and owned a Lexus he described as “the Japanese Mercedes”, was inherently wedded to the road. “You couldn’t put him on a train because that not who he is. It’s part of his character that he drives,” he said.Coogan told the court that the camera shots could not be faked: “You have cameras mounted on the bonnet then you have other shots where you have a camera mounted on a separate car filming the person in the car driving.”He said his Baby Cow production company has lined up between 15 and 20 staff to work on the series and they would struggle to find alternative work if he cancelled at short notice.The court heard the actor had a history of speeding offences and had attended a drivers awareness course just two months ago.Coogan admitted his driving record was not good, but said he had now taken steps to change his behaviour: “I’m trying to slow down and I try to observe the average speed limits that have come in. I tend to drive the one, the car, with the automatic cruise control that will keep me within the speed.”Ann Schroder, the chair of the magistrates bench, said they had taken into account the “exceptional hardship” it would cause other TV professionals if the series had to be cancelled. She told Coogan: “We have also taken into account your driving record, which is not very good.”Magistrates gave him three penalty points and disqualified him from driving for two months. They also fined him £750 with £85 court costs and a £75 victim surcharge.Coogan is a noted motoring enthusiast who has owned a succession of cars including Ferraris, Mazdas, Range Rovers and Porsches.He escaped a driving ban after saying he was unable to remember who had been driving when his car was allegedly clocked speeding in Hove. He was fined £670 and banned from driving for 28 days in February 2016 after being caught speeding at almost twice the limit in Brighton."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/602eaa4df02f977488f92e9b5935ac4ab0c4a005/281_187_3719_2232/master/3719.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d523d890b85f69329748e839358e5e0f","title":"labour wants universities to offer places after exam results","story":"Party aims to stop students from being hindered by inaccurate A-level forecastsSchool-leavers’ anxious wait for university places in England could be ended under proposals by Labour that would delay the admissions process until after exam results are published, ending controversial practices that penalise disadvantaged students.Angela Rayner, Labour’s education secretary, said the next Labour government would undertake an overhaul of the structure and timing of the higher education admissions system in England, to avoid relying on inaccurate A-level grade forecasts and to halt the controversial use of unconditional offers for school-leavers.The announcement comes as more than 300,000 school-leavers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland await the results of their A-levels and other qualifications later this week, with the majority holding offers of undergraduate places dependent on achieving specific grades.In most cases the offers are the result of applications made in January or earlier, but under Rayner’s plan the decision-making process at English institutions would be delayed until after 18 and 19-year-olds have had their exams marked and received their grades.“The higher education admissions system isn’t working for students and radical action is needed to change that. Predicted grades are wrong in the vast majority of cases and disadvantaged students in particular are losing out on opportunities on the basis of those inaccurate predictions,” Rayner said.Labour said a new admissions system would require consultation with schools and universities but would end England’s unusual status in requiring students to apply without knowing if they have achieved the right grades, leading to more than one in five students not receiving their first choice of course.Research has found that around 1,000 high-achieving students from disadvantaged backgrounds have their grades under-predicted each year, which can force them to wait a year to reapply to highly selective institutions such as Cambridge or Imperial College London.Rayner pledged that a new streamlined admissions system would be introduced by the end of Labour’s first term in office.“No one should be left out of our education system just because of their background, yet with grants scrapped and fees tripled, the system is now deeply unfair,” Rayner said.“We will put students at the heart of the system, making it fairer, more accurate, and a genuine vehicle for social justice. We will work with schools, colleges and universities to design and implement the new system, to make higher education genuinely accessible to all.”Sir Peter Lampl, founder of the Sutton Trust, backed the overhaul proposed by Labour. “The current system is based on students’ predicted grades which are wrong most of the time,” he said. “Our research has found that high-attaining, disadvantaged students are more likely to have their grades under-predicted than their better-off peers.“Moving to a system of post-qualification applications would empower the student to make the best university choice for them.”The change could require substantial changes to the timing of A-levels or the start of the university year for new undergraduates, although Rayner points out that, in other developed countries, applicants do not decide on offers before they receive exam grades.In Finland, for example, final exams are taken in March before applications open, and offers made in July.Rayner told BBC’s Radio 4 programme that Labour are willing to change the academic calendar to fit with their proposal. She said: “I want students to be able to make choices based upon their actual grades and be supported through that process. If that means we have to adjust the academic year slightly to make that happen, I think its important we do that because our system has to be fair.” Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders that represents many secondary school heads in England, warned that Labour’s proposals “represent a significant and complex change”.“It would be extremely difficult to manage the entire applications process in the few weeks between A-level results in mid-August and the beginning of university terms in September or October, and it is likely that we would need to rethink the entire calendar,” Barton said.School-leavers apply through the Ucas service, which also advertises courses available after exam results are published under a process known as clearing, a route that has become more popular in recent years as universities have aggressively expanded while the number of school-leavers in the population has been falling.Clare Marchant, the chief executive of Ucas, said the application timeframe would need to change to give universities and students more time to make their decisions.“Young people need their teachers’ support when making application choices, and this isn’t readily available to all at the scale required when schools and colleges are closed during August,” Marchant said.“Universities and colleges need time for interviews, auditions, and considering contextual information about applicants, and time to put in place support services to help care leavers, first in family, and disabled students, transition into higher education.”But the move was strongly supported by Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, which represents many university staff.“The current system, based on inaccurately predicted results, is failing students. It is time we adopted the type of system used around the rest of the world where university offers are based on actual achievements instead of guesswork,” Grady said.Rayner’s proposal would only apply to institutions in England, and potentially to applicants living in England, because education policy is devolved to national governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, with Scotland already using post-qualification admissions (PQA) for its domestic applicants."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f57fac0ac4adc6552df0acbcf59b66ee7a33b43/0_0_8660_5196/master/8660.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42f6ba1e63913c0c11680127b2e605c8","title":"aced your a levels find a last minute course upgrade through adjustment","story":"Clearing’s adjustment process helps students find better uni offers. All it takes is a little post-exam homeworkAdjustment gives students the opportunity to reconsider where and what to study if they have exceeded the conditions of their offer. It could be goodbye back-up choice, hello top-ranking uni.The process is available from A-level results day, 15 August, until 31 August. It’s entirely optional, and many competitive courses will be full, but other applicants might have missed their conditions or swapped a course, so it is worth seeing what’s available.You need to register for adjustment in Ucas Track and then call the universities and colleges you’re interested in. Bear in mind that not all universities and courses will make use of it. There is no comprehensive list, but some universities specify which courses are available on their website.Why’s that? According to Manuel Souto-Otero, a senior lecturer in social sciences at Cardiff University, many people don’t even know about it. Plus, after the whole Ucas process, the idea of switching can be daunting.Shanita Jetha got into Warwick University through adjustment and says that although the process is nerve-racking, it is worth it. “My first choice had asked for ABB, but on results day I got AAB. Luckily, over the summer, I’d made a list of unis to consider if I’d done better or worse than expected. I really had no idea how I’d done in my exams.”Jetha contacted four of the unis on her list and was offered three places, and given a 24-hour deadline to respond. She accepted Warwick’s offer the following day. “I knew people’s experiences of being there and I had looked into the course. I’m really pleased I did it. I’ve studied abroad and I don’t think I would have had that opportunity with my original choice.”Delyth Chambers, director of student recruitment at the University of Warwick, recommends avoiding a scattergun approach and focusing on places you are “genuinely interested in and eligible for”.If you get better marks than expected, shopping around makes sense, but be wary of being swayed by university rankings, as they can change from year to year, and don’t be distracted by new offers for the sake of it. “If you are sure about the course and uni you’ve chosen and that’s what you want to do, that should take priority over everything else,” says Souto-Otero.Before your results come out, research your options in case you are under-predicted. There is little time to react, so gather information on the courses you’re interested in:1 Trade-up optionsThis year there will be the lowest number of 18-year-olds in the UK population since the turn of the millennium. As a result, universities will find it harder to fill their courses, so it’s likely there will be more places available. This puts you in a good position to trade up. Also, remember that courses with a similar name offered by different unis can have very different content.2 Get back in touchYou can still contact a university that rejected you earlier in the cycle to check your options. Have your Ucas ID number ready and a pen and paper to take down any information.3 Interview by phonePrepare for a telephone interview. Some universities may do this, but also be ready to interview them. It is a good time to ask questions on what the course covers. Are there options to study abroad? How much contact time will you have per week?4 Take in an open dayIf you can, visit the universities that you are interested in. Many universities have open days over the summer.5 Be fast, but not too fastReact fast. You’ll be given a certain period of time to reply, but some courses may go on a first-come-first-served basis. That said, don’t react too fast, and don’t accept an offer verbally if you don’t want it. You can only accept one adjustment offer, after which the uni will confirm your place straight away using your Ucas student ID. Talk to parents, carers, teachers and friends and consider calling other unis before accepting.

Lauren, Rowan and Tair went to Kim-Joy’s kitchen to find out – and compete furiouslyAs the nation collectively puts on the kettle before this year’s Great British Bake Off, Kim-Joy – perhaps the biggest breakout star of last year’s show – is hosting her own warm-up competition.In her candy-coloured home in Yorkshire are three amateur bakers sent by the  to compete to be Kim-Joy’s Baker of the Day. At stake – an edible medal baked by Kim-Joy herself.When I arrive, Kim-Joy and the bakers are drinking tea and looking jolly. There are three cows in the field outside, a mere iced-bun’s throw away, and bees are buzzing about the yellow-lidded bins inside.Kim-Joy and her partner, Nabil, have just returned from San Diego Comic-Con. Jetlagged, but very relaxed, they are manning a pale yellow KitchenAid mixer, while three of the gamest bakers this side of the Bake Off tent look on.There’s Lauren, who only realised how far her hobby had got out of hand when her boss introduced her to a visiting colleague as “Lauren. She bakes”. Taking treats in to work was her way of dealing with her fears that people wouldn’t like her, she says. These days, it is mostly her workmates who are afraid: frightened that she will stop. Her most recent triumph was a mango mousse cake – although she is proud of the fact her colleagues now come in to work asking for advice on cookie baking times, having followed in her baking footsteps.Next up is Rowan who, like Lauren, has been baking since she was four. Her mother, she says, starts planning Christmas in August, and now delegates the entire sweet section to her. When a friend mentioned today’s contest, she thought: “I’ll probably be doing that at home anyway.” She works at a publishing house and sits down the hall from the cookbook department, meaning taking in treats can be nerve-racking. But her boundless creativity (she also runs artistic retreats and creates video essays about queer culture and film) and her knack for a good flavour combo has won over every colleague.And then there is Tair, a customer service specialist and serial 10k runner, who has been baking since 2006. It all started when he encountered a bonkers multilayered dessert that featured a sweet pie baked into each tier of cake. His friends have had to move to another country, just to get away from the calories he was plying them with.“I took up baking so people would like me,” he says. “But then they started hating me because they were putting on weight.” He has even written a play about the pitfalls of baking, which he is now turning into a book. It is a cautionary tale, he says: “Like HP Lovecraft, but with cookies.”Kim-Joy has never had this many people in her kitchen, and she loves it. “Usually, it’s just me on my own, with Nabil looking at me going: ‘How have you made all this mess?’”I decide this is going to be just like the tent, only much better.The recipes are from Kim-Joy’s forthcoming cookbook, a compendium of edible cuteness. The plan is for the guest bakers to collaborate on baking, then compete on decorating.“Do you have enough ingredients?” asks Nabil.“I think so …” says Kim-Joy.On your marks, get set, bake!The three bakers take it in turns to squeeze blobs of dough into the chilled tray’s shell-shaped moulds. When it is time to slide the day’s first bake into the oven, everyone crowds around and sings with joy.Things get serious when the madeleines have cooled down, however, and Kim-Joy declares that it is time to “start dipping”. There is silence in the kitchen. You could hear a chocolate sprinkle drop.After testing the black icing for consistency, Rowan cautiously pipes on her first panda face. It is a bit wonky. She promptly calls him Boris, and says she may just eat him. Lauren is next, and Rowan channels Jonathan from Queer Eye: “Look at this confidence! YASSS!” Tair is a picture of stoic calm – until his whole body heaves a huge sigh of relief and I realise he hadn’t been breathing.The rack fills up with a menagerie of panda-ish creatures – some mouse-like, some sleeping, one with a goatee – and I gain a new appreciation for the skill involved in drawing on sponge with liquid sugar.In this challenge a batch of profiteroles have their tops sliced off before being filled with strawberry cream and given piggy faces with icing and pink marzipan.Kim-Joy’s recipe says they are “quick and actually so simple” to make. The level of collective concentration, though, would suggest this is optimistic. Just watching the bakers peer into the oven to check if the choux balls are browning makes me feel nervous, and that is well before they have turned them into baby boars.Rowan whips some cream with freeze-dried strawberry powder and sugar, then dribbles in some pink food dye. Lauren methodically makes all her marzipan snouts then heads to the stove to melt dark chocolate which will act as mud. When Tair has finished slicing and dolloping pink cream, he anxiously starts icing faces. It only requires two little dots for the eyes and two smaller dots for the nostrils. But a shake of the hand here or a squeeze of the piping bag there and things can quickly take a turn for the monstrous. Our bakers are not to be undone by royal icing, though. Their composure is impressive.“Shall we get a plate for each of you so you can mud up?” Kim-Joy asks.Tair dishes up a bold puddle and plops his four little piggies down in a row. Rowan plates hers first then dribbles and flings the melted chocolate with Jackson Pollock-style abandon. Lauren’s plate is minimalist, with the chocolate poured into a smooth pool and the piglets huddled at its edge.The three of them take a moment to smudge their anxious brows and appraise. Nabil brings round a tray of cheese sarnies. Everyone tucks in. Competitive baking is hungry work.Kim-Joy conquered spice week with a show-stopping chandelier made of these beauties. Today, she has prepped the dough ahead of time (a salted butter, black treacle and muscovado mixture, spiced with cinnamon and cloves). “What do you guys fancy decorating?” she asks as she tips out two entire boxes of cookie-cutters on the floor and uncovers a basket of food dyes.They settle on cacti and llamas. Tair opts for egg-yolk yellow, Lauren, cerise pink and Rowan, a light and a dark forest green. Kim-Joy takes a selfie with the bakers and their piping bags just as a butterfly flies up to the door.“Can things possibly get cuter?” I whisper softly to no one in particular. The contestants get decorating.Kim-Joy hands out toothpicks for fixing holes – or “for wiggling”, as she puts it – and candy rocks, sprinkles and shimmer pearls. “Oh, I got some eyes, too, if you want to make it crazy.”“Dammit, no, wasp, not right now,” says Rowan as yet another stripy inspector takes an interest in her sugar work.Lauren is wiggling, too, bent over the kitchen counter as if her life depends on it. She oozes precision, commitment and focus, as she delicately pokes the icing to create a prickly texture. She dots her succulents with white-icing thorns and sets them in a bed of coloured rock-sugar topsoil.Meanwhile, I fear Tair has stopped breathing again. He smothers his three cacti and lone llama in yellow, then bejewels the lot with red, pink and brown blooms.There is half an hour to go and everyone suddenly realises that, contrary to GBBO tradition, no one has been calling out timings. The whole day has unspooled without the slightest glitch, largely because Kim-Joy is a master of time management.Tair is the first to finish, so we have a bit of a chinwag. How is the book going to develop? “Well,” he says, “I need to work out the recipes. And it will involve a celebrity chef who is also an elephant. A bit Jamie Oliver, a bit Gordon Ramsay. He’s a bit of an ego, but gets brought down to size.” Time is up. Kim-Joy looks nervous for the first time. She says she wants everyone to win.She was up at 1am (the jetlag) baking a biscuit medal for the winner. “It’s the worst thing I’ve ever decorated,” she insists, then disappears upstairs to deliberate, yelling down for Nabil to bring up her edible pens which she has stashed in her pen pot.Downstairs, the bakers and I catch up. It transpires that none of them knew this would be a Kim-Joy event: this wasn’t about the celeb factor. No, it was, is and always will be – for each of them – about the baking. And the day has not let them down. They have relished the fine decorating, the communal baking and being part of a team.Kim-Joy comes back down with books, pin badges and that biggest, kindest of smiles. She announces the winner. Lauren! That final procession of colourful cacti set on a bed of edible sediment seems to have been the deciding factor.The beautiful biscuit medal falls off its green ribbon instantly, which gives her permission to dig right in and eat it. Lauren, Tair and Rowan finally taste their wares.The table looks like a Technicolor feast. The photographer, Chris, can’t quite believe what they have accomplished. Kim-Joy has loved baking with the trio so much that Nabil suspects she may want to do this every weekend.There’s no doubt in my sugar-sated mind that all three are potential star bakers and each has a chance at a Paul Hollywood handshake. Get yourselves signed up for the TV show sharpish: the country’s cuppa’s getting cold.Baking with Kim-Joy is published by Quadrille on 22 August and is available for pre-order from bookshop"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7210d5be6cba2f652d143d0a0f87c219f6e983d1/0_88_7143_4287/master/7143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f559f4b53e55fe0bec0996da197d72e5","title":"celtic cluj champions league qualifier match report","story":"Neil Lennon bemoaned a “wasted” first half and some self-destructive defending after his Celtic side crashed out of the Champions League.Celtic were heading out on away goals before George Tucudean netted with the last kick of the ball to seal a 4-3 win for Cluj at Celtic Park and a 5-4 aggregate victory for the Romanian side. Celtic’s first two efforts on target came in the opening minutes of the second half and they came from a goal down to lead just after the hour mark through James Forrest and Odsonne Edouard. They had chances for a third but a handball under no pressure from Scott Brown allowed Billel Omrani to level from the spot and the goalscorer struck again four minutes after Ryan Christie’s quickfire response.The manager said: “The first half we were so passive, no tempo, I don’t know where that came from. We weren’t physical or aggressive enough and certainly didn’t work hard enough to stop crosses, second balls. We got a warning beforehand and didn’t stop the cross and then we do the exact same thing again. At half-time we got after them a little bit and got the right response but we shot ourselves in the foot with the goals we conceded. We had the lead twice and we have given it away.“The first goal you are thinking ‘right, wake-up call’, the second goal was an inidual mistake, the third goal we had plenty of defenders back but we just let the guy run off us and get the shot away and should have done better with the rebound. The fourth goal is academic because we are trying to throw everything at them to get an equaliser. We had enough chances to win the game but we wasted 45 minutes. If we had played anywhere near as well in the first half as we did second half, we would have been through.”Lennon explained why he dropped Boli Bolingoli and started the midfielder Callum McGregor at left-back.“Just to get Olivier Ntcham in midfield because he has been playing well and to have a couple of technicians on the field as well, and we know Boli has been a bit up and down with his form,” he said.Celtic now drop down to the Europa League play-offs where they will face AIK Stockholm or the Moldovan side Sheriff, with the Swedish team 2-1 up going into their home leg.“It’s hugely disappointing for us all,” Lennon said. “We are going to have to accept the criticism that comes our way whether it be from the media or our own supporters or elsewhere.“We have to regroup and make sure we qualify for the Europa League and make a strong claim in that.The Cluj head coach, Dan Petrescu, led Unirea Urziceni to a 4-1 win over Rangers at Ibrox in 2009 but declared this win a greater achievement.“I can’t believe it, it’s the second time I have played in the Champions League in Scotland and my team scored four goals,” he added.“I never expected that. I told my players they would have to play the game of their lives and told them it would be a miracle if Celtic didn’t score, because they have so much quality they can win against any team in Europe. It’s one of the best victories in my career.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a654f08d14be96cf17eaad4fc6bd402f8f87eb93/0_0_2674_1604/master/2674.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39c45334ce7f150460def7a46d0d3dde","title":"frank lampard chelsea spoil liverpool super cup party","story":"Chelsea manager’s rollercoaster start continues in city where Liverpool enjoyed their greatest Champions League winWeek one as a competitive Premier League manager and Frank Lampard feels he has already experienced the rollercoaster that is life in charge of Chelsea. Not quite. It has been a week without highs so far. The first all-English Uefa Super Cup final offers the remedy and a potential platform for what lies ahead at Stamford Bridge. Liverpool sense opportunity to prolong the new Chelsea manager’s uncomfortable ride.In Jürgen Klopp and his European champions, Lampard faces the highest calibre opponents of his short managerial career at Besiktas Park on Wednesday. Liverpool, who finished 25 points ahead of Maurizio Sarri’s side last season, are a team primed to exploit the gaps and defensive vulnerabilities that contributed to Chelsea’s 4-0 defeat in their Premier League opener at Manchester United on Sunday. The former Derby County manager insisted in Istanbul that the lessons have been learned.“We need to be much better at not committing errors which lead to chances on the counterattack,” he admitted “Because all good teams will make it difficult if you do that.” Liverpool especially.Klopp shares Lampard’s opinion that the scoreline at Old Trafford did not reflect the contest. He also responded with some bemusement to a Turkish journalist who ventured that Liverpool were clear favourites to beat the Europa League winners in a city synonymous with their Champions League successes.“Chelsea are strong, young, fresh and in a really exciting moment with Frank there as a club legend trying to make his own name as a manager,” he said. “Everyone at Chelsea is on their toes. This is the first trophy they can win together. That makes it really interesting. It is a really important game for us.”For Liverpool, their sixth appearance in a Super Cup final is a chance to breed the winning habit after lifting their first trophy under Klopp in Madrid in June and having lost on penalties to Manchester City in the Community Shield.For Chelsea and Lampard, who lost two Super Cup finals as a player with the club, the aims are more prosaic. A performance that does not invite doubts to fester over the club’s enforced reliance on young, homegrown talent would be a welcome reaction to Old Trafford. The bonus of a European trophy in his first competitive week as Chelsea manager would, Lampard believes, have a lasting effect on a new-look team seeking to close the gap on Liverpool and City this season.It was not merely the United result that has complicated Lampard’s first week. He left N’Golo Kanté on the bench at Old Trafford due to an injury-hit pre-season. The influential midfielder came on to try to limit the damage being inflicted only to pick up an ankle problem that makes him doubtful for this match. Added to the transfer ban, the loss of an experienced defender in David Luiz, the team’s most creative talent in Eden Hazard and injuries to Willian plus Antonio Rüdiger, and the Chelsea manager is having to adapt as rapidly to changing circumstances as his players.Lampard concedes: “This week is a good example of that rollercoaster, but I had a year at Derby last season where I had similar rollercoasters. I think that comes with managers’ jobs, particularly at clubs like Chelsea, Liverpool, Man City – all the bigger teams. But I’m very prepared for that. It has been a week where a lot has happened but I was ready for that and I certainly don’t fear that. There are challenges every day in this job.”Klopp’s problems are minor by comparison. He will be without his first-choice goalkeeper Alisson until September with a calf injury and Naby Keïta raised fresh concerns over his fitness on Tuesday when he limped out of the pre-match training session. Istanbul represents “a special place for every Liverpool supporter,” said Klopp but, 14 years on from their fifth Champions League triumph, it is the setting for the six-times winners to show their appetite for silverware is as great as ever.The Liverpool manager said: “We won one competition last year, that’s all, so how could we change our mentality? This team is built for being successful and this final is another chance for us. For me it was important we showed in the Man City game that we were there to win. With a bit of luck in that game we could have won it. It was obvious we wanted to win the trophy and now we have to prove that again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b8b2d8f1aa43c11c9ac7967e48b523e3d31f300/283_170_3179_1908/master/3179.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d07d6ab14d84d708135a679c53bc8f5c","title":"nigel adams derby county wayne rooney very crafty","story":"Derby County have been urged by Britain’s new sports minister to reconsider their “very crafty” decision to give Wayne Rooney the No 32 shirt in order to promote an online casino.Nigel Adams said he understood the criticism Derby had received from the Church of England and healthcare groups after securing a record deal with their shirt sponsor, the online casino 32Red, by signing Rooney on a reported £90,000-a-week deal and handing him 32 as his squad number. However, he stopped short of endorsing the calls from a growing number of healthcare professionals who have called on the government to ban gambling sponsorship in sport.“I totally understand the concerns,” said Adams. “The No 32 shirt is a very crafty move by Derby. I would ask them to look within themselves and think about the impact that problem gambling can have on some in society, particularly vulnerable people and youngsters. They have got a social responsibility to be mature and grown up.”Adams warned that if any of the 10 Premier League and 16 Championship clubs who have betting firms as their main sponsors crossed the line they could expect action from the Football Association. “Clubs need to be very conscious of that link with gambling,” Adams said. “It did raise an eyebrow when I saw the No 32 on Wayne Rooney’s shirt.“I would urge the clubs to abide by not just the rules but the spirit of what the Gambling Commission and the FA have laid down. And if they break those rules then they shouldn’t be surprised if there is further action. We have to make sure we look after those who are vulnerable.”While 32Red will not appear on any replica children’s kits as it is banned by regulations, they are able to have Rooney’s name and No 32 printed on the back of their shirt. The betting company has said their agreement “complies with FA regulations”.Adams also said the government was concerned that Bolton and Bury appeared to be on the brink of collapse and said he would be meeting the Football Association to discuss how to help the clubs out of the mess they were in.Last week a proposed takeover at Bolton fell through after a court order forced the club’s joint administrator to suspend the sale. Meanwhile Bury – who on Tuesday had their fourth game of the season, against Gillingham on Saturday, postponed by the Football League – have been given a two-week deadline to save their League One status.“In Bolton and Bury, that part of Lancashire, football is like a religion so it’s not acceptable,” said Adams, who said he would be meeting the FA shortly. “It is incredibly sad that Bury fans have been denied football at the start of the season. And it is incredibly difficult for the clubs that were meant to be playing them as well. But the FA have to put their foot down. They have to make sure that clubs are financially stable and they can pay their creditors. So it is a very tough call for the FA. But for a government it causes us concern that these clubs are in this mess.”Adams, who recently became the third sports minister in nine months following Tracey Crouch, who resigned over the government’s refusal to speed up plans to curb controversial fixed-odds betting terminals, and Mims Davies, who was moved to the department of work and pensions, said that he wanted to do more to tackle discrimination and boost participation levels in schools.“Any form of discrimination is unacceptable in sport or in society,” he added. “And I know, from personal experience, how sport can change your life and make you feel more inclusive when you’ve not necessarily grown up in a family with privilege. That’s why sport in school is important. Participation is a key driver for me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56402daa70bb624ff67b1ff07c868c7ac4510552/0_324_5042_3025/master/5042.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56857f7db65f15e08485d419c4c76b32","title":"men said we were immoral aphrodisiacs challenging taboos nigeria","story":"Nigeria’s traditional ‘Kayan Mata’ recipes have grown into a booming industry that’s empowering women to be more open about sexWhen Amra Mansur was working as a makeup artist in Abuja, while she studied law, she would overhear conversations between would-be brides and older relatives about how to please their men in the bedroom.The older, mostly female relatives would recite aphrodisiac recipes that involved ingredients like fenugreek, dates, honey, watermelon and the fruit silky kola.After finishing her studies, Mansur decided she didn’t want to be a lawyer, and the bridal makeup industry was getting too crowded. “I needed to e into something new, and then I thought – why not Kayan Mata?”“Kayan Mata” refers to the aphrodisiacs made of herbs, roots, spices, seeds and fruit that have been used for centuries by women from northern Nigeria. Though they were originally used to prepare brides for marriage, to ensure a healthy sex life, the aphrodisiacs are becoming increasingly popular among all women across the country. Recipes are passed down from generation to generation.“All my ingredients are natural. Honey is one of the ingredients. We have spices like cinnamon, cardamom, mustard seeds, chilli peppers, dates and sugarcane. We have some herbs, roots, powders we get in Nigeria, especially around Zamfara, Gusau and Sokoto,” she says. “These herbs have to come in their natural leafy form, so we see what we are buying.”Not only is Kayan Mata becoming a thriving business, it is challenging the taboos around sex and marriage, and women’s role in society.Many northern women are expected to fulfil the conservative roles of wife and mother. “The image we have is not to be sexual tigresses – we are supposed to be demure,” says journalist Fatima Umar. Speaking about sex openly is not expected of women.“At first, I thought this is going to be so controversial because even though we northern women take it, I wasn’t married at the time,” says Mansur, who added her own family recipes to those gathered during her time making up brides, before opening her business. “It was a taboo for someone who isn’t married to be selling Kayan Mata openly. Even when you are married and selling Kayan Mata, there is this stigma that is attached to it.”Umar remembers the backlash she faced after airing a four-part radio programme she produced and presented.“The backlash was from men who said we were being immoral by giving women a platform to talk about sexuality,” she says. In two of the episodes, women talked about being married to a man who didn’t satisfy them. “To hear a Hausa woman in rural Kano say these things – we thought it was ground-breaking journalism, but it became such an issue that I had to switch off my phone because I was getting all sorts of talk that this is an abomination.”Beyond the backlash, Umar is excited and fascinated by the new wave of Kayan Mata and how it is opening conversations around female pleasure within communities and social groups. “Hopefully in the next 10 to 15 years, we will see more open public conversations.”One myth that needs to be debunked is the mysticism around Kayan Mata that compares it to love potions and charms used by women to bewitch husbands or lure them away from their wives.“Kayan Mata is sex food. That’s what I call them,” says Mansu. “You take this food and they make you wet and sweet. That is just their aim, not to make you bewitch your husband. If you are like that in bed and then he enjoys you, if he does any nice thing afterwards, then that is on him.”Social media platforms like Instagram have been crucial to increasing the popularity of these local aphrodisiacs, giving room for more open conversations around sex and pleasure as well as financially empowering many northern women.Although it’s difficult to put a value on the Kayan Mata market, Umar says: “It is definitely empowering women as they are employing people whom they pay well. There are people back home who source the herbs and have been able to get better opportunities for themselves and families because of this boom.”Hauwa Sule Yaro was three years into running her business when her 17-year-old daughter convinced her to open an Instagram page. Within weeks she says orders started flooding in from places like the US, UK, Istanbul, Cyprus and Dubai. However, she explains that coming from a conservative community still means that she isn’t permitted to discuss sex explicitly on her social media.“A lot of people think talking about sex in public is not a good thing in Nigeria. People look at you as someone who is wayward or irresponsible, so people hide a lot when it comes to sex or using aphrodisiac products.”Much of the history around the use of Kayan Mata centres around men as the principal recipients of sexual pleasure, a myth Mansur is keen to bust.“When I started, all the women were like, ‘Give me something that is going to drive my husband crazy! Give me something that he will enjoy.’ And then they say, ‘I don’t care if I have fun, as long as he does.’”As these requests continued, she believed that women needed a change in mindset and decided to teach them about embracing their own sexual pleasure.“I am so proud of myself because now, I have women who actually enjoy having sex. I have women who have had orgasms and climax because a lot of women didn’t know what orgasms were.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7249d976cdd22d8cd0c55633702c1086737d15d/0_161_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9eeaf568043bcf5df7a791aa874b9783","title":"joy despair and determination photographs from kibera","story":"Despite its poverty, Kibera is a vibrant place where people survive in testing conditions, both physical and mental.

We’re already paying the highest ticket prices in Europe to travel on overcrowded and understaffed trains.”The TUC said private train operators paid out £200m in idends to their shareholders in 2017-18 and received £3.8bn in public subsidy. O’Grady said: “It’s time to take the railways back into public hands. Every single penny from every single fare should be invested into our railways.“RPIIn 2013, the retail prices index (RPI) lost its status as a national statistic, as the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the way it calculated prices was likely to overstate the rate of inflation. The treatment of housing costs is also a problem, as RPI uses a combination of mortgage interest payments and house prices as a proxy for housing depreciation. In a period of rapidly rising house prices, inflation accelerates ahead of a basket of goods and services bought by most consumers.CPIAn internationally recognised calculation of inflation, it monitors the rising cost of goods and services according to an agreed formula that statisticians believe is more reliable and robust than that used with RPI. However, CPI also has its detractors because it excludes all housing costs.CPIHThe ONS has included housing costs in its CPI calculation to make CPIH its preferred method of calculating rising prices. It uses rents as a proxy for housing costs. In recent years rents have fallen, especially in London, dragging down the CPIH rate below CPI. But neither the Bank of England nor the Treasury has recognised CPIH as a the standardised measure, leaving it to be largely ignored outside the ONS.\u0026nbspLabour said passengers were “paying more for less” and promised to take the railway back into state ownership as franchises expired.Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said: “It is indefensible and intolerable that many fares may, once again, rise faster than inflation.”But the government defended the planned increase. The rail minister, Chris Heaton-Harris, said: “It’s tempting to suggest fares should never rise. However, the truth is that if we stop investing in our railway then we will never see it improved.”The government has tried to turn the spotlight from rail fares by announcing the award of the West Coast Partnership to a First Group-led consortium with Trenitalia, which will replace Virgin from December. The contract award, which could include the introduction of HS2 high-speed train services from 2026 if the project survives, remains controversial, with the incumbent Stagecoach-Virgin suing the government after being barred from bidding for the franchise again.Bruce Williamson, from the campaign group Railfuture, warned: “It might be that we’ve now reached the point where we cannot simply put fares up and expect passengers to take the hit. They will just give up and refuse to pay. They will either find another job or another form of transport.”The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents private train operators and Network Rail, said 98p in every £1 taken in fares was put back into running the railway. Robert Nisbet, an RDG director, said: “No one wants to pay more to get to work but, by holding rises down to no more than inflation, government is ensuring that money from fares continues to cover almost all of the day-to-day costs of running rail services.”News of the increase comes after a year in which the structure and functioning of the railways has been called into question. Major commuter routes have largely recovered from the chaos of the 2018 summer timetable change, when there were thousands of cancellations and the railway recorded its worst punctuality performance in 18 years, but other problems have persisted.Campaigners and unions staged protests against the fare increases on Wednesday at stations around Britain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c346c8bd58897255604daf862a97bb393f254ddb/0_0_5332_3200/master/5332.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18965b16bdadb82a6e739b9a08f2b62f","title":"virgin price rise contract cancel fee","story":"Two days later, my internet failed.

Most people in this country want to see us leave in a smooth and orderly fashion that will not disrupt lives, cost jobs or diminish living standards, whether they voted leave or remain in 2016. No deal would be a betrayal of the 2016 referendum result. It must not happen.”In an apparent swipe at Cummings, he said: “The unelected people who pull the strings of this government know that this is a demand the EU cannot, and will not, accede to. Not just because they will be stubborn in their defence of the single market (although they will), but because the fragility of their own coalition of 27 means any attempt on their side to reopen the package would see their unity collapse. They will not take that chance and the smart people in Whitehall know it.”A senior Downing Street source said: “Philip Hammond actively undermined the government’s negotiating position by frustrating and obstructing preparation to leave the EU. Everyone knows that the ex-chancellor’s real objective was to cancel the referendum result.”The former chancellor is leading a group of 20 Tories, including seven former cabinet ministers, who have written to Johnson accusing him of setting the bar too high in negotiations with the EU to have a hope of getting changes to a deal.Signed by Greg Clark, David Gauke, Rory Stewart and others, the letter says: “We are alarmed by the ‘red lines’ you have drawn which, on the face of it, appear to eliminate the chance of reaching agreement with the EU”.The intervention is a sign that Tories opposed to a no-deal Brexit are prepared to vote with opposition parties to prevent Johnson taking the UK out of the EU on 31 October without a deal.At the same time, John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, vowed at an Edinburgh festival fringe event to fight attempts to sideline parliament “with every breath in my body”. He said he would insist on the right of parliament to continue to sit and debate.Cummings, the architect of the Vote Leave campaign, has told staff in No 10 that the rebels are too late to stop a no-deal Brexit, as the prime minister could simply push it through on 31 October and hold an election afterwards.However, his opponents are incensed by the idea that parliament could be sidelined and have been working over the summer on ways to prevent that happening. These include a confidence vote to replace Johnson as prime minister with a temporary government or passing a law to force him to extend article 50.Johnson insists that he wants a deal with the EU but only one that does not include the “undemocratic backstop” – the insurance mechanism to stop a hard border on the island of Ireland that Brussels says must be a part of the deal.Since taking office, the prime minster has ramped up preparations for leaving without a deal in a move to convince the EU he is serious about leaving on 31 October regardless of whether the UK has a withdrawal agreement in place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a64e8aa7258520bc7febbe98e2ac5010b962e1f0/0_125_5550_3329/master/5550.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7e46ac194fe3375bdf3cff83f80ffd6","title":"rps 2019 science photographer of the year shortlist","story":"The shortlist for the Royal Photographic Society’s science photographer of the year competition will be exhibited at the Science Museum in London from 7 October until 5 January.

In the first he is belting out the national anthem just before his senior Test debut last Sunday while in the second he is doing the same, four years earlier, at the Junior World Cup in Italy. As fate would have it, Ellis Genge is standing next to him in both and Ludlam accompanied the images with caption: “4 years apart. Aint nothing changed.”It resonates because as Ludlam is only too aware, much has changed in the intervening period. Twelve months ago he was fighting for his career, told by Northampton that he was unlikely to feature in their future plans. Twelve weeks ago he was not due to be part of the England squad to face the Barbarians, only to be added because Teimana Harrison was called away to the birth of his child. Even 12 days ago Ludlam would have featured in few predicted World Cup squads and Eddie Jones is not overstating the flanker’s emergence when he says he came from nowhere.Ludlam has something immediately likeable about him and the video of him singing the national anthem on Sunday has gone viral – as has one of his father doing likewise in the crowd. Underneath the surface, however, there is a steely determination, demonstrated when Chris Boyd arrived at Northampton last summer. Injuries and back-row competition had hindered Ludlam’s development since the 2015 Junior World Cup, where he was named England’s player of the tournament on their run to the final – so much so that he was considering his options and contemplating a move abroad.“This time last year was almost one last shot at it for me, trying to fight for another club contract,” says Ludlam, who as a junior was cut from the Saints academy before forcing his way back in. “Chris Boyd said to me that he could give me an opportunity but he didn’t really see how I fitted into his plans. It’s not easy as a young player. I picked up injuries at the wrong time, which doesn’t help. It’s hard to get into a rhythm and break through.“I couldn’t think of anything I wanted to do other than play rugby. It crossed my mind: what am I going to do post-rugby? I thought that part of last year was trying to play my way into a good highlights reel to get a gig at probably not such a big club or potentially abroad.”Ludlam benefited in part from James Haskell’s injury problems and strung together a series of strong performances in Northampton’s run to the Premiership play-offs. He has played at openside flanker more often than not but Jones sees him primarily as a No 6, which is where he made an impressive debut against Wales – starting with a thumping tackle on Ross Moriarty and continuing in the same vein.“He is uncomplicated, he just wants to be a good rugby player, he wants to work hard,” said Jones. “To me he’s one of those old-fashioned sixes that just does the job. He carries hard, tackles hard, cleans out hard – ‘What do you want me to do, coach, I’ll do it. What does the team need?’ He’s one of those boys. They’re such valuable players.”Ludlam may have been a surprise inclusion but in many ways he exemplifies England’s World Cup squad as one of the young thrusters Jones has turned to and as one of a number of players with multicultural heritage. Ludlam’s father, Arron, has Palestinian and Egyptian roots, his mother, Dorinda, a Guyanese background, and he is evidently proud of his ancestry, equally so of representing England – as his singing would suggest.“Seeing my dad in the crowd gave me goosebumps, gave that extra little bit of something,” he says. “To see him belting it out made me want to sing it that little bit louder.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/324bf36b233e378b3d560490dcd94ce0cad5bd29/0_112_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23eb5291f4a18ef863ac67d5a7a55076","title":"ashes 2019 england v australia second test day one live","story":"I have been off round the ground again to curate some Top Quality Online Content™ for you.

But Waller-Bridge, who is taking the play into the West End for her final run in the role, had spent years honing her craft. Fleabag was the fruit of a long-running short-play night she established in 2007 with her writing partner Vicky Jones. It shared the name of the theatre company, DryWrite, which they still co-run. The pair cut their teeth there without any critics to clock it. The backstory to their success has, so far, gone untold.At the time, London had quite a few similar nights, all breeding grounds for emerging talent. But DryWrite’s was different – “the least formal, the most rough round the edges and the most punky”, remembers playwright Phil Porter. They were as much about socialising as scriptwriting, and they certainly weren’t showcases. With no industry invites, people made work for their peers – mostly for the hell of it. “It felt like you were part of this great gang,” says The Pass writer John Donnelly. “They felt like the coolest nights in town.”DryWrite started off at the George Tavern in Shadwell, a rundown old boozer (since renovated). The stairs were rickety, the ceiling threatened collapse and, on one occasion, artists arrived to find a dead owl on the stage.“It was like a Who’s Who of the great and the good of British theatre today,” says playwright Tim Price. You might find shorts by James Graham, Ella Hickson, Lucy Kirkwood or Jack Thorne being performed by Arthur Darvill, Michelle Terry or Daniel Rigby – and, of course, Waller-Bridge herself.Not that you’d know. DryWrite’s distinguishing feature was anonymity, partly allowing Waller-Bridge to write undercover. “For a community of people all desperately trying to make a name for themselves, that was an interesting provocation,” Price reckons. It gave writers freedom to take genuine risks, from saying the unsayable to toying with form.What really set DryWrite apart, however, was that it started to set writers tasks. They weren’t scratch nights, or rapid responses to a subject or theme. The starting points were more active and open-ended: playwriting challenges. For instance, “Funny, Not Funny?” charged writers with toeing the tightrope of taste or tragedy. At what point, it wondered, would the laughter dry up? “What’s in My Box?” was an exercise in intrigue, giving characters containers they couldn’t open – safes, coffins, inboxes, flight recorders. “Guilty?” took horrific real-life crimes – stolen newborns, sex slavery – and had culprits attempt to justify their actions. Other challenges asked writers to pen lyrics that would be set to song and to cook up extended, extravagant fight sequences.Most nights involved audience interaction. One secret mission set writers out to solicit a heckle, birthing the first incarnation of Fleabag as Waller-Bridge wrote about a woman dumping her boyfriend for someone who was simply much better in bed. Another split the audience according to gender. “The provocation was immediately dangerous,” says Donnelly. “What do I with this? Do I lean into it or do I back away? It gave you a genuine problem.”Price remembers: “Vicky and Phoebe would spend days and days honing a stimulus for their writers.” “They wrestled with ways to create maximum drama.” That put writers to the test. How do you control an audience’s laughter? How do you hook them in or rile them up? DryWrite was always more interested in effect than expression, encouraging dramatists to do something to their audience: shock them, surprise them, elicit a response.“It was entirely about entertaining the people in the room,” Donnelly says. “Most of the stuff was pretty ropey, but occasionally something magic would happen.” Someone would hit a rich theatrical seam – and scratchy memories of the time seem to reflect that. People recall images, rather than entire scripts: Darvill with his hand stuck in a vase, reaching for a ringing phone, or Terry winning a crowd round as a grieving mother who had murdered someone else’s child. Fighting nuns. Co-workers scrapping with shredders and staplers. A family argument, except everyone’s dressed as animals. “Seeing a penguin screaming at a donkey, that was special,” says Price with a chuckle.Inevitably, it grew competitive, and giddiness was par for the course. Jonjo O’Neill remembers “a champagne feeling – more cava, I suppose. It was a very bubbly atmosphere. There was always a sense of being close to corpsing.” The point, he says, is that people were writing and playing for each other, not to impress industry types or bag a commission. “It was all very un-Rada, the opposite of taking yourself seriously in a Chekhov. There was a real sense of community – like a secret theatre club.”At the heart of that were Waller-Bridge and Jones – infectious personalities who set the evening’s tone. If the duo defined DryWrite’s spirit, the club left its mark on them. Waller-Bridge’s writing still bears its hallmarks – teetering on the edge of taste and relishing moral ambivalence. You could trace Fleabag’s direct address back there, or Killing Eve’s delight in overblown action sequences. Two protagonists that do unconscionable things and retain our sympathies regardless? That’s pure DryWrite."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1f1d84ab5ed8ee663e0458f28577302910a75b8/0_0_3199_1919/master/3199.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e241f6efb5ec09d91d01a8a6d07365f2","title":"teen smart fridge twitter grounded","story":"Fifteen-year-old resorts to drastic measures after action taken ‘so I’d pay more attention to my surroundings’A resourceful teenager has taken the rise of increasingly powerful smart home devices to its logical conclusion – tweeting from her family’s smart fridge after her mother confiscated her phone.The 15-year-old Ariana Grande fan known only as “Dorothy” was barred from using her phone but managed to find a number of innovative ways to reach her thousands of followers – a handheld Nintendo device, a Wii U gaming console, and finally, her family’s LG Smart Refrigerator.Dorothy, who declined to share her last name, says her mother disciplined her two weeks ago after she got too distracted while cooking and caused a fire.“She took all my tech so I’d pay more attention to my surroundings,” said the teen, who messaged the  from her cousin’s iPad because she was still facing a tech ban. “I felt mortified! I was worried because I’ve been bored all summer and Twitter passes the time for me.”The user was worried about losing her “mutuals” – accounts she follows that follow her back – and devised other ways to get tweets out. Her self-described “fan account” is used primarily to send tweets about Ariana Grande.Dorothy then sent a tweet saying: “my mom took my phone and my nintendo ds so i have no choice but to use my wii … thank u all for the support and love.” The tweet’s source label, which indicates the device from which a tweet was sent, confirmed that the tweet came from a Wii U.Finally, after her mother apparently took her Wii U away as well, she sent a tweet from her LG Smart refrigerator: “I’m talking to my fridge what the heck,” she said.LG did not respond to request for comment, but its website confirms the refrigerator does have social media capabilities, and the tweet source confirms it was sent from the device.After the saga went viral, with more than 12,000 retweets, Twitter itself stepped in and joined the calls for Dorothy to be returned to the internet, tweeting #FreeDorothy.Dorothy did not answer questions regarding how long she will be grounded. “I may be late to reply, as it is difficult to find something to use Twitter,” she told the ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/833edc16435de60d406f1a7367fc5f25b02be4c9/0_205_6016_3608/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2eec257a2b3ea255833e8a11875b9221","title":"mix it up the mixologists guide to drinking rum","story":"Still drinking gin? Update your drinking habits with tips from the experts on enjoying rum’s craft revivalWhile gin has had a dramatic rise in popularity over the past five years, bartenders have been quietly getting excited about rum. It offers huge cocktail variety, depending on the style from the unaged white variety to those aged in the tropics, it’s as complex and nuanced as any other spirit. I spoke to some top mixologists about their favourite cocktails.Jack Wallis and Chris Tanner at the VaultRum cocktails range from the super-simple to concoctions worthy of Michelin stars. Jack Wallis, operations manager at the Vault in Soho, is proud of the simplicity of their Captain’s Blood – a twist on a daiquiri, made with rum, fresh lime, sugar syrup and bitters that’s perfect to serve at home. For something a little more complex, Chris Tanner, also of the Vault, makes a version of Planter’s Punch with orange, pineapple, lime juice, grenadine, sugar syrup and Lugger Rum. Unlike some varieties, Lugger Rum is not dominated by vanilla, aiming instead to deliver a full profile of spices, including nutmeg, orange peel and cloves.Liam Cotter of Heads, Hearts and TailsBarman Liam Cotter, of events and consultancy firm Heads, Hearts and Tails, warns not to take shortcuts in rum-based cocktails: “Inexperienced bartenders may swap out a quality rum with an inferior one and wonder why their grog isn’t quite the same.” Cotter’s all-time favourite cocktail is a Jungle Bird not the original 1970s version, created in the Kuala Lumpur Hilton, but the reimagined New York classic, created by way of Giuseppe Gonzales (formerly of New York’s Suffolk Arms and long-standing patron of Milk \u0026amp Honey). He reworked it to become infinitely more balanced and appealing to a refined contemporary palate. It’s part all-night-fun negroni, part complex bitter daiquiri. He thinks this would be great with Lugger Rum.He also has a soft spot for something more straightforward: “There is something lovely about a simple rum and coke.”Mia Johansson at SwiftLondon bar Swift is known for its elegant and inventive cocktails, and one of managing partner Mia Johansson’s favourites is a Praline Flip. First, they make their own hazelnut orgeat – by heating the nuts in water, cooling and re-blending them – then combine with Angostura bitters, egg, Guinness and spiced rum. Their second cocktail is a little less complicated, but still one I wouldn’t try at home. It’s an espresso martini using Mr Black cold-brew coffee liqueur, coffee, vodka, rich demerara sugar and spiced rum.Thom Solberg at Black RockBlack Rock’s bar manager Thom Solberg loves a Mai Tai. Although this award-winning Shoreditch bar primarily focuses on whisky, it also works with rum. Solberg’s take on his retro favourite uses three rums – Jamaican, Lugger spiced and over-proof – along with triple sec and lime juice. All it needs is shaking up, pouring over ice and a garnish of orange and mint. He says spiced rum goes well with anything apple-y, and that a particular favourite rum modifier is pomegranate molasses. He incorporates this mix into a rum punch alongside dry cider, lime, allspice dram and a little vanilla syrup, garnished with cinnamon, nutmeg and apple slices.Kurt Maitland, cocktail authorKurt Maitland, author of Drink, can recommend something simple and something more showy. A Devil’s Kiss won’t tax you: shake up equal parts coffee liqueur, Grand Marnier and Lugger Rum with ice and strain into small glasses.The Kama’aina is a completely different kettle of fish, however. It starts with ginger syrup, almond paste and pimento liqueur, stirred to create a #9. Next add Rhum agricole, Lugger Rum, guava nectar, real cream of coconut, and fresh lime then shake with crushed ice and strain into a tiki glass, adding Angostura bitters and an orange blossom garnish at the end. Maitland describes a Devil’s Kiss as like an aperitif at home before the main drama of a complicated Kama’aina in a specialist bar. The former can easily be made in quantity for parties and the spiced rum balances beautifully with the bitter coffee and sweet Grand Marnier.Featuring fruit, spice and a genuinely fiery twist – careful with those matchesLugger rum 50mlStrawberry and lime syrup 20ml*Angostura bitters, 2 dashesWest country cider 30mlSprig of rosemarySpiced powder**MatchesStrawSugar 50gStrawberries x10Peeled lime skins (x2 whole limes)Juice of 1 whole limeIn a bowl, muddle all ingredients and leave for 10-30 minutes in fridge, then strain through a sieve.Mix equal parts of icing sugar, cinnamon powder and nutmeg powder.Lugger Rum is a Caribbean rum aged in Devon, featuring sophisticated notes of orange peel, nutmeg, cloves and vanilla.

The cottage is surrounded by National Trust land, with views out to the Isle of Skye and the Applecross peninsula. It’s also close to the picturesque palm tree-peppered seaside village of Plockton, with its lively traditional pubs and galleries. The Kyle Line, which runs between Inverness and Kyle of Lochalsh, is among the most scenic rail journeys in the country.

Workers shovelling snow from the line in winter would traditionally stay in these low-slung stone huts at the end of their shift. Now upgraded for high-spec, studio-style, open-plan living, the first hut has exposed brickwork and beams, under-floor heating, slate floors, reclaimed teak furniture, an L-shaped leather sofa and a woodburner. The other hut is also open-plan with a mezzanine bedroom under the sloping eaves.

Burke takes a warts and all look at the ever more ugly beauty industryKathy Burke, the actor and self-described “lifelong member of the non-pretty working classes”, investigating the concept of beauty in the new Channel 4 series Kathy Burke’s All Woman, is endlessly quotable. Not in a family newspaper, alas, but let’s just say that a number of summations issue forth that are refreshing and bracingly succinct. Her response to the reverential quotation of Lucian Freud by Sue Tilley, one of his most famous muses – “He used to say that libraries should be renamed beauty parlours because what you learned made you beautiful” – is worth the price of admission alone. It could be valuably deployed in response to much of what you hear artists, especially the extra-libidinous kind, say.Not that Burke is a one-trick presenting pony. Although she has surely been chosen as a straight-talking outsider to the beauty industry and to the modern, Instagrammed pressures accreting around younger generations, it is her concerned “nana side” (as she puts it) that draws out the fears of the young people she interviews.The picture they paint is not pretty. Megan Barton-Hanson talks through the £40,000 worth of procedures that turned her into the Love Island babe-standard we have come to know, over a picture of her as a lovely-looking pre-surgery girl. You either use filters and editing apps online, she explains, or you do it in real life. The targeted ads on social media for surgery effectively tell you so. It is perhaps why she didn’t expect the vilification she experienced from the public and the media when she appeared on the show for “daring” to transform her looks.What if it doesn’t make her feel better, wonders Burke gently.There is a pause. “I really can’t imagine what I’ll do,” says Laura.You cannot help but want to mourn this sprawling loss. Never, perhaps, has there been a time when youth is more wasted on the young.An interview with the 26-year-old rapper Nadia Rose, who seems to have more successfully resisted the external pressures of her generation and her industry, gives you back some hope, but still has tales of friends driven almost to suicide by their peers. “The world needs to change,” she says. “It feels very unbalanced right now. If you are a person – you’re beautiful. Done.”It was a much-needed shot of cheer that highlighted the great weakness of Kathy Burke’s All Woman, which was the lack of any sense of the systemic nature of the problem. There was no real follow-through on any of the many points raised. Nothing was pushed: no dots were joined. Burke didn’t examine the inconsistency, for example, of Barton-Hanson’s claim: “My thing is, I don’t want young girls growing up with unrealistic images like I did,” in the midst of hours-long preparation involving dressers and hair and makeup artists for her appearance at the Pride of Britain awards. How had Rose managed to resist what her peers had not?The problem with keeping to inidual case studies is that you are hampered by not wanting – of course – to hurt anyone’s feelings or be seen to blame them personally. But somewhere, somehow you need to introduce a wider view – talk to someone about who and what is being served by keeping women uncertain about their looks, by defining beauty so narrowly and requiring its acquisition and maintenance to be such an effort. Why does beauty still have such power, and is still so lucrative? If, as Burke claims in passing, it is a knock-on effect of when beauty was the only currency women had, why does it still persist so strongly in the world of (we are told) increasing opportunity? Overall, while Burke herself was the tonic she always is, the show’s conflation of so many issues – and the scattershot approach to illuminating and answering them – was a frustratingly incoherent response to a world shown to be even uglier than we suspected."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c0e7cd34e4b48f9024bd6affb1a07ebe4561d83/0_197_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3dd1e9ce9b40fa7884b4e2e39520bf6","title":"ceo worker pay gap","story":"Chief executives at the US’s top companies took home $17.2m in pay last year – 278 times the salary of their average worker.The analysis comes as some of the US’s richest businessmen have publicly worried about growing income inequality.This year, Ray Dalio, billionaire founder of Bridgewater, the world’s biggest hedge fund, warned that the gap between rich and poor in the US was becoming a “national emergency”. JP Morgan’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, has called for a “Marshall plan” to address a “systemic problem” that had left half of society “severely disadvantaged”.Lawrence Mishel, EPI distinguished fellow, said there was a direct correlation between the outsized pay gains made by CEOs and the stagnant wages of their workforce given that there was little evidence linking the turbocharged growth in their wages and the performance of their companies.“You could cut CEO pay in half and the economy would not be any different,” he said.Average CEO pay peaked at $21.5m (in 2018 dollars) in 2000, the height of the late-1990s tech-driven stock market bubble, and it fell after the bubble burst. It had recovered again by 2007 only to dip again in 2008 and 2009 as the last recession took hold. Their compensation has been growing steadily ever since.Over the long term, the gap between the average worker at one of the US’s top companies and their boss has widened dramatically. In 1965, the average CEO earned 20 times as much as the average worker at one of the US’s top 350 companies. By 1978, the ratio was 30-1. By 1991, it was 121-1.While some shareholders and corporate governance groups have targeted executives at companies they believe are overpaid, Mishel said the easiest way to address the gap was to substantially increase taxes on top earners.“It’s hard to do this one CEO at a time,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d331f69d859cba46702b7ed15ccee21efee486e9/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b0dd22463b8559f5ec6733f5bf8bac9","title":"french politician accused of doctoring photo of alpine climb","story":"A French politician has hit back at claims he changed the angle in a photograph to make the his ascent of an icy summit in the Alps seem more perilous.Éric Woerth, a senior right-of-centre MP, insisted the picture he tweeted of his climb up the Aiguille d’Argentiere was genuine and said he was astonished French media had judged mocking of him on social media newsworthy.One tweeter discovered two people in the background who appeared to be walking upright at a 90 degree angle from the snow covered mountain.Others pointed out that the zip of Woeth’s jacket was at a strange angle if he was climbing upwards.Woerth held two ministerial posts when Nicolas Sarkozy was the president and is currently president of the Finance Commission in the French national assembly.When Woerth challenged Twitter users to contact the mountain guide who had taken the photo, the social network exploded. “I’m the glacier and I can confirm that Mr Woerth climbed me,” wrote one.

Haigh Allen, a magistrate from Huddersfield, wrote: “Gents … The meeting took place at 1 o’clock. Hunt in the chair with 16 flags and 7 caps of Liberty hoisted up amongst upwards of 60,000 people, the cavalry has just broke in upon them, the flags are taken, Hunt and his party secured, several lives are lost and a number wounded.

Photograph: Ben StansallAFPGetty ImagesGreta Thunberg, the 16-year-old climate activist, climbed nimbly aboard the Malizia II, the racing yacht that will set sail on Wednesday afternoon whenever the wind is right and take her across the Atlantic to New York. The journey is expected to take two weeks. The sea is likely to be rough at times.Thunberg is making this epic voyage because she has been invited to participate at the United Nations climate talks in September, and she refuses to fly because aviation has such an enormous carbon footprint. And so, on a Tuesday morning, under grey skies, here she was, aboard a sleek racing machine that had made many journeys across the ocean, but never with a 16-year-old novice. The boat was fitted with solar panels to power its equipment. The conditions inside were spartan: There is no toilet nor much light in the cabin, so she will have to read by headlamp. In a particularly acute challenge for a teenager with 871,000 Twitter followers, she will not have much access to the internet.Thunberg has never done anything like this before. She said she was looking forward to being without the familiar luxuries, to “being so limited”. She acknowledged being a bit nervous. “Whether its seasickness or homesickness or just anxiety or I don’t know,” she said. “I don’t know how tough this journey will be.”Also, she said, she will really miss her two dogs. She has packed many books (she is currently reading Quiet, a book about introverts, like her) eight writing journals, some partly filled and boxes of freeze-dried vegan meals (Thunberg stopped eating meat a few years ago, because of the emissions associated with animal protein).There is a satellite phone on board, so she plans to send some pictures and text messages from her voyage to friends who will upload them on her social media accounts. Going to the toilet will mean going to the back of the boat with a bucket. Her drinking water will come from a tiny desalination machine that treats seawater.“By doing this it also shows how impossible it is today to live sustainable,” she said. “That, in order to travel with zero emissions, that we have to sail like this across the Atlantic Ocean.”  School strikesThe voyage of the Malizia II is the latest stage in an epic journey that Thunberg has been on for the last few years. As a child, doctors told her she had Asperger syndrome. In early adolescence she battled severe depression, so much so that she stopped eating for a while and stopped growing.Recovery came slowly, and only after finding a sense of purpose. “I’ve had my fair share of depressions, alienation, anxiety and disorders,” she wrote in a recent Facebook post. “But without my diagnosis, I would never have started school striking. Because then I would have been like everyone else.”Her weekly school strikes began in Stockholm, her home city, a year ago. They sparked a global youth movement to demand climate action and then turned her into something of a modern-day Cassandra, a target of praise and pointed attacks. In March came a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize. António Guterres, the UN secretary-general, said he trusted young activists like her to “push societies to save our planet”. This week, Steve Milloy, a former member of the Trump transition team, described her on Twitter as “the ignorant teenage climate puppet”.Thunberg on Tuesday shrugged off the attacks. “They are doing everything they can to switch the focus from the climate crisis to me,” she said. “That is what you have to expect when you talk about these things.”  Thunberg is taking the year off school. She is scheduled to attend the UN climate summit talks next month, speaking at a youth summit on September 21st and then at the main meeting on September 23rd. She also plans to travel to Chile for the next round of UN-sponsored climate talks December.Both meetings are to be attended by world leaders, all of whom have agreed, under the Paris climate accord, to keep global temperatures from rising to levels that would produce climate catastrophes. Still, global emissions continue to grow, and the world as a whole is not on track to meet the targets of the Paris agreement.“This is a big opportunity for those world leaders who say they’ve been listening to us to actually show that they’ve been listening to us, to actually prove that,” Thunberg said. Rain and darknessThe voyage has drawn enormous media attention. Thunberg gave four face-to-face interviews Tuesday, spoke to other reporters on the phone in between, and greeted a few youth strikers who had come to Plymouth from elsewhere in Britain before heading into an emergency training session.There were many handlers and helpers. And there was Greta swag. One woman moving chairs for her well-wishers wore a sweatshirt that hollered, “Be Like Greta”. Thunberg, for her part, wore a red hoodie and lilac sweatpants with a hole at the knee.Boris Hermann, the 38-year-old German captain, said he had crossed the Atlantic many times. In fact, he has sailed around the world in this yacht, finding routes where the wind was in his back, steering it through rain and darkness. This trip, though, would be different. “I feel a special responsibility also because it’s an important trip for Greta and we promised to bring her over,” he said. “I admire her leadership.” The captain said he would try to take a southerly route to the United States to avoid the strongest headwinds, to find what he called the “softest” variations. If the wind is calm, it could be smooth sailing and his passengers would be able to relax and read. Or, there could be gusts of wind and rain.There are two beds for Thunberg and her father, Svante, who is accompanying her. The others on the voyage – Hermann, the skipper Pierre Casiraghi, the head of the Malizia II racing team and a documentary filmmaker named Nathan Grossman – plan to sleep on beanbags. The boat has a motor and generator in the event of an emergency. The slogan on the mainsail was chosen by Thunberg. “Unite Behind the Science,” it reads. Thunberg will be close to Hermann’s age in 2040, which is when, scientists say, climate catastrophes could strike the world unless we move swiftly away from a fossil fuel based economy. “I have no idea how the world is going to look,” she said. Either the world will have tackled the problem in time, she went on, or it will have crossed what scientists call “tipping points”, beyond which it’s impossible to return to normal weather patterns.“I can’t really start planning my future,” she said.

I’d like to pay tribute to everyone who searched for Nóra. May she rest in peace.”Consular assistanceMinister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said officials from the Irish consular services were liaising with the family.“Irish and French embassies in Malaysia working together to provide every assistance to the Quoirin family,” he posted on Twitter. “Irish embassy is in touch with Malaysian authorities on today’s discovery of a body. At this harrowing time all of our thoughts and prayers are with the family.”The official Twitter account of the Embassy of France in Ireland said French ministers Jean-Yves Le Drian and Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne “were sad to learn Nóra Quoirin’s death today and express their condolences to her family and close friends”.Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald issued a statement in which she said her “heart is broken for the family of Nóra Quoirin”.“I cannot begin to imagine their grief,” she said. “What started as a holiday of a lifetime has ended in this unimaginable tragedy. I wish to offer my deepest condolences to Nóra’s family and loved ones at this sad time.”Former senator Jillian van Turnhout said news of the discovery of the teenager’s body was “devastating”.“Thinking of the family and friends of Nóra Quoirin,” she said. “Devastating news. Heartfelt thanks from Ireland to all the volunteers and locals who helped in the search for Nóra Quoirin.”Irish band Kodaline also took to Twitter to issue condolences. “So saddened to hear the latest news coming out of Malaysia about Nóra Quoirin,” it said. “Our sincerest condolences to her parents and their whole network of family and friends.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3985300.1565719708!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hogan raises erg plans around backstop with uk brexit secretary","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUK Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay: “We’re leaving the EU on October 31st with or without a deal.” Photograph: Tolga AkmenThe EU has raised with UK ministers claims by some Tory MPs that they will not support the current Brexit deal even if Boris Johnson’s demands to scrap the backstop are met. Mr Johnson, the new British prime minister, has said the backstop, the insurance policy to avoid a hard border, must be abolished if there is to be an orderly Brexit at the end of October. The EU is adamant that the current withdrawal agreement, which contains the backstop, will not be reopened or renegotiated. Stephen Barclay, the UK Brexit secretary, laid out Mr Johnson’s position in a phone call with EU agriculture commissioner Phil Hogan earlier this week. However, Mr Hogan indicated to Mr Barclay that the EU is aware that members of the so-called European Research Group of hard-Brexit Tory MPs have already said the abolition of the backstop is not enough. Mr Hogan repeated that the backstop would not be changed and challenged Mr Barclay to come up with some ideas to break the current impasse.After the phone call, Mr Barclay said: “We’re leaving the EU on October 31st with or without a deal.” He added that he stressed to Mr Hogan that “while we’re ready to energetically enter into new negotiations in a spirit of friendship, the backstop must go”. Political declarationThe EU and the Government have categorically ruled out any changes to the backstop and the wider withdrawal agreement, but they have said that the political declaration, the looser document which aims to sketch out the post-Brexit relationship between the UK and EU, can be amended. Recent weeks, however, have seen members of the ERG say they want the withdrawal agreement in its entirety scrapped. One MP, Mark Francois, said: “If there were any attempt to revive the withdrawal agreement, even without the backstop, the ERG would vote against it.”Mr Hogan is understood to have brought up such claims in his phone call with Mr Barclay. “The UK had made an agreement with the EU in good faith and it is up to them to propose ideas to break the impasse, taking account of the expressed view of the ERG members that the removal of the backstop would not convince them to vote in favour of the WA under any circumstances,” one source said, adding the EU is ready for new ideas “under the future relationship”.“In response, commissioner Hogan reiterated the EU’s well-established position that the withdrawal agreement, which was negotiated in good faith between the EU and the UK, is not open for renegotiation. “If the UK government continues to reject the withdrawal agreement, it is now the responsibility of the UK government to come forward with proposals for the future EU-UK relationship. The UK government can be assured that any such proposals will be given appropriate consideration by the EU.”Mr Hogan has been nominated for another five-year term at the European Commission by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar but he is not expected to find out what portfolio he will be given in the new commission until September.

She was on holiday at the resort with her family.“The family expects the police to do a thorough investigation into the incident, including criminal angles,” their lawyer, Sankara N Nair, said, clarifying an earlier comment that the family “won’t press for anything” did not mean they opposed a full inquiry.He urged Malaysian police to accept an offer by French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian to help investigate the circumstances of the death.“It’s a very good proposal,” he said. “I hope police will accept the assistance.”Nóra’s mother is from Belfast while her father is French. The family is still at the resort, Mr Nair said.Police said they would answer questions on the incident later in the day.The family initially feared a criminal angle in the disappearance, saying she had special needs and had never before left her family voluntarily, a British victims’ group, the Lucie Blackman Trust, said in a statement issued on their behalf.An initial investigation yielded no evidence of criminal behaviour but police would look at all possibilities, Malaysia’s deputy police chief, Mazlan Mansor, said on Tuesday.In a statement, Nóra’s family said their “hearts are broken” and offered their thanks to those involved in the search.They described how the teenager had “truly touched the world”.“Nóra is at the heart of our family.

However, he said that if police suspected foul play was involved in Ms Quoirin’s death, the repatriation could be delayed.Bereavement careMr Searle said the trust was continuing to provide support and bereavement care to the family. He added that the family was “incredibly grateful” for all the support they had received from around the world.In a statement, President Michael D Higgins expressed his sympathy to the Quoirin family and thanked the Malaysian authorities and volunteers for their assistance in the search.“Our thoughts and prayers are now with Nóra’s family, at this most difficult time.

He declined to comment on whether the body had any visible injuries and said police needed to await the postmortem before commenting on this.The teenager’s parents, Meabh and Sebastien Quoirin, an Irish-French couple who have lived in London for 20 years, had earlier thanked those looking for their daughter. Nóra’s mother appealed for help on Monday and the teenager’s family had offered a reward of 50,000 Malaysian ringgit (about €10,600) donated by an anonymous Belfast business – for information leading to her return.Separately, €125,525 had been raised through two GoFundMe pages set up by the Quoirin and Agnew family following Nóra’s disappearance on August 4th. The funds were initially set up to support family taking part in the search and rescue effort. However, it is understood some of the money may now be used to help repatriate the Irish teenager’s body."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Comment: Philip Hammond got us into this mess.

It might also suggest that our understanding of the black hole is wrong, and that researchers will have to come up with a new model to understand it.First ever photo of black hole revealed by astronomersOne of the possibilities is that the flash was thrown out when the star known as\u0026nbspS0-2\u0026nbspmoved close to the black hole, in 2018. Researchers had been watching that star in an attempt to understand more about Einstein\u0027s theory of general relativity, but it appears to have found something even more surprising.It might also be the remnants of the passage of a dusty object known as G2, which passed by in 2014. Researchers had expected a thrilling display when that happened, but found themselves ultimately disappointed – it might be, however, that the exciting show was simply delayed rather than cancelled.Researchers now hope to keep examining the black hole both to watch for potential changes in its state and to better understand what physical processes might be responsible for the changes in how it looks.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The data suggested trading was “consistent with material illegal activity”.An FCA spokesperson responded: “The FCA has been aware of these matters since the first tweet and price movements on Tuesday of last week and at that point we began undertaking wide-ranging enquiries. We will continue to make enquiries using the wide range of data and resources at our disposal.”Burford said it detected signs of spoofing and layering – illegal methods of driving down share prices, which have resulted in convictions previously.For example, trading data showed that there was “an unusual flood” of order cancellations beginning shortly before Muddy Waters’ original tweet. Burford also said: “While Muddy Waters was suggesting that Burford was insolvent, it was at the same time buying Burford shares.”In its report, Muddy Waters labelled Burford a “poor business masquerading as a great one”. Burford’s shares plunged by 65 per cent over the course of 6 and 7 August, with almost £2bn wiped off the firm’s value.The following day, Burford hit back against the report, accusing Muddy Waters of peddling “factual inaccuracies” and “fallacious insinuations”.Christopher Bogart, chief executive of Burford, said the company’s “market-leading” business is the same as it was a week ago.He said: “What has changed is that a substantial amount of market value was wiped out by activity we believe is consistent with illegal market manipulation that has nothing to do with Burford’s business. That is wrong and that is illegal.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s great if you’ve got the guts for it.”Clive Fenton, the former chief executive of fellow housebuilder McCarthy and Stone, is providing assistance to the review as an industry expert.The consultation period closes on 16 September, with findings of the review due by the end of the year.Roger Devlin, chair\u0026nbspof Persimmon, said: “It is important that we listen in order to improve and this consultation process is a vital step in hearing from our customers, employees, and many other people important to our business.“We hope that as many of our stakeholders as possible will take the time to contribute to this important process and I am very grateful to them for participating.”Persimmon faced criticism last year as it handed out hefty bonuses to executives, despite scoring relatively low for customer satisfaction in the industry.Former chief executive Jeff Fairburn’s circa £75m pay package in particular came under fire.He later stepped down, blaming the “distraction” of his pay deal.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Policymakers have looked for an explanation in the so-called supply side of the economy – the ways in which goods are made and services delivered – and pointed to declining technological innovation and cheap loans keeping unproductive “zombie” firms afloat, among other possible reasons.\u0026nbspBut the New Economics Foundation says its research shows that the government must also look at the demand side – the level and nature of spending across the country.\u0026nbsp“Average productivity, wages and living standards have experienced their worst decade in almost two centuries. It is increasingly clear that weak demand has been the overlooked problem,” said Alfie Stirling, head of economics at the think tank.\u0026nbsp“Raising demand by putting more cash in the pockets of the UK’s poorest workers, while giving people more paid time off from work to spend it, should now be part of a radical mix of options for any government that is serious about increasing productivity in a way that works for people and society.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Britain’s Jamie Chadwick wins first-ever W Series title.

Instead, companies rely on cheaper labour that can be shed quickly if demand doesn’t improve. As a result, productivity does not improve.The New Economics Foundation finds evidence of exactly this in official data.\u0026nbspIt says that since 2012, firms have increasingly preferred to hire rather than to invest and that, relative to all employees, the proportion of zero-hour and self-employed workers, as well as one-person “micro-companies”, has grown by two fifths since before the financial crisis. The corresponding lack of investment now explains at least a quarter of the UK’s gap in productivity with the historical trend.A report by the New Economics Foundation sets out a number of measures to lift demand, including gradual increases in statutory paid holiday and faster rises in the minimum wage.\u0026nbsp“The evidence shows that increased leisure time for workers can be expected to increase economy-wide demand,” the think tank says.It adds: “Increasing minimum wages is a particularly efficient way of boosting demand because workers on minimum wages are far more likely to spend rather than save any increases in salary, compared with higher-income iniduals.”Based on the same logic, the report recommends abolishing the personal allowance of income tax and using the extra public revenue on direct payouts to consumers and an increase in child benefit. It says this will redistribute £8bn a year from the richest 35 per cent of households to the remaining 65 per cent, with most of the gains concentrated on the poorest 10 per cent.\u0026nbspThe think tank also argues the government should frontload a large share of investment required to turn Britain into a zero-carbon economy over the next five years, in order to boost demand.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Nearly three in four secondary schools are academies, as well as more than a quarter of primary schools.Protests by parents and children stop schools from becoming academiesThe first academies were set up in 2002 by Labour to improve standards in failing schools. From 2010, the numbers grew after the coalition government allowed all schools to convert to academies.The Conservative government has been pushing academisation, which gives schools freedoms to set their curricula, admissions policies and working conditions, as well as their policy for school improvement.Chris Keates, acting general secretary of the NASUWT teachers’ union, said: “The research by the University of Oxford does not come as a surprise, but it is no less shocking.”She said: “It is unacceptable that children and young people are being denied their fundamental entitlement to be taught by qualified teachers. It is also unacceptable for other staff to be exploited by schools that require them to do the job of a qualified teacher while\u0026nbspbeing paid less.“Every school should be investing in recruiting and retaining teachers rather than devising strategies to pay teachers as little as they can get away with.“Parents have a right to expect that a government that cares about their children’s futures will act to ensure that every child is guaranteed the right to be taught by qualified teachers.”Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “The vast majority of schools of all types seek to recruit appropriately skilled and qualified teachers.“There may be times when they decide to recruit specialists who do not have QTS in subjects where there are severe teacher shortages such as maths and physics. However, they will always ensure such staff are properly supported. Obviously the best solution would be for more action by the government to tackle the crisis in teacher recruitment and retention so that all schools can recruit the teachers they need.”Nick Brook, deputy general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said\u0026nbspthere were\u0026nbspsome\u0026nbsplegitimate reasons academies or private schools might choose to employ a teacher without QTS – such as when they\u0026nbsphave some particular skill, like\u0026nbspin art or pastoral care.But he added: “That said, the greatest rise in the use of unqualified teachers has been in sponsored academies – a school type typically found in more disadvantaged areas.“We already know that recruiting and retaining teachers in schools serving disadvantaged communities is challenging, so the rise of unqualified teachers in these schools is concerning. It is children from disadvantaged backgrounds who are most in need of the very best teachers.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “More than 95 per cent\u0026nbspof teachers in state funded schools – which includes academies – have qualified teacher status. All schools are held accountable for the quality of teaching through Ofsted inspections and the publication of school performance data. \u0026nbsp“We want all children to have great teachers who can inspire and excite them. That’s why schools have been given the freedom to employ experts, such as scientists, sports people or musicians, to add value and improve the learning experience for pupils.”University of Oxford\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Universities take a holistic view of applicants’ achievements and potential when deciding whether to make an offer.“Personal statements, references, interviews, and auditions can be as important when assessing if an inidual will flourish on a course.”A Department for Education\u0026nbspspokesperson said: Universities must ensure their admissions practices are fair, to ensure everyone can access higher education, or they will face action.The Office for Students and Universities UK are already undertaking a review of university admissions to look at how well current practices serve students and we urge all groups to support them to see how they can be improved.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Before the reforms, universities could use actual results when considering applications.It has been suggested that parents who are more familiar with the university application system could be placing more pressure on teachers to give their children higher predicted grades to secure offers from top universities, leaving pupil from poorer backgrounds at a further disadvantage.The surge in the proportion of university applicants being offered a place on a degree regardless of their exam grades –\u0026nbspknown as unconditional offers – could also disadvantage students as they could become demotivated in their final year of schooling and find the step up to university more difficult.How to get a university course place through Clearing on results dayHowever, radically changing the exam timetable could also leave poorer students in the dark and at a disadvantage, the head of the admissions service argues. \u0026nbspA consultation run by Ucas in 2012 found that an introduction of PQA would significantly disadvantage underrepresented and disabled students unless calendars were changed.Ucas chief, Clare Marchant, believes poorer pupils lacking parental support would have to make quick decisions about degree courses at a time when schools are closed and teachers are absent. \u0026nbspShe also argues that universities could struggle to put in place support services for those who are first in the family to enter higher education, as well as disabled students, in time for start of term.And now that a record number of students are taking up places on degrees through clearing, Ms Marchant argues that there is already a “genuine post-qualifications admissions route” in place.The debate between Ucas and leading groups in the sector rages on. But we will have to wait and see whether the Department for Education and Universities UK decide to finally make a change. \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. 130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments.

The entire cast of dogs appearing in the film were rescued from shelters and adopted by cast and crew upon completion of filming.Theroux and Thompson have been joined by an all-star cast of actors also lending their voices, including Janelle Monae, Ashley Jensen, Benedict Wong and Sam Elliott. Monae has also contributed three original songs to the film, including a far less racist version of the notorious “Siamese Cat Song” from the original movie.Everything we know about Disney+Disney remakes have made over $7 billion since 2010Unlike Disney’s recent live-action or photo-realistic remakes, including Aladdin, The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast, the new Lady and the Tramp will only be released on their forthcoming streaming platform Disney+, where it will be available upon the platform’s launch on 12 November.Lady and the Tramp\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspBeauty and the Beast\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The inherent \u0027message\u0027 is that this woman is accountable to her boyfriend, must obey his orders and must seek his permission to live her life.\u0026nbspMental health services failing to ask women about domestic abuseIn this case, it has manifested in a set of rules, but often control is a pattern of subtle behaviours. Such controlling behaviours are normalised and legitimised in society which can make it difficult to recognise and challenge. Technology has made this easier - from apps that track women\u0027s movements, to websites that encourage revenge on women who \u0027disobey\u0027 their partners, and text, calls and social media providing platforms to control women even when they are away from the abuser. Ultimately, many men still enjoy power and control over women who are disadvantaged by a patriarchal system which facilitates and excuses men’s violence.”\u0026nbspThe latest figures show that out of an estimated two million victims of domestic abuse in the last year, some 1.3 million were women.The majority (70 per cent) of victims of domestic violence deaths are female. Every week in the UK,\u0026nbsptwo women are murdered by a partner or ex-partner.Suzanne Jacob, chief executive of domestic abuse charity SafeLives, said: “Firstly, we hope Zoe is safe and has the support she needs around her. This kind of controlling behaviour is extremely worrying and is not ‘normal’ in a relationship. A partner should make you feel loved and valued, not tell you what to wear, who to speak to or how to behave. “If you recognise any of these behaviours in your own relationship, know that there is support out there. Everyone deserves the freedom to live the life they want, and no one should have to live in fear of a partner’s ‘rules’.”Ms Scholefield did not immediately respond to The Independent’s request for comment.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

deputy Prime MinisterPhilip Hammond resigned as Chancellor of the ExchequerA cross-party attempt to pass legislation to force Mr Johnson to seek an extension of Article 50 is highly likely, but many MPs opposed to no deal believe any effort\u0026nbspmust go further to thwart the PM.They fear Mr Johnson\u0026nbspcould simply refuse to cooperate with EU leaders – keeping a 31 October crash-out as the legal default – and want that default changed to require Article 50 to be revoked if no extension has been granted.Now the local Labour parties have signed up to a campaign to maximise pressure in Brighton in September, launched by the grassroots groups Another Europe is Possible, Labour for a Socialist Europe and Open Labour.The motion “notes the vast majority of Labour members and voters oppose Brexit” and says the party still needs “a clear Brexit policy”.Corbyn ‘to tell Queen we’re taking over’ if Johnson loses powerIt then states: “Labour will campaign energetically for a public vote and to Remain. We support revoking Article 50 if necessary to prevent no deal.”Lloyd Russell-Moyle, a Labour MP backing the campaign, said: “No deal would be a catastrophic moment for the Labour Party and the people we represent. It would mean a huge economic crisis which the right wing of the Tory party would use to drive an agenda of deregulation.“We must be willing to do absolutely anything to stop it – and of course that would mean, if we had to, whipping to revoke Article 50.”And Michael Chessum, national organiser for Another Europe is Possible, said: “It’s not the tool we would choose, but if revoking is the only option left on the table to stop the disaster capitalists, Labour has to be willing to use it. There can’t be any fudge or ambiguity on that.”An online petition calling on the government to revoke Article 50 was signed by more than 4 million people earlier this year, making it the most popular petition ever submitted to the parliament’s website.The idea has also been backed as an escape route by senior Tories John Major and Ken Clarke and by the Scottish Nationalist Party\u0026nbsp– but not by Mr Corbyn.PM facing criticism over plan to pull UK officials from EU meetingsHuge march or Brexit referendum to be held as October exit date nearsLegal bid to prevent PM suspending parliament to go aheadThousands of EU academics left posts at top universities after BrexitJohnson identifies critical date for MPs trying to stop no-deal BrexitLast month\u0026nbsphe suggested Labour would fight the next election seeking to negotiate a better Brexit deal – if the UK is still an EU member – and said: “We’ll decide our policy when the election comes.”The motions set\u0026nbspthe scene for a repeat of last year’s bitter tussle about Brexit policy, waged over a five-hour meeting to hammer out a compromise “composite” motion.This year, anti-Brexit activists are likely to make a commitment to revoking Article 50, if necessary, a “red line” in the marathon Sunday evening get-together of constituency parties, trade unions and affiliated groups.The conference\u0026nbspwill be staged just a month before the 31 October deadline for leaving the EU – with no sign of a new agreement with Brussels to avert a crash-out departure and the widespread damage predicted.\u0026nbspThe activists also fear that\u0026nbspif a snap election is called then\u0026nbspconference could be cancelled, leaving Labour’s policy to be decided by a joint meeting of the shadow cabinet and the national executive committee.They are urging the near-200 local parties\u0026nbspto submit a motion to join the campaign to “shift the party’s position regardless of whether a formal conference vote takes place”.\u0026nbspIn total, 50 constituencies have already voted to submit anti-Brexit motions to the Brighton conference, of which at least 29 explicitly call for the Article 50 notice to be withdrawn.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Policymakers have looked for an explanation in the so-called supply side of the economy – the ways in which goods are made and services delivered – and pointed to declining technological innovation and cheap loans keeping unproductive “zombie” firms afloat, among other possible reasons.\u0026nbspBut the New Economics Foundation says its research shows that the government must also look at the demand side – the level and nature of spending across the country.\u0026nbsp“Average productivity, wages and living standards have experienced their worst decade in almost two centuries. It is increasingly clear that weak demand has been the overlooked problem,” said Alfie Stirling, head of economics at the think tank.\u0026nbsp“Raising demand by putting more cash in the pockets of the UK’s poorest workers, while giving people more paid time off from work to spend it, should now be part of a radical mix of options for any government that is serious about increasing productivity in a way that works for people and society.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Britain’s Jamie Chadwick wins first-ever W Series title.

Instead, companies rely on cheaper labour that can be shed quickly if demand doesn’t improve. As a result, productivity does not improve.The New Economics Foundation finds evidence of exactly this in official data.\u0026nbspIt says that since 2012, firms have increasingly preferred to hire rather than to invest and that, relative to all employees, the proportion of zero-hour and self-employed workers, as well as one-person “micro-companies”, has grown by two fifths since before the financial crisis. The corresponding lack of investment now explains at least a quarter of the UK’s gap in productivity with the historical trend.A report by the New Economics Foundation sets out a number of measures to lift demand, including gradual increases in statutory paid holiday and faster rises in the minimum wage.\u0026nbsp“The evidence shows that increased leisure time for workers can be expected to increase economy-wide demand,” the think tank says.It adds: “Increasing minimum wages is a particularly efficient way of boosting demand because workers on minimum wages are far more likely to spend rather than save any increases in salary, compared with higher-income iniduals.”Based on the same logic, the report recommends abolishing the personal allowance of income tax and using the extra public revenue on direct payouts to consumers and an increase in child benefit. It says this will redistribute £8bn a year from the richest 35 per cent of households to the remaining 65 per cent, with most of the gains concentrated on the poorest 10 per cent.\u0026nbspThe think tank also argues the government should frontload a large share of investment required to turn Britain into a zero-carbon economy over the next five years, in order to boost demand.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is\u0026nbspnot clear what the final death toll is.\u0026nbspTrump in ‘bizarre’ nuclear-powered missile claim after Russia blastRussia admits deadly blast was caused by nuclear reactor accidentMore than 300 anti-Putin protesters arrested in RussiaThe company said the victims were on a sea platform testing a rocket engine and were thrown into the sea by an explosion.\u0026nbspRosatom director Alexei Likhachev praised the victims as true heroes and the pride of our country.\u0026nbspOur further work on new weapons that we will certainly complete will be the best tribute to them, Mr Likhachev said during the funeral, according to Rosatom. We will fulfil the Motherland\u0027s orders and fully protect its security.\u0026nbspFollowing the explosion, Russian authorities also closed part of Dvina Bay on the White Sea to shipping for a month, in what could be an attempt to prevent outsiders from seeing an operation to recover the missile debris.\u0026nbspThe Severodvinsk city administration said the radiation level rose to 2 microsieverts per hour for about 30 minutes on Thursday before returning to the area\u0027s natural level of 0.1 microsieverts per hour. Emergency officials issued a warning to all workers to stay indoors and close the windows.\u0026nbspThe radiation level of 2 microsieverts per hour is only slightly higher than the natural background radiation, which could vary between 0.1 and 0.4 microsieverts per hour.

a street gang which formed in the late s - and started attending their parties.And as the violence in her neighbourhood raged, she became increasingly drawn to the protection and respect gang membership would bring.Local journalist Frank Main said: Her friends started getting shot and I think that she got sucked into gang le and she realised that’s where she’s going to get respect and honour and the warm fuzzies that other kids get from playing basketball or playing chess or something in high school.Shed originally wanted to become a social worker, but as she became more involved with the Gangster Disciples her priorities turned to status and reputation.Her le changed completely at  when one of her fellow gang members and friends, Shondale Tooka Gregory, was shot and killed by members of a rival gang in .To make the slaying even more incendiary, Tookas killers mocked him on social media after the murder — even going as far as to edit toilet paper into a picture of Tooka dead in his casket.This online savagery and threatening each other on social media - known as cyber-banging - turned Gakirahs grief into rage.In fact the escalation in hatred between the gangs that followed was so extreme that Lee Caldwell of Chicagos Gang Safety Team said: Essentially, this image started a gang conflict.Later that year, -year-old Odee Perry, who was suspected of killing Tooka, was shot dead.An all-out gang war began, with the Gangster Disciples renaming their territory Tookaville and the Black Disciples calling theirs O Block in their fallen members honour.Although Gakirah was never charged with Odees murder, people thought she was the one who pulled the trigger.Frank Main said: It gave her a giant reputation as a shooter.If you are a teenager in a gang in Chicago and you kill somebody, your status rockets.Gakirahs street cred exploded online too as she amassed nearly , followers on Twitter a huge number in the early days of the site.Her popularity came from how openly she showed off her gangster lestyle, including by threatening others on the social media network.She also started appearing in Drill rap music videos posing with guns and fists full of dollars.Gakirah, who was also known as KI - thought to be an abbreviation of her first name - appears in one video from the Fly Boy Gang in a song called Murda.She even gets referenced directly in the line KI my young killa and is seen in the video wearing a bandanna covering her face and pointing an automatic gun at the camera.The local rap scene adored her — with rappers from rival gangs following and flirting with her on Twitter.Angalia Bianca, a former Chicago gang member, said: She was a real badass gangster girl — every bit the definition.For females,you want to keep that kind of respect, she was never going to stop.And Professor Desmond Patton, who studied Gakirahs online presence, said: She wanted to be the toughest person she could be in that gang.Her reputation as gangster girl every bit as violent as the boys only grew as the violence in Chicagos South Side got worse.And the year after the murders of Tooka and Odee, Gakirahs deadly rage would be intensied by the loss of another loved one.Tyquan Tyler, a family friend of Gakirahs from outside the city, was just  years old when he came to visit her.The pair were leaving a party in a group when several men started firing into the crowd.They were targeting someone  — but Tyquan was hit in the chest, and he died in a childrens hospital several hours later.Gakirahs friend, who was with her that evening, said shed never seen the hardened gangster cry like she did that night.Gakirah took up the Twitter handle Tyquanassassin in remembrance and wrote: Tyquan supposed  Be hear wit me But instead Lil bro ended up  feet under a million miles away.But the brutal aggravation wouldnt end for Gakirah.In March , her friend Raason Lil B Shaw was fatally gunned down in a foot chase with police when cops said he pulled a pistol on them.Again she tweeted her agony, writing: Da pain unbearable.But it wasnt long after that she wrote: Police took my homie I dedicate my le  his revenge .Around the same time, a member of a rival gang named Blood Money was shot dead.Word on the street said Gakirah was the killer, though again police didnt charge her with the murder.But in a city which saw , murders between -, the rumours were enough for Blood Moneys friends to want revenge.The situation was accelerated when one of Gakirahs fellow gang members, Lil Jay, posted a video of himself bragging on Instagram.In it, he drinks a red-coloured liquid and the caption reads: Sippin on Blood Money.With the word out that Gakirah was responsible for the killing, her le was in serious danger.On April  , she tweeted: I Dne seen  many of my n****z in a casket... In da end we DIE.The next day, Gakirah was walking to a friends house when a hooded man walked up to her.He shot her a total of nine times, leaving her bleeding to death on the pavement before making his getaway.She managed to crawl to the steps of a house nearby where she lost consciousness.Gakirah died in a hospital bed two hours later at just  years old.Reporter Frank Main said: The novelty of Gakirah the gang assassin being shot down was huge.She was thought to be one of the most notorious shooters in the history of that neighbourhood – and she’s a girl.Within hours of the news breaking, her death was being mocked by rival gang members online.Academics trying to end the cycle of gang violence in Chicago have since studied Gakirahs tweets to look for insights.Using articial intelligence, theyre trying to identy which online threats usually turn into actual street violence.Professor Desmond Patton said: Expressions of grief and loss often come before a more aggressive and threatening tweet – perfect time for an intervention.Speaking of Gakirah specically, he added: She almost didn’t seem realThere was this devilish, monstrous little girl who was going around killing people and that she also talked about on this online.Secret Le of a Gang Girl is on Crime and Investigation tonight at pm. "},{"url":null,"title":"paul hollywood only has himself to blame","story":"Actually, Summer Monteys-Fullam ran out of the door after being told she had to sign a draconian non- disclosure agreement, vowing not to give away any details of her affair with the Bake Off dough boy.Apparently, she thought she was going to receive a romantic proposal and engagement ring but instead was presented with a cold, legal document that all but screamed: “I don’t trust you.”She decided to pack up all her crop tops and tight jeans and flee as fast as her lithe, -year-old legs would carry her.We are told Hollywood, , charmingly bellowed after her: “Why don’t you f*** off back on that horse you rode in on ”Not exactly the stuff of tender romance, I’m sure you will agree. But let’s be honest, I think we all knew this midle crisis of a romance would end in tears.For a start it all played out in the public eye like a soap opera, which never bodes well.Paul, who bizarrely seems to be regardedas some sort of sex symbol, has not exactly covered himself in glory when it comes to his love le.Don’t forget that back in , he cheated on ex-we Alex with his cutesy-pie American co-presenter.That was when he went to the US hoping to cash in on his Bake Off fame and attempted to build a lucrative career across the pond.The affair with Marcela ­Valladolid might have generated a lot of free publicity and media attention, but his bid for transatlantic success never took off.He came home with his tail between his legs and had to eat a great big entire humble pie to win back his we.We don’t ever know what goes on inside a marriage, but Alex took him back, possibly for the sake of their teenage son Josh.At the same time she appeared on my show to kick-start her own career as a cook.She was very good, with a no-nonsense, immensely likeable personality — and her food was delicious. She’s since become a celebrity chef in her own right.I recall that Alex brought her sheepish husband along with her that morning for her first appearance on live TV.Perhaps it was for moral support, but I reckon it was more likely to keep an eye on him. He did his best impersonation of a penitent man and they somehow managed to reheat the souffle.Of course, it didn’t last.They split up in  and that same year, Hollywood began his relationship with ex- barmaid Summer.Alex was convinced the affair began before they finally split but this was vehemently denied by both Paul and Summer.Paul and Alex, of course, are now orced. And he apparently faces an imminent court battle over cash.Alex could even end up with half her ex-husband’s ­estimated £million fortune.She is currently enjoying a holiday in France, where she was photographed looking chic, cool and effortlessly ­elegant.No one could fail to forgive her for feeling a bit smug that her ex has been so publicly dumped. After all, she had to bear her share of public humiliation over his behaviour.Meanwhile, it gets worse and worse for Paul, as inevitably there is now talk of ­Summer writing a book and appearing in a clutch of reality shows.She didn’t sign the NDA so is completely free to warble about their sex le and all sorts of potentially embarrassing revelationsshe wishes.So it looks like Paul is leaving Summer behind him and entering the autumn and winter of his le alone, with only himself to blame.I’ve just gobbled up the entire new BBC series Fosse Verdon about the hugely talented husband and we team who, among many other hits, gave us musicals Sweet Charity, Cabaret and Chicago.It’s gratying to see Broadway legend Gwen Verdon finally given the acclaim she deserves for the part she played in Bob Fosse’s success.He was a genius choreographer and director but also a notorious womaniser, chain-smoker, heavy drinker and pill popper.This series never shies away from Fosse’s sleazy side, showing how manipulative he could be – and his seduction of vulnerable young actresses and dancers is not easy to watch.We are light years from the #MeToo movement, and this series illustrates why we need it so much.Sam Rockwell plays a blinder as Fosse, but Michelle Williams is a revelation as Gwen Verdon.It’s as though the red-headed dancing star has been brought back to le.You know those stock responses you get after stating the bleedin’ obvious – about the Pope being Catholic and bears defecating in the woods.There is another one which I always thought was very callous.“Does Rose Kennedy own a black dress ”This is particularly unfeeling given the many tragedies visited upon the Kennedy clan – continuing right up to the present day.Theirs is a long litany of pain and suffering.Matriarch Rose endured the death of her eldest son Joe during World War Two, before the unimaginable ordeal of seeing two more sons publicly gunned down.First when John, as US President, was assassinated in . Then his younger brother Bobby, the former Attorney General turned senator and presidential candidate, was brutally slain in .The “Kennedy curse” has persisted through the decades.Twenty years ago, John F Kennedy Jnr, JFK’s only son, died while flying his light aircraft to the Massachusetts island of Martha’s Vineyard when it crashed into the ocean.In , Mary Kennedy, the estranged we of Robert Kennedy Jr – Bobby’s son – was found dead in her New York home, having apparently taken her own le.And this week, the family gathered for yet another tragic occasion.This time it was the funeral of Bobby’s -year-old granddaughter Saoirse Kennedy Hill, who died from a suspected overdose at the family compound in Cape Cod.Rose died in  aged .She was spared witnessing the deaths of some of the younger members of the family, including poor Saoirse.But after all she endured during her long le, she deserves a bit more respect and understanding than being the punchline to a weak joke.Whoever signed up Michelle Visage for Strictly Come Dancing deserves a pay rise.Michelle, right, one of the stars of the fabulous RuPaul’s Drag Race, will be a firecracker of an addition to Strictly. She’s sassy, sexy, ballsy and a real grafter.She has a wonderful dirty laugh and a terric outlook and she’ll seize this show by the throat.I’d have paid real money to have seen her reduce sacked former pro Brendan Cole to a whimpering jellyfish.It’s a huge shame that’s no longer a possibility, but bosses need to make sure Michelle is paired with a young, hungry dancer not afraid to take risks.There could perhaps be a chance for Kevin Clton to win two Glitterballs in a row after his success with Stacey Dooley last year.Kevin and Michelle could really burn up that dance floor and there would be no hanky panky from this loyal woman whose -year marriage to hubby David is rock solid.So no Strictly “curse”, but knowing Michelle, maybe rather a lot of Strictly cursing.Her big-heartedness remains undimmed even under the cruel shadow of Alzheimer’s, so it was no surprise that Dame Barbara Windsor used her nd birthday this week to demand more action to help fellow sufferers and their families.While other entertainers with long careers might have used their special day just to celebrate their achievements, Dame Barbara instead pleaded for us all to show compassion towards those with dementia, and for the Government to ensure more resources are made available.Barbara and her devoted husband Scott Mitchell have become ambassadors for the Alzheimer’s Society charity and have sent an open letter to Boris Johnson to sort out the care crisis that is making le so very hard for everyone affected by this disease.Now Boris might profess to being unafraid of all of the EU grandees as he tries to deliver Brexit, but he should be quaking in his boots at the prospect of the wrath of our Barbarahe doesn’t deliver vital help and money to those affected by dementia.More power to this incredible woman and how lucky she is to have Scott to take care of her because, sadly, not everyone dealing with dementia has such a devoted partner.They have both made a huge dference in raising awareness and much-needed cash.When this horrible disease is finally vanquished, and one day it must be, we will never forget the part Barbara and Scott played. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And we should all rejoice in that.DAMNING new statistics reveal the average wait for a non-urgent GP appointment is now more than two weeks.This is simply not good enough.Boris Johnson promised in his first speech as Prime Minister that it was his job to make sure we don’t have to wait for weeks on end to see our doctor.The latest figures highlight the enormity of that task.There is a limit to what can be achieved by under-pressure health service staff and, though the PM has moved quickly to free up extra funding, there will never be an endless supply of money for the NHS, no matter who is in No.What is needed is serious reform and some radical thinking.Jeremy Corbyn will doubtless oppose any new ideas and continue using the NHS as a political football.Butthe Prime Minister can prove as single-minded on the health service as he is proving on Brexit, there is still hope.VAR made its Premier League debut on the opening weekend of the new season and had an instant impact.In spite of teething problems, it’s great to see the right decisions being reached by the video assistant referees — but fans should not be left in the dark while it happens.Refs should be mic’d up, like in rugby, so supporters can hear what’s going on.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are the only guests out here at the moment.We were enjoying lunch when we saw over a dozen people getting off their speedboats and landing on the island.When we looked harder, we could see the FBI logo on the backs of their shirts.It didnt take long for us to realise they must be conducting a raid on Epsteins house.It is feared Epstein may have abused so-called sex slaves at the lavish Caribbean estate including a bizarre temple built on the island.The billionaire bought Little St James more than two decades ago - transforming it into a high-security private oasis, complete with a mansion and a bizarre blue and white gold-domed structure.To date, the island has remained Epstein’s main residence, but has been shrouded in mystery.With high security, its in a secluded location, while its locally-known moniker as Paedophile Island has given rise to more sinister theories about its use.Neighbouring islander Kevin Goodrich, who operates boat charters from nearby St Thomas, said: “Everybody called it ‘Paedophile Island ... It’s our dark corner.”Epstein set about building an enormous stone mansion with cream-coloured walls and a bright turquoise roof surrounded by a maids’ quarters.Years later, and on the other southwest edge of the island, he built a square-shaped blue and white building resembling a religious temple, topped with a gold dome.Many have speculated that the child sex abuse Epstein has been accused of may have occurred in this secluded space.Workers claimed the structure was a music room, fitted with a grand piano and acoustic walls.But Epstein - a classically-trained pianist - positioned the building far away from other structures on the island.A medieval-style lock on the front of the temple became a curious point of conversation for those working on the site.Chicago-based contractor James Both shared his professional thoughts on the buildings door with Business Insider.Its styled like what you might see on a castle, with what appears to be a reinforcing lock bar across the face, he said.What makes it peculiar is thatyou wanted to keep people out, the bar would be placed inside the building, [but the] locking bar appears to be placed on the outside ... asit were intended to lock people in.The front of the building is flanked by statues painted in gold one which appears to be Poseidon, Greek god of the sea, and another that looks like a pair of birds.It is surrounded by a line of palm trees and a terrace with a labyrinth mot.A small structure downhill from the building has led some to believe it serves as a second entrance and suggest that the space extends underground.Both suggested: It is absolutely possible to install a dwelling and elevator underneath the structure.If an elevator was built there, [there] would most likely be a record with the vendor who installed the elevator, as they typically require yearly maintenance and inspection.Other curious details about the building have since emerged.It was constructed sometime between  and  - after Epsteins  guilty plea of soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution.The billionaire financier maintained a low profile after he received a lenient plea deal over claims he paid girls for sexual massages.Many began to believe his need for privacy appeared more sinister.The palm-fringed paradise became the subject of lurid rumours.Those who worked for Epstein in constructing the buildings said they signed non-disclosure agreements and refused to talk.Security guards keep watch along the islands shores.Before Epsteins  guilty plea, he would visit the island archipelago about two or three times a month for stays of three or four days, according to the former staffer who spoke to SF Gate.He described it as a Zen-like retreat where women would sometimes sunbathe topless or in the nude.At least one alleged victim has since spoken out about an orgy on the island she had with Epstein and others, in a court affidavit obtained by the Associated Press.The same victim said that she saw former President Bill Clinton on the island but never witnessed him having sex with anyone.A Clinton spokesman issued a statement denying the claims, saying Clinton never travelled to the island.Virginia Giuffre, previously Virginia Roberts, has recently alleged she was among a number of young girls who were abused by Epstein and others when she was a teenager.In a  lawsuit, Ms Giuffre claimed that she was a “sex slave” for Epstein, and that she was abused in his homes in New York, New Mexico, Florida, and the US Virgin Islands.Giuffre, now , said she was allegedly forced into “an orgy with numerous other under-aged girls.”She also made alarming claims involving the Duke of York, saying she “was forced to have sexual relations with [Prince Andrew] when she was a minor” at Epstein’s Little St James estate.A Buckingham Palace spokesperson told Sun Online: “It is emphatically denied The Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts.”She renewed her claims from  in an interview with the Miami Herald, saying she was  when she met Epstein, who she was introduced to by British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of Robert Maxwell.The mother-of-three said she was sent to Epstein’s private Caribbean island and groomed as a sex slave.Back in , police in Florida received reports Epstein had sexually abused underage girls in his mansion in Palm Beach.According to an indictment, Epstein recruited victims to provide massages, which they would perform nude or partially nude.Prosecutors said the encounters would become increasingly sexual, where Epstein would masturbate and ask victims to touch him while he did.According to court documents in Florida, authorities say at least  underage girls were brought into Epsteins Palm Beach mansion for what turned into sexual encounters.Courtney  Wild and Michelle Licata were part of a  criminal case brought against Epstein in FloridaWild was just  when she alleges Epstein forced her into performing sex acts on him, ABC News reported.She said: “I was , I had braces on.“Like, I remember standing in his kitchen ... and he also had a lot of girls there all the time.”Michelle Licata was aged  when she claims she was brought to the banker’s mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, where she was paid to give him a massage.She said: “He said, god, youre just so beautul and sexy and gorgeous and it was making me feel really uncomfortable.“Then he wanted me to rub his back, and he kept asking me to go lower and he was kind of talking to me.”Epstein was sentenced to only  months in jail."},{"url":null,"title":"lottery couple scoop 1m scratchcard pet food","story":"Andrew and Paula Hancock thanked their cat Shortcake for their newfound fortune after buying the winning ticket at their local petrol station.The couple, who run a catering business together, had forgotten the cats dinner but Andrew picked up a Monopoly Millionaire Scratchcard instead after popping to the shops.In the rush of excitement on realising he had landed the couple a seven-figure jackpot, Mr Hancock forgot to buy six-year-old ginger tom Shortcakes food again -

They say the event is a wholesome tradition that dates back three centuries and the “most important event in the gypsy calendar.They hit back at the locals, claiming they are “racist”.“There’s quite a lot of racism in that village, says one lad.As soon as you mention the word traveller or gypsy they think you’re scum because there are a few gypsies out there that give others a bad name but there’s good and bad in every community.”But pensioner Mervyn says: “Last year was horrendous. They were urinating in the bus shelters and destroying the hay fields.“They’d broken into stables to use them as lavatories. You had to duck when the young boys were driving past because they wind down their windows, clear their throats and spit.”The Appleby Horse Fair has been held every year since   and attracts , travellers and gypsies, , caravans and hundreds of horse drawn carriages plus.A further , visitors flock to enjoy the atmosphere and spectacle of the gathering.But for local police and residents, the fair presents a headache – with the town centre becoming a no-go area as horses are raced through the streets.Local hotel owner Nigel, born and bred in Appleby, says the town is “unrecognisable” throughout the four day fair.“In Appleby, everyone knows each other, we all grew up together and it’s a nice place to live,” he says.“For the ordinary residents of Appleby, [the fair] is pretty awful. You can’t go out, you can’t get to the shops, you can’t drive around.“There are people parking in front of your house, parking a caravan on your front lawn.”Nigel says he locks up the hotel and only lets guests in through the front door.“We put little wooden things on the windows so you can only open them so far, so you can’t get in from the outside.”Mervyn adds: “It reminds me of the air raid precautions in World War II. You don’t expect that in an English country town. I was horried when I saw it.Another resident says she makes sure her doors are locked “so no one comes in the back. You are a bit worried about that.”A third claims the travellers urinated in his garden on two occasions last year.After sundown, the fairgoers descend on the town’s pubs – and things can get rowdy.In , the fairs worst year for violence, a mass brawl broke out and, in total, there were  arrests,  crimes and  incidents.In , a -year-old grandfather accidentally ran over a toddler who ran in front of his car from a traveller encampment, breaking his arm. He was dragged from his car and beaten, suffering a broken vertebrae, black eyes and a bruised head, neck, spleen, liver and kidney.This year, however, the event passed more peacefully and there were just eight arrests.But Kaseem, a bouncer called in as extra security, says the hard-drinking revellers “start kicking off” when told the pub is closing.“As you come towards last orders it’s not like anything you’ve seen before,” adds pub landlord Kyle. “Until you work here you don’t realise what it can be like. We just have to get through it.”At the local Indian restaurant, owner Tariq has replaced his usual chairs with cheaper versions because he doesnt mindthey get destroyed and he says some of the lads that come in refuse to pay the bill or try and do a runner.“One night there was a huge problem with four guys who said they didn’t want to pay for their food,” he says. “I told them ‘You ate here so you’ve got to pay for it’ but they were having none of it.“We had a girl working here and she got that scared she didn’t want to come back.”But the travellers claim the fears are unjustied, and that the locals are prejudiced against them.Romany dad John says: “People look down on us like we’re a piece of sh**. We’re not. We work hard for a living and look after our children like everyone .“We respect the people who don’t do this. They should respect us the same. We should all get on with each other.”Flashing is part and parcel of the horse trade among travelling but the speeding horses prove a hazard to some and accidents are common.In , two horses collided and died during flashing and in  a woman was rushed to hospital with head injuries after being “run over” by a horse and cart during a  carriage race on a public road.Throughout the Channel  show, local police constable Ruth is filmed constantly telling the travellers to “slow down” as they hit dangerous speeds on the slippery rain-soaked road surfaces.But the travellers round on her, shouting “we’re not children”, with one insisting he has a buyer interested in the horse so “he’s got to have speed.”Another defiant seller says: “It’s storming down with rain now but we’re still here and we’ll carry on.”But one helmetless rider pays the price when he is thrown from a speeding horse, suffering serious head injuries that leave him “bleeding from the ear”, and is carted off to hospital in an ambulance. He was discharged two weeks later.Tensions are stretched further when police erect a road block to prevent flashing in the high street and, when  hours of rain leads to rising water levels, police are forced to cut off access to the River Eden.Traditionally horses and riders, who have travelled hundreds of miles to the site, wash themselves by plunging into the River Eden, ensuring the animals being traded are “clean and pretty” for potential buyers.A few years ago, a horse drowned after being led into a deeper part of the river and PC Ruth is concerned the same could happen again.“We can’t let anybody in the river at all,” she says. “It’s far too dangerous for the horses.”But the travellers are convinced the measures are all designed to shut the event down for good.“This fair’s been going on for years and years and they’re trying to stop it,” claims one woman. “They can’t, it’s our heritage.”Another woman, forced to park her two wagons and graze her horses on the side of a busy road because of blocks, rants about the “rude, disrespectful” police.“We’re just people living how we want to live. We’re not horrible people.“No matter what they try and do they’re not going to stop it, are they ”For -year-old Romany Jack, who spent three weeks travelling up from Wales, it’s a chance to catch up with the many friends and family members that are scattered around the country.“I love going to Appleby for that week,” he says. “Your heart lights up to it. Been doing this all my le my whole le, since I was a kid.“We all meet here and we do deals with horses or sell a bird, a canary – anything we can make money with.“Andwe rob one another we rob one another with the [deal on the] horses. You rob me this time, I’ll get you next time.”Head gypsy Billy Welch, who liaises with police and the local council to arrange toilets, rubbish skips and suitable grazing for the horses, says the fair is “sacred” to both old and young. “If you say to these children ‘Do you want to go to Disneyland in Florida or Appleby ’ they definitely want to go to Appleby,” he says. “There’s no contest. It is literally our Mecca. This is where our ancestors have been coming for centuries.“When we sit around our campfires it gives us a feeling of belonging, of ancestry. When we’re here we feel closer to God. It’s God’s country.”The Town The Gypsies Took Over airs tonight on Channel  at pmOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

School leavers should apply to uni only after seeing their A-level results, the party has said. Thousands of students are anxiously waiting to collect their results on Thursday and seethey’ve got the grades they need to go their top choice university. But the system, which sees pupils apply with predicted results based on past performance and teacheraposs predictions, makes it dficult for the brightest students from working-class families to get into top universities. Labour has warned. Studies have revealed that predicted grades unfairly penalise disadvantaged students and those from minority backgrounds, with black pupils the most likely to be discriminated against. One report found just % of predicted grades were correct. Labour is calling for radical action on higher education admissions, saying they will scrap university offers based on predicted grades and implement a new fairer system of post-qualication admissions The plans would also end the controversial use of unconditional offers. Angela Rayner MP, Labour’s Shadow Secretary of State for Education, said: “The higher education admissions system isn’t working for students, and radical action is needed to change that. Predicted grades are wrong in the vast majority of cases, and disadvantaged students, in particular, are losing out on opportunities on the basis of those inaccurate predictions. No one should be left out of our education system just because of their background, yet with grants scrapped and fees tripled, the system is now deeply unfair.    The move has previously been supported by academics union the UCU and is currently being considered by Universities UK as a potential reform. The reform has already been proposed by the union which represents university lecturers and is being considered by UK universities. A Universities UK spokesperson: “The university admissions system must be fair and transparent, able to serve the needs of a erse group of applicants from a wide range of backgrounds. “Universities UK recently launched a review of admissions, involving UCAS, students, and senior representatives from schools, colleges and universities. We will be exploring post-qualication admissions as part of this review. It will collect evidence on how the current admissions system works, identy the challenges relating to offer making and recommend best practice in the interests of students.” Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, said: Allowing people to apply after they receive their results would help level the playing field for students, remove the problems associated with unconditional offers and end the chaotic clearing scramble. The current system, based on inaccurately predicted results, is failing students and it is time we adopted the type of system used around the rest of the world where university offers are based on actual achievements instead of guesswork. David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, said: The Labour Party has recognised weaknesses in the current admissions system which must be addressed and which have concerned colleges, including the increased use of unconditional offers. With only % of applicants achieving their predicted A-level grades, it is clear that pre-results applications are problematic. However, some education bodies have warned caution.

Hugging the lucky ginger tom, the delighted couple told how Andrew bought the £million-winning scratchcard after going to get a tin of Whiskas. Andrew drove to his local petrol station, but forgot to buy six-year-old Shorty’s regular chicken treat. Instead he got some petrol and the £ Monopoly Millionaire scratchcard. Andrew,  who runs a catering business with Paula, , explained: “We’d had a busy -hour sht and forgot his food so I said I’d nip out. “The plan was to fill the car up with fuel and then get the cat food. “But while paying for the fuel I bought the scratchcard then sat in the car. “Then I realised I’d forgotten the cat food...

Norbert Farkas, , of Parkside Road in Birkenhead, pleaded guilty to two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal following the shocking discovery.His partner Leila Horvath, , also of Parkside Road, pleaded guilty to two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal, one count of poisoning and failing to see that the dog received proper medical attention. Wirral Magistratesapos Court heard how on April  this year RSPCA inspector Anthony Joynes was contacted by environmental health officers to attend an alleyway in Birkenhead.Chris Murphy, prosecuting, told the court how Mr Joynes found a dead American bulldog wrapped in bin bags and a paddling pool. Mr Murphy said that the dogaposs body was covered with live maggots, the Liverpool Echo reports.The court heard how Mr Joynes then went to question Farkas about the dead dog, whose home overlooked the alleyway. Farkas initially said that that the dog was not his, but then admitted that it was his animal. He said that the dog had attacked him so he hit it with a metal bar in self-defence and to protect his Horvath. When Mr Joynes later questioned Horvath, she admitted that she fed the dog anti-freeze and then stabbed her. Luna, an American bulldog, had recently given birth to  puppies. Mr Murphy later provided graphic details of the events that led up to the dogaposs death.    He explained how Farkas struck the dog with a weights bar. After going online to research how to kill a dog, Horvath fed the animal chicken land sausages aced with anti-freeze. The court heard that Horvath thought the dog would die quickly but the animal lay in the alleyway lingering to le. On the third day Horvath took a large kne and later stabbed the animal in the throat. Mr Murphy made it clear that the couple would have been able to see the dog as it lay whimpering in the alleyway over a three day period. District Judge Nicholas Sanders told the court that the case was one of unimaginable cruelty. Horvath told probation officers that Lunaaposs behavior began to deteriorate after she gave birth to puppies. She said that she bought anti-freeze from a nearby garage and laced it on sausages, which were fed to the dog. Horvath said that she thought the dog would die quickly but it did not. She said that the dog was making strange noises and she was concerned that neighbours might call the police. She then decided to grab a large kitchen kne and stab the dog to death. She told probation officers that they had been reviled by the local community after the incident and had to move to a new address.    Farkas said he had been advised by health professionals to buy a large dog to help treat his mental health problems and stress. Farkas also claimed that Luna became aggressive toward them after she gave birth to puppies. He claimed that this aggressive behaviour led up to the attack on him. He claimed to have suffered a panic attack after the dog attacked him and said that was why his partner decided to kill it. Thomas Hanlon, defending, said that Horvath took full responsibility for her actions.  He said that the couple arrived in the UK from Hungary in  and had both worked full time since arriving, contributing to society. Mr Hanlon said that the couple had been targeted after their animals were seized by the RSPCA, and that a petrol bomb was thrown at their home.  He said the couple were forced to leave their home in the night after the attack. Mr Murphy said that a vets report found thatthe dog had attacked Farkas in the way he claimed he would have suffered serious injuries which he did not have. District Judge Sanders told the couple: You struck the dog with a metal bar, and then you poisoned it with anti-freeze before stabbing it.  It is hard to imagine a more cruel way of dealing with an animal.

Khalid Qadeer, who works as a tax adviser in London, is a frequent customer at the food chain and would always opt for its signature tuna baguette sandwich. However, the tax adviser was shocked to find out the sandwich contained white wine vinegar, after noticing the ingredient listed on a new printed label. White wine vinegar is not considered halal in Islam. Despite that, the ingredient is also not listed on fridge labels in store. Pret has come under fire in recent months over the deaths of two customers who suffered allergic reactions from consuming the restaurantaposs food.    They have since placed new labels containing a full list of ingredients on all Pret food products - and Mr Qadeer has slammed Pret for failing to mention white wine vinegar as a listed ingredient until now. Mr Qadeer said white wine vinegar is like a nut allergy for many Muslims as they have zero tolerance towards it. He told : Being a Muslim I can’t consume anything with alcohol. And there’s probably thousands of Muslims who buy products from Pret. As most people know, some Muslims drink alcohol and the rest, but there is a certain percentage that will have a “oh what the f***” moment here. He added: I’ve worked in the City for the last  years as a tax adviser and I would have never bought the product had I known. Mr Qadeer complained to his local Pret store manager and his case was later escalated to Pret’s CEO, Clive Schlee.

Meghan, , wanted to use the opportunity to shine a light on female trailblazers – and she insisted she would NOT be a cover girl. The former Suits star had graced scores of glossy publications in her days as a Hollywood actress. But since joining the Royal Family she and husband Harry have vowed to use their profiles to highlight issues close to their hearts. So she was determined to use her stint at the helm of the legendary fashion “bible” to highlight a collection of erse women breaking barriers – like climate activist Greta Thunberg, actress and activist Jane Fonda and New Zealandaposs Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. Vogueaposs editor in chief, Edward Enninful, explained: From the very beginning, we talked about the cover - whether she would be on it or not. “In the end, she felt that it would be in some ways a aposboastful thing to do for this particular project. She wanted, instead, to focus on the women she admires.    Meghanaposs critics claimed, of course, that she was having a dig at her sister-in-law, Kate, who featured on the front of Vogue in . But Harry and both his parents have also been fashion mag favourites along with other members of the Windsor clan. We browsed the archives to find the royal cover stars. Duchess of Cambridge In June  Kate posed for a series of stunning photos for the centenary edition of Vogue magazine. A keen photographer herself, the Duchess also agreed for two images from the shoot to go on show in an exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery  Duke of Cambridge In the same year his we was in Vogue, Prince William showed heaposs got attitude. He become the first member of the royal family to be photographed for the cover of a gay magazine and gave an interview. In the July edition of Attitude William discussed he mental health implications of homophobic, bi-phobic and transphobic bullying,His mother, Princess Diana, who was patron of the National Aids Trust, appeared on the cover of the Gay Times in a  tribute issue after her death. Princess Eugenie To mark her  birthday in , Andrew and Fergieaposs youngest daughter featured on the front cover of society magazine, Tatler.In the accompanying interview she talked about having major surgery to correct a spinal condition, her love of Radio  and Big Brother and why she, sister Beatrice and their Mum call themselves “the tripod.”   Prince Harry In  Harry appeared on the cover of GQ, to promote his Walking With the Wounded charity. He was just about to leave for Norway to train with a group of wounded servicemen preparing to trek to the North Pole. Harry joined them for the first five days of their gruelling, but ultimately successful walk. The Prince told GQ: aposaposThis extraordinary expedition will raise awareness of the debt that this country owes to those it sends off to fight - only for them towounded and scarred, physically and emotionally. The debt extends beyond immediate medical care and short-term rehabilitation. These men and women have given so much.  aposaposWe must recognise their sacrice, be thankful, so far as we can ever repay them for it.aposapos Princess Diana Diana is considered the ultimate royal cover girl and appeared on the front of numerous mags including Vanity Fair and Harpers Bazaar. But her four Vogue covers – three in the Britain and one in the US – became iconic.  Her first appearance was in , ahead of her wedding to Charles. But ten years later, just before they split, she captivated the world by revealing her new, short hair cut. Zara Tindall Newly-married Zara appeared on the front cover of Hello magazine a month after she tied the know with rugby star Mike Tindall. Princess Anneaposs horsewoman daughter spoke about her big day and why theyaposd postponed the honeymoon tor a three-day eventing competition.  And she also got to plug her new range of riding gear.

Prince Charles In November  the Prince of Wales guest-edited Country Le magazine to mark his  birthday.

Ben Muscroft, , who weighed st lbs, was already embarrassed on the flight there, when he had to ask for a seatbelt extension and could not lower his meal tray. After the trip, Ben decided that “something had to change” and started attending a Slimming World group near his home in Hillsborough, Sheffield. Now, after slimming to st lbs, and going from a size XXXXXL to a ins waist, he has been crowned Slimming World Man of the Year.    And after meeting new girlfriend Karen Parker at the slimming class, they plan to go to China together so he can tackle the Great Wall again. “I was too unfit to walk any of it, which I really regret,” he said. Always the “big kid” at school, his weight ballooned on a diet of a bacon, sausage and egg sandwich for breakfast, fish and chips for lunch, and spaghetti bolognese or pizza for dinner, along with cans of cider or two bottles of wine. “Before I lost weight le was just hard. I couldn’t walk for more than five minutes,” he said. “I couldn’t even roll over in bed.” Ben, who once struggled to walk longer than five minutes, told how he never dreamed he would find anyone who wanted to be with him. Mr Muscroft said of the  trip to see his brother: “Just getting to China was a bit of a battle. “I had to ask for a seatbelt extension in front of the entire plane which wasn’t the greatest of starts.    “Then the tray table wouldn’t lie flat, so I had to eat my meals at a strange angle. It wasn’t a pleasant way to spend  hours. “Then when we got to China, my size meant I missed out on certain activities. I also became something of a talking point because many people had never seen anyone my size before - so the looks and stares were plentul. “When you weigh more than st even the simplest tasks really take it out of you. I couldn’t walk the short distance to Hillsborough football stadium without getting out of breath.” But after joining Slimming World his le has transformed. After being crowned top slimmer, Mr Muscroft now hopes toto China next year with his new girlfriend, Karen Parker, , and tackle the Great Wall of China.    The pair, who have known each other for  years, only got together after meeting in slimming class. Now they are hoping to see the world together. “I met someone special too – my girlfriend, Karen. At the size I was I’d grown used to the idea that I’d never find anyone who wanted to be with me. “My Slimming World group didn’t just change my le, it gave me a le I never thought I’d be lucky enough to have. “Next year I’m planning on ing to China with Karen so that she can meet my brother and I know this trip will be full of amazing memories. “We’ve got our whole future ahead of us and I can’t wait to see what’s in store.” Ben lost weight after switching to fruits and fat-free natural yogurt to start the day and a homemade coriander and mint chicken dish to end it.

Allegations have been made that underage girls were used as sex slaves and repeatedly abused inside a temple on the island.    Epstein died on Saturday in a Manhattan correction facility having apparently hanged himself in his cell. And last night it emerged the warden at the federal jail where he was found dead awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges has been removed.US Attorney General William Barr ordered the removal after condemning serious irregularities at the facility.

Europa League third qualying round lead from last week’s first leg.A miserable result on the Continent was compounded for NAC Breda loanee Leigh and his team-mates when they suffered a - Premiership reverse to St Mirren in soaking Paisley on Sunday.Nevertheless, the -year-old is convinced the Dons know what they need to do to fight their way to the Euro play-off round and keep their hopes of the lucrative group stages alive.He said: “Everybody who plays in these big competitions comes up against this at some point.“We’ve obviously come up against it really early.“We’re a strong group. Sunday was annoying, but we’ll get back stronger, kick on to Thursday and show what we can do.”Englishman Leigh pointed to May’s Anfield stunner when Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool overturned Barca’s - first leg lead with a - victory to reach the pinnacle of the European game.He said: “People wrote off Liverpool against Barca. But it’s a strong position to know what you have to do before you go into the game.“For example, a -, - scoreline is dficult for everybody, because you think, do we press  Do we sit off  Do we defend “But we know we need to score as many goals as possible – at least two – and not concede.“That’s a game plan we can go with and say ‘this is how we’re going to play to do that’.“It’s obviously a worry, but we just need to go out and do it.”Away in Rijeka, and at the Simple Digital Arena, Derek McInnes’ Dons have struggled to put the intricate attacking puzzle together.In Croatia, they kept the game goalless to half-time.However, against Jim Goodwin’s well-organised Saints, they were suckered after  minutes by Ilkay Durmus’ goal on the counter.One thing’s for sure, they need to come flying out of the traps at Pittodrie and find the flair they did in the - home victory over Georgians Chikhura Sachkhere.Leigh said: “No, we can’t . It’s something the manager has addressed after the game and that the players are aware of.“We know what we have to do as early as possible to give ourselves a chance.“Going away to a place like Rijeka, we didn’t show what we were about.“In the first game, we were obviously going in thinking not conceding was the ideal scenario.“But we know we have to show them what we’re about at Pittodrie, we’ve done that so farand we’ve got to do it again.”One problem on the horizon is the potential absence of Sam Cosgrove for the crunch meeting with Rijeka, as the hitman has a hamstring problem.Curtis Main was unable to fill Cosgrove’s sizeable boots in Paisley, but Leigh thinks inidual absences can’t be allowed to derail the team.Squad players like Scott Wright, Connor McLennan and new signing Zak Vyner were also below their best against Saints.Leigh said: “We need to be able to play without certain players.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Day one saw us head out from Carloway aboard the SYSAC II under the watchful eye of skippper Robbie Bell who knows these waters like the back of his hand.The day kicked off with a bait hunt in the East Loch but the mackerel were pretty scarce, it took an hour or so to fill the baskets before steaming out to the two-mile mark in search of spurdogs. By then there was a fair wee wind picking up and it was a tad rough to say the least, with the heavy swell claiming a few breakfasts along the way.All that was soon forgotten as the battle commenced with the mighty spurs. The action started on the first drop with some thumpers coming aboard, single and double shots causing mayhem thrashing about the deck and we lost count of the number of rigs sliced through on the way up. But that’s what we came for, not everyone’s choice but great sport all the same.In between the madness we picked away at the haddock, whiting, grey and red gurnard, ling and pollack, until we had our quota and decided to seek the smoother waters of East Loch Roag for some flattie bashing on the soft ground. It was good to get into the calm and fish the light gear, picking away for dabs and plaice. There was plenty around, nothing huge but a steady flow coming aboard taking us to the end of the day with a good mixed bag of species.Day two set off in brilliant sunshine and not a breath of wind, it was almost tropical conditions. We quickly got our supply of fresh bait in West Loch Roag and set off for the rough ground in search of a few more species, but there was little or no drt so we took a turn into Clf Bay and settled in for a day on the rays. It was brilliant fun, everyone got their fair share with loads of thornback rays and a few spotted rays coming aboard, plenty of dabs, plaice, dogfish and a bonus lb oz turbot to add to the tally. It was a great opportunity to brush up on some of fishing techniques that don’t get practised much at home.We decided to hit the hard ground on the way back to the harbour. It was quite slow, maybe a wee bit early yet, but it produced more haddock, a lovely lb cuckoo wrasse and pollack bringing our two day adventure to an end. All in all another excellent club trip.This year we picked up  species,  counting fish and a few personal bests. Add to that, great company, loads of banter, a good skipper who makes a mean cup o’ tea and you have the ideal ingredients for another memorable few days away on Lewis. We’ll be back next year for sure.Results: Nikki Thompson  points, Robert MacBrayne , Nick Friel , Jim Smith , Gary Sinclair , Steven MacBrayne ."},{"url":null,"title":"mach1 scottish tarmack rally championship report","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWith  starters and  Cobble shop STRC registered the championship tables were always going to change on this mid-season two day event.Sunshine was forecast for the Machrihanish Airbase Community Companycourse and that’s what was delivered. Some crews were hoping for rain but this year it wasn’t to be. Last year’s winner Bruce Edwards in the Darrian T GTR was favourite and since Bruce had not driven the car competitively since Mach   we all thought he would be a bit rusty.Bruce led from the start and set some impressive times throughout the two days but on the last stage he threw it all away and rolled the car as he clipped a large lorry tyre a mile from the finish line, unable to right the car and with the stage blocked the clerk of the course decided on the grounds of safety to cancel the final stage. This allowed Alistair Inglis in the lotus Exige and a previous Mach  winner to clinch the top spot.Class  had  STRC registered this year and new to class  was Tom Blackwood in the gorgeous yellow and Black Fiesta R+. Tom#s first event driving in anger and showed that with some tweaks here and there with suspension settings it’s a great car to drive. How well the car drives notwithstanding, there was a slight moment coming out of one of the tight sections onto the main runway when Tom ran wide and clipped a boundary fence damaging the front bumper of the car but kept the fence intact. Tom finished third Overall and second in class .John Rintoul in another Fiesta R on the back of the recent win at Crail was on it all weekend but just couldn’t clinch the win this year, John finished second overall and took the class win.Alan Wallace in the distinctive green and white Mitsubishi Evo finished a very well deserved th overall and third in class. Harry Chalmers was a Mach  virgin and loved every mile of the venue. Harry commented at the end of the event they we had no problems at all on day one and the car ran faultlessly all day to give him a real confidence boost to push on harder and let him get used to some new parts on the car. Harry kept it neat all day and came away with rd overall after day one.Day two was very fast. Fastest he’s probably been in the car to date with these faster stages suiting faster cars Harry just had to push on brake late and keep it tidy and with that being said the team dropped to th overall due to some of the quicker cars retiring out.Harry said: #I couldn’t be happier for how this event turned out for the team and are all delighted with the result and how far they have come.#Harry also managed the full two days on the same Hankook Tyres Finishing th overall.Alan Stark in the stunning Red Mitsubishi Evo had decided he was playing the long game and would drive accordingly. The plan went well and they played about with tyres trying to make them last for the two days. On the second last stage on the Saturday the manold gasket started to blow and he lost a fair bit of power mid stage. The service crew managed to bolt it up again but the long stages were killing it and it usually faded about  rds in each time.On Sunday he decided to push on a bit and of course it bit him. The interior mirror fell off and he became aware there was a car coming up behind after a merge but wasn’t sure how close. He decided to do the next lollipop and then see where he was on the straight but in his enthusiasm got to him and he understeered into the bales bouncing off them, hitting his bonnet. He also noticed the brake pads were rattling more than usual and it turned out they had lost a pin. The team had to improvise with spare tyre borrowed from Allan Wallace which didn’t quite fit but they wired it in and it lasted.Class  had  STRC registered crews this year and top spot and current championship leader in class went to Colin Gemmell in the Mark  Escort. Colin had a trouble-free run on both days and managed to finish the event th overall just  seconds behind Tom Blackwood and second in class.Alistair Inglis winner of the  Mach  stages kept just ahead all weekend. Nothing could touch his car which stuck to the road like glue.Inglis said: #Overall victory and a class win  Can’t get any better.#Robert Marshall in the Mark  Escort was looking forward to some decent results but an issue on day one with the car losing all its water put an end to any real chances and on day two an engine mount broke putting an end to what Robert described as a perfect weekend.Ross Auld was a welcomethe Mark  Escort and also managed a couple of days assistance in setting up the venue. Ross had managed to set some decent times on Saturday but late in the day the alternator belt snapped and took with it the dry sump belt causing the engine to cease. Ross loaded up the car and headed home and by the Sunday evening he had the engine out the car ahead of its rebuild.Class  saw four STRC registered crews compete in Kintyre this year and top of the list was Greg Inglis in the Lotus Exige. Greg exited the last stage on the Saturday and noticed the rear brake calliper hanging off. A call was made to Montrose where a spare part was removed from a car and the handover was done half way between Montrose and Machrihanish. Greg finished a respectful fth overall and took the class win.Second in class and th overall was Michael Harbour in the Mark  Escort, on the back of electrical problems that saw the team fail to finish the last round at Crail the team have now got the car singing on the stages. Michael didn’t report any issues during the weekend and brought the car home in one piece.Michael Robertson isn’t having the best of luck this season as the Honda Civic Type R driver reported issues with the CV joint that led to driveshaft and df failure but as usual the team loved the event and will be back for sure.Class , with eight registered STRC in class  the battles were all tensely close. Taking top honours in the class was Kyle Adam a full two minutes ahead of nearest class  car of Des Campbell. Kyle also managed a top  overall clinching th spot and despite some overheating at one point the car ran faultlessly doing his championship hopes no harm.Lochgilphead local, Jamie Miller in the C R Max loves the track and had the luxury of booking indoor servicing. With navigator Ian McCulloch, his biggest problems were brake related but with some fluid changes and adjustments it was just all back to normal for the team finishing a well-deserved th overall and fourth in class.Kayleigh Strachan in the Citroen Saxo finished th in class on the event and th overall but managed to pick up  points and th in class in the STRC.Gary Coutts in the Fiesta commented after the final stage on the Sunday that on the second to last stage of day one he developed a few ‘minor’ issues. A change of driveshaft, ball joint, wheels and tyres seemed to cure the problem. With an early start on the Sunday morning the car was back on form. Loss of intercom on way to stage  and a half spin on stage  cost them a bit of time and after a few tweaks at service they were away again. The last stage of the day was cancelled resulting in a th overall and th in class.Alan Watt was again out in the green Saxo and finished th in class and st overall. A great result for the team with no damage or mechanical issues to report.Class  had four teams registered in the STRC this year at Mach  but only one managed to finish.

Goddards were granted permission to turn the house into a wedding venue with marquees in July , but Scottish Borders Council imposed strict conditions on the use after receiving strong objections from neighbours.One condition, that the planning permission was only valid for two years, was removed on appeal but the condition that only two rooms can be rented out in the mansion at a time has remained in place.The most recent application, submitted by Lanark-based Burrel Design Studios on behalf of the Goddards, seeks to lt this condition and allow guests to stay in the mansions year-round.A supporting statement accompanying the application reads: ldquoThe effect of the councilrsquos ruling means that year-round self-catering accommodation may legitimately be offered in the lodge, the white house and penthouse, and the rights bestowed under the planning acts mean that year-round bed and breakfast accommodation may be offered for a maximum of two bedrooms within Hartree

the historic structure from being a building lsquoat riskrsquo to being a fully restored historic building incorporating some contemporary elements, which have served to reconcile former unsympathetic earlier additions and have made the building fit for occupation in the current age.ldquoRegrettably, the limitations imposed by the planning status of the property at Hartree have restricted the opportunity for the current owners to accommodate visitors who have wished to re-establish their connection with Hartree House.ldquoThe opportunity to offer accommodation in Hartree House to guests will add signicantly to the attraction of Hartree as a venue and will assist towards the upkeep of the house and grounds.A castle, known as Hartree Tower, was present on the site by at least the th century, but was demolished in the late th century by Colonel Alexander Dickson, who rebuilt the current Hartree House in its place.In , the property was passed to Elizabeth Dickson after her brother

Applying the guidelines in the approved supplementary planning guidance, there would be no signicant loss of light or privacy to Orchard House from this property.ldquoIn terms of the impact of the house on plot five on Orchard house, the garage would be positioned on the eastern side of the proposed house and the decking is shown on the western side beyond the rear wing.ldquoThere would be a window and door to the garage and a window to a WC in the rear elevation, which are not considered to be habitable rooms.

Built around a single, beautully menacing chord, which apparently symbolises the background radiation in our universe, the finale discusses the search for discovering a unying theory of everything.To quote Small from Imprints, As you travel through space, you are displaced, imagining time. You exist like a plant, you bloom and you grow, then wither and die. But the one card you play, genetically, is always an ace.

at Barrel Law, near Hawick.In September, plans for an poundm wind farm were rejected by Scottish Borders councillors.The proposal would have seen seven turbines, of up to m in height, erected on land to the north-west of Roberton, near Hawick.The company behind the plans, Germany-based ABO Wind, then submitted an appeal to the Scottish Governmentrsquos planning and environmental appeals ision .As part of that appeal process, the DPEArsquos appointed reporter Elspeth Cook held a hearing at Forman Hall, Roberton.However, the hearing was simply to clary and define legal terms and certain technical standards in order to help inform Ms Cookrsquos decision.For example, one point of contention between Scottish Borders Council and ABO Wind is whether or not the combined appearance of Barrel Law and the existing wind turbines at Langhope Rig will create a lsquolandscape with wind turbinesrsquo or a lsquowind turbine landscapersquo, as per the legally-defined definitions.The councilrsquos position is that a distance of between -km is required in order to maintain the current landscape type in the valley, but ABO Wind suggest the turbines should be less than km apart, as they state that spreading out the two turbine sites would actually make the landscape look more saturated as the wind turbines would effectively cover a larger area.Furthermore, they state that a greater distance between the two developments would push the Barrel Law turbines outside of the topography which makes wind farms viable in this area.Appearing as part of ABO Windrsquos  of representatives, land and development consultant James Welsh told the reporter: ldquoIn our opinion we preserve the distinct identity of the two groups.ldquoThere are examples of wind farms being approved with similar distances between them but still being accepted as being clearly separate wind farms.ldquoTo insist on a greater separation would increase the effect of a cumulative effect between them.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning consultant, Dr Guy Wimble, said: ldquoI donrsquot dispute that they are identiable as separate elements, my issue is the effect of the wind farms on the landscape, and recognising that they are two dferent wind farms not one development.ldquoThe proximity of them makes this appear more of a wind farm landscape rather a landscape with wind farms.ldquoWhile I accept that separating the developments would make the wind farms seem more spaced out, by putting them closer yoursquod increase density.John Campbel QC, appearing on behalf of a group of objectors called Barrel Law Action Group, said: ldquoIf you pull the wind farms apart then clearly you increase the area of cumulative effect.ldquoIf you pull them together, yoursquore going to increase the cumulative effect just by sheer numbers, and you lose the ability to discern the two as distinct entities.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, appearing in his capacity as Scottish Borders Councilrsquos executive member for planning and environment, told the hearing: ldquoIt seems to me that the guidance allows for developments in this area but doesnrsquot necessarily promote it.ldquoNo one is disputing that the two wind farms would be separate, wersquore working to find out what degree of separation would be appropriate.Mr Welsh responded: ldquoIf you increase to a km distance it will push all m turbines outwith the area that has been identied as having the appropriate topography for this type of development.Ms Cook also sought clarication on certain technical points, mostly surrounding tables and figures contained within ious reports submitted by the appellant and the local authority."},{"url":null,"title":"art-thou-shakespeare-cyclists","story":"BORDERS

There was a lot of spirit and a feeling that a number of towns in Scotland which have been forgotten, like Campbeltown, will not be left behind after independence.#He put the turnout at more than , and added: #The fact that the march extended theof Longrow gives a fair indication of the numbers who were there.He also told the Courier this week that he remained the #legal indentity# of the All Under One Banner group, despite a bitter public row among the hierarchy which looks like splitting the group in two.It was the biggest rally held in the town in recent years with marchers coming from as far afield as Aberdeen and Alloa and as well as Oban, Glasgow and Islay, with many travelling on the weekend ferry from Ardrossan.#It really exceeded expectations and made a big splash in the town, Ron Wilson of Yes Kintyre told The National.#There was a real buzz as people came early and most of the hotels were booked up. The pubs and cafes were busy so it was good for local businesses. Campbeltown is a Yes town and it was brilliant to have all these people come here. Local people were coming off the pavements and joining the procession so it created a good, positive vibe.Pro-Unionists opponents held their own counter demonstation. However, the march went off without any incident and there were no arrests, with only one warning which was drug related.A spit of rain earlier in the day failed to develop into poor weather as the marchers would round the town to hear speakers and listen to musicians at the rally at Kinloch Green.Mr Wilson said he was particuarly pleased at the turnout as there had been some confusion over whether the march would go ahead due to internal sions within the hierachcy of All Under One Banner, which has organised independence marches across the country.Following Mr Singh#s sacking, founder Neil Mackay resigned from his position on its national executive pending an internal investigation.Pro-UK Unionist group A Force For Good met the march on the shore front and say they filmed and counted the marchers, as they have at previous events, and afterwards claimed the turnout was just .Director, Alistair McConnachie, said: #All Under One Banner is basically the marching wing of the SNP. AUOB, and SNP MPs and MSPs, lie about the numbers which attend their marches, sometimes up to  or  times.#Unfortunately, they are not challenged by the Scottish media. The good news is that A Force For Good has a presence at every AUOB march. We bear witness to the huge value of the United Kingdom.  Our #Thin Red Line# stands for everyone who likes being British, who likes the UK, and who wants us to stay together.#A group from Barrowfield at the Campbeltown cross ahead of the march.

are fortunate in Scotland to have a way out of such dficulties in the form of a Debt Arrangement Scheme , which is one of Scotland’s best-kept secrets.  It’s available from charitable organisations such as StepChange and from commercial debt advisers such as TC Debt Solutions, too.  It is a Scottish Government scheme that is legally binding and prevents creditors from taking further action against people who owe money.Set up back in  by the Scottish Government, the scheme allows people to freeze interest and charges on their debts and pay their debts off interest-free over a longer period of time.  This brings payments down to levels that people can afford and gives people the chance to get their lives back on track.  Interest and charges are simply written off.Apart from reducing debt, one of the best things about the DAS scheme is that it protects people from their creditors but is not a form of insolvency: people get to pay back their debt in an affordable way.  Lenders like the scheme because they know they will eventually get their money back – and borrowers like it because they don’t have to pay interest charges and they get longer to pay their debts off.  It’s a case of everyone wins.There’s plenty of information about the Debt Arrangement Scheme online at  www.aib.gov.uk debt-arrangement-scheme.  Thousands of people have used the scheme, but so many

summer tournament, winning the competition in , the one-off match was played in a good spirit, but it was the Pupils who found their ruthless streak to snatch a win in the closing minutes.Rhu, fielding a team with plenty of height and energy, featuring several former youth players from Dumbarton FC # and former teammates of Pupils’ playmaker Donald McCallum # threatened early on.At the other end, though, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils had first-half chances, with Scott Souden and youngster Calum McKillop both having one-on-one opportunities, but their efforts were stopped by the Rhu keeper.The second half exploded into le on the hour mark as former Sons youth Callum Scott made his mark for Rhu, turning inside his marker to curl a classy left-footed finish beyond stand-in goalkeeper Ellis Robertson.Undeterred, the Pupils searched for an equaliser, and were given the opportunity minutes later when a Rhu handball in the box was penalised by referee Thomas d’Alessandro.John McCallum, playing as sweeper in a back three with Fraser Wylie and Ross Souden, stepped up to send the keeper the wrong way and make it -.However, after a lapse in concentration, the Pupils conceded a second goal, a cleverly guided header from a near-post corner evading Robertson in goal.Then, with the -degree heat and high humidity making the game hard work for both teams, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils rallied to equalise.A sweeping move involving midfield trio Keith Mitchell, Stuart Crossan and Donald McCallum found Scott Souden, who made no mistake when bearing down on goal, lashing a right-foot shot past the Rhu keeper, to the delight of his teammates and the clutch of Campbeltonians making the long journey to spectate.Then, in the dying seconds, after seeing shots blocked at their own end, thanks to some vital interventions from Robertson, the Pupils stole a winner when midfield substitute Finn Scott was teed up by Scott Souden to slot the ball home low beyond the Rhu keeper, ensuring the visitors completed pre-season unbeaten.Pupils manager Campbell Robertson said: ‘The conditions were tough, but the boys played really well, and our shape was good too. We would like to thank Rhu Amateurs for their excellent post-match hospitality.’Meanwhile, the Pupils’ centenary season officially starts tomorrowwhen they host Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star at Kintyre Park, in the SAFL’s aptly named Centenary Cup, with a pm kick-off.And with two more Saturday group matches to follow in August, firstly away to Dunoon and then at home to Tarbert, the Pupils will look to continue their dazzling pre-season form once the competitive action begins.Photograph:"},{"url":null,"title":"simply the best for james","story":"James was + after nine holes and then proceeded to put together an excellent back nine to finish on +.Meanwhile Donald had gone to + n the front nine only to fall back on the inward nine and finished on +.Result: , James Williamson +  ,  Donald Brown +  ,  Bill Brannigan +  ,  Sandy Watson +  , Ken MacMillan +  , Robert Cook  +."},{"url":null,"title":"letter trying to keep everyone happy","story":"We, as the private landowners, have endeavoured throughout the years to make this historical area  as fully accessible to the general public as possible.Our use of introducing a few sheep to graze down the grass over certain months of the year is our preferred method but often, when summer visitors appear, we find the animals get frequently disturbed and distressed with human contact , and very often remove them in busy months to avoid any upset.The larger access gate is frequently left wide open, leading to constant rounding up of the livestock and  posing a danger to the passing road users, with even the odd complaint about our animals ‘deposits’  around the Footprints area coming into the equation too.Changing climate conditions have ensured that bracken and other plant species have increased in volume as every year passes and with worry about the decreasing insect population and visiting dogs perhaps being harmed by ingesting sprayed grass, we have never used any chemical solutions to help keep the undergrowth at bay.Strimming has been used on occasions  but this, too, has produced complaints from the public about the unnecessary removal of wild flowers and plants that provide food for the visiting bird and butterfly population.Sign posts are often needlessly torn down and often used to fuel beach fires and barbecues, with even the old, fragile, stone dyke surrounding the area being constantly clambered over,  rather than using the access gate, causing stones to be dislodged and even the wall being  deliberately dismantled, in order to use the stones to construct fire pits for outdoor cooking.In short, we’ve found there are never any easy answers when it comes to trying to keep everyone happy.Yours,Catherine Barbour,"},{"url":null,"title":"top artist jolomo finds inspiration on his doorstep","story":"The latest exhibition by John Lowrie Morrison, which opens on Saturdayat the Archway Gallery in Lochgilphead, concentrates on paintings of Crinan and Knapdale, landscapes found within a few miles of his Tayvallich home.Although John’s work is now sought out by collectors all over the world, he continues to exhibit every August at his #local# gallery # this will be his th solo exhibition at the Archway.

Their leader, Richard Leonard, was left speechless. The Shadow Chancellor had directly contradicted Labours  manesto promise to oppose a repeat referendum. Only in March, Leonard made clear in an interview with the Daily Record, that a future Labour government would, like Theresa May, refuse any request for a ldquoSection  Order to trigger a legally-binding referendum on independence. No s no buts.:Scottish Labour registers lowest level of income in nearly two decadesNot any more, it seems. The Branch Office, as the SNP like to call Scottish Labour, has been told to back the policy of their deadly enemy. Christmas has come early for Nicola Sturgeon, without the turkeys.Many Scottish Labour MSPs were incandescent, as was the former Labour shadow Scottish secretary Ian Murray MP, who called McDonnell ldquoludicrous and demanded that he ldquoapologise to Richard Leonard , and reaffirm Labours policy of opposition to a referendum . Off-the-record comments from Scottish Labour figures were unprintable. Unionist Labour MSPs put together a statement ldquodeploring\" the change in policy. This backfired when it emerged they hadnt cleared it with Richard Leonards office.The Labour MP, Paul Sweeney, then added to the confusion by calling for a multi-option referendum including federalism, or devo max as it used to be called. This was once proposed by Alex Salmond in , and rejected by Labour and the Conservatives in favour of a binary Yes No question. Saying Labour were all over the place would be an insult to geography.So, what on earth is going on  Why was one of the key figures in the UK Labour party provoking a split on one of the most contentious issues in British politics  And right in the middle of the Brexit row. Labour is now ided every which way on the constitution: over Scottish independence and over leaving Europe. McDonnell has left the Scottish party an impossible task: trying to win Scottish votes without a policy on Scotland in a general election thats possibly weeks away.:Scottish Labour breaks silence over anti-semitism investigation by blasting \"biased\" BBCWhat seems to have happened is this. Labour, at a UK level, has started to think about forming much wider political alliances in future in order to defeat the rising tide of the right. This has been discussed by a number of Labour people, including the former BBC economics editor Paul Mason in his book Clear Bright Future.Mason has argues that Labour should abandon its traditional base in the white working class and the trades union movement, and look to creating a new progressive alliance, or ldquopopular front, with LGBT and BAME groups, and with other progressive political parties. Mason regards the SNP, unlike most other nationalist parties, as progressive and social democratic. On the eve of McDonnells Edinburgh interview Mason called infor ldquoa penalty-free independence referendum whenever Holyrood chooses.Im not saying that Paul Mason is writing Labour policy. Far from it. Many in the party regard him with suspicion, not least for appearing to abandon the working class. But it looks asthe Labour leadership has finally been persuaded that the SNP is not just a band of ldquotartan Tories, and that Jeremy Corbyn could do business with Nicola Sturgeon.Scottish Labour is anyway likely to be crushed again in the forthcoming General Wlection, while the SNP is in line for around  Westminster seats according to the polls. Its support would almost certainly be requiredLabour is to try to form a government, and McDonnells intervention could be an attempt to prepare the ground. Theres been no love lost between Corbyn and the mostly Blairite rump of the Scottish Labour Party, so he probably regards them as expendable.Not that Labour is admitting any of this. Indeed, the line from McDonnell in Edinburgh, echoed by the Shadow Business Secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey on Newsnight, is that Labour will not form any ldquocoalitions or pacts with anyone. Labour is still smarting from those Tory election posters in  which showed the then leader, Ed Miliband, in Alex Salmonds breast pocket. It is imperative for Labour, in England at least, to deny any hint of an alliance with the SNP.But Scotland is a dferent. A ing Labour government in Westminster would require the tacit assistance of the SNP, perhaps on a confidence and supply basis. At any rate, the UK party leadership seems to have decided that offering a referendum is a risk worth taking to help some future co-operation to happen. This is huge development and raises questions about whether Labour can still be called a Unionist party.Paul Hutcheon: the biggest threat to the Union is Scottish Labours disintegrationLast week felt asa dam has broken. After three years in which Scottish politics has been in suspended animation, suddenly everyone was talking about independence again. Even Conservative commentators like The Times Iain Martin are now calling for a referendum in five years. s Simon Jenkins believes independence itself is now unavoidable, and called on Westminster to plan for it now.Of course, a referendum may not deliver a Yes. The polls still show Scotland split down the middle on independence. But this is a vindication of Nicola Sturgeons cautious, constitutional approach to winning independence. It is a blow to her critics, who had been calling for an unauthorised referendum, or even UDI. The former SNP MP, George Kerevan, had been calling for mass civil disobedience to obstruct London transport. But this is a blow her internal critics will be happy to take for there is now a real possibility of a referendum in the next couple of years.That isLabour manages to defeat Boris Johnson ndash a big ask, perhaps, but far from impossible. There will likely be a vote of no confidence the Tory PM next month, and he will almost certainly lose. If Labour fails to form an alternative government in  days, then Johnson has to call a General Election. Hes hoping to delay polling day until after Brexit on October . But that is a risky tactic. Such constitutional jiggery pokery could easily alienate voters, many of whom are anyway unconvinced by Johnsons abilities.Just about anything could happen in the next few weeks. But what is not in doubt is that Scottish independence, or at least a referendum, is back on the agenda. And almost exactly five years since the last one."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed-uk-shoppers-want-39-perfect-39-community-high-street","story":"In a land of strip malls, edge-of-town supermarkets and soulless retail parks, shoppers still dream of traditional mom and pop stores.A survey , adults has found a real community shopping street should have baker, a butcher, a barber, post office, and hardware store.And even in an era of downloads, those surveyed said they would want a record shop.So we all know want makes the perfect high street.

It may be the low quality of our petty, patronising political discourse at Scottish, UK and EU level. Or it may be the cringe I feel when I hear that the NHS or the education system or whatever  is the ldquoenvy of the world, with all available evidence suggesting the contrary.Either way, Irsquom not exercised by national identity. My political decisions are made clinically. I am emotionally cold to political parties and to the sides of a referendum campaign. I cast my vote based purely on the perceived risk and reward for me and my family.:UK first in line for trade deal post Brexit, insists US security chief John BoltonAll of this is to make clear that, whilst I may not win a Patriot of the Year award, I am not uncomfortable with the theory of living in an independent Scotland. But in rsquos independence referendum my risk reward matrix led me to vote No. In truth, it was not a dficult choice. I have never doubted the long-term viability of an independent Scotland, but in the short-term I saw a fiscal hole with a policy  which would have made it bigger, not smaller. Too much risk, not enough reward.My choice was not an unusual one it is generally accepted through subsequent polling that uncertainty over the economic case was the central inhibitor to pushing the Yes campaign over the  per cent line.The prospect of a second independence referendum is now real. The  Scottish election is the most important in devolutionrsquos short history. The campaign will be, as good as, single-issue: should there or should there not be another referendum  If the pro-independence partiesa Holyrood majority, based on a clear, unambiguous and identical manesto pledge, then indyref  is in my view a democratic requirement. This is, effectively, the point acknowledged by both John McDonnell and David Mundell last week.How could Yes win  First, it could double-down on the - ldquocampaign ndash tack to the left, promote populist economics, arrange a big march, wave some Palestinian flags, Bairns Not Bombs, End London Rule and all the rest.Perhaps we are in an era where this can work. The recent record of prevailing economic theory winning political arguments is murky. The Yes campaign in  almost won despite the economic orthodoxy running contrary, as did Jeremy Corbyn in , and in , of course, the Leave campaign proved that relentless economic warnings can be ignored by a majority of the population.However this ndash a win based on a socialist fairytale ndash is no way to create a new country. We can damn private enterprise, wealth creators and taxpayers, but without them wersquoll find ourselves at the bottom of a social and economic pit in short order. This is student union politics, and high school economics. Eventhey could win this way, they shouldnrsquot.I spend most days with the Scottish business community. Their world is ruled by risk. And although, of course, this ies industry-to-industry, they generally see three primary political risks affecting their business. The first, and most concerning for them, is a Corbyn-led Labour government, the second is Scottish independence and the third is Brexit. Yes campaigners may wish that this order was radically altered, but that is the reality on the ground.:Mark Smith: How a Wings Over Scotland party could turn Yes to NoMost people in business ndash generally Remainers, generally No voters ndash are miles away from voting Yes, and every time they see the marchers and their flags and their populism on a Saturday afternoon, they move still further. They want to see some adults in the room.It is not as though the SNP doesnrsquot understand this. Andrew Wilsonrsquos Growth Commission was an effort to reassure this key demographic. And it was a very good one, primarily, in my view, because it acknowledged the economic reality of a small country in a big world, and did not bow to populism .But the Wilson report is one of very few items on that side of the balancing scale, still sitting high in the air, weighed down by the cacophony of evidence that the economic argument has not evolved.The SNP needs a long runway to prove that an independent Scotland can be an economic success story. There are a couple of obvious hurdles along the way. The first will come later this year, with the Scottish Governmentrsquos annual Budget. Since the  election ed a minority government, the SNP has relied on Green support for three budgets in a row. Each one has involved further concessions each one has pulled the SNP further left, particularly on tax. Not a lot just a little each time. The  budget will do the same.With the backdrop of a Boris Johnson government which might lower personal taxes in England, an expanding gap between Scottish and English taxpayers will really start to bite. Scots donrsquot like paying taxes any more than anyone  attempts to argue the contrary are delusional.The second hurdle is,anything, more dficult to tackle. Over the coming weeks, Westminster mathematics may present the SNP with an opportunity to replace Boris Johnson with Jeremy Corbyn infor a second independence referendum. This will be tempting. Indeed, it will likely be impossible to resist, and I am not suggesting that it should be.:Marianne Taylor: Gordon Brown insults us all by claiming independence is an evilHowever, this action would have a consequence. As the leaders of the past, current and future Yes campaign, the SNP is responsible for creating that sensible economic narrative. Where does putting Mr Corbyn into Downing Street fit into it The Yes campaign needs to build economic competence. From scratch. Partly because it will help it win. But primarily becausewersquore going to be an independent country, then we need to be a grown-up country.

mitigate effects of global climate change.The seven latest projects will improve habitats and bioersity, transform unused land, tackle flood risk and create new active travel routes, community gardens and play areas in Glasgow, Bishopbriggs and Dunfermline.SNH Chief Executive Francesca Osowska said: ldquoWe know that connecting people with nature makes them happier and healthier and itrsquos great to see this funding delivering that in our most deprived areas.ldquoIn addition to the many social and economic benefits, improving our urban greenspace can also help us adapt to and mitigate climate change.ldquoThis funding will help us create a nature-rich future for everyone in Scotland, part of the solution to the climate emergency facing us all.The EU-backed Green Infrastructure Fund is part of the Scottish Governmentrsquos European Regional Development Fundprogramme and is being delivered in two phases.Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: ldquoThis investment will bring signicant benefits to communities across seven more urban areas, repurposing and revitalising land to create green spaces and infrastructure.ldquoCrucially, this funding will also help address the impacts of climate change by improving bioersity, managing flood risk, and reducing pollution, while promoting new low carbon lestyle choices and active transport options in the heart of our communities."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10269959.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scotland-found-uk-mobile-phone-offence-hotspot","story":"The transport select committee has said using any type of mobile phone while driving had potentially catastrophic consequences and warned that current laws give the \"misleading impression\" that hands-free options are safe.And the MPs called for more severe penalties ldquocommensurate with the risks, as road deaths linked to phone use have risen steadily over the past decade.A public consultation on the proposal should be published by the end of , the cross-party group said.It is understood the Scottish Government would support a ban on hands-free mobile phones from a road safety point of view as long as the proposal is backed with evidence and proper impact assessments.It comes as it emerged research found that Scotland is a UK hotspot for distracted driving offences.Court penalties doubled when tough mobile phone driving laws were introduced in March, .And research using freedom of legislation carried out for the motor dealers Peter Vardy revealed that in around nine months after the new legislation, there had been , recorded offences since March across  constabularies in the UK.Scotland was said to have been the worst region, accounting for , of these.A separate survey at around the same time to determine the places that are the worst offenders found that came top with nearly three in four admitting to using their phones behind the wheel. This was closely followed by London where % said they used their phones while driving, as did % of Glaswegians, % in Cardf and % of Birmingham drivers.The safest place for other drivers and pedestrians appears to be Southampton, where just one in twenty of drivers admitted to using their phones. While people in Bristol , Manchesterand Nottinghammade up the four lowest cities for mobile phone use behind the wheel.:Lorry driver caught checking his phone before fatal crash jailed for five yearsIn September, last year, -year-old recovery driver David Shields who was caught on camera checking his phone prior to a fatal crash was jailed for five years.The driver crashed into -year-old Yvonne Blackmans car in a line of traffic on the A in Dumfries last February.He had previously admitted a charge of causing the mother-of-fours death by dangerous driving.Footage captured Shields, of Drongan, East Ayrshire, focusing on his phone for a full  seconds in the lead-up to the fatal crash.Brake, the road safety charity said research showed using a hands-free phone can impair a driver in the same way as a hand-held device and so it makes sense that the law treats these acts equally.A Brake spokesman said: ldquoThe number of distracted driving offences in Scotland is cause for concern and highlights that there is still much work to be done regarding the dangers of phone use behind the wheel.:Time to ban phones in schools: Cross-party MSPs call for Holyrood investigationldquoWe need urgent clarication of the law on using hand-held mobile devices while driving, including closing loopholes which treat sending or receiving data dferently.\"The current law also provides a dangerous  impression that it is safe to use a mobile phone with a hands-free kit - it is not. All phone use behind the wheel is dangerous, and we need the law to reflect this by banning the use of hands-free devices.\"It is also true that a law is only as strong as its enforcement and so we want to see further resources provided to the police to make sure there is an effective deterrent to the menace of mobile phone use behind the wheel.A Scottish Government spokesman said: ldquoWhile the power to legislate in this area is reserved to the UK Government, we are clear that road safety is a priority and we recognise that driving while distracted puts the driver and other road users at greater risk.ldquoWe continue to support behavioural change and marketing campaigns through Road Safety Scotland. The message from us and all road safety partners is clear - do not risk your safety or the safety of others by using a mobile phone behind the wheel of a car."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10270163.jpg?type=article-full","title":"tennents-maps-scotlands-top-15-pubs-view","story":"A new guide to Scotlands most scenic pubs has been launched in a bit to introduce beerlovers to a pint with a view.But anyone wishing to finish the trek will have to get their walking boots on and have some time to spare , as it criss-crosses the country for  miles by land and sea and none of the bars are exactly local.However, when they have called last orders on the mammoth trip, they will have visited some of Scotlands most stand-out hostelries, including a -year-old coaching inn, a pint aboard a boat on Loch Katrine and a bar located within the stunning glens of the Cairngorms National Park.The map was Tennents ideaThe lsquoViewPintsrsquo map, celebrates  pubs and bars across the country with the most spectacular views as judged by brewers Tennants -

Itrsquos just something that I wanted to do. Irsquove been trying to keep it a bit of a secret, but Irsquove been enjoying the process of doing it.Scots of any vintage will have little trouble knowing the song from which it takes its name. Written in , it was recorded two-years later, and amid a plethora of cover versions, popped up to some fame on the  Tennentrsquos Lager advert by Frankie Miller, reprised by MacLean himself years later.But while it might be one of Scotlandrsquos ldquoother national anthems, itrsquos clear for MacLean that it means so very much more. ldquoI wrote the script myself, I wrote the story, which is a nice thing to do at my stage of le after all these years as a travelling troubadour and songwriter, he says. ldquoIrsquove got so many songs, therersquos  songs Irsquove written over the years and Irsquove got this great story ndash itrsquos a love story ndash and itrsquos cool.He revealed that it was his time spent in Glasgow, as musical director at the Citizenrsquos Theatre for the hugely successful A Scots Quair trilogy staged by Glasgowrsquos TAG theatre company in  and featuring Sunset Song, that lay the foundations for his move into musicals.He said: ldquoI thought to myself, I know how this works, I can visualise a stage production Irsquom performing all the timeI know how audiences work, I know the songs that Irsquove written over the last  years and the ones that work onstage with people, so itrsquos great to just make a story and bring all those songs into that story.While he wants to keep the core theme under wraps ndash its worth waiting for ndash he hints: ldquoItrsquos amazing that a song that I might have written for myself, thatyou put it in another situation, it changes the whole dynamic of the song.And he hopes it will strike a chord with a new generation of fans, as well as those who love the song and his other bodies of work already.He said: ldquoCaledonia was a homesick song. I wrote it when I was on a beach in Brittany in France. I finished it and was staying in a youth hostel with three friends who were Irish, we were busking basically in the streets around France.ldquoWersquod jump on a train, see a nice town and get off, did a few wee gigs and I finished the song off.ldquoI remember going back to the youth hostel where we were staying, singing it to them, we were all that homesick anyway, and we left the next day.ldquoThe first time I ever performed it was in West Berlin. Irsquod gone back to Germany and was touring around and I didnrsquot do many of my own songs at that time, I did a lot more traditional songs, a bit of fiddle, and I snuck this song in and the audience just loved it. Even way back then, I was  maybe, I turned around and said wersquoll keep that in the set.And he is proud he did. ldquoCaledonia is only a tiny, little part of what I do. But therersquos something about it that became part of common culture which is fascinating and which is a great thrill for a songwriter to have something that is part of it ndash that is sung at football games, played at Scottish weddings, is played at funerals, you hear buskers singing it in the streets. I have incredible stories about it, you canrsquot invent that. Therersquos probably not a night goes by and therersquos not a drunk standing somewhere singing Caledonia.MacLean will be back at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall this Sunday, with his traditionally inspired show The Gael, a collaboration involving skilled and talented musicians Ross Ainslie, Finlay MacDonald and Gus Sicard plus other members of the piping supergroup TRYST and select special guests for this yearrsquos Piping Live!He said: ldquoIt was really nice of the guys to ask me to come along and be part of the Piping Live!

I remember when the band Alba told us they were getting their Highland bagpipes out, we were all ndash you cannae get your Highland bagpipes out in a folk band because they were B flat and what have you. But these guys worked out how to do it.ldquoThe concert is more of a solo concert with me touching my cap to the piping tradition. Irsquove always liked to use whistles and bagpipes, rather that saxophones ndash because they are Scottish.MacLean says Scotland is in rude health, culturally, shaking off the stereotypical caricature of the Harry Lauder years, adding: ldquoTherersquos a lovely, modern, sophisticated image that we have now and Irsquod like to think Irsquove been part of that whole cultural revolution that began to happen around  years ago.Next month he turns , but he laughs: ldquoIrsquom busier this year than Irsquove ever been.

People choose their own anthemic songs, and I donrsquot know why Caledonia has seeped into this.Therersquos probably not a night goes by and therersquos not a drunk standing somewhere singing Caledonia.DOUGIE MACLEAN ON THE MEANING BEHIND CALEDONIAWhen you are young, you donrsquot have the baggage of le so you are a wee bit more honest in what you say and in what you write.I mean, I was just really very homesick and I wrote what was there.If I tried to write it now, I probably couldnrsquot, because I would be saying lsquooh no, thatrsquos too sentimentalrsquo or whatever.Caledonia is a big song over in Ireland, itrsquos a big song whenever Irsquom over in Europe, itrsquos about the sense of belonging that it has.It encapsulates your own sense of belonging, for me I would make it Scotland.But therersquos something  in that song that people identy with in terms of their own sense of belonging.I donrsquot know where it is today.Therersquos a lot of political turmoil, Irsquom not sure anybody knows how it will turn out. I try to sometimes to imagine whatrsquos going to happen, where itrsquos going to go, but I canrsquot.But I think having songs like Caledonia help people keep their cultural sense of identity, and an identity can be all-encompassing too.TURNING HIT SONG CALEDONIA INTO DOUGIE MACLEANrsquoS FIRST MUSICALItrsquos a musical - Irsquom in the middle of working on it. Caledonia the Musical. Itrsquos just something that I wanted to do.Irsquove been trying to keep it a bit of a secret, but Irsquove been enjoying the process of doing it.I wrote the script myself, I wrote the story, which is a nice thing to do at my stage of le after all these years as a travelling troubadour and songwriter.Irsquove got so many songs, there are  songs Irsquove written over the years and Irsquove got this great story ndash itrsquos a love story ndash and itrsquos cool.I was musical director years and years and years ago for TAG theatre company here in Glasgow at the Citizens Theatre for a three play series, A Scots Quair, and so I learned quite a lot in the process of being involved with that because we had music on stage as well.Irsquove been using a lot of what I learned there.I thought to myself, I know how this works, I can visualise a stage production Irsquom performing all the time for I know how audiences work, I know the songs that Irsquove written over the last  years and the ones that work on stage with people, so itrsquos great to just make a story and bring all those songs into that story.Itrsquos amazing that a song that I might have written for myself, thatyou put it in another situation, it changes the whole dynamic of the song.INFLUENCING SCOTLANDrsquoS CULTURAL IDENTITYScotland has a very modern vision of itself, a modern, progressive vision of its national identity which is kind of unusual.Irsquom glad that Scotland has developed it that way.Irsquom very proud of our Scottish Parliament, I think itrsquos very progressive and modern and I think Scotlandrsquos is a great international brand ndash people love Scotland, they love the whole concept of Scotland, I donrsquot know how politically it will all fold out because it gets very complicated.Itrsquos not a black and white thing anymore. There have been a lot of things ndash a lot of lies ndash said. People are maybe looking at ita bit more.Even culturally, Irsquove seen a huge dference in my letime the way that Scottish people identy themselves as Scottish.Back when we were kids we were embarrassed to be Scottish, it was that old buffoon with the wiggly stick and the hairy legs, the Harry Lauder caricature of being a Scot, but I think people arenrsquot anything like that ndash therersquos a lovely, modern, sophisticated image that we have now and our culturersquos been part of that.Irsquod like to think Irsquove been part of that whole cultural revolution that happened  years ago where it went away from being music hall to people writing their own stuff, we werenrsquot playing on the caricature of being Scottish, we were creating a fantastic cultural revolution ndash not just the folk guys, but the rock guys and everyone .DOUGIE MACLEAN ON SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE AND EUROPEI think Scots are more confident in being Scottish, and maybe that will inevitably lead to independence.I donrsquot how that journey will go, but Irsquod like to see it myself because I believe in small things.I believe in independence, but part of a bigger thing.And itrsquos been like that in my own le, Irsquove been very independent in how Irsquove gone about things ndash I have my own company, my own studio, so I was in control of my own destiny.But without the bigger thing, it would be very dferent.Irsquom independent but in a big music scene. I think we need to be part of that bigger thing .:Dougie MacLean: lsquoI want people to be talking about Live by the Loch in next  yearsI think part of cultural identity is the brand, thatrsquos the glue thatkeeps the world together ndash everybody loves their cultural identity, andyou can invent one that encompasses and brings in other peoplersquos cultural identities too, then you have a modern Scotland that is quite dferent from the one that my dad would have imagined.Thatrsquos what makes my songs dferent from James Taylor songs because he writes them from an American perspective, but Irsquom not singing about traditional things, I write about human things.DOUGIE MACLEAN ON BEING A SCOTTISH MUSICAL PIONEERWhen we set up the record company, I built a wee recording studio, and nobody was doing it at the time. It was me and Ossian, another folk group, who were a great help.It was vinyl in these days, and you couldnrsquot get vinyl cut in Scotland, so I remember the first record I made up in Butterstone was a fiddle record and I had to get on an overnight Stagecoach to London, to Soho where they had the cutting rooms, with the master tapes under my arms, to get the vinyl cut on this thing.Thatrsquos where I learned that they used a diamond needle on the cutting machines, but they only used the new diamond needles for the big acts and when it was worn they put it on an old machine at the back and cut all the independents with it.People donrsquot realise thatrsquos how I did it.It was the early days of Stagecoach which is from Perthshire, and they had two old buses.The driver would stop halfway down, about Carlisle somewhere, and get this gin box out with his Thermos flask and come round to give everybody a cup of coffee and a sandwich that his we had made ndash that was it then, though Stagecoach are huge now of course.But thatrsquos how we had to do it.The CD has become devalued because it is so easy to make. But back then people said oh, yoursquoll never be able to do it, yoursquoll never be able to stay in Dunkeld, yoursquoll have to go to London, New York or even Glasgow or Edinburgh.But I was dogged, I said no, Irsquom going to stay here, and I made it.I live in my old school, the school that I went to, and my dad went to. Itrsquos a great story.I am on facetime a lot with my son Jamie who produces my records now, it all ties together. I like that. Itrsquos not an ego-driven lestyle, I keep bees, I collect Singer sewing machines, wersquore all surviving and itrsquos just our lives. Itrsquos what we do.TRYST AND DOUGIE MACLEAN PERFORMING AT PIPING LIVE! IN GLASGOWOne of the things about the TRYST concert, it was really nice of the guys to ask me to come along and be part of the Piping Live! Festival because I had a long history with bagpipes.I joined The Tannahill Weavers when I was , thatrsquos when that whole piping revolution was happening.I remember when the band Alba told us they getting their Highland bagpipes out, we were all ndash you cannae get your Highland bagpipes out in a folk ban,d because they were B flat and what have you.But these guys worked out how to do it and I ended up touring American with wee Alan on bagpipes, and I had my relationship with young Gordon Duncan who played on all my records when he was a youngster.This was all before it became really well established.The concert is more of a solo concert with me touching my cap to the piping tradition.I did a tour of America one time with Kathy Mattea who had just won a Grammy at the time, and she had come to my studio and we had recorded lsquoFrom a Distancersquo and Gordy had played a little bit of pipes on it for her.So when I went to America and did the special guest on her tour, she said lsquooh, I wish we could do that with the bagpipesrsquo so I learned the part of small pipes ndash it was the only part I could ever learn to play ndash and I walked onto the stage playing that. I felt a fraud.But I did it, Irsquom just hoping someone has a recording or photograph somewhere.DOUGIE MACLEAN ON PERFORMING IN GLASGOWI love Glasgow, I come down a lot. I did a solo show there recently which was brilliant and Irsquove done shows over the years, all the theatres around here and I worked at the Citizens.I remember coming down here as an eight-year-old, my uncle Roddy liked in Castlemilk, and coming down from where I lived up in Dunkeld, I might as well have been going to the moon.It was so dferent for me. I love living in the country, Irsquom a country boy, but I have very fond memories from Glasgow.Irsquove had great fun in Glasgow, with the festivals and the shows that Irsquove done ndash but a couple of night ago I played in Crieff, the night before that up in Findhorn on the north coast, and on Stornoway at An Laantair ndash it was fantastic.Irsquom a very positive person, I like all kinds of music, I like the creative process.The last couple of years Irsquove been doing solo concerts, Irsquove ed back to the essence of what I do.Irsquove done a lot of collaborating, Irsquove done orchestra stuff, with bands and things, but now Irsquom doing these shows solo and itrsquos great because I get this relationship with the audience going which you just canrsquot get in collaboration.I love that, I tell stories and get the audience to sing, I love that side of what I do.This weekendrsquos show at the Royal Concert Hall will be a bit like that, I donrsquot like formal concerts, itrsquos a Dougie Maclean concert with a bunch of my songs and a bunch of my stories and a bit of whistle here, a bit of bagpipes there, it is a great privilege to be asked to come down and be part of it.DOUGIE MACLEAN ON FILMING HIS LIFE STORYThe whole world is changing. I do a wee bit of photography and video.Irsquom in the process of cataloguing my le in video for the kids.My son has got his drone licence, Irsquove got a drone, my video cameras, my GoPros and Irsquom going to go out and visit all the places I grew up in.If I wait about trying to get the media to do it, theyrsquore not interested in me at all, then there will be no record of what Irsquove done, my le, unless I do it myself.I enjoy it, itrsquos for my grandkids, not really for anything .Buttherersquos any other value, then therersquos a big old internet out there, so people will be able to see it for themselves.DOUGIE MACLEAN TURNS  YEARS OLD ON HIS BIRTHDAY IN SEPTEMBERIrsquom busier this year than Irsquove ever been. Irsquove just come back from Europe. But people say to me ndash when are you going to retire But I remember a famous American actor said, lsquoIf yoursquove got a job, you retire,itrsquos your workndash you just keep doing itrsquo and I thought that was a quite good way of describing what I do.As long as Irsquove got a voice and I can drive and travel, Irsquoll keep on doing it.I love the people, Irsquove got a fantastic group of fans who appreciate what I do, who will come to my shows, and are great fun to be with for an evening.There are two paths you can take as a musicianyou want your face on the front of Q magazine, you sign a deal with a big, major record company, then you might have a bit of fame for two or three years, then you go back to being a taxi driver.Oryou just enjoy playing music, you set up your own independent publishing label, and you go out and do gigs, all kinds of gigs, and thatrsquos whatrsquos been lucky with me.Irsquove managed to have this longevity ndash Irsquom turning  as you say ndash and I think Irsquom getting better as I get older.Even my own songs I sang  years ago Irsquom doing better now for some reason, with that older gravitas that you get.Therersquos something about not being stressed out about it all.Irsquom not at that place in my le where Irsquom worried about reviews, every year I have now is a bonus for me. Irsquove got my family and the kids, Irsquove paid off my house, Irsquom in a good place.Itrsquos an amazing place to be as a musician."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10272102.jpg?type=article-full","title":"1m-whisky-sauce-e-made-country-fair","story":"Foodies and whisky aficionados can delight their taste buds when the one-of-a-kind whisky sauce is served at Galloway Country Fair this weekend.The sauce, made from cask number one of Annandale Distilleryrsquos first unpeated single malt Man orsquo Word, will be used for a recipe in the Fairrsquos Galloway Demo Kitchen.This will be the first and only use of the whisky, named after Robert Burns, before it is out away to mature for a decade.

Internal features such as stone benches have also been found along either side.The hall is oriented towards the sea and finds include steatite , pottery, a bone spindle whorl and a fragment of a Norse bone comb.The find provides tantalising evidence of the earliest phases of inhabitation on this farm and settlement mound which may well have been inhabitated for over , years.It provides another piece to the ,-year jigsaw along this archaelogy rich stretch of coast as Westness in Rousay — described as the #Egypt of the North#.A team of archaeologists from the University of the Highlands and Islands Archaeology Institute, Rousay residents and students have been digging at the site for a number of years, investigating the later stages of the farm complex and its waste heaps with a particular focus on past diet, farming and fishing practices.Although only partly uncovered at this stage, the Skaill hall has parallels with other Norse halls excavated in Orkney, such as Snusgar, and where in Scotland.The excavation is part of the Landscapes of Change — Archaeologies of the Rousay Clearances and Westness Estate project which is exploring the Skaill farmstead.The present farm at Skaill dates to the th and th centuries and was part of the Rousay clearances during the mid-th century.The name Skaill suggests the site was home to a Norse hall or drinking hall, and was a high status site.Westness is mentioned in Orkneyinga saga as the home of Sigurd, a powerful chieftain, so it was always likely that a Norse settlement was located somewhere at Skaill.Earlier structures have been found below the present farm during previous seasons, and this season explored more of the Norse phases of the site.Three dimensional models of the farmstead can be found here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Please feel free to contact us with any questions by phoning  ,# said those involved.A spokesperson for the project went on to say: “A huge thanks to all the landowners who have helped us by agreeing the essential land access we need to get started. With their support together we can protect Orkney’s unique wildle for future generations.”The traps will be laid around  metres apart in preferred stoat habitat, which may include some road verges. They will be checked regularly by the project staff.The Orkney Native Wildle Project is a partnership between Orkney Islands Council, Scottish Natural Heritageand RSPB Scotland. Following three years of development generous support for the project has been provided by, the Heritage Lottery Fund and EU Le, providing a combined grant of £. million for the duration of the five-year project.Stoats are native to the UK Mainland but not to Orkney, where they were first recorded in . Since then the population has increased rapidly and is now fully established and widely-distributed throughout Mainland Orkney, Burray and South Ronaldsay.

Sales will be licensed from August   until October  .

Now, licensed sellers from Orkney will have a chance to develop the market for their product and people can try goose for themselves, on Orkney, and across Scotland.“Wild geese are an important part of Scotland’s nature, but their rapid rise in numbers has been challenging for farmers and crofters. Striking the balance between conservation, farming and hunting can be dficult. Our goal is to give farmers and crofters the tools they need to safeguard their crops, enabling them to control goose numbers sustainably, and sell goose meat for profit.”Until now, meat generated by the Orkney resident greylag goose project could only be sold locally by retailers based on Orkney.SNH is working to secure longer-term arrangements for the sale of resident greylag goose meat in Scotland.

Richard Leonard hadn’t got the memo. He rushed out a release restating his own take on party policy, but still the sht was reasserted by Corbyn’s right-hand man.Bizarrely, it suggests a further extension of the policy that cost Labour so heavily at the European election: the doctrine of ‘constructive ambiguity’.: John McDonnell owes Richard Leonard apology over thoughtless independence ramblings – Ian Murray MP: Three weeks of Boris Johnson - and Scotland has had enoughIt’s a bit of a mouthful but constructive ambiguity basically boils down to trying to play both sides at once. Initially it only applied to Brexit. It stood as a means of triangulating a position which would please both their Leave-voting constituencies in England and reassure their Remain voters in ­metropolitan London and university towns. It failed. Spectacularly.Labour learned the hard way that, when it comes to constitutional politics, you cannot ride both horses. They had tried to convince Leave voters that they were a party wedded to honouring the referendum result whilst simultaneously reassuring Remainers that they were going to block Brexit. They forgot one key factor: both groups were hearing both sets of ­messages and didn’t believe either.The softening of their policy towards a second indyref feels like the same gambit, trying to appeal to Yes voters whilst maintaining an ostensibly pro-UK  to retain their pro-Union supporters. Without an urgent course correction, it could bring about their ruin.Over the past four years, Labour have been quietly conducting a post-mortem into why they were all but wiped out in Scotland in the  ­general election. They believe they came adrt of substantial ­sections of their base when the SNP started to win over traditional Labour demographics to the Yes cause. That feeling that “Labour isn’t on my side” was compounded, they believe, by images of Labour politicians sharing ­s with the old enemy – the Conservative Party.The result of that post-mortem was a two-stage policy sht, the first, uttered several times in recent months, that Labour would not campaign alongside the Conservatives in any future independence referendum. The second was the withdrawal of hostility to that referendum at Westminster.There are already huge signs that this isn’t playing well among their remaining supporters. After offending their ultra-Remain core with ambiguity over Brexit, they are causing equal or even graver offence to the substantial wing of the party who loathe the ision that will come with a second border poll.Moderate Labour activists stared on in disbelief. That reaction was elegantly captured by Duncan Hothersall, a respected Labour activist and blogger, when he described his party in Scotland as the political equivalent of a ghost in the movie The Sixth Sense – “Most people don’t even notice it, and it doesn’t realise it’s already dead.”Several journalists have already told me of their private expectations that my own party, the Lib Dems will benefit handsomely from being the only party to stand full square behind Scotland’s place in the UK and Scotland’s place in the EU.That may be the case, but I take no pleasure in Labour’s sht. A plurality of voices making the positive case for our place in both unions is absolutely vitalwe are to save either.

On Brexit, he can be trusted to oppose the Tories # tooth and nail and he can use his experience as a marine engineer to help secure valuable green jobs for Shetland.“Tom’s ideas are striking a real chord with islanders. That’s why more and more people are moving to the SNP, many for the first time. After  years of the Liberals, Tom is asking for just  months until the next Holyrood election to show what he can do.” raquo.."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LOCHCARRON-GAMES-1-adj.jpg","title":"number 41 in the sun for lochcarron highland","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.Sinclair Patience of Tain and Angus Davren of Conon Bridge excelled at the st edition of the games as they wrote their names into the record books.Angus Davren hit new heights as he cleared . metres to set a new ground record in the high jump.

The results are projects which genuinely improve the lives of today#s residents # as well as visitors # and leave a legacy for future generations. What is even more remarkable is the fact these projects are achieved with very little access to loans. The good work of the community trusts is achieved through dogged determination to raise funds within the community combined with seriously clever navigation of the minefield of grant applications. By steadily securing the funds from a myriad public pots and local activities the trusts ensure each project is not only affordable now, but sustainable for generations to come.In Staffin # home to the iconic Old Man of Storr # the local community trust has raised over £, to upgrade existing footpaths and create new ones. There will be new parking, #welcome# structures and interpretation boards at all sites. The whole project will result in what the trust is calling #Skye Ecomuseum# which will encourage visitors to spend more time and therefore more money in Staffin.In the north west of Skye, the Glendale Trust covers a huge area that attracts , visitors a year # many travelling the long and winding single track road to the top five hotspot of Neist Point.The trust, under the leadership of Tim Hunter-Davies and three new directors, is working hard to develop sustainable facilities for the community and tourists. They have taken ownership of Meanish Pier and the foreshore, creating opportunities for local residents and regional businesses alike. It will be run commercially and provide income to enable the Trust to invest in further sustainable community projects.Glendale # which was the subject of Scotland#s first community buyout back in  # is rich in history and the trust is also looking to develop projects that preserve and share the story of the area, as Tim Hunter-Davies explains: #As well as being instrumental in land reform in the last century, Glendale has a rich heritage stretching back through the centuries. A steamer used to sail daily from Loch Dunvegan and was used as a point to transport many people away from Scotland during the Highland clearances. We want to preserve and share our history with the community and visitors.#In south Skye is the Sleat Community Trust. It has been working hard to provide and improve leline services for the community that also benefit visitors arriving and leaving Skye on the Armadale Mallaig ferry.The SCT currently provides shop, post office and fuel services in two buildings no longer fit for purpose. Over £, has been raised from public and private sources to build a new shop with a community #social# space and offices for the employees of the Trust. They hope to open the new shop in early summer .In addition, the purchase by the Trust of the -hectare Tormore Forest in  continues to create additional sources of income, including selling housing plots as well as an attraction for the community and visitors alike. As trust business development manager Mike Shucksmith explains, the success is based on a combination of commercial and voluntary activity.He said: #To maintain the forest, we have to generate income so we sell split logs to the community, create woodchip for biomass boilers and are developing a micro-hydro scheme. At the same time, we have a vibrant volunteer culture in Sleat who have created a network of paths, social areas and a polytunnel where local school children can help grow saplings to regenerate the forest. The trust also operates #Skyenet # a community broadband network # a community transport scheme, Tormore Explore Forest School and the Visit Sleat tourism group, which promotes the area as a destination of choice for visitors.#From the Sleat Peninsula to the gateway to Skye in the south where a new access route to the island is being created by the members of the Broadford and Strath Community Company. They are developing a cycle path all the way from Kyle of Lochalsh to Broadford. One of the project pioneers is keen local cyclist, Andy Neison.#I used to commute from Teangue on Sleat to Kyle by bike,# he said. #I was really unnerved by the road from Breakish to Kyle with a high volume of fast-moving traffic. When friends told me about the old road from Broadford to Kyle I started exploring sections of it. It#s a good starting point and will become a pioneer project for the highlands.#After receiving a grant of £, from Sustrans, a sustainable transport charity, to fund engineering and traffic surveys, the Trust is now working to secure funding for a project officer to take the Skye Cycleway to the next phase. The community is heavily invested in the project with volunteers coming out in all weathers to clear sections of the old road, but this is a long-term project with hundreds of thousands of pounds ultimately needed to complete the full route from Kyle to Broadford.Over the Skye bridge, the Kyle and Lochalsh Community Trust is creating a vast community and visitor experience on a piece of land known as the Plock.Securing funding from the Scottish Land Fund enabled the Trust to take ownership of the Plock and the old Skye Bridge toll office and develop a masterplan for these two community assets. On the Plock itself, there will be a hub building with cafe, carpark and toilets, a network of accessible paths, a #pitch and putt# course, a Viking living village, accommodation pods, a watersports centre, wildle hide and a for thrill-seekers a huge zipline across the bay.Jo Wawrzyczek of the trust expects the Plock to attract , visitors a year. #This is an ambitious project that will cost almost £million,# she said. #However, it is very important for local people and businesses as it will help to create a great community space as well as keep visitors in our community for longer.#The trust also owns and manages the public toilets and pontoons in Kyle which will be a source of income for the project. With the aim of making the project self-sustaining, the Trust plans to lease the café and watersports centre on the Plock as well as generating income through the accommodation pods. Inspired by the success of other community-driven harbour developments such as Tobermory on Mull, Portree and Braes Community Trust want to maximise opportunities for local people and visitors through taking ownership of the harbour and improving facilities.The trust is currently in talks about relocating the oil tanks at the pier head which would be a breakthrough for the project and open up commercial opportunities. They are also considering a new road from the south to improve access and ert traffic away from the town centre. But according to development officer Fiona Thompson a new breakwater and pontoons will be the real game-changer for Portree.She said: #There have been aspirations for improvements to facilities at the harbour for over  years with little major investment.The harbour group are now closer than ever to realizing the community#s vision for a new, vibrant, welcoming port. A breakwater will allow us to provide overnight berths and efficient, comfortable transfer for cruise ship passengers, while a visitor centre will provide a warm highland welcome to visitors from across the globe. This project will be transformational for Portree and surrounding areas.#The community trusts of Skye and Lochalsh all have several features in common. They have vision, ambition, energy and drive and they are full of volunteers who are committed to bringing long-term projects to fruition for the benefit of their community # and their visitors # for decades to come."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Skye-Bridge-2018-winners.jpg","title":"skye bridge 10k race to kick start kyleakin gala","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe first bridge k was held  years ago, and since  hundreds have taken on the challenge in an event which has helped raise thousands of pounds for good causes based in Kyleakin and surrounding areas.back again.Online entry — which is discounted — will be open until Friday th August, or runners can register on the morning of the race for £.

The book states that “being the nineteenth century of the Redemption of mankind” the then Pope, Pius XI, had proclaimed  a “Holy Year”.“These facts have prompted the publishers to devise and reproduce this beautul and artistic Album containing the fourteen ‘Stations of the Cross’,” it states.“The primary purpose of the work of Irish Art is to provide a most appropriate and lasting souvenir for the Catholic home, in honour and commemoration of Holy Year.”It also reveals that the artworks are “exact replicas of the celebrated and valuable set in the Church of Mount Alphonsus, Limerick”, which belonged to the Redemptorist Fathers, who gave permission for their reproduction.According to the Redemptorists in Limerick, the Stations of the Cross in their church date back to  – just four years after the church was officially completed.Explaining his find, Fred said: “I bought it in a massive market in Kildare. I’m  now, so I would say it was about  years ago, maybe more.“I liked it because it was the Stations of the Cross and I thought it maybe would be worth a few bob in a lot of years’ time, but I never tried to sell it or do anything with it. It was exactly like that when I bought it so it was a good few years old then.“I just found it up in the attic of the house. I was clearing the attic out because we’re changing over from oil to gas and I came across it again.”He continued: “I just want to see what’s what with it. I thought back then that it was an oddball of a thing to be getting sold. The only person I took it to was Father Hanna down in Clonard Monastery last week. He looked at it and said it was very, very good, it’s very nice, but he couldn’t give me an opinion of where to go to see about it. Then somebody told me to bring it up to the Andytown News.”He added: “If it turns out to be stolen or anything then I would give it back to whoever owned it, but I don’t think it is.”If you have any further clues or information about the book or its contents, please contact the Andersonstown News."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bmg-advert-banner-classified-v01.png","title":"lansdowne is ready to enjoy another golden age","story":"THE recent opening of the Lansdowne Hotel in the leafy surroundings of the Antrim Road and Cave Hill has got local people talking of how it was back in the day.It was the place to go and for one businessman, the opportunity to transform the once-so-popular venue was simply too hard to turn down.Born and bred on the Glen Road in West Belfast, Jim McLaughlin left home at  years old to pursue a career in the food industry.He worked in Cavan and Monaghan and boasts a spell as a chef at the Hilton Hotel in Amsterdam on his CV.Jim ed to Ireland and went to Benedict’s Hotel in Belfast city centre, working as their Head Chef before becoming manager a few years later.When the Lansdowne Hotel was put up for sale, Jim says it was an opportunity he could not turn down.“The Simpsons offered me the opportunity to be partners with them in their latest project – the Lansdowne Hotel – and here we are today,” he said.“The attractive thing for me was that when I came here  years ago when I was young it was for a night out and a bit of fun. Back in the day, the Lansdowne Court Hotel was the place to go in Belfast. In the past year or so, the place had become a bit tired and it was put up for sale. I see it as a great opportunity to restore it to its glory days and bring something to the people of the Antrim Road and North Belfast.”Jim and his co-owners have put a lot of money into the refurbishment and he is very pleased the way the stunning new premises have turned out.“It is the city centre on the Antrim Road,” he added. “Everything is top class from the drink, food, garden and bridal suite. We have invested heavily and also boast around  staff so it is great to bring jobs to the local community.“When we bought it last March, we thought it was going to be a quick refurb and it would be opened for Christmas but the further we looked at it, it wasn’t going to be a quick turnaround.“We wanted to do things right and we are very pleased with the way it has turned out.”Jim is hoping the eye-catching new surroundings and features of the Landsdowne will bring people through the door – and he hopes to bring his expertise to the project.“Our support from the local community to date has been second to none since we opened seven weeks ago.“Customers have been very welcoming to me and I want to welcome them too.“I am here every day as the face on the floor. My background is in s and food so I hope to bring a fair bit to the table knowledge-wise.“For anyone who hasn’t been yet, come and try us – you will not be disappointed!“We are open to suggestions for anything that can be improved.“The bridal suite is stunning. It is the only room that hasn’t been used yet but there are a number of weddings booked for later in the year.“The garden has been there over  years.“We have invested a bit of money in it for people to sit and relax, enjoy a bit of food and drink.“We also put a lot of thought into the food. It is served both in the restaurant and bar. The small plates are proving a huge hit with customers.“We think our food is top end and we are not charging top end prices.”“It is a pleasure to be here. I am really excited about the Lansdowne,” he added.The Lansdowne Hotel Antrim RoadBelfast BT EFTel:    www.thelansdownehotel"},{"url":null,"title":"apprentice boys we recognise the upset over para emblems","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He said: “The statement from the Apprentice Boys acknowledging the genuine hurt caused by a band parading with Parachute Regiment and Soldier F insignia is a positive step that will contribute to healing in the city. “It is welcome and demonstrates the kind of leadership that Derry and the North needs right now.

The businesses in Portglenone are delighted as its brought a lot more people into the town.\"It doesnt take that long to sow the seeds,\" said Damian, who works at the local DLF Seeds company and knows what it takes to bring the field to le. \"It was just a couple of hours of walking up and down shaking the fiddle, but after that its out of your hands as to whether everything comes good.\"This year Damien and Karen, with their three children Cara , Ryanand Therese , have crafted another masterpiece. Visitors are greeted by scenes reminiscent of a Monet impressionist painting with a touch of Van Gogh, all on the edge of Seamus Heaney country.\"We live in a very green country with lots of rolling meadows, but people seem to like a splash of colour too. Its dferent and we like to think its a very romantic setting,\" said Damien. \"We had three marriage proposals in the field last year, wedding parties coming for photographs, plenty of fashion photo shoots, buses stopping off on tours of the country and, of course, plenty of photographers. There were also a couple of music videos filmed.\"The families who have come along are getting back to nature. Its so good that people are getting out into the fresh air and appreciating natural beauty. Kids are running around the path spotting butterflies.\"Thats an added bonus this year, with a neighbour lending an extra acre-sized field where Damian has created the perfect haven for butterflies, and when work commitments allow, he is only too happy to take visitors on a guided walk through the wildflowers.\"Its worked so well,\" he said. \"Were getting plenty of guests! \"Weve seen some of the rarer types, like painted ladies and peacocks. Youd almost think they were looking at you as the patterns on the wings resemble eyes. Its lovely to see them coming into their natural habitat.\"Obviously were relying a lot on the weather, but its been warm enough so far this year to allow the sunflowers to come out. They are a tropical plant, so heavy rain can take its toll, but theyve survived so far andwe can manage to get a couple of decent sunny days, even more of them should come out. Were at around % right now, and they thrive on direct sunlight.\"Karen and her kids, plus an army of young people from the town, have all been roped in to keep the meadow in tip top shape, and she expects the field to be open to the public for the next few weeks.\"Obviously theres a limited time span for when the sunflowers are in bloom, soanyone does want to take a stroll through, forget all about everyday le and lose themselves in a natural world, the next two to three weeks will be the best time to experience it,\" she said.\"In the meantime, were only too happy to have people as our guests, bring a picnic or a flask of tea and enjoy it while it lasts.\"This year, Damien and Karen are raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support.

I also felt guilty that I didnt know what was going on, and there and then I decided Id better find out what it was all about.\"Taylor tonight broadcasts a previously unseen interview with a man who was said to have been the commander of the Derry brigade of the IRA on Bloody Sunday.The man, whose face is blurred, says the IRA played no part in the civil rights march and took all their weapons out of the area.Asked by Taylor what Bloody Sunday had done for IRA recruitment, the man replies: \"I would saywe had the facilities we could recruit the majority of the Bogside.\"Looking back from , Taylor says: \"If I had been a teenager that day on Bloody Sunday I probably would have joined the IRA. I would have considered taking that final step, which is what happened to hundreds of young Catholics, men and women.\"Taylor says that he thinks Bloody Sunday legitimised violence in the minds of many people who believed thatthe State could use violence against them, they would use violence against the State.Taylor says that as he looked at the bodies of the Bloody Sunday victims in a church, John Hume told him the person he should talk to was Martin McGuinness, whom he did interview and quickly assessed to be a \"natural leader who was very articulate, charismatic and friendly\".\"He looked you straight in the eye and he had eyes that could be friendly and warm and welcoming and he also had eyes that could be hard as iron,\" Taylor adds.He says that in his opinion McGuinness came to be the single most important IRA leader on the island of Ireland, a man who was \"charming and ruthless\", and who would go on to meet the Queen.Taylor continues: \"In the end he was somebody I came to admire, as did many of his fiercest critics because of the journey he made from war.\"After Bloody Sunday Taylor went on patrol with the Army in , the most violent year of the Troubles, and he is heard asking soldiersthey are biased against Catholics. One of them says it isnt possible to be neutral because of the dferent reactions the Army receive in loyalist and republican areas.One soldier says that most of his colleagues \"on seeing their mates shot would love to punch the f*** out of some Paddy\".Taylor says that many of the soldiers, not all of them, hated the Catholic community that they believed supported and harboured the IRA.Some of the footage in Taylors latest documentary is of the fledgling UDA after they set up no-go areas in response to similar moves by the IRA in the early Seventies.He says he understood why loyalists thought their heritage was under threat \"and they had good reason to fear that\".He also recalls how the \"bulwark of loyalism\", the Rev Ian Paisley, once told him to \"get you back\" to England, but how the \"funny, charming and irresistible\" politician later bought ice-creams for him and his crew.Taylor says his discovery in the s that terror suspects were being abused by the security forces at interrogation centres including Castlereagh shocked himHe adds: \"I really felt outraged by what I was convinced was happening. I got confirmation from all the main sources, apart from the police, who were denying it was happening.\"It was around that time in the Seventies that Taylor claims the Northern Ireland Office \"presumably encouraged by the Secretary of State Roy Mason\" said he was doing programmes that were unhelpful to the security forces who suggested that his bosses should get another reporter to cover the situation.Taylor says: \"I felt very exposed. It makes you think - have I got this right  And you conclude yes.\"He also deals with the IRA prisoners dirty protest and the resultant hunger strikes over political status in the Maze and how, against the advice of the NIO, Desmond Irvine, the secretary of the Prison Officers Association, gave him an interview in which he talked of the respect he had for the Provos for their protest.Two weeks later Mr Irvine was shot dead by the IRA and Taylor, who says he felt sick at being indirectly implicated in a murder, was asked by a journalist how he felt about having \"blood on his hands\".Taylor says he was in tears at Mr Irvines funeral and admits he considered stopping covering Northern Ireland, but decided to carry on with his work.He says Bobby Sands martyred himself for the cause and the hunger strike showed that the IRA had a reservoir of support, which built the  for the rise of Sinn Fein over the next decade.\"The Iron Lady met the Iron Men and the Iron Men won,\" he says, adding that in the Eighties after the hunger strikes neither the British Government nor the IRA were prepared to compromise, something the Provos illustrated with their attempt to assassinate Mrs Thatcher with the Brighton bomb.Back in Northern Ireland, Taylor says a killing which affected him deeply was that of teenager John Boyle, who was shot dead in  by the SAS the day after his Catholic father alerted the security forces that his son had stumbled on an arms cache in a graveyard in Dunloy.Taylor says Mr Con Boyle went to his grave without ever receiving an apology, adding: \"Its a small thing but its the least that should happen when these tragedies happen, its the least the family deserves.\"However, Taylor says that the SAS and their sister intelligence unit called The Det played a crucial role in what he dubbed the \"secret war against the Provos\" using a range of weapons including surveillance which could even tell the British what the terrorists were having for breakfast.In an interview for one of Taylors earlier documentaries, the late IRA leader Brendan Hughes tells the broadcaster the technology effectively brought the IRA to a standstill where they could move very, very little, and \"contained\" the organisation.Taylor says he was shocked when he found out that the security forces had been helping loyalists in what he called the \"dirty war\".He replays an interview with convicted UFF terrorist Bobby Philpott, in which he says he was getting so many intelligence documents for targeting republicans that he didnt know where to put them, and claims the information went right down to the colour of socks they were wearing.Taylor deals briefly with atrocities like the Enniskillen massacre, Michael Stones Milltown cemetery attack, Loughinisland, Warrington and the Corporals killings in Andersonstown and says he got a sense that all sides were growing weary of the violence.The documentary also focuses on Taylors coverage of moves by the British Government to persuade the IRA to call a halt to their violence.He revisits interviews with one-time MI officers Frank Steele and Michael Oatley and with an emotional Brendan Duddy, the Derry businessman who was used as a \"secret peacemaker\", liaising between the British and the IRA, who both realised they could not win the war.And Brendan Hughes is heard telling the broadcaster that the war is over.Taylor marvels at Ian Paisley taking office as Northern Irelands First Minister, and though he says the peace of today is not perfect, it is \"certainly better than what we all went through for all those awful, bloody, desperate years\".Taylor says no one apart from dissidents wants to go back to those years of violence.But he says another major outstanding issue remains - how to deal with the past, in particular the prosecution of soldiers, like Soldier F, for killings including Bloody Sunday.Taylor says he thinks the law must take its course.Towards the end of the documentary he addresses the question of the border and predicts: \"In the long tunnel of history a united Ireland is perhaps more likely than not.\"But he adds: \"That will only happenunionists are party to it.\""},{"url":null,"title":"with each passing day every shred of hope faded now noras family is left utterly broken","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Local Malaysian newspapers reported that her clothes were in her room, suggesting that she disappeared wearing only her nightclothes.The following day, missing persons charity The Lucie Blackman Trust said the Malaysian police were treating Noras disappearance as a potential abduction, but officers on the ground denied any foul play.It was later reported that the teenager, who was born with holoprosencephaly, a disorder which affects brain development, was barefoot and dressed only in a nightdress when she went missing.On August , her distraught dad issued a desperate appeal on social media asking the public for help in locating Nora, whom he believed had been taken..png\" title\"Noras aunt Eadaoin Agnew issues a plea\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Noras aunt Eadaoin Agnew issues a pleaHis post read: \"Our daughter Nora has now been missing for three days in Seremban, h  south of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. We believe she may have been abducted and we need your support to help us find Nora.\" But police said there was no sign of any intruder entering the property. Nor did they find any footprints inside the villa or forensic evidence to suggest an unknown person was inside.More than  officers had joined the search for Nora by August  and her grandfather Sylvain Quoirin, mayor of Venizy in north-central France, said it was \"unthinkable\" that she had wandered off alone. As the search intensied, more details emerged about the family.It was reported that the Quoirins are an Irish-French family who have lived in London for  years.Mea­bh is chief executive of a consumer analytics company there.The couple met in Derry in the late s, according to the local Derry Journal, when both were at Ulster University in Magee. They shared a house in Aber­foyle Terrace for several years and later moved to London.Four days after the teen went missing, officials hunting for her in the dense jungle played a heartbreaking recording of Noras mum calling \"Nora, Nora darling, mummys here\" through loudspeakers in an attempt to reach her.Mrs Quoirin reached out in a statement describing her as \"a special person\" who is \"fun, funny and extremely loving\" as the frantic search for Nora continued, adding: \"She is not like other teenagers. She is not independent and does not go anywhere alone.\"Both parents also thanked the search teams helping to look for their eldest daughter, saying \"it means the world to us. We are so grateful for everything that you are doing for us\".On August , Malaysian police set up a hotline dedicated to receiving information about Nora and two days ago a £, reward, donated by an anonymous Belfast business, was announced for information leading to Noras safe .Appearing before cameras on Monday, a tearful Ms Quoirin said: \"Nora is our first child. She has been vulnerable since the day she was born.\"She is so precious to us and our hearts are breaking.\"Yesterday saw a devastating conclusion to the familys horric ordeal as their hopes of finding Nora alive ended at a waterfall the young girl was said to have been excited about seeing when she arrived in the resort.But, for the Quoirins, there will be no end to the devastation or the grief that was visited upon their lives during a brief stay at a remote eco-resort that robbed them of their bright future with their precious daughter."},{"url":null,"title":"education minister denies electioneering over student fees and accommodation","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

years in a local third level college and using that as a stepping stone, so there’s going to be widespread competition, there won’t just be the traditional route that you had to go to a city to get what you want.”He added he was not concerned that university places for Irish students may be reduced to make way for international students to make up for any funding shortfall.He said: “I don’t think that’s a road they’ll want to go down, we have a responsibility to ensure that we provide access for our graduates.“There is an onus on us to look after students from our own country.”Mr McHugh refused to be drawn on the fact that he has not yet discussed the promise of the fee freeze with Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure Pascal Donohoe.“Myself and Pascal talk quite frequently, maybe not as frequently in the summer months,” Mr McHugh said.“We’ve a close working relationship, we’ll continue to communicate on that front, this is about ensuring equality of access particularly for people who live in rural areas.”Mr McHugh was speaking in Croke Park at the National Parents Council Post Primary Helpline on Tuesday as more than , students received Leaving Cert exam results across the country.The  results are in line with previous years, however five students achieved results of eight Hs while  students achieved six or more.A total of , received at least one H in the results.The six most popular Higher Level subjects taken by students were English, Biology, Irish, Geography, Maths and French.Mr McHugh, who admits he was disappointed with his own results  years ago, said that students should not be disheartened, as more avenues than ever are open to those leaving school.“I beat myself up for a number of weeks, and maybe months, but in hindsight it couldn’t have worked out better, and my message would be to people who feel today their expectations were not met, there’s so many options,” Mr McHugh added.“As my granny always said, ‘What’s for you won’t pass you’.”"},{"url":null,"title":"greta thunberg the schoolgirl who inspired global climate change movement","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Gamble, a former RUC officer who has been in daily contact with the Quoirin family, said last night that people have held them \"in their hearts and prayers\" in the days since Noras disappearance. \"This is simply the most devastating news after  stressful and extremely anxious days for the family, who have been dignity personied in the face of the most awful nightmare,\" he said. \"They have been pitch perfect in the way they have engaged with police and volunteers. \"We all need to respect the fact that they must be given time and space to deal with their grief and come to terms with their loss.\" Mr Gamble also warned against \"unhelpful speculation\" on social media about what may have happened to Nora. \"There are a number of set procedures that will now take place involving forensics and not least the coroners examination of her body,\" he said. \"I hope that in the coming days, when the evidence has been gathered, we will learn more about Noras final journey to where she was found. \"I believe that speculating or second-guessing those experts who are on the ground would be unhelpful and will most definitely do no one any favours. \"The last thing the family need to be listening to now is a lot of speculation about the what-s, which wont help anybody. \"If we all want to demonstrate that we do have the deepest sympathy for the family then we need to press the pause button and retain an open mind.\" Mr Gamble said he had been \"desperate\" for a positive ending that \"sadly wasnt to be\". He added: \"Ive gone to bed at night and thought of Nora and in the morning I have been checking my news feed, a pattern which Im sure has been replicated across the country.\"You always believed that there would be some information, and even when the harsh reality hits you are still deeply saddened and shocked.\""},{"url":null,"title":"prayers are held for nora quoirins family at belfast church where teen was baptised in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This can result in many dficult policing decisions. That was the situation we found ourselves in on Saturday in Derry Londonderry. “The vast majority of the people who arrived in Derry Londonderry at the weekend to participate in the parade did so within the law and with due regard to that context.“One band, chose to take an approach which we believed would have interfered with our legitimate purpose of keeping the peace and keeping people safe. On that basis we engaged with them and sought their cooperation to address that in a constructive way they chose not to do so. We sought to engage the involvement of the Organisers and their Marshals to assist us in that and they were unable to do so. googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“With a large number of people delayed for a signicant amount of time, where some people were parading on the Cityside and other people were waiting on the Waterside area of the City, instead of persisting in that delay with the risks that entailed, we chose to make other operational arrangements to help ensure that people were kept safe and prevent a breach of the peace or a likely breach of the peace for the remainder of the parade.“Once the parade was finished we took steps to seek to identy those within the band so that we could fulfil our duty to put the matters and facts before the Public Prosecution Service in order that they might determinethere was any liability on the part of those people responsible. That is a legitimate policing purpose and was done so professionally. Once those details and assurances were given to us those people were free to travel on their way. “As a policing service we have a professional responsibility, and a legitimate purpose, to maintain the peace and keep people safe. These were the objectives of our decision making on Saturday. The event passed off peacefully, people were kept safe, no one was hurt and nobody was unduly inconvenienced by police actions. “Derry Londonderry has for a long time been considered the model for parades and protest. Efforts must now turn to dialogue to ensure that the that the good work of years gone by can be continued.”"},{"url":null,"title":"welshpool hand cyclist raises","story":"Andrew Paddison from Welshpool and his Lands End to John OGroats hand bike chaltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtrity ride..Picture bltspan classtruncate-full-screengty Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Welshpool hand-cyclist raises over K for charityAndrew Paddison in training for his Land’s End to John O’Groats hand bike chltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtarity ride.

That total and then some was passed in no time and has now risen above the pound, mark which has delighted Jeff.ldquoMany thanks to all the sponsors, supporters, players, umpires and scorers, Jeff enthused.ldquoThanks also to Liz Byrne, Jackie Wilson and Dave Crudgington who ran the refreshments and food made by chef Ryan Finnegan. We just couldnrsquot have achieved our target without the help of a lot of people and I can never thank them enough, he added.Sunday was an emotional day for Jeff and he was at times reduced to the odd wee tear.ldquoRodney Hassardrsquos tribute had me close to breaking down, but I was able to hold it together. I got my wish of playing alongside a lot of my former team-mates and I am indebted to them all for turning up and sharing the occasion with me.In the first challenge game of the day Dundrumrsquos current first team took on a squad of former Dundrum players that included Alan Mills and Darren Oldroyd, from Drumaness, Mark Yeates, from Downpatrick, and Byron Woodruff, from Saintfield.The game was competitive to say the least and thanks to decent knocks from Terry Hutley , Stuart Campbelland Sean CameronDundrum posted .Yeates sent the stumps cartwheeling on two occasions with Oldroyd also picking up two wickets. Harry Hitchins got the prize wicket of first team captain Ian Wright.The golden oldies rolled back the years in reply with Rodney Hassardshowing his undoubted class in his first game in five years.Woodruff made , including two big sixes off Cameron and Shilliday danced his way down the wicket, as used to be the norm, for a quick fire . Oldroydand Yeatescompleted the job with five wickets to spare.The second game saw some excellent ball striking and decent bowling from an NCU Select team.Saintfieldrsquos Byron Woodruff and the best young prospect in County Down,  year-old Adam Reid, treated all the bowlers with contempt as the runs flowed quicker than the refreshments.Man of the match Reid hit  not out in only  balls including eight boundaries and one massive six that went out of the ground.Superb all rounder Woodruff showed his old team-mates what a talent he is, hitting  in  balls with four big sixes and the same in boundaries.If both had not retired they would have scored centuries and the Dundrum bowlers were happy to clap them off. Ricky Owens then rolled back the years with a splendid , including three big sixes and three fours, the NCU side posting .It was perhaps fitting that Alan Mills, the oldest player on the pitch and still ultra competitive, finished  not out.Dundrum fought back well after the early onslaught with good fielding catching and astute field placing by captain Gavin McNerlin.Wickets were shared around with Chandar Shekhar the pick of the bowlers, taking  for  of three overs. Shilliday was again on the money and finished with  for . McNerlin, Keba Butler, Neil Reilly and Peter Calvert all got one wicket apiece.Dundrum got a steady start from Greg Hutleyand Rodney Hassard before Drumanessrsquo Neil Gelston removed them both. Oldroyd then hit the middle stump with successive deliveries leaving Dundrum on  for .McNerlin hit Gelston straight over the scoreboard in his  before Stuart Campbellwas run out by Woodruff. Saintfieldrsquos T McCavera picked up two wickets with CIYMSrsquo Steven Hughes and Woodruff also getting in on the act.The last wicket partnership of  between Neil Reillyand Keba Butlergot Dundrum closer than it looked as the NCU side ran out comfortable winners.The match ball sponsors were Bao and Bento and Pizza Palazzo, Newcastle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Downpatrick railway’s first afternoon tea event is runaway success  ","story":"THE Downpatrick and Co Down Railway got out the best china when it hosted its very first afternoon tea event recently.The experience started with guests boarding the train at Downpatrick town station and taking a relaxing journey, travelling in a comfortable s carriage, to Inch Abbey by steam train.They then boarded the buffet carriage where guests were welcomed by the volunteers with a glass of prosecco, wine or a soft drink, before being directed to their allocated tables to enjoy a mouthwatering selection of freshly handmade sandwiches, luxury homemade scones with jam and cream and mini French patisseries.Guests were also offered bottomless teas and coffees, or their own pot of luxury specialist tea.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner, who was one of the servers, said: ldquoThis is something wersquove wanted to do for some time, and itrsquos always been a very popular treat on heritage railways in Great Britain.ldquoNerves may have been a bit jangled as with all first events.

If something does not happen soon we are finished, he said.ldquoTo be owed something like pound, by a public body like the Housing Executive is scandalous and someone should step in to sort this mess out.The crisis has been sparked off by staff shortages and industrial action in the accounts department of the Executive.A spokesman for the Executive said they were extremely concerned at the situation and had brought it to the attention of the Government.ldquoThere have been a number of vacancies in the department and we are unable to fill them because of the Government ban on recruitment to the public service. The result is that we cannot porocess these settlements as quickly as we normally do.He added: We are trying to do all we can to help the smaller contractors who are always much more vulnerable in such a situation.NEWCASTLE mdash A verdict of accidental death has been ed on Newcastle motorcycle ace Tom Herron, who died at the North West  earlier this year.Thirty year-old Herron, ranked third in the world, came off his bike at mph and smashed into a lamp post just  yards from the finishing line in the cc race. He died in hospital two hours later.The inquest at Coleraine heard how Herron had ridden in the race with an injury to his thumb and arm, but the pathologistrsquos report could not determine whether this would have interfered with his ability to control the bike at high speed.Two police constables, who witnessed the accident, told the inquest that the bike scraped the ground and the rider then lost control.The coroner, Mr Robin Wray, discounted suggestions to close the Portrush circuit and said that the racing gave a great deal of pleasure to a lot of people. He added that he had seen Herron race many times and always had a great admiration for him.DRUMANESS mdash Fresh hope for the old Drumaness Mill, which was becoming something of a white elephant, emerged this week with the news that Irish Waste Services have long term plans to develop it into an industrial estate.This week a spokesman for the company confirmed they had already moved on to the site. The long term plans for the , sq ft red brick building involve the setting up of an industrial estate with potential for several hundred jobs. The firm will advertise shortly for tenants and the spokesman explained that there was a real need for small factory premises providing employment in the area.The story of the mill since it closed down when owned by Hurstrsquos as part of the Ulster Weaving Group, when at one stage it provided work for  people, has been a long saga of disappointment.The mill was sold to Irish Waste for around pound, recently. This figure falls far short of the original asking price at a public auction held in Ballynahinch last year, which was believed to be around pound,.The news of employment hopes for Drumaness was welcomed by the chairman of Down Council, Mr Eddie McVeigh, who said it was ldquogood news indeed.He added: ldquoI would welcome anything which would bring jobs to the Drumaness area and I hope that this is not one of the many disappointments which we have suffered over the last few years.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Plessey Telecommunications in Ballynahinch was closed on Monday when more than  production workers walked out as part of a national campaign to obtain shorter hours and more pay.The strike action will be repeated on the Monday of the next two weeks and the production workers are also refusing to work overtime.Their demands are for a basic skilled rate of pound, a reduction in hours to an eventual  hours a week and two extra daysrsquo holiday.A spokesman for the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions said: ldquoWe would have prefer to have obtained our realistic claim by mutual agreement with the employers, but unfortunately we are left with no other alternative.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash A strong plea is being made to boat owners on Strangford Lough to combat the nuisance caused by inexperienced owners of large fast powerboats.It comes from Mr T W McKee, of Sketrick Island, a noted yachtsman with more than  yearsrsquo sailing experience behind him.He is annoyed by a recent ldquomafia-type display of outrageous aggressiveness by a powerboat owner and would like to find an authority with the power to control such ldquoblatant abuse of delightful waters, not to mention the risk to innocent people and their boats by sea-borne thugs.In a letter to the Recorder, Mr McKee describes how his -foot yacht was rocked from side to wide so viciously by the wash of the powerboat, which buzzed around it, that his family and grandchildren were lucky not to be seriously injured as they were flung back and forth across the wheelhouse.He has passed the complaint to the Coastguard in the hope that they can have action taken, but understanding that use of Strangford Lough as a navigable waterway is free to all who wish to use it, he does not expect any success.PORTAFERRY mdash A public meeting is to be held in Portaferry next week to protest about plans for sewage disposal in the town.The meeting has been called by the local development association, which is concerned that the scheme about to be launched will be inadequate.Councillor Paddy Doherty, a member of the development association, appealed for the support of townspeople to support the meeting so that plans can be drawn up to combat the scheme by Ards Borough Council.Mr Doherty said the council originally proposed a filter bed scheme, which would pump treated sewage into Strangford Lough, but then abandoned the filter bed idea.LOUGHINISLAND mdash It was a historic day for the community in Loughinisland when Paddy McFlynn, the president of the GAA, declared open their new Macartan Park on Sunday.The weather certainly could have been kinder for the biggest day in the history of the club, but nevertheless there was a good crowd to witness the opening, as well as the football and hurling games.Mr Vincent Doran, the chairman of the club, welcomed the distinguished guests and said Loughinisland was one of the oldest clubs in East Down.

A few weeks ago Clonduff would have been regarded as red hot favourites to progress against their Division  opponents.However, it is uncertainthe Hilltown outfit will be at full strength as several of their players headed off to the USA a fortnight ago.Clonduff were beaten - to - on Friday night by Burren and given half a chance, Pat Havern and Daniel McCarthy could take full advantage of Clonduffrsquos misfortunes and lead Saval to a surprise win.The curtain-raiser for this game is the IFC encounter between Drumaness and Glasdrumman at .pm. Drumaness are expected to progress as the Quarter Road outfit have yet to win a game this season and seem certain to be relegated from Division .A Gary Murdock-inspired Drumaness beat Glasdrumman - to - at the start of July and they will be intent on repeating that result.There are two IFC games also down for decision over at Fontenoy Park when Drumgath face Darragh Cross and Teconnaught clash with St Johnrsquos.Darragh have been involved in a tense battle for promotion into the top flight, but recent defeats to Carryduff and Longstone have dented their aspirations.However, they are a championship team and in Shane Murray, Michael Monan, Joe McKinney, Matty Hardy and Anton McGrattan they have players capable of going all the way this year and Drumgath, who lie in second place in Division , will do well to get a result.The Teconnaught v St Johnrsquos derby should be a nice opener for the Drumnaquoile side who are more than holding their own in Division  with John Clarke, Conor Morgan, Marty Keenan and the Flanagans all in good form.Teconnaught, who won the JFC title last season, will rely on Paddy Grant, Jack Larkin, Ciaran Carville, David Kelly and Tony Davis to keep them competitive.Friday night sees another four games take place mdash two in Burren and two in Newcastle.A lot of focus will naturally fall on the SFC game between Kilcoo and An Riocht in Burren.Kilcoo have made no secret of the fact that they are determined to regain the Frank OrsquoHare Cup after losing out to Burren in last yearrsquos decider.They have blooded several new faces this season and are well in the running for the ACFL Division  crown, but they will not be taking An Riocht lightly, despite theirindferent season in Division . The Branagan, Devlin, Laverty and Johnston brothers will ensure Kilcoo go into the game in the right frame of mind.At the same venue, Shamrocks clash with Tullylish with the outcome hard to predict.Tullylish have fallen from grace in recent months and have been cast adrt at the bottom of Division . Shamrocks are in the top half of Division , but it looks asthey have missed out on promotion yet again.The game of the night should be in Newcastle where Carryduff lock horns with Castlewellan in the SFC.D J Morganrsquos Carryduff side seem destined for Division , while Castlewellan are battling to avoid relegation to Division .Carryduff have really made their mark this season with James and Daniel Guinness, Owen McCabe, Ronan Beatty, John McGeogh and Josh Connery all to the fore.Castlewellan are just now starting to get a few of their walking wounded back in action and Sean Dornan, Liam, Donal and Gareth McKibbin, Colly Flanagan, Rory Burns and Daniel Morgan could prove a handful for a young Carryduff side.The curtain-raiser to this game is the IFC encounter between Annaclone and Atticall.Ciaran Branniganrsquos Annaclone have been blazing a trail of glory at the top of Division  and it is unlikely that Atticall, who are  points behind them in the table, will inflict their first defeat of the season on them.Annaclone were held to a - to - draw by a fast-improving Ballymartin side on Friday night, but they still should have too much firepower for Atticall.Saturday sees another four games take place.Top billing goes to the Loughinisland v Longstone SFC clash in Castlewellan.Loughinisland have taken Division  by storm since theirthis season and are riding high in third place after Friday nightrsquos - to - win over a good Warrenpoint offering at Macartan Park.Longstone, on the other hand, are embroiled with Carryduff for an automatic promotion place at the top of Division  and now that Ambrose Rogers and Mark Poland are back to full fitness, this should be a cracking affair.Absolutely nothing separated the sides when they met in Division  last year and the same should be the case on Saturday.Loughinisland will rely on their big hitters Dan Gordon mdash still good enough to be playing county football mdash Jonny Flynn, Rory Mason, Stefan Mason and the McClements brothers and they should progress.This game will be proceeded by the Saul v Bosco IFC encounter.Saul,they can reproduce the sort of form they showed a fortnight ago to beat Carryduff, will be expected to ease past their Division  opponents, but championship football doesnrsquot always work that way.Bosco fell to a narrow - to - defeat away to Clann na Banna on Friday night while Saul were soundly beaten - to - by Bredagh.However, Donnan Ritchie will have his charges pumped up for this encounter with the Arnold, Harney and Mahoney brothers prepared to take the game to Bosco.It will be a short trip down the road to Kilcoo for the next two games on Saturday.Glenn play Liatroim in the IFC at .pm and Bryansford take on Bredagh.Neither Glenn or Bredagh have been causing a stir this season, but now is the time to turn it on. Liatroim should be at full strength with the McCrickard connections finally finished with their county hurling commitments and the Fontenoys might just cause an upset.The big game on Saturday night is the Bryansford v Bredagh game in the SFC.Bryansford have been plagued by injuries to key players all season long, but in Davy McKibben, Ruairi Wells, Danny Savage and Conor Maginn they have the men for all jobs and I would expect them to see off Bredagh.Brendan Masonrsquos outfit hammered Saul on Friday night and in Donal Hughes, Tommy McElroy, Eoin Costello and Conor Francis they have players capable of mixing it with the best, but last yearrsquos IFC winners might find Bryansfordrsquos physicality too much to handle.There are another three games to be played on Sunday.Ballymartin face Clann na Banna in the IFC at Mayobridge at pm before Warrenpoint take on Ballyholland and Burren lock horns with neighbours Mayobridge at Pairc Esler.Ballymartin seem to have turned the corner after a few disappointing results, but they are now operating at full strength again and warmed up for the championship with a draw against runaway Division  leaders Annaclone on Friday night.Clann na Banna are sitting in a comfortable mid-table position, but I donrsquot think they will give Ballymartin too much to worry about.The Ballyholland v Warrenpoint game should be another close encounter.Ballyholland may lie bottom of the Division  table, but Warrenpoint are only four points above them. The lsquoPoint have potential match winners in the Boyles and Ross McGarry with Ballyholland looking to the Murphy brothers, Tiarnan Rushe and Seamus Loughran.The Mayobridge v Burrren game is the tie of the round.Paddy OrsquoRourkersquos side, the defending league champions and Frank OrsquoHare Cup holders, will not relinquish their grip on both trophies without a fight.They have been a little bit inconsistent of late, but bounced back to their best on Friday night with a comfortable - to - victory away to Clonduff, while Mayobridge were beaten - to - by Kilcoo.In Kevin McKernan, Donal OrsquoHare, Liam Kerr and the McAvoy brothers, Burren have the perfect blend of youth and experience, while Maybridge will look to Corey Quinn, Shane Annett and the combative Conor Garvey to keep them interested.Downpatrick and Rostrevor bring the curtain down on the first round of fixtures when they clash in Hilltown on Monday night.The sides met last Friday night in the league at Petit Park with Rostrevor winning - to -. However, Caolan Mooney, who was literally unplayable in that game, is unable to play in the championship and that could well hand the initiative to the Hoops.Downpatrick will again look to big performances from their big game players and they donrsquot come any bigger than Gerard Colllins, Michael Magee, Conor McGrady, Jarlath Branagan and the Turley brothers.Without Mooney, Pete McGrathrsquos side will look to Conor Doyle, John Connolly, Shan Parr and Piras Kane for inspiration..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Great turnout for multi cultural event in Ballynahinch  ","story":"HUNDREDS of people attended the multi-cultural family friendly celebration at The Square in Ballynahinch on Saturday.The Connecting Cultures Event was held to help promote community cohesion and encourage acceptance and understanding of other cultures.In addition to music from all over the world, there were dancers entertaining the crowd, face painting, an exotic petting farm, stilt walkers, circus skills and cuisine from ious parts of the world.The African drumming proved particularly popular, with people of all ages keen to take part.

He told BBC’s Nolan Show: “We welcome people from a multitude of dferent opinions and communities. Anybody who comes to the Feile are provided a  to speak. “In no way am I going to ask a band to stop singing a song. That is censorship and not what Feile is involved in doing.”Loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson said he has reported Feile an Phobail to the Charities Commission.“There will be signicant unionist attention on the Northern Ireland Charity Commission and how they deal with the issues around Feile’s endorsement of the promotion of IRA terrorism,” he tweeted.“Failure to robustly investigate will confirm what many perceive to be an inherent bias.”The commission told the News Letter it could not confirm whether or not it is has received report regarding the feile.A spokesperson added: “This is because the commission is an effective and fair regulator of Northern Ireland charities and, as such, would not wish to prejudice any current or potential investigation.”There have also been calls for Belfast City Council – one of the principal funders of the feile – to carry out an investigation.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Having stood empty for many years, I am delighted it is being given a new and exciting future.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We learn about the Romans, World War Two, the American Civil War at school, but most people have never been taught about the history of their own country.ldquoWe have more castles than any other country in the world per square mile, and thatrsquos something worth celebrating.Fonmon Castle is a rarity among Welsh castles, uniquely well-suited to creating interactive events like jousting, workshops, Renaissance and Steampunk fairs, and many more.ldquoFonmon Castle is one of the few Welsh castles that is still lived in, explained Mr OrsquoHenessey. ldquoIt has remained within two families since it was built by the Marcher Lords during the Norman invasion.ldquoIt recently it was sold to a very friendly couple and they headhunted me in order to help them turn the castle around, to open it up to the public and help teach people more about Welsh history.ldquoTheyrsquove basically provided me a blank cheque. I want people to wake up in the mornings, and wonder lsquowhat shall we do today at Fonmon Castle rsquoThe first of these events, on Wednesday, August , will feature medieval re-enactments, living history displays, medieval combat lessons, have-a-go archery, childrenrsquos play areas and dino walks - and will be free.ldquoWe have so much history to offer as a country, said Mr OrsquoHenessey. ldquoI want to really start to show it off.To find out more, email info@fonmoncastle article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The paper, which examines the negative impact of a ‘no deal’ EU exit, warns the “Northern Ireland Civil Service’s assessment remains that a ‘no deal’ would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI’s economy and society”. Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says. Once again, it raises serious concerns over the agri-sector in particular, meat in particular, and beef especially, in regards to “increased vulnerability to low cost non-EU imports in the GB or NI market”. Its not just the physical goods, though as it says Northern Irelands IT sector is facing the cost of exporting services increasing, by an average of .%. And regarding foreign direct investment– one of the big business buzzwords here over the last few years – it says “under a ‘no deal’ exit, NI’s FDI attractiveness would be negatively impacted”. “A ‘no deal’ would see losses in the medium to long run of % per annum in the case of the number of FDI projects and of .% for FDI-related new jobs.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/hamilton_hotel.jpg","title":"new  bedroom hotel for titanic quarter","story":"Posted on Monday  July  by John Mulgrew Belfast looks set to get a new -bedroom hotel amid freshly submitted plans for a development across from Titanic Belfast.

A statement, signed by  business organisations and trade bodies, says that “two and a half years on from the collapse of the Executive, and now approaching the likely conclusion of the Brexit process, the Northern Ireland business community is deeply concerned at the continued absence of a ing administration and is calling on political representatives to redouble their efforts to reach agreement to get the Assembly and Executive working again”. “There has seldom been a time when strong and effective leadership has been more necessary, both to deliver on the domestic agenda and also to speak up for Northern Ireland in the Brexit process. “We need a fully ing administration to agree and deliver a Programme for Government that will build infrastructure, reform our health service and education system, ensure we have a strong economy, and create opportunities for our young people. We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise. Without such a commitment and associated action from our elected representatives, we risk irreparable damage to our economy and our society for which future generations will judge us harshly.””  The letter has been signed by the following organisations: Belfast Chamber Causeway Chamber of Commerce CBI NI Centre for Competitiveness Construction Employers Federation NI Federation of Small Businesses Northern Ireland Freight Transport Association Hospitality Ulster IoD NI Londonderry Chamber of Commerce Manufacturing NI Mineral Products Association NI Newry Chamber of Commerce  Trade NI Grain Trade Association NI Hotels Federation NI Tourism Alliance Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association Northern Ireland Retail Consortium Retail NI Women in Business NIView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/qub_1.jpg","title":"ulster business top  sees sales rise by ","story":"Posted on Monday August  by Ulster Business Michael Neill, head of office, AL Goodbody Belfast, sponsor of the Top , Flavio Malnarcic, chief financial officer, Moy Park and Ulster Business editor John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s largest businesses have seen sales rise by .% to more £.bn, the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies list  has revealed.The list, sponsored by AL Goodbody, showcases the successes of the biggest firms from right across Northern Ireland.

Editor John Mulgrew looks at the numbers, the analysis and the once household names no longer with us The tattered corner of the Ulster Business Top  list from  probably isn’t the worst way to analogise the then state of the Northern Ireland economy, and a precursor to what was around the cornerWe’ve come a very long way in a decade, and while there are some big and familiar names on the  Top  list, there are firms which have fallen off it entirely, and resigned to the history books post-recession.In former editor David Elliott’s intro to the magazine, it references the fact that most of the accounting periods in the list were just as the downturn was starting to gather pace.Economist John Simpson, writing in the edition, says the “big recession of  and  did not impact evenly across the economy, and recovery will be best seen as a sequence of dferent proportions”.There are some positive things to take from it – including a large glowing image of Victoria Square, which in the more than  years since it opened in the heart of Belfast has become part of the retail fabric of the city.Topping the list at the time was Viridian Group, which owned Northern Ireland Electricity and now includes Power NI as a subsidiary, with turnover of £.bn. However, it made a loss of £m during that period.Second on the list is a business familiar to many. Quinn Group, headed by Co Fermanagh businessman Sean Quinn, posted turnover of £.bn for the year ending    but incurred a loss of more than £m during the same period. There have been enough column inches written about the business in the years since then to fill many a book – and they have.Among those no longer on the list is developer David Patton  SonsLtd, Armaghdown Creameries Ltd and Ballyrogan Holdings.Many others on the list have since been acquired by some of the now giants in their respective industries.Moy Park is an interesting one. Back then it was still a large player in the poultry sector with turnover of £m.Those fortunes have evidently changed dramatically since then, as the company has held the top spot on the list for the last eight years, and now posts big profits and turnover of £.bn.Meanwhile, WR Barnett is on the  list in position , with a turnover of £m and pre-tax profits of £m. In the last  years, it has climbed the list to comfortably take the number two spot with sales of almost  times that of those a decade earlier.As far as employment goes, it was Tesco topping the list in , followed by Bombardier – which at the time had a workforce of around , people – with Royal Mail and Queen’s University following in third and fourth position.A lot has happened in the years since that list. The economy has slowly but surely gotten back on its feet. Growth has been gradual, and in the last year or so has been sitting at around %, while employment levels and unemployment levels are at their respective positive record levels. However, we are amid the most challenging time for business in a generation and some of the signs, and whispered conversations, are far from positive. As I write this, we still sit on the precipice of whether we secure an agreement on Brexit, or shuffle off the edge without a parachute. Let’s hope it’s the former.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/flav_1.jpg","title":"top  moy park takes number one spot","story":"Posted on Thursday August  by Ulster Business From a purely editorial perspective it would be refreshing to have a dferent company head up the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies list.But Moy Park has now made it to the top for eight consecutive years, as the poultry processing giant continues to expand both its workforce, global sales and pre-tax profit – firmly setting its place at Northern Ireland’s biggest business, with a workforce of more than , here alone.In the last year, it has grown turnover to just over £.bn, up from £.bn a year earlier, while pre-tax profits have surged by % – rising to £.m in its latest set of accounts, ending December .The business supplies Moy Park branded and own label chicken products to leading retailers and foodservice providers throughout the UK, Ireland and Europe.In numbers, Moy Park processes six million fresh chickens each week, , turkeys a year, along with , tonnes of other ‘added value products’.London-born Chris Kirke replaced long-serving boss Janet McCollum in , less than a year after Craigavon-based Moy Park was taken over by new US owners Pilgrim’s.And around a year ago, Flavio Malnarcicjoined the business – then as executive business director – before taking over as the firm’s chief financial officer.He was formerly business director at JBS Global, and has a senior leadership background as executive director of the poultry and export business in Seara, also as chief financial officer and chief executive at Tyson do Brazil and finance roles in Cargill.“There has been a consistence in the performance. We have been growing volumes… we got to six million birds each week, which is about a third of the UK market. For the UK, it is a signicantly big company.“Looking year-over-year, our performance was very consistent in the last few years.”“For people working there, working for a company which is the largest employer in a country, the top company, it is a source of pride for us.“But I don’t think that drives the behaviour of the team. We are more interested in making sure that our performance is sustainable in terms of margins.“It is nice that we arebut that is not our main goal. We are making sure that we are sustainable, work on quality, safety. There are lots of other things. It’s making sure that we fit our customer needs.“We have a lot focus on that, and we need to be competitive.”And as for growth, expanding turnover isn’t necessarily the main focus, according to Flavio“A lot of the efforts in the last year have been to consolidate the management tools they have in Pilgrim’s. They are very keen on efficiency, so that’s one of their strategies. “ a lot of focus in improving our performance, it’s how we can be more efficient, focusing on a portfolio that feeds our customer base, how we deal with our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
