Photograph:  Colin KeeganCollinsAn independent expert is to be appointed to investigate claims by the whistleblower who exposed the south Kerry Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (Camhs) scandal that he was sidelined within the HSE after his revelations.HSE chief executive Paul Reid said an independent authorised person was being appointed to investigate a protected disclosure made by the whistleblower, Dr Ankur Sharma. In January, a report found 240 children in South Kerry Camhs had received substandard care, and 46 had suffered significant harm. Dr Sharma had raised concerns about their treatment immediately on starting to work in the service in 2020.During an appearance before the Dáil public accounts committee on Thursday, Mr Reid declined to answer questions about Dr Sharma’s claims that he was told to take time off and then placed on administrative duties after he revealed the substandard care being given to children in south Kerry.Mr Reid told Sinn Féin TD Imelda Munster that he had to respect the protected disclosure process and that the HSE was engaging with Dr Sharma about how this would proceed.Asked whether it was HSE policy to ask whistleblowers to leave after they made disclosures, Mr Reid replied “absolutely not”. He said he had no experience of any whistleblower being “punished” for making revelations. Last year, the HSE received 60-65 protected disclosures, he said.Review to be expanded On foot of the report, a nationwide review of prescribing practices in Camhs services for children with ADHD is being carried out. HSE chief operating officer Anne O’Connor said the review, which will sample 50 files per unit, will be expanded to non-ADHD files at a later date.Committee chairman Brian Stanley criticised the delay in the HSE implementing an integrated financial management system across all of its spending. The need for such a system was first highlighted in 2014, he pointed out.The entire system will be in place by 2026, according to HSE chief financial officer Stephen Mulvany, who said a year had been lost due to Covid-19 and the cyberattack on HSE systems.Mr Stanley said 12 years was “too long” but Mr Mulvany replied that the project was probably the biggest change project in the country at the moment” and the risks involved needed to be managed appropriately.Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy likened HSE financial reports to “blancmange mixed together in a bowl” after a Comptroller \u0026amp Auditor General report highlighted more than €1 billion in unaudited spending in the accounts.Criticising the lack of “granular information” on spending, she said the failure to audit some of this was “completely unacceptable”.Responding to questions from TDs, officials said there have been no admissions of children to adult psychiatric units so far this year.

The building has “no more or less challenges” than most other buildings in this area of provision, she said. “You’ve decided to move those 11 people 30km down the road at a cost of €1.25 million and you have no planning permission for that building.”“The decision to close Owenacurra is absolutely contrary to national policy, and to the wishes of the residents and is part of a procurement process I have considerable questions about.”Department of Health principal officer Seamus Hempenstall said the decision was taken by the HSE in response to findings by the Mental Health Commission and it was in the interests of the residents that they have accommodation as the building is not suitable.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"motorists on rising fuel costs what can you do you can t stay at home","story":"Ian Currums business owner at Aztec Scaffolding said the company had three vans and three trucks on the road and his weekly fuel bill had risen from €800 per week to “12 to 14 hundred”.

More than a third of Northern Ireland’s population hold an Irish passport, according to latest official figures.While applications plunged amid overseas travel restrictions during pandemic lockdowns, fresh data from the Department of Foreign Affairs shows numbers rebounding.Already this year, 24,643 people were issued with Irish passports in the North through Northern Ireland Passport Express (NIPX), which is available at post offices in the North. This is more than 400 every day. The figures do not include Irish citizens in the North who apply for their passports directly from Dublin.If the trend continues it suggests more than 150,000 Irish passports would be issued in the North by the year end.This would eclipse, dramatically, the 107,937 issued through NIPX in 2019 – the last full-year figure before coronavirus prevented international travel for most.Issued passports during 2019 in the North soared 27 per cent from the previous year (84,855). This continued a pattern of rising Irish passport applications in the region against declining British applications following Brexit. Official figures show there were 110,506 applications from Northern Ireland for a UK passport in 2019. This was down from 119,298 the previous year, in a continuing 15 per cent slide in such applications from people in the North over a five-year period.LockdownDespite the virus grounding most of the world’s aircraft since the outbreak began, 56,709 Irish passports were issued in the North last year, up almost 16 per cent from 48,911 in 2020, when the first pandemic lockdown was imposed in Ireland.Aggregate figures for the decade 2012 to 2022, to date, show 660,427 Irish passports issued in the North, about 35 per cent of the region’s 1.8 million population. Under the Belfast Agreement, Irish and British governments recognise the birthright of all people in Northern Ireland to identify as either Irish, British or both. There is also a right to dual citizenship and people can carry Irish and British passports. Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, is down to increasing pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. An Irish passport allows them to travel freely within the EU. The Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson has previously said he gets “quite a lot” of loyalist voters in his constituency who ask him to sign off on their applications for Irish passports. The East Antrim MP said he encourages constituents going on holidays to opt for an Irish passport as it is a quicker process and negates restrictions imposed on British citizens in the EU as a result of Brexit.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"calls for consumer watchdog to investigate alleged fuel price gouging","story":"Taoiseach said price fixing and profiteering was unacceptable and  morally reprehensible. Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WirePoliticians are calling on Ireland’s consumer watchdog to investigate alleged fuel price gouging amid rises in the cost of petrol and diesel ahead of the cut in excise duties.Excise cuts of 20 cent per litre of petrol and 15 cent on diesel kicked in from midnight as part of Government efforts to mitigate spiralling fuel costs happening as a result of the war in Ukraine.However, there have been claims that fuel companies hiked the price just before the excise cut and suggestions that prices are still rising.Taoiseach Micheál Martin told Fianna Fáil’s parliamentary party meeting on Wednesday that price fixing and profiteering is unacceptable and that “any exploitation of a barbaric war such as this is morally reprehensible”.The issue was raised at the meeting by Longford-Westmeath TD Joe Flaherty who said that he wanted to see the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) investigate fuel companies.Senator Eugene Murphy echoed the call, telling colleagues he had never seen the public so angry with fuel suppliers. Sources said Mr Martin indicated he would follow up on the matter.Laois-Offaly TD Barry Cowen has written to the CCPC saying he is concerned some retailers may be engaging in “price gouging”.“Photos have been shared on social media of the high cost of petrol and diesel per litre, with assertions being made that the cost increased dramatically overnight – sometimes apparently by the sum of the planned Government reduction in excise duty,” he wrote.His letter said he believes it is “essential” that the CCPC looks into the matter, adding: “I urge you to act immediately and to give this investigation full priority.”‘Dawn raids’Speaking in the Dáil on Thursday Fine Gael TD Fergus O’Dowd called for “dawn raids” on fuel companies.He said petrol dealers are challenging the authority of the Government “by not passing on the full discount in many cases to consumers”.Mr O’Dowd said: “The Government needs to show them their teeth and instead of soft words and phone calls we need to ensure there are dawn raids by gardaí and the CCPC into these companies because they are directly challenging your authority while pocketing this money.”He also said the public “need to flood the CCPC with complaints because they will only act if they have those complaints”.The Louth TD added: “This is a war situation right around Europe and if the petrol retailers get away with it God knows who the next crowd will be.”Addressing Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan he said: “You must act and protect the ordinary people of this country.” He said it must be insisted that the excise cuts are passed on to customers.Mr Ryan said he understood that the CCPC would be issuing a statement on the issue shortly.He said: “I think it’s important to allay public fears. If you have any particular evidence or examples if you could direct to them as well as our Department I will follow up.”‘Price gouging’Social Democrats TD Jennifer Whitmore also wrote to the CCPC asking it to launch an investigation.She said: “I have received dozens of representations from all over the country telling me the same thing – fuel prices in their respective localities are increasing in forecourts, a number of times a day, in unison.“We have all seen prices in forecourts increase overnight, following the Government announcement that it was cutting excise duty in fuel, leading to accusations of price gouging.”The Wicklow TD said: “We cannot tolerate a situation in which certain retailers or suppliers may be engaging in cartel behaviour, or price gouging, during a period of great peril for the country – when ordinary workers and families are already struggling to cope with the cost-of-living crisis.”She said that given the hardship price hikes are causing she is hopeful the CCPC will open an investigation swiftly."},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics pearse doherty on sinn f%C3%A9in s policies a united ireland and issues of security and neutrality","story":"Sinn Féin finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty joins Hugh and Pat to discuss what his party\u0027s priorities and policies would be, if they were to lead the next government.

Sir Ernest Shackleton’s polar exploration ship had last been seen 107 years ago when it was slowly crushed and then sunk by pack ice, and until very recently had been thought lost forever.Yet four days on from the discovery, 69-year-old Bound confesses – on an in-and-out phone line from Antarctica – that the enormity of the achievement, the peak of a stellar career of over 40 years that has earned him the nickname ‘the Indiana Jones of the Deep’, has yet to sink in. His head is still spinning.“Shackleton has been a lifelong thing for me,” he explains. He grew up in the nearby Falkland Islands – and still has a home there – where the polar explorer’s “greatest escape of all time” in leading his crew of 27 to safety after the loss of their ship has made him the enduring local hero. “I have with me right now a book on Shackleton that I was given for regular Sunday school attendance in the 1960s,” he says. Indeed some reports have even suggested that Bound is related to Shackleton, who at the time of the sinking had been attempting to make the first crossing of Antarctica. “At that point,” says Bound calmly, “we knew it must be Endurance because it is the only shipwreck that is down there.”   It was only when they switched to cameras, however, that what was revealed “sent shivers up my spine,” he says. Even more extraordinary in a life-changing moment of superlatives was the state of preservation of Shackleton’s ship. “Without any exaggeration this is the finest wooden shipwreck I have ever seen – by far – sitting upright, bold and beautiful and largely intact.” The combination of the extreme icy cold at that depth – “water is a brilliant preservative” – and the absence in the Weddell Sea of wood-eating marine organisms that feast on timber wrecks elsewhere has produced what Bound refers to simply as “magic”.   “You can see a porthole that is Shackleton’s cabin. At that moment, you really do feel the breath of the great man upon the back of your neck. You can even see the paintwork. It is in such a good state that I felt in that moment we could almost raise her and sail off.” Almost. The Antarctic Treaty contains strict rules on disturbing wrecks but, even if it was allowed to bring Endurance to the surface, the technology needed is not yet available. “Not in my lifetime,” Bound says. “Conservation science hasn’t reached that stage, but in 40 or 50 years…” So speaks a man whose life has been defined by a fascination with the oceans. “I was always enthralled by the sea growing up. I was going out on a schooner when I was still a boy.” He was christened Michael, but has always been known as Mensun, his childhood mispronunciation of the word “medicine”, after a bout of severe illness. At 11, he was sent to secondary school in Uruguay.After a spell on a merchant ship in his late teens, he studied history and then archaeology at university first in the US and then at Oxford, where he still lives with his wife Joanna and three grown-up children. In the early 1980s he made his name excavating an Etruscan shipwreck from the sixth century BC off the Italian island of Giglio, and went on to head the first academic marine archaeology unit in England at Oxford. But part of him has always belonged in the South Atlantic.  In the next day or two, the expedition’s icebreaker, SS Agulhas II, will stop off en route for South Africa on the uninhabited South Georgia, a Falkland Islands dependency until 1985. This was where Shackleton led his men to safety after an 800-mile open-boat journey. And it is where the man they called “the Boss” was buried in Grytviken Cemetery in a funeral that took place exactly 100 years to the day before Endurance was rediscovered.  Some argue that wrecks should be left where they are, especially if they are the last resting place of those who died in them, though that wasn’t the case with Endurance. Bound believes that one day it should be brought to the surface. “Even though it is so well-preserved, the longer we leave it there as pollution increases and sea temperature and acidity rise, the more it will rot and what we have found will be gone, lost to learning and to heritage,” he says. For Bound, she is more than a ship. There is the whole escape saga of Shackleton and his crew.  “He wasn’t the two-dimensional Edwardian hard man that he is sometimes portrayed as.

They have demonstrated a strength of resolve and unity of purpose among Western leaders that Mr Putin did not think was possible as he weighed whether or not to go ahead with the invasion.And the longer the Western powers can maintain a united front, the more pressure Mr Putin will come under to end his brutal bombardment, especially if the sanctions precipitate a total collapse of the Russian economy, which appears a very strong possibility given that the rouble has now halved in value since the start of the year.When prominent Russian oligarchs are warning that Russia is facing an economic catastrophe similar to 1998, which led to Moscow defaulting on its debt, it is clear the sanctions are having the desired effect. Not even Mr Putin can wage a war if he has no money to pay for it.The only ray of light for the Russian leader, therefore, would be if isions develop among Western leaders that begin to undermine the effectiveness of their stand against the Kremlin. In this regard, the contradictory, and sometimes confusing, statements emanating from the White House on the Ukraine conflict are hardly helpful.From the outset, US President Joe Biden has shown a woeful grasp of what is at stake in Ukraine. In January, he was forced to issue a correction after he appeared to suggest that no action would be taken against Russia if it only mounted a “minor incursion” into Ukraine.Then, to compound the image that he does not fully comprehend the issue, in his State of the Union address earlier this month he managed to confuse Ukraine with Iran, two very different countries that present very different policy challenges to Washington.The sense that the White House is not entirely on top of the Ukraine brief has increased, furthermore, as the fighting has intensified, with Washington giving conflicting signals about how best to help the Ukrainian war effort.The Ukrainian military’s impressive performance in preventing the Russians from over-running the country in just a few days, which was Mr Putin’s expectation when he launched the invasion, has been helped considerably by the training and support they have received from the West. Britain has trained around 25,000 Ukrainian troops, and the British anti-tank weapons delivered before hostilities commenced have been used to devastating effect against Russian heavy armour. Similarly, Stinger anti-aircraft missiles provided by the US have stopped the Russians from establishing air superiority over Ukraine, with Russian warplanes sustaining heavy losses.Making sure the Ukrainians have the arms they need to sustain this valiant effort is, therefore, essential if Kyiv is to prevail in its efforts to thwart the Russian advance.In particular, the Ukrainians are in desperate need of extra aircraft to protect their citizens and, following a direct appeal last weekend by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for the West to supply more warplanes, Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, appeared to support the move, saying that plans for Poland to provide 28 Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets had been given a “green light” by Washington.But when Poland offered to fly the jets to a US base in Germany to prepare them for delivery to Ukraine, the Biden administration quickly changed its mind, with the Pentagon warning it could result in a direct confrontation between Russia and Nato.At a time when the Ukrainian people are fighting for their lives, Washington’s conflicting signals risk undermining Western unity, as leaders argue about the best way of supporting Ukraine.As a sovereign nation, Ukraine is perfectly within its rights to obtain arms to defend itself, and acquiring warplanes should be seen as no different from receiving shipments of anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles.Consequently, if the Biden administration is really serious about making sure that Mr Putin pays a heavy price for invading Ukraine, it should be working overtime to help the Ukrainians receive the kit they need, instead of putting obstacles in their way.For far too long, Western policymakers have urged caution when dealing with Moscow for fear of provoking a confrontation. That approach has patently failed now that Mr Putin has torn up the international rule book by invading Ukraine. In future, Washington needs to act decisively to defend its interests, irrespective of whether it causes offence to Moscow.More from NewsMan arrested after Bristol\u0026#39s Southmead hospital evacuated due to suspicious packageRussia-Ukraine latest news: West must understand \u0026#39danger\u0026#39 of sending Kyiv weapons, warns KremlinVladimir Putin cannot be ‘rewarded’ with the Donbas for invading Ukraine, says ministerPolitics latest news: Nato is a defensive alliance, No 10 insists after Russian chemical weapons raised as possible \u0026#39red line\u0026#39Watch: Brave Ukrainians defuse giant Russian bomb with two hands and bottle of waterRoman Abramovich accused of ‘destabilising Ukraine’ by supplying steel for ‘Russian tanks’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"links peter stringfellow stephen hawking shaped british history","story":"Peter Stringfellow helped “shape British history”, the Oxford University Press has said, as the self-styled “King of Clubs” is inducted into the nation’s biographical bible.The Oxford Dictionary of Biography (ODB) details the lives of those who made significant contributions to British life, from William Shakespeare to Sir Winston Churchill, and it has now been updated with entries on luminaries such as Prof Stephen Hawking.The ODB’s latest iteration also includes an entry on Stringfellow, best known for his nightlife empire and for opening the first topless table-dancing venue in the UK.Stringfellow, who died in 2018, takes his place in the ODB alongside genuine royalty, together with a host of actors, artists, scientists and politicians. His entry states that the entrepreneur from Sheffield was “the first club owner to be granted a fully nude licence”.

We will be ruthless in pursuing those who enable the killing of civilians, destruction of hospitals and illegal occupation of sovereign allies.Mr Deripaska has stakes in En+ Group, Mr Sechin is the chief executive of Rosneft and Mr Lebedev is chairman of the Board of Directors of Bank Rossiya.Government wants to take Russian economy \u0027out at the knees\u0027Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned in part because of his links to a metals firm that may have provided steel to the Russian military to build tanks.The oligarch is cited in the Government’s financial sanctions register as having a significant shareholding in, and exercising effective control over, the steel manufacturing and mining company Evraz Plc.It states: “Abramovich is or has been involved in destabilising Ukraine and undermining and threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, via Evraz Plc…“Evraz Plc is or has been involved in providing financial services, or making available funds, economic resources, goods or technology that could contribute to destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine – which includes potentially supplying steel to the Russian military which may have been used in the production of tanks.”The document, published by the Treasury’s Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation, states that Mr Abramovich “is or has been involved in obtaining a benefit from or supporting the Government of Russia”, as he and the metals and mining company “carry on business in sectors of strategic significance to the Government of Russia – namely the construction, defence and extractive sectors”.It also cites the “pro-Kremlin” oligarch\u0027s “close relationship for decades” with Vladimir Putin and asserts that he has received “preferential treatment and concessions” from the Russian President and government.The new sanctions announced today form part of a Government strategy to take the Russian economy “out at the knees” and curb funding of the “Putin war machine”.For Chelsea, there could now be uncertainty over the £1.5billion worth of loans which have been pumped into the club since he purchased it in 2003. He had promised to write off the loans after putting the club up for sale last week, with proceeds going to all victims of the Ukraine war. Chelsea\u0027s financial ecosystem is heavily reliant on handouts from Mr Abramovich. Matchday revenue is dwarfed by some rivals largely due to his decision in 2018 to shelve a £1billion stadium redevelopment. The loans are due to be repaid to Camberley International Investments Ltd, a British Virgin Island entity. It is certain that fund is owned by Mr Abramovich, but more detail is elusive given the source\u0027s offshore status. Despite calls in parliament for Mr Abramovich to face action in recent weeks, the announcement by the Government appears to have come as shock to the club.A spokesperson for the Russian was unable to comment. It is unclear whether he has now halted the process of speaking to potential club buyers.Mr Abramovich is described by the Foreign Office in a new statement on the sanctions as one of the few oligarchs from the 1990s to maintain prominence under Putin.Nadine Dorries, the Culture Secretary, has said that Chelsea will still be able to play matches and pay staff.Our priority is to hold those who have enabled the Putin regime to account. Today’s sanctions obviously have a direct impact on Chelsea and its fans. We have been working hard to ensure the club and the national game are not unnecessarily harmed by these important sanctions, she said.I know this brings some uncertainty, but the Government will work with the league and clubs to keep football being played while ensuring sanctions hit those intended. Football clubs are cultural assets and the bedrock of our communities. We\u0027re committed to protecting them.Mr Abramovich has been to Stamford Bridge just once - in November last year - since he withdrew an application for a UK visa in 2018, so the travel ban is unable to cause him much of a headache.As well as Chelsea, he has stakes in steel giant Evraz and Norilsk Nickel. He sold a 73 per cent stake in Russian oil firm Sibneft to state-owned gas titan Gazprom for £9.87 billion in 2005. His net worth is an estimated £9.4 billion.Jets and yachts owned or chartered by Mr Abramovichcan been seized, the sanctions say.\u0027The blood of the Ukrainian people is on their hands\u0027The seven who have been sanctioned have a combined net worth of more than £15billion, the Government said in a press release announcing the move.Liz Truss, the Foreign Secretary, said: Today\u0027s sanctions show once again that oligarchs and kleptocrats have no place in our economy or society. With their close links to Putin they are complicit in his aggression.The blood of the Ukrainian people is on their hands. They should hang their heads in shame.Chancellor Rishi Sunak simply tweeted Sanctioned and a link to the press release.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was pleased the government had sanctioned Mr Abramovich, but they had been too slow to do so.Speaking on a trip to Estonia, Sir Keir said: I\u0027m slightly frustrated, we called for this weeks ago and whilst we\u0027re very supportive of the action the Government has taken on sanctions, there are echoes of Afghanistan here. We need to go further and faster on this.I called for these sanctions against Abramovich two weeks ago now and a feature of the Government\u0027s reaction here is that they are too slow.Chris Bryant, the Labour MP for the Rhondda who has led a lot of the pressure on this, wrote: Well done finally on sanctioning Roman Abramovich and freezing his assets. Now let’s move on other Putin oligarchs as fast as possible so they can’t squirrel their assets out of reach.James Cleverly, Europe minister, said: Putin is a global pariah but there is nowhere to hide as we go further and act more strongly in partnership with our allies. In the coming days and weeks we will continue to impose further sanctions to starve the Kremlin\u0027s war machine of its funding.David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, wrote: At last! This is the right decision. But it shouldn’t have taken the government weeks. Too few oligarchs linked to Putin’s rogue regime have faced sanctions from the UK. We are lagging behind the EU and the US.

Days after the party fundraiser, on July , , the passenger jet Malaysia Airlines flight  was shot down by a surface to air missile launched from pro-Russian separatist-controlled territory in Ukraine.And just months earlier, Putin had faced international condemnation over the annexation of Crimea.But speaking to LBC Radio’s Andrew Marr today, the former PM insisted Mrs Chernukhin had attempted “absolutely no influence” on UK policies on Russia.Askedhe remembered the game, he said: “I do, I remember - and there was absolutely no conversation about Russia, finance, Putin or anything .”  “We had a very careful system for vetting who could and could not give money to the Conservative Party. “A small handful of people had any connections with Russia, and as I’m concerned most of them were dissidents, often Ukrainians.” Mrs Chernukhin was born in Russia, studied in the United States and became a British citizen in . She is legally eligible to vote and make donations to UK political parties, and there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing on her part.Ms Chernukhin has repeatedly paid for access to successive Prime Ministers ministers in Party fundraising auctions, including a ‘girl’s night out’ with Theresa May and Liz Truss, dinner with then-Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and a second tennis match with Boris Johnson, after he became Prime Minister.In total Ms Chernukhin has given almost £ million to the Conservatives - and is the biggest female political donor in British history.Mr Cameron went on: “But crucially, this point - Britain had the strongest anti-Putin policy of any country in Europe. “Who threw him out of the G  Who insisted on the sanctions  Who passed the rules on beneficial ownership  “So I think it’s a giant red herring to suggest in some way that Russian money somehow influenced policy against Putin and Russia.” He added he was the “strongest ally in building a really robust case in holding Putin to account.”  Asked what Mrs Chernukhin and other Russian expat donors were paying for when they gave money to the party, he replied: “Like many people who come and live in this country and make it their home, they get involved in politics because they care about this country, and making sure it’s an open, tolerant and democratic country.” He said there was “absolutely no influence” on the UK’s Russia policies adding: “If they were trying to buy something, they didn’t really get it, did they ” On Tuesday evening, Mrs Chernukhin was given the Award of St Agnes, one of most prestigious honours handed out by the Republic of San Marino at a ceremony in London. The event was attended by a high-level government delegation from the micro-country, including Captains Regent Francesco Mussoni and Giacomo Simoncini, the dual heads of state.

Special Rules for Terminal Illness allow terminally ill claimants to access fast-tracked benefits. But they must get their GP to fill out a form confirming they can “reasonably be expected” to die in six months. This time period will now be changed to  months after years of campaigning from charities and MPs.But the change next month will only apply to people seeking Universal Credit and Employment and Support Allowance. It’s understood dying claimants will still have to follow the six-month rule when applying for Personal Independence Paymentuntil at least next year. Ten people a day die while waiting for a decision on a PIP claim. The rules under Disability Living Allowance and Attendance Allowance will also only be changed at a later date, with officials hoping to finish the changes in . Matthew Reed, Chief Executive of the end of le charity Marie Curie, said: “This will ensure more dying people can concentrate on making the most of the limited time they have left, rather than worrying about their finances.” But he added “there is more to be done” and PIP must “come quickly in line with those benefits impacted today”. Sally Light, chief executive of the Motor Neurone Disease Association, said: “This is an important first step and we hope that this positive change can be enacted for other applicable benefits as soon as possible.” The Department for Work and Pensions said those who are eligible will not be subject to a face-to-face assessment or waiting periods, and in the majority of cases they will receive the highest rate of benefits.

We are lagging far behind allies in the EU and the US.It is right that, under pressure from Labour, the Government U-turned to strengthen sanctions legislation. Ministers must now move faster to continue to close the sanctions gap.Here are the new names added to the sanctions list. Roman Abramovich Roman Abramovich is one of the most high-profile Russian oligarchs in the UK thanks to his ownership of Cha Football Club. Abramovich, who is worth an estimated £. billion and has a multi-million pound property empire in the UK, also has stakes in steel giant Evraz and Norilsk Nickel, the UK Government said. He sold a % stake in Russian oil firm Sibneft to state-owned gas titan Gazprom for £. billion in . He recently announced plans to sell the top-flight football club, which he has owned since , after initially saying he was passing stewardship to the clubaposs charitable foundation. Abramovich has denied having strong ties with Putin but the Government said he had had received financial benefits from the Kremlin, including tax breaks for his companies, the buying and selling of shares from and to the state at favourable rates, and contacts in the run up to the  World Cup in Russia.The list shows he has been sanctioned both on the basis of his personal connections to the Kremlin and preferential contracts over the years, but also the role the Evraz steel company plays - the British government believe it is providing steel to the Russian military The football club has now been seized by the UK Government but ministers have issued a licence authorising Cha to continue playing matches. Season ticket holders and those with games already booked can still attend matches, but no new tickets can be sold and the clubaposs merchandise shop will close. Abramovich’s UK property will also be frozen with not even cleaners allowed to enter it. But the asset is still only “frozen” - not actually seized by the UK government. Technically the tycoon’s family - who are not directly targeted with sanctions - could stay in his homes but officials believe it would be practically very dficult. Oleg Deripaska Industrialist Oleg Deripaska, who is Abramovichaposs former business partner, was among those newly added to the sanctions list. The Russian tycoon has stakes in En+ Group, a major extractives and energy company which owns UC Rusal, one of the world’s major aluminium producers. Deripaska is estimated to be worth £billion, with a multi-million pound property portfolio in the UK.  He hit the headlines in  when he hosted Labour grandee Lord Peter Mandelson and then-shadow chancellor George Osborne on his yacht in Corfu. Mr Osborne was accused of trying to solicit a donation for the Tory party from the oligarch - something he denies. The US designated Deripaska in , which is means a personaposs assets are blocked and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from dealing with them. Igor Sechin Tycoon Igor Sechin is the chief executive of Rosneft, the Russian state oil company. The UK Government described him as a particularly close and influential ally of Putin and he is understood to be regarded as Putinaposs number two.  He has already been sanctioned by the US and EU. The French Government seized a yacht linked to the oligarch last week. Andrey Kostin Andrey Kostin is the chairman of VTB bank, Russiaaposs second largest bank. The bank was designated by the UK last month. The UK put his net worth at an estimated £ million. Kostin was described by the FCDO as a close associate of Putin, and has long supported Kremlin objectives through the bank.  He has previously accused the West of waging economic war against Russia through sanctions. He has already been sanctioned by the US and EU. Alexei Miller The chief executive of Russian energy company Gazprom is one of the most important executives supporting the Kremlin. Miller served under Putin in the s when the now-President was deputy mayor in St Petersburg. UK officials believe he has been going along his career trajectory with Putin since the Russian President was was deputy mayor of St Petersburg in s.  Miller has already been sanctioned by the US. Nikolai Tokarev Nikolai Tokarev is president of the Russia state-owned pipeline company Transneft. He served alongside Putin in the KGB in Dresden, East Germany, in the s.

But unions blasted the announcement, saying the money had already been promised two years ago - and accused the PM of failing to give details of orders.Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter Speaking before visiting a Merseyside shipyard, Mr Johnson said: “Shipbuilding has been in our blood for centuries and I want to ensure it remains at the heart of British industry for generations to come. “The National Shipbuilding Strategy will transform this important and crucial industry, creating jobs, driving technology development and upskilling the shipbuilders of tomorrow, ensuring we are levelling-up across every dock, port and shipyard in the UK.  “This will ensure the UK is rightly seen as a shipbuilding power across the world .” Unions fear the three-decade blueprint, which will be published today, will be light on detail about the types of ships pledged and who will fund them. The £bn will not fund  ships. Each of the Navy’s six Type , Daring-class destroyers cost £bn, and the two Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers cost £.bn each. The NSS “will outline how the Government will support UK shipyards across the nation to upskill workers, create high-quality jobs, drive technology development and ensure UK shipbuilding delivers on next-generation challenges”, No said.  Britain’s shipbuilding industry currently supports , jobs-, including in the supply chain, and injects £.bn into the economy each year.Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, who is also the Government’s “shipbuilding tsar” said: “With signicant government investment, we will be levelling-up across our shipbuilding, workforce, from shipyard to supplier, from procurement to designer, creating tens of thousands of new employment opportunities, boosting living standards and pay.“Our refreshed strategy will see the sector galvanised at a crucial time for our economy and see a vital part of British industry expand and flourish.”  Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions general secretary Ian Waddell crticised the announcement. He said: “This money was first announced two years ago. “Far from being refreshed this strategy looks like it has ignored the view of its author Sir John Parker who recommended ‘that UK-only competition should be considered for future defence-funded vessels’.  “If the Government was serious about levelling-up, it would get on with the job of building the Future Solid Support ship programme which will pump £.bn into regional economies, throw a le belt to local businesses and maintain the skills base built up to deliver two world-class aircraft carriers.” Prospect union’s senior deputy general secretary Sue Ferns said: “The UK’s shipyards must provide high-skill, good-wage jobs right around the UK so they can play their part in levelling-up. “Our yards are showing that they can deliver - as this updated strategy recognises.  “While the strategy is a helpful stepping stone, what we need now is more firm orders so that industry can commit to a pipeline of work that lasts for the next decade or more, building up skills and experience rather than working on stop-start projects.” The GMB accused ministers of “again sowing uncertainty with their disastrous policy refusing to guarantee work for UK yards”. General secretary Gary Smith said: The Governmentaposs scheme of sending potentially every order overseas is killing investment. “No other shipbuilding nation would dream of procuring its own vessels in this way.  These jobs are essential to our national security. “The world is becoming less stable and we need a clear industrial strategy for the defence sector that secures our capabilities at home. Shadow Defence Minister Chris Evans said: ““Ministers are failing to ensure ships are built in the UK and to secure local jobs. “One in five ships have disappeared from our surface fleet since  and, while a  year pipeline for industry is welcome, this strategy does not address the MoD’s deep-seated issues which mean none of its major shipbuilding programmes are on time or on budget.  “With growing threats and Russian aggression, our steel industry and shipyards are essential to national security.“ Labour is committed to a ‘British built by default’ approach to defence procurement which would build resilience in our supply chains and protect our security.”But trade body Maritime UK said the strategy meant “shipbuilding communities can power the future prosperity of our island nation, as green engines for economic growth”. Chairwoman Sarah Kenny said: “Whether it’s levelling-up by creating skilled jobs across our coastal communities, delivering net-zero by steering our ships in a green direction and exporting these technologies across the world, or promoting Global Britain, with % of all our trade moved by sea, maritime is central to our country’s future success.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Gary SmithJohn ParkerIan WaddellChris EvansBen WallaceMinistry of DefenceGMB unionLabour PartyRoyal NavyArmed forcesBritish economyThe economyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

You had to pinch yourself to realise that until very recently our Prime Minister spent every appearance here refusing to admithe’d held parties in his own flat. Yet here was the leader of a major European country being brutally honest about the devastating shelling of flats by an invading army in cities three hours away from the UK on a budget flight.As Volodymyr Zelensky outlined the crimes being unleashed by a “gangster state” the assembled MPs, wearing headphones and grim expressions on the packed benches, gave the big, hushed room the feel of a war crimes court. Hopefully a modern-day Nuremberg awaits Zelensky’s nemesis, Putin. The Ukrainian leader pointed out he was addressing everyone in the UK, as a fellow citizen of the world. And dressed in his trademark green tee-shirt he looked the part. As he gave us a breakdown of the horrors happening in his homeland, with eyes heavy and face drawn, it could have been someone you’d just met talking you through a personal tragedy. If anything encapsulates the Spirit of Ukraine it is this man. If anything says Putin won’t win it is Zelensky’s defiant demeanour. His presence in our parliament, like his message, was simple. It said: “I’m not hiding, I’m not afraid. We will endure.” Other world leaders have addressed Westminster before such as Barack Obama and Angela Merkel. But whereas they felt like they were taking part in some mutual admiration ceremony, this felt real. It felt urgent.  Whenever we turn our TVs on we see voiceless children and pensioners scrambling for their lives, and here was their voice. Here was their living symbol of resistance. Here was a man telling us, from the heart, why we cannot further abandon those innocent civilians who do not deserve their plight. Yet who do deserve our protection. It made you ashamed of the listening government’s pathetic response to the refugee crisis, with the pitul amount of visas they’ve handed out and the bureaucratic hoops they are making desperate people jump through to get them. Zelensky is what we hope we would all be when put under the most intolerable of pressure. Cool and courageous. This former actor is suddenly making speeches on the hoof that the finest dramatists would be proud of. For his British audience he evoked Shakespeare, saying there was no question of whether Ukraine’s fate was “to be or not to be.” It was to be. He pushed the British patriotic buttons even harder when he summoned the spirit of Winston Churchill, vowing to fight the Russian enemy in the fields and in the forests. Johnson gave a knowing smile of recognition when he heard that. Priti Patel sat there smirking by his side throughout, as she does. And when Zelensky talked about dramatically increasing sanctions, Rishi Sunak’s eyebrows twitched as he did the sums.  To hear him speak is to realise how badly Putin underestimated the will of Ukrainians. It’s the sense of calm he projects that has kept his nation going in the face of horrendous oppression. At the end of his -minute speech, during a long standing ovation, some MPs wiped away tears. It was a moving performance which humbled all who watched and gave us hope. Because the longer Zelensky survives and the more he draws standing ovations from parliaments and wet cheeks from millions watching on TV, the more he becomes Putin’s worst nightmare.

Covid cases started to increase from the end of FebruaryThe number of Covid- cases is rising again Image: Adam Gerrard   Daily MirrorByMartin BagotHealth and Science editor:,  Mar |commentsCovid- cases are surging in the over s as official data shows hospitalisations and deaths increasing again.The UK Health Security Agency warned the coronavirus pandemic is not over and case rates are still very high. Imperial College London’s REACT study reveals upturn infections since Boris Johnson ’s ‘Freedom Day’ on February , which included the removal of the legal requirement to self isolate.The , random swab test collected in England between February  and March  suggests one in every  people now have the virus. Covid cases were falling until the final days of February since when they started to increase.  Professor Paul Elliott, director of Imperial’s React programme, said: “We are seeing an uptick in infections, particularly in the older group, and we are seeing an uptick in hospitalisations. “At the moment, we’re possibly seeing the beginning of an uptick, but we don’t know where it’s going to go.” Prevalence in England was .%, down on the .% reported in the last round covering January -, but the second highest recorded rate since the study began in .New cases are being driven by the BA. sub-lineage of Omicron, dubbed ‘Stealth Omicron’ because it cannot be detected by routine PCR tests. Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency , said: “These data confirm that cases have declined substantially following the peak of the Omicron wave. “However, the increasing presence of BA. and the recent slight increase in infections in those over  show that the pandemic is not over and that we can expect to see Covid circulating at high levels.“Vaccination remains the best way to protect us all from severe disease and hospitalisation due to Covid- infection.“We urge you to come forward for your primary or booster doses straight awayyou have not already done so.” There were , new positive tests logged across the UK over the last  hours, according to Government dashboard data, % more than last Wednesday’s figure of ,. Deaths within  days of a confirmed coronavirus test also increased to , up % on the  recorded last week. It comes as hospital admissions in England are up by a fth in the last week, with a weekly total back above ,. Covid admissions in the South West are higher than the January peak. England scrapped all its remaining emergency Covid laws in February with routine contact tracing axed along with £ self-isolation payments. Dr Simon Clarke, cellular microbiologist at Reading University, said: “There’s something of an inevitability to increasing infection numbers. “Control measures were put in place to reduce transmission of the coronavirus, so removing them, by definition, creates an environment where transmission can occur more easily.  “If you create or allow conditions for the virus to spread, that is what it will do. It cannot simply be wished away. “Whether the UK sees the number of hospitalisations like we have seen previously and whether admissions result in a higher proportion of patients going to ICU remains to be seen “This latest increase in infections could be because people are mixing more or because of a drop in population-wide immunity. Most likely it’s a bit of both.” Asked whether the increasing numbers of BA. could lead to a surge in new cases, Prof Elliott added: “It is more transmissible.” The REACT data has been published as a pre-print.

Hannah Harris, , sent the text message to the boyaposs mother after she developed a relationship with him at a school.St Albans Crown Court heard how Harris tricked them by claiming to be a woman called Olivia, who said the lad and his girlfriend aposKaylaapos were being looked after. Hours later, they had sex in the car park. One text Harris wrote read: Seems Kayla and … are getting on well, so I am happy to ferry them around.  Harris, who was  at the time, has been jailed for six years after being found guilty of sexual activity with a child. The woman, from Henlow, Bedfordshire, denied the four charges in December  and January . She was found not guilty on three of the four charges.She also exchanged social media messages with the boy, at one point driving him to buy his favourite sweets. The paedophile also allowed the teenager to smoke cannabis in her car.  The teaching assistant was only brought to justice when the boy’s older brother found out and told his mother. Prosecutor Simon Wilshire told the court: “Both parents believed they had spoken to Olivia on the phone and his mum had exchanged texts. “The names Kayla and Olivia were fictions to hide the fact they were meeting up. “The parents were in fact talking to Ms Harris as that was the number they had been given for Olivia.” He added: “When the parents became aware, they realised they had unwittingly facilitated the contact. They had been duped by the boy into the belief he was seeing someone of his own age.”  He went on: “As a teaching assistant at his school shewould have known his age - such activity is a criminal offence regardless of whether he believed himself to be a willing party.” Judge Caroline Wigin sentenced her on Wednesday, saying the womanaposs behaviour was an abuse of trust, constituted grooming and involved signicant planning. She said: Your conduct has had a devastating effect upon the le of that young man. I find that you disregarded all the warnings that you had. Before the sentencing, Julia Flanagan, defending, argued that the messages and trips had not been geared specically towards a sexual relationship. But Judge Wigin cut in, saying sharply: It is utterly inappropriate to form any relationship of any kind. She chose to disregard that. She chose to abuse this trust. The defence barrister added: She bitterly regrets that she became involved withand she wanted me to tell the court that she did not intend to cause him any harm.

Victoria Cook, , welcomed her son Jack five months ago with him weighing a whopping lbs oz. Despite only having gas and air to get her through, Victoria says she felt very little pain - and really enjoyed the experience.She was in labour for hours in the birthing centre near her home in London last September but it appears she loved every moment of it. The nurses told her how peaceful the process was - despite little Jack being one of the biggest babies of his age in the country when he was born.  Victoria said: I know it sounds ridiculous but it almost didnapost hurt, it was quite a quick delivery. His shoulder got a bit stuck on the way out, which was painful, but on the whole, it was a really positive experience.We opted for a birthing centre instead of a labour ward in the hospital and we were lucky enough to have another water birth. It sounds a bit hippie, but we had nature sounds playing in the background during labour as well, so that was really nice.  Every time we had a nurse come in or anything they would say aposwow itaposs so peaceful in hereapos! Victoria says she would highly recommend a birthing centre to any soon-to-be-mums. She said: Itaposs midwe run, so itaposs less medical than going to a hospital and much more natural. The water birth was so great as well, itaposs such a relief during labour to get into the warm water, it takes the strain off your back as well. We had a lovely corner room as well, so there was lots of sunlight flooding in. Giving birth can be really daunting, and I think we donapost talk about a lot of the details of it enough.  So many people have horror stories, and a traumatic birth experience, so I want people to know itaposs possible to give birth to a lb baby and walk away from it! Victoriaaposs experience was so positive, she even ended up face-timing her mum during labour. She said: I donapost really know what I was thinking, looking back, but at the time it seemed like a great idea. I was doing little video tours of the room and I spoke to my brotheraposs we, Liana, because she was only ten weeks behind me. So I just showed her what was going on. Victoria revealed that she also had a huge bump with Jack and looked nine months pregnant at the seven-month mark. Victoria said: It was just huge. People say with your second you do look bigger, but lots of people were asking meI was having twins.I suppose I was carrying the equivalent of that, roughly. It got to the point where even walking became quite hard.Trying to look after a one-year-old in that state is really dficult. Today, Jack wears the same size nappies as his one-year-old sister Emilie and is powering through her hand-me-downs. Victoria said: When Jack was born he was one of the biggest of his age in the country, he was in the th centile for weight. Because Jack was my second, I was a bit more prepared going to the birthing centre. I had some - month clothes for him to wear because he wouldnapost fit into newborn stuff. One issue we had though, was with nappies because none of the newborn sized ones at the centre fit him.

The Money Saving Expert founder warned about forthcoming price rises which will impact Brits in the coming months.Martin revealed that the price of stamps and prescriptions will rise from April , the Manchester Evening News reports.First class stamps are going up by p to p, and nd class stamps will now cost p, up by p. Consumer expert Martin issued a useful tip to adults in the UK to help them save money ahead of Christmas. The key rule here is to stock up now on these class stamps i.e those that say first or second. In the past when prices went up Iaposd always say you could use them indefinitely but you can only use these until January , , Martin said.  So buy [these] Christmasapos stamps nowyou can do so. Ordinary stamps are set to be replaced by bar coded stamps from February . Martin also advised that you could still buy the existing stamps now, and then swap them in for the new ones via a free scheme that is going to come later in the year. Butyou are going to use stamps in the future, you may as well buy them in now whilst they are cheap, he added. His advice comes as family finances face being stretched as Ofgemaposs price cap will rise for  million homeowners, with the average household bill increasing by around £ per year.Earlier this week Martin issued a new video with three things everyone must do before prices rise on April . This included checkingyou can stockpile energy now to beat the price hike, taking a meter reading nowyou pay by direct debit and checking how you can claim a £ council tax rebate from April. Keep an eye out for a letter from the council because each council will tell you its claim system and you need to watch for that,” said Martin. If youaposre not eligible for the £, say, because youaposre in a higher band, then there is a discretionary £ million fund being set-up to help those who are struggling. “It will be up to each council to decide how it distributes it, but be ready to claim that.

Yesterday, Camilla welcomed three female rowers, who crossed the Atlantic in record time, to Clarence House - the London home she shares with Charles - to mark International Womenaposs Day. They were joined by former male rower Tim Christian and were pictured chatting with Camilla in a sitting room at the royal residence. Behind where the guests were sitting, royal fans noticed a side table that was filled with lovely family photos.And one of them included a stunning black-and-white image of Meghan with Charles on her wedding day in .  When Meghan married Harry, Charles escorted the bride halfway down the aisle of St Georgeaposs Chapel in Windsor - and the framed photo appears to depict this.Other framed pictures on the side table appear to be one of Prince Harry at the Invictus Games, an adorable photo of Charles holding Prince George at his christening in  and a family shot taken at Prince Louisapos christening in . Earlier this week a new book claimed Meghan showed she was confident and independent and certainly not a blushing bride on her wedding day.

With her father unable to attend the wedding, Charles offered to walk her down the aisle of St George’s Chapel.Her reply was not quite what he expected: Can we meet halfway , she asked, according to a new biography of The Queen by Robert Hardman, serialised in the Daily Mail. The response was an indicator that this was no blushing bride, but a confident, independent woman determined to make a grand entrance on her own, the author notes.  Meghan has yet toto the UK since she and Harry quit as senior royals in early , and son Archie has also not been back for a visit. Meanwhile, Harry and Meghanaposs baby daughter Lilibet has never been to the UK or met her grandfather Charles or great-grandmother the Queen.Earlier this year, Charles is said to have offered an olive branch to his son by inviting him and his family to stay with him on their next trip over from America.He has expressed his firm wish to spend quality time with his grandchildren in an attempt to heal the rt between him and his son. Royal sources confirmed the Prince of Wales has held several “good-natured and enjoyable” video calls with his son, Meghan and the children during the past few months. One source said: “The Prince of Wales has been saddened that he hasn’t had the opportunity to spend time with his grandchildren, which he really does miss. “He is a fantastic grandfather and loves playing the role immensely and it’s certainly fair to say he feels there is something missing from his le without the ability to get to know Harry’s children.

Mr Pittaposs partner had been tied up naked and threw herself ft from a window to escape him when he attacked her out of the blue at their home in Northumberland, trying to gouge her eyes out and threatening to cut her throat with scissors.  In July , Mr Pitt was given a minimum four-and-a half year imprisonment for public protectionsentence for  imprisonment. He was moved to HMP Humber in . An independent investigation by the Prisons and Probations Ombudsman has found that Mr Pitt caught the disease in the prison during a apossignicant outbreakapos in February and March . The ombudsman said she was concerned that when Mr Pitt tested positive for Covid-, healthcare staff did not take his clinical observations and he was not monitored to seehe became symptomatic. Mr Pitt was obese, which meant that he was at a higher risk of developing complications, and should have been closely monitored and his observations taken regularly, the report says. Mr Pitt complained about being unwell on March  but was told by a nurse to sit down to improve his breathing. The nurse then said they wouldto check on him later.

The nurse did notfor over an hour, by which time Mr Pitt had got into bed because he felt so unwell, and then an ambulance was called”.

A spokesperson for the venue said this could not come at a worse time, as the business is still recovering from the Covid lockdown.He told Nottinghamshire Live: It is just ridiculous. One of them distracted the member of staff by standing at the bar out of sight of the door. He was ordering another drink while the ladies in the group marched their children out, one under each arm, and bundled them into a couple of cars. Then they waited until the last guy exited and shot off. He went on and said: We started the business in , just before Covid hit, and so obviously it is a dficult time. The price of everything is going up massively. We have got wholesale beer increases of nearly p a pint this year to deal with. We are going to try to soak that all up, and we will try and fight all of that and then people are going to do that. It is not very helpful.  He said that while the incident hit the venue from a business perspective, it is the well-being of members of the staff that he is more concerned about. He added: The member of the staff that was on rang the manager and said he was upset and quite exasperated. He had been intimidated by their passive-aggressive behaviour - and he has blamed himself. It is awful because he was doing really well and was training to be in a managerial position. Now he has lost all of his confidence. It is not that it just hurts my pocket, the real problem is that the staff there are nervous now and do not feel comfortable.  The pub owner said that he has worked in the industry for about a decade - but that he has never witnessed anything like it. He added: The children were running around the restaurant, running up to peopleaposs tables, falling over things. And then they have left bowls of food upturned on the floor - I have never seen anything like it in ten years in the industry. It was just like a pack of bears had been in.Inspector Hayley Crawford, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “We are pursuing lines of enquiry following a report that a group of people had attended The White Horse Inn in Barnby Moor, eaten a meal and left without paying.“Officers are making enquiries after the incident was reported to us at around pm yesterday. “To help us with our investigation we are urging anyone with information to please get in touch with us.” It is believed those involved left the area in a white van and a black car. Anyone who has any information is urged to call Nottinghamshire Police on , quoting incident  of  March , or Crimestoppers anonymously on   .” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Nottinghamshire PoliceFoodPubs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Serve the food you really want to eat by signing up for our tips and recipes and never be bored by your cooking againSign UpInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It comes just weeks after she failed to mark the birthday of one of her other sons - Prince Andrew when he turned another year older.Today, the Royal Family Twitter page posted a picture of a smiling Edward along with the caption: Wishing The Earl of Wessex a very Happy Birthday!. It was accompanied by a birthday day cake emoji.Unlike his older brother Andrew, Edward along with his we Sophie Wessex are working members of the Royal Family and carry out engagements on behalf of the Queen.Meanwhile, Andrew quit public le in  following his disastrous interview on BBC Newsnight, where he talked about his association with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.And last month, he reached an out of court settlement with his accuser Virginia Giuffre in a civil sex claim filed in the US.When he also turned  last month, there were no posts on social media to mark his birthday.

He explained: “The language used in this [settlement] statement is that Prince Andrew will be helping sex trafficking victims. Is this him positioning himself to try and reinvent himself in the eyes of the public  Speaking to friends of his this week - they say he still feels he has a lot to offer public le again. I still believe that he is the only person on the planet that believes that [apart from] possibly Fergie and possibly the Queen.” But despite this, Russell said it was impossible to see how he could have a public role in the future.

She rarely talks about her inner most thoughts and feelings, but sometimes instead uses her clothes, jewellery or even her surroundings to send what some believe are secret messages.Just this week while meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at Windsor Castle, and royal watchers were quick to point out the beautul blue and yellow flowers in the background.Of course yellow and blue are the colours of the Ukrainian flag and it was seen as a tribute to the people of the country amid the Russian invasion. So what other secret messages has she seemingly sent in recent years  Here we take a look... Ukraine flowers  The most recent subtle message was of course the the blue and yellow flowers on display at Windsor Castle during an audience with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.Mr Trudeau was in London earlier this week for talks on the war in Ukraine with Boris Johnson and Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte.Sources said that the small gesture of the flowers was a deliberate sign of the Queenaposs solidarity with the people of Ukraine.Later, at a press conference with Mr Johnson and Mr Rutte, Mr Trudeau confirmed he talked to Her Majesty about Ukraine. He explained: I can tell you in my conversation with her this morning she was as insightful and perspicacious as ever, very interested in whataposs going on.

In , the Queen attended the State Opening of Parliament wearing a vibrant blue hat that featured yellow flowers.At that time the debate surrounding the aftermath of the Brexit vote was raging in the UK and in her speech, which is written by the government, she outlined how the country was preparing to exit the EU. However, many people on social media couldnapost help but notice that her hat very much resembled that of the European Union flag.In , in her book The Other Side of the Coin: The Queen, the Dresser and the Wardrobe, the Queen dresser Angela Kelly insisted it never occurred to her the hat resembled the flag. Anniversary brooch During last yearaposs deeply personal Christmas message, the Queen paid an extraordinary tribute to her late beloved husband Prince Philip. Pinned to her dress was a stunning sapphire chrysanthemum brooch that royal fans pointed out she wore on many happy times with the Duke of Edinburgh - believing it was a tribute to him. Among the times she wore the brooch was on her honeymoon in  and to mark her rd wedding anniversary in . Red boxes Just last month, an image of a beaming Queen was released to mark Her Majestyaposs Platinum Jubilee year. It shows her at Sandringham going through papers from her red box, which she is sent everyday from the Government. And according to former royal butler Grant Harrold, it was signicant the boxes were included in the snap. He said on Tik Tok: People keep asking me do I think the Queen is going to continue with her work  Well in this photograph you see one of her official government boxes and of course this is the Queen doing her day to day work. I think this shows all of us that even though sheaposs now coming into her th year, sheaposs been on the throne  years, she is very much going to continue being a monarch. Lockdown message brooch  One of the most important address the Queen has given to the country in the past two years came in April .In it, she spoke of the unprecedented nature of the Covid pandemic being fought around the globe and promised we will meet again despite lockdown.For the speech, the Queen wore a beautul turquoise and diamond brooch that once belonged to her grandmother Queen Mary. It was later pointed out that stone is said to be one that promotes healing and love as well as enhances the powers of leadership. Cop outfit Last November, a bout of ill health meant the Queen had to pull out of attending the Cop climate change summit in Glasgow.However, she recorded a rousing video message where she urged world leaders to help protect the planet.For the speech, she wore a green dress, which is of course the colour of being environmentally friendly. She paired it with a rare a diamond and ruby butterfly which was gted to her upon her engagement to Prince Philip. And many believed it was her subtle way of paying tribute to her late husband, who had been heavily involved in environmental matters.

The driver had dropped off a customer in Marsden, a village near Huddersfield in Yorkshire, and was heavily relying on his navigation system upon turning around. When he ordered his sat nav to take him back in the direction of the A, the machine directed its driver through darkness and down a steep path across the Saddleworth Moor. The path was narrow and littered with sharp rocks, but the persistent driver carried on until his car, a Mercedes Vito, ground to a halt.He reportedly tried in vain to reverse, but eventually gave up and called friends for a lt home. He made sure he walked to an accessible road, first. Bemused locals surveying the scene the next day presumed the vehicle had been stolen then dumped by joyriders. That was until the embarrassed Uber driver then ed and revealed the truth about what had happened.  Local Craig Hannah said it was “amazing” that the driver managed to get that far along the “rough and very steep” track. “Apparently he had been working in the area late on Saturday night and was trying toto base,” she said. “A passenger did say he could drive down the lane even though there was a sign warning that it was unsuitable for vehicles. “If you were local you would know the road is not passable but this guy was clearly out of town and didn’t know.” Craig had heard the driver had become so stuck that he had not been able to get his door open. The back bumper of the driver’s car had been ripped off, he said, with the only way to retrieve it, likely being dragging it back up the hill. Craig said the driver seemed a “really nice guy” who had been left shell shocked by the experience. A less sympathetic local said: ‘We heard the taxi driver was just blindly following his satnav and got stuck. ‘Some people just don’t learn from the old adage – the computer is not always right.’ The Uber driver is reportedly awaiting repair costs, after the vehicle was rescued by a tow truck on Monday.

Free testing will also be available for social care workers and NHS staff with symptoms.The government may scrap all Covid travel restrictions within days under new plans being discussed by ministers.  While the passenger locator form has been simplied, it remains a requirement for people heading back to the UK from holidays and could be removed completely. Travelling has become more straight forward in recent months for people who have been vaccinated and they no longer need to take Covid tests before departure and then on theirto the UK. And also under discussion for ministers will be the possible removal of the testing requirements for the unvaccinated.  The removal of the passenger locator form could be a boost for the tourism industry ahead of the Easter holidays which is reportedly the aim of Transport Secretary Grant Shapps.The forms were introduced two years ago as a means of tracking infections and went into signicant detail at a time when travellers had to quarantine on theirto the UK. Currently the form is a lot more simple and requires people’s address, contact number and flight details.

Instead schoolchildren should be given vegan meals at lunch which doctors say will tackle obesity and help the environment. Bacon and sausages could be swapped with lentil bolognese and chickpea curry while cows milk could be replaced with a vegan alternative, one expert suggests.Dr Shireen Kassam, leading the campaign, told The Sun it is vital that families start making better food choices and see the plus sides of the diet. The founder of Plant Based Health Professionals also warned that eating meat and dairy could have a detrimental effect on youngstersapos health. Reports suggest that one in four primary school aged children have obesity while one in three do not eat even one portion of vegetables per day.  Dr Kassam said: Swapping current school meal plans for plant-based meals makes fruit and vegetables more accessible, but also ensures that children are eating nutritious foods daily, optimising their health and minimising health-related issues.Meat and dairy have proven to be detrimental to children’s health, including increasing cholesterol and blood pressure, increased risk of heart disease and is linked to the cause of some cancers. Obesity in children and young people is a severely concerning health problem, and one we could so easily tackle through plant-based nutrition and education. Dr Kassam told of the importance of a whole-food plant-based diet where children would be free from low saturated fat and benefit from vitamins and minerals, fibre and antioxidants. If the UKaposs . million schoolchildren swapped one meat meal for a plant-based alternative, greenhouse gas emissions would drop by . tonnes which is the equivalent of taking , cars off the road each year.Dr Kassam, a consultant haematologist at Londonaposs King’s College Hospital, said that the NHS could also benefit and save around £ billionBrits ditched meat and dairy.Some schools have already taken the decision to drop meat from the canteen menu. Our Lady of Sion in Worthing, East Sussex, and Barrowford Primary School, near Nelson, Lancashire, are already meat-free.  But some parents have criticised the move and said the dramatic change is absolutely ridiculous. Questions have been raised over the right to have freedom of choice and why schools had to dictate their childrenaposs diets. But Dr Kassam said: Schools need to lead on ways to tackle both health and climate issues and educating around. Introducing plant-based nutrition is key to doing this.

Clubbers now have the chance to buy a souvenir section of the sticky rug with prices ranging from £ for an A sized piece to £ for a larger, framed piece.Owner Simon Jackson was inspired after hearing a young clubber celebrating his th birthday tell how his parents met at the club and his grandmother had worked there. Now, having been on sale for just a day, it has sold more than  pieces already and raised £, for the local Street Angels charity, which helps homeless people.  Owner Simon Jackson said: It started as a bit of a joke, I had a conversation with a lad celebrating his th and he said his grandmother used to work there and his mother met his father there. There were three generations of the same family celebrating. The mother said aposI remember the carpet, it is the same one apos and I said it probably is.I told her changing the carpet has been on the list of things to do for a few years but things kept getting in the way. They said aposwe should take a piece of it as itaposs part of their family history and a few other people said theyaposd take a piece. We got to thinking how many people have met here and had first kisses, birthdays whatever here. The joke quickly snowballed and Simon - who worked as a DJ in the early s before buying the club in  - decided to cut some pieces and sell them to punters. He added: We knew Street Angels were struggling for money so we thought weaposd try to get some money for them as they donapost get any funding. Sales went live at .pm on Wednesday and by .pm weaposd sold over  pieces. By pm that night weaposd raised over £, for the charity so hopefully we can get a few thousand for them. If weaposd got a couple of hundred quid weaposd have been happy. Itaposs just blown up, we couldnapost cope with the demand. Weaposve had to dig it out of the skip and clean it up to sell the rest of it. The club has been a staple of nightle in the former mill town since  and generations have walked on its infamous carpet for more than  years. Simon added: Itaposs famous for three things being really old, selling drinks for p and the carpet. It doesnapost even look that bad, itaposs just going thin in places. The club has created a grid-like map for anyone interested in buying a piece of the carpet - so they can identy the specic spot they would like.

It has been a bitterly cold start to March for many parts of the UK with temperatures hovering around the low single figures but there will now be a brief respite from the wintry conditions - although it may be too soon to say spring has arrived. With temperatures set to peak at C or even C, it will be warmer than Athens which is predicted to be C on Thursday or Monaco where it will be C.After several cold nights, the weather has become increasingly unsettled this week as a low pressure front threatens from the Atlantic and is competing with high pressure over the continent. It looks like the low pressure will be held off bringing mild temperatures but at the same time wind and rain will not be far away. The will also be a east-west ide, with the higher temperatures on the east coast. Met Office spokesman Richard Miles told The Sun : The west will be wet and windy which will gradually spread across the country overnight, and then it will be cooler in the west and wetter in the east. Thataposs the picture for the next few days. It will be wet and windy over the weekend too but when the sun comes out in central and eastern areas, we will see temperatures creeping up to quite pleasant numbers. BBC weather forecaster Stav Danaos said that there will be sunshine especially across the east of England.Cold, frosty start for Northern Ireland but bright with some sunshine, he said.  Some sunshine getting into western Scotland and it will also be bright across eastern England and the South East where again we will see temperatures very mild for the time of year, C or C, but even double figures further north and west, it will be a little bit breezier as well. As we head through Thursday night it turns cloudier, outbreaks of rain pushing up from central and southern areas and it will spread northwards, across northern England and towards Scotland so more cloud around and more breeze so it will be a milder night for most of us, and a milder night certainly for Northern Ireland.  Mr Danaos said it will then be a blustery day on Friday with wind in the north and a maximum temperature around C. He continued: On Friday we see a more active weather front start to sweep in from the Atlantic, that will bring more windy weather but also some heavier rain which will start to push in through south west England, Wales and Northern Ireland as the day wears on.” UK forecast for the next  days Unsettled over the next few days. Today: Patchy light rain across parts of Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and western England will slowly clear northeastwards to allow brighter skies. Very mild across eastern and southeast England where some sunny spells are possible. Patchy rain reaches southern England later. Tonight: Cloud and patchy light rain moving northwards across some parts, though also some dry spells. Breezy and mild. Heavy rain reaching the far southwest later. Friday: Patchy rain clearing northern and eastern parts to leave a brighter spell. Rain in the southwest, heavy at times, moving northeastwards across most parts. Windy, with coastal gales. Outlook for Saturday to Monday: An unsettled weekend with showers or longer spells of rain, wettest in the west. Windy for a time with coastal gales in the west. Drier for most on Monday.

Ellie Marie Whitby, from Liverpool, came up with the “funny idea” for her YouTube Channel. London Fashion Week takes place in the capital twice a year, showcasing hundreds of designers to a global audience. Ellie, who previously managed to persuade her mum to dress up as Bigfoot stalking the woodlands of West Kirby, said she looked forward to the challenge. She managed to get into an event after calling multiple buildings in London and hoping one designer would reveal their secret location.She told the ECHO: “I just try to make comedy and funny challenges for my content. Something light-hearted to make people smile and I thought this would be a funny idea.“At first it looked pretty terrible, I stuck my head through a hole and it was awful. I haven’t got any arts and craft skills but eventually, I managed to make it look half decent.” Ellie even found an old banana peel on the floor to add to the “trash look”. She said: “Originally, London Fashion Week is held in one big event building but for security reasons, every single catwalk had been moved to a secret location.“I spent the entire day with my friend in a coffee shop calling every event building in London. A lot of designers wouldn’t give us the address because we weren’t on the list but one slipped up. “We turned up and my friend pretended to be a paparazzi taking pictures of me.” Ellie claims she “joined the queue” and followed the lead of the girl in front of her.The YouTuber added: “They were already running behind schedule. It was such a surreal experience, to be ushered in and sat there in a bin bag. “A woman ended up coming over to me and asking uswe wanted to sit with her on the front row seats. “I was definitely getting some judgemental looks but I felt a bit like a celebrity. It felt weird to be getting papped at a prestigious event. “People loved the video. My fans said it’s a favourite because it’s so homemade and I managed to get in. “I’ve always loved creating videos and messing around with friends and it’s just grown. “But I just did this one on a whim, I’ve never had an interest in attending London Fashion Week before but now I have.”The full video can be found on Ellieaposs YouTube channel.

Families were traumatised after the aggressive monkey mauled the bird to death in front of young children. The creature apostransformed into King Kongapos and scaled a ft-tall structure at Chester Zoo. It snatched a passing bird out of the air and hammered it against its perch before eating the gull during a deadly five-minute battering.Bec Adamson was enjoying a aposlovely day outapos at the Chester Zoo with her son when he saw the monkey at the top of the pole, the Manchester Evening News reports.The -year-old began filming and captured the fearsome animal holding its prey by the head and repeatedly slamming it against the side of his enclosure.The monkey then even appears to aposlick blood off its fingersapos as the outstretched bird becomes limp. Startled Bec, who was also with former partner Jamie Stockall, , says the zoo animal then dropped the seagull, so it quickly climbed down to grab the aposinsidesapos from the carcass and take it away to eat. Despite the aposviolentapos ordeal, the mum-of-one claims son Dominik Minshull, five, was fascinated as it felt like the David Attenborough nature clips he loves so much. The hospitality worker posted her startling video to TikTok on Sunda and itaposs since been viewed more than two million times. Bec, from Northwich, Cheshire, said: It was like watching the real King Kong. He was really slamming it against the pole and pulling at its feathers. It was just really aggressive and mad  Weaposd just been to see the rhinos, so we were walking across, then I saw all these seagulls circling and then this monkey caught one as it was flying past. It was really clever. I told Jamie and Dominik looked too, so I started filming. When I zoomed in I could see he was battering the f**k out of this seagull. I couldnapost believe I was catching it on video. Her TikTok post, sarcastically captioned aposlovely family dayapos, has been liked , times and has attracted more than , comments. She added: Other people started watching too and suddenly there were about  people watching. It was really violent, but itaposs natural. Itaposs what happens in nature. Dominik askedDavid Attenborough was watching as well because we watch this sort of thing at home. He just thought it was amazing because he thought they were fighting. It could have scarred him for le. If I was his age, Iaposd have been terried. I think Iaposm raising a psychopath. Iaposve seen the comments on my video saying itaposs like the next King Kong movie. I noticed he was licking his fingers. He was really enjoying his meal. When the monkey dropped the seagull he slid down the pole so quickly, then it was pulling its insides out before he pulled it back into the cage. There were loads of seagulls flying over the top but he just picked that one. Poor thing. You canapost help but keep watching. Weaposre all like little psychopaths watching this seagull getting mauled, but we want to find out whataposs next.

Casey Shaw, from Belfast, Northern Ireland, spent most of his childhood taking verbal abuse from school bullies, and even faced vile comments from adults, who would call him ugly or give him nicknames such as twiglets and fox p***.Random strangers would have no reservations about declaring that I was ugly and how disgusting being ginger was. It was very confusing and very alienating, he recalled. I was very young and could not understand why I was being targeted by such a wide range of people. I would rush home to my room and cry by myself. I didnapost confide in my parents because I was too embarrassed and I really didnapost know how to handle my emotions.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. However, the -year-old has since gotten his sweet revenge, as his red hair has gotten him countless dates and compliments as he got older.Casey credits his older brother and celebs like Ed Sheeran and Prince Harry for helping him accept his locks - which have since allowed him to go onto achieving a successful modelling career.He said: About  years ago something happened – the vibe changed almost overnight. I donapost knowit was the popularity of Ron Weasley, the rise of Ed Sheeran or the coming of age of Prince Harry but all of a sudden, it seemed that gingers became a hot commodity.The abuse changed to compliments and my hair would be a conversation-starter instead of a finisher. In my mid to late s, I had a very active dating le and was very much spoiled for choice, especially when I moved to London. I have even hooked up with people because they said they had aposnever been with a ginger beforeapos. Many women in bars or pubs often ask ‘does the carpet match the drapes’ andI’m feeling in a particularly cheeky mood I will turn the awkwardness back on the questioner. Iaposve never taken offence [to women liking me for my hair] and have always been more than happy to oblige. It was about time being ginger paid off to be honest.However, the -year-old actually has a girlfriend and she too first fancied her beau thanks to his ginger locks. Casey said: My partner absolutely loves my ginger curls and credits them with attracting her attention in the first place. Standing out from the crowd definitely helped get me that coveted right swipe. My partner is sporting a big beautul black afro with ginger tips, complimenting my orange glow and giving us aposmain characterapos energy wherever we go. Casey comes from a family of gingers – all but his father – and is now proud of his unique appearance. He added: My mother is ginger and I have two siblings, both of whom are redheads. My brown-haired father would always mention how the household had such a aposfieryapos temper and atmosphere! My brother is seven years my senior and he helped me a lot when it came to how I dealt with what I now see as abuse. At the time it was just a normal everyday inevitability, especially in my town.Now, I love who I am. I enjoy my iniduality and embrace my uniqueness. My red hair makes me feel special, like being kissed by fire makes me one of the chosen people. Being ginger is a true blessing. Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

She said that the couple have had to contend with flea bites, a bodily fluid stained mattress and a foul stench among other complaints, reported CornwallLive. It is so bad they are sleeping on a mattress on the lounge floor. Sarah said: “It really is awful. The property is flea-ridden, the settee is broken in half, the toilet is disgusting, the bed is black with body fluid and the stench is foul. The bed is horrible and stained with urine and sweat.  She said that the conditions are having a bad impact on her partneraposs mental health. “My partner is disabled and suffers with his mental health really badly. This is just making it worse. He’s also severely epileptic and this is making his fits even worse, Sarah continued. “Nobody can seem to help and despite calling the council loads of times I’m just not getting anywhere. I’m struggling to breathe here. “It is so bad here my daughter came to stay but has since gone back with my mother in law as she just can’t stay here.”  Sarah says she ended up in temporary accommodation after the landlord of her privately rented property sold up. She then lived in sheltered accommodation in Bude before being moved to Tencreek. A member of staff at Tencreek did reportedly use a ‘flea bomb’ in one of the rooms, but Sarah says it hasn’t done anything to help. She added: “I don’t know how long we’re here for but so far nothing at all has been done to help and we can’t go on living like this.” Cornwall Council has been contacted for comment.

The expert has dedicated several years studying the old spy photographs of the Middle East. His work has even featured in documentary ‘The Le of Earth: The Age of Humans’ - and says the snaps from  years ago could hold some very important answers. Dr Casana feels the images are invaluable because the countryside in the Middle East was far less industrialised when they were taken.  He said: “We were able to document something like , previously unknown archaeological sites that, through the history of  years of archaeologists working in the Middle East, no one had ever documented.” Having started as a small settlement in the seventh millennium BC, Tell Brak evolved during the fourth millennium BC into one of the biggest cities in Upper Mesopotamia.That included parts of northwestern Iraq, northeastern Syria and southeastern Turkey. A small settlement first emerged at the site in circa  BC, with pottery found at the site dating back to then. Excavations and surface surveys have revealed that Tell Brak developed as an urban hub slightly before better known cities in southern Mesopotamia such as Uruk.  It grew to around  hectares by the late fth millennium BC, and had more than doubled in size to  hectares in the period spanning  BC to  BC. Tell Brak expanded again around  BC, when it became known as Nagar, and served as the capital of a regional kingdom. For a settlement like Tell Brak to appear as it did, the environment needed to have been transformed by some form of dramatic event. The last ice age ended around , years ago, causing the Earth’s climate to change radically. The planet was at its warmest point in , years. Where Tell Brak lies is an area of the Middle East known as the Fertile Crescent, the culmination of the ice age allowed this area to finally become fertile. Rainfall and temperatures increased, leading to a great expansion of grassland, and climate change fuelled a food revolution.Rainfall and temperatures increased, leading to a great expansion of grassland, and climate change fuelled a food revolution. For millennia, humans had foraged wild grass seeds, but now, wheat and barley proved easy to grow and to control. Ancient humans began to settle and to nurture and protect their crops. These people started to abandon their hunter-gatherer lestyle, instead opting to become farmers. Human reliance on cultivated plants and domesticated animals changed the landscape forever from this point. These settled populations expanded, overwhelming the remaining hunter-gatherers, and transformed the landscape with their fields, villages, towns and eventually cities. A ‘tell’, in Middle Eastern archaeology, is a raised mound marking the site of an ancient city. In ancient times, houses were built from mud, which would crumble easily when exposed to the elements. Earlier debris would be levelled off in the rebuilding process and new buildings would be erected on top, so most tells are typically shaped like a low truncated cone. At over  metres high, and  by  metres in area, Tell Brak — or Nagar as it was then — is one of the largest in the area. It is believed to have thrived under dferent peoples right up until circa  BC when it was destroyed by the Assyrians.

The ­desperate families squeezed in, standing, sitting, lying wherever they can, next to their precariously piled ­belongings, packed into the dank underground space they now call home. There’s an air of restlessness, a palpable sense of tension and anxiety. How could there not be And then, completely unexpectedly, something magical happens. Little Amelia – age unknown, but probably, what, seven or eight  – stands up on a chair. She’s wearing a sparkly jumper with stars on it, from HM a few years ago – my friend’s daughter has the same one and still loves it too. Hands clenched together shyly, unbrushed hair pulled back into a ponytail, Amelia plucks up all her courage, opens her mouth and starts to sing Let It Go, from Frozen. And like a spell cast in the movie her song comes from, the Kyiv shelter falls silent. Everyone turns and gives this small blonde scrap of a girl their mesmerised full attention. No one moves. Babies stop crying. This captive audience cannot take their eyes off her, as they listen to her sweet, steady voice, a chink of shining light in the unimaginable ­darkness of Ukraine.She has given these people the gt of focusing on something other than the living nightmare they’re enduring, albeit briefly, and there isn’t a dry eye in the room. Or from any of the millions around the globe who have since watched the video on social media.Despite probably never having heard Ukrainian before, the song is in the universal language of Disney, kids from any country in the world watching it could name that tune in three. In the caption, the woman who posted it explains that Amelia told her she wanted to be “a singer on a grand stage” – an ambition now fulfilled, just not in a way anyone would want. Their poor parents can, at least, try to fight back, but the children of Ukraine are utterly defenceless in this war. Putin is torturing and traumatising these pure, faultless human beings, turning them into orphans. Murdering  of them.  Amelia and the other kids in that shelter, and similar ones across the country. Danya and Mpak, the boys trapped in Calais, denied entry by our callous government because they don’t have the right paperwork. The -year-old who braved a -mile journey to safety alone. Heroic President Volodymyr Zelensky’ s own children – Aleksandra, , and Kiril, age nine – who have targets on their backs. Polina, the girl with the pink hair, and her brother Semyon, both dead. And the many other nameless young casualties.All entirely blameless, innocent children – just like their entirely blameless, innocent mums and dads – frightened for their lives.  Two weeks ago they were moaning about homework, playing with their friends, not eating their vegetables. Now, suddenly plunged into a reality where growing up without their fathers may well be the best case scenario. The least worst of their horrendous options. When Let It Go lyricist Kristen Anderson-Lopez saw Amelia’s rendition, she tweeted: “Dear Little Girl with the beautul voice, my husband and I wrote this song. The way you sing it is like a magic trick that spreads the light in your heart and heals everyone who hears it.” She finished by urging Amelia to “Keep singing!” If only that choice was hers.

The incredible image was released by Ourspace, part of the Chinese National Space Administration.The beautul panoramic shot shows the recent journey taken by the rover, known as Yutu , on the hidden hemisphere of the lunar surface. The lbs solar-powered rover landed atop of the Changapose  lander in January .Its powerful cameras recently detected a “mystery hut” - which transpired to be a rabbit-shaped rock- so went to investigate.When it looked back its tracks were clearly shown in the dust on the surface. A diary entry by the Yutu  team said: “On the moonlit night, the scientists expressed their desire to explore the cornucopia.  “ This task seems simple, and the image shows that the road is smooth. However, after the terrain products are actually generated, the drivers still scratch their heads. “An insurmountable obstacle area lights up the red light for this road, although the range is not large, but it cuts off the way of direct detection. “However, this is not dficult for the experienced Yutu drivers. “It started smoothly, turned perfectly, stopped in time, and the detection was successful. Soon Yutu completed the set detection task and ed safely. The pilots applauded each other and looked forward to the valuable scientic data brought back by the probe.”The Earth only sees one side of the Moon with all six of Nasa’s manned Apollo missions landing on the near side. The far side, sometimes wrongly called the dark side, remained a mystery until the Chinese rover successfully landed and started investigations. Yutu  and the Changapose  lander have both far exceeded their original letimes of around three months and one year respectively. Sara Russell, at the Natural History Museum in London, previously said: “The exploration of the far side is really in its infancy. “It’s like this whole new world to explore. We really have a lot to find out about the far side of the Moon. “It’s really exciting.”  It comes as it was announced Artemis , the first in NASAaposs new generation of Moon missions, has been delayed until May, possibly June. It was due to lt off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida in April but has been put back until the space agency has more data from a full rehearsal. Artemis  will take an uncrewed mission around the Moon and back before future missions land on the lunar surface.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden.Top three jobs in March:PICS:Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. no_aGardening_March"},{"url":null,"title":"council backs argyll events in covid recovery","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowCowal Highland Gathering is to receive a £, grant from Argyll and Bute Council as it prepares to take place in person for the first time in three years.The event, at Dunoon Stadium in August, had to take place virtually in  and  due to the Covid- pandemic.But preparations are being made for the  event to take place from August -, and it is the only event recommended to receive more than £, from round four of the council’s strategic events and festivalsfund.The Mull Rally has been recommended to receive £,, Mull of Kintyre Music and Arts Festival is earmarked for £, and the Tiree Wave Classic is in line for £,.Seven other events across Argyll and Bute are recommended to receive smaller grants.Councillors approved the recommended grant awards at the virtual meeting of the authority’s policy and resources committee on February .Eleven events across culture, sport and the arts will receive support totalling £, from round four of the council#s fund.The total budget available for   is more than £,.Councillors agreed to make remaining SEF funds, estimated to be £,, available to apply for.Receiving £, grant awards are Jura Music Festival, the Gathering of Cowal Clans and Helensburgh Winter Festival.The Highlands and Islands Music and Dance Festival will get £,, West Highland Yachting Week £, and Inveraray Highland Games £,.Tarbert Seafood Festival has also been recommended for £, despite being £ over the  per cent criteria.The report says it is felt this #does not prejudice the other applications# and the funding is available.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for economic growth said: #Events and festivals have played an important part in the economic health of Argyll and Bute in past years.

GHK broke the deadlock to score the first try of the game  minutes into the game, then missed the conversion.Mid Argyll then put together some great attacking plays and earned a penalty just outside the GHK -metre line.Inside centre Coll MacKay stepped up to score Mid Argyll#s first points of the campaign with a glorious conversion.  –  to GHK.GHK went on to score two more tries and one conversion # before disaster struck for Mid Argyll on the stroke of half time and with the score at  –  to GHK, as Wilson hobbled off with suspected knee ligament damage.With Wilson playing out of position in the front row, Mid Argyll had to reshuffle an already patchwork pack with Aaron McAllister moving from the wing to hooker and usual hooker Robbie Herd moving to prop.The new look front row finished off, Daniel Doherty doing well, as they held their own against an experienced opposition pack.Mid Argyll took time to settle into the new system, though, and GHK ran in two more converted tries.Mid Argyll almost produced the perfect reply when fly-half Logan Allen whipped a quick ball out to Gritten who, without actually catching the ball, flicked it on to Innes Patterson.Patterson beat two players and released Ed King-Venables who was caught by the GHK defence just short of the line.GHK ran the ball back up field but some great defensive play from flanker Gordon McLean, Self and MacArthur stopped them on the halfway line.A scrum to Mid Argyll saw scrum-half Calum Patterson pick the ball from the feet of McLean and, noticing a gap in the defence, broke through.He still had two more players to beat before he ran over the whitewash for Mid Argyll#s first try of the season # undoubtedly try of the match.

years and - years.The results showed that among the early morning group, very few students got adequate sleep.The larksoutperformed owlsin all school subjects and this effect, which increased as students progressed through the school, was most extreme in maths.This outcome, however, was not evident in those having afternoon schooling, and the situation almost reversed in those receiving evening schooling, where students with later chronotypes performed slightly better in languages than the early chronotypes in the same group.Clearly academic performance is influenced by biological iation in daily rhythms, to an extent that has previously been underestimated.The study authors, while conceding that it is impractical to attempt to fully align school timetables to inidual chronotypes, suggest that it may be possible to, for example, progressively delay school start times during adolescence.* Goldin et al.  https:doi.org . s---."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures may 28 2021 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 4 2 2 2 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWe stray off the beaten track for this week#s featured image.This photograph arrived in our inbox attached to a press release from VisitScotland about two new marketing campaigns focusing on Argyll and the Isles sustainable staycations.Explore Islay and Jura and Destination Helensburgh are two of  recipients to be supported by the £ million Destination and Sector Marketing Fund, administered by VisitScotland as part of the recovery programme on behalf of the Scottish Government.Travel blogger Kay Gillespie # aka The Chaotic Scot # took the image as a selfie while experiencing some of the activities that make Helensburgh and Lomond a great winter destination.

Don#t be the dog walker who doesn#t clean up.Tommy Macpherson, Scottish Conservative and Unionist candidate, South Kintyre ward.Households in Argyll and Bute have received £, from low income pandemic payments and £, from bridging payments that support families with children in receipt of free school meals.Across Scotland, these payments have amounted to the SNP Scottish Government delivering more than £ million to more than , low income households – including more than , school age children receiving bridging payments.The pandemic has been incredibly dficult for so many families for a iety of reasons – some have lost wages and jobs, others have seen an increase in heating bills as we all spent more time at home.I#m glad the SNP Scottish Government has been helping families in Argyll and Bute to get through this tough time with £,, of support, in addition to offering Scottish low income benefits and the Scottish Child Payment.We know that families in Argyll and Bute are going to continue to feel the pressure as we face a cost of living crisis, so it is reassuring to see the Scottish Government#s focus on helping those who need it most and their commitment to delivering bridging payments this year.Sadly, the contrast between the SNP Government in Holyrood and the Tories at Westminster could not be clearer.While the SNP get on with extending the Scottish Child Payment to under s and doubling the payment to £ per week per child from April, the Tories are cutting support for those who need it most and implementing unfair tax hikes on households.It#s now beyond all doubt that Westminster control is not working for people in Argyll and Bute. The only way to keep Scotland safe from Tory cuts is to become an independent country, with the full powers needed to build a fairer society."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week february 18 2022","story":"Instinctively, I would answer: #Doubt.#But is that right  The opposite of faith is surely not doubt, but certainty. If you are sure you know something to be the case beyond contradiction, you don#t need faith.Doubt, on the other hand, is strongly linked with faith because, while you may have faith strong enough to move mountains, there is always the possibility your faith is misplaced.I would argue the existence of God is proven by large amounts of evidence, but in the end that is a matter of faith.The Bible recognises this right at the start where Adam and Eve leave the Garden of Eden and do not see God face-to-face anymore.From now on, they, and we who come after them, must live by faith.This is what it is to be human – and faith is always open to challenge.When suffering occurs, when disaster looms, people ask, #Where was God # and use what has happened to deny God exists.Yet the faithful keep believing. Why There have been many attempts by faithful people to explain unbearable tragedies with faith in a loving God. Few are convincing – at least at the time.For me, the love that people give to one another is God reflected in human goodness.Living by faith is not easy. Sometimes it means being assailed by doubts and I believe we must be honest about our questions.After all, did not Jesus say: #The truth will set you free.# When those most bitter and painful tragedies strike us down, faith can be a consolation – sometimes the only consolation – even as at the time it is tested to breaking point."},{"url":null,"title":"oban golfer bob shines in californian sun","story":"With  top  world-ranking players in the field, the honorary Machrihanish Golf Club member was going head-to-head with the one of the strongest fields assembled outside a major championship.Having shown signicant signs of ato form in his previous two tournaments in the United Arab Emirates, this was a chance for the left hander to build on his progress and climb back towards the top  in the world rankings.An opening level par  on Thursday left Bob in the middle of the pack after day one.

The scenes from Paddington to Windsor were impressive, especially the arrival at Windsor and the unforgettable journey to St George’s Chapel.To those people in Kintyre, so far from the television network, it must have been an unforgettable experience to have this outstanding London ceremonial brought hundreds of miles to before their eyes and to be taken in imagination straight to Windsor to

Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost-filled seed trays and then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost.If the seeds are big enough to handle, then you can sow them inidually into cm pots – the quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds, between five- seeds per pot.For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost-filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can then be planted outside tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill.You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots.Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and – handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots – gently tease them apart.Drop inidual seedlings into a cm compost-filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level.Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes.These can be planted from mid-March however planting times will y across the country, according to temperature and risk of frost.Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags.You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, and approximately cm deep and cm apart.Once stems are about cm tall, they will need earthing up – by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered.Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt – good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle – nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh Maris Bard – white flesh with good ‘new potato’ flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks.It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden."},{"url":null,"title":"cowal gathering set for 2022 return","story":"Nobody could have predicted at the end of the th Cowal Gathering in August  that it would be another three years before the sights and sounds of one of Scotland#s best family days out again would be experienced again.The event will be held from Thursday August  to Saturday August  and will feature a full programme including the World Highland Dancing Championships, the Cowal Pipe Band Championship and the Cowal International Heavy Athletics Championship.Live music fans will be well catered for as The Gig at the Gathering s to rock the Stadium on Cowal Gathering Friday night, before some of Scotland’s best-known traditional bandson Cowal Gathering Saturday to the Live Music Tent.Cowal Gathering chairperson Ronnie Cairns spoke of his excitement that the -year-old gathering will be live this year.#This is the best possible news and I can#t wait to welcome competitors and spectators from across the world through the gates of Dunoon Stadium this August,# he said.#While Cowal’s Virtual Gathering entertained thousands of gathering fans across the globe in  and , there is nothing that compares to the atmosphere of games day.#We’ve waited for three years to gather together again and this year we’re going to make sure we celebrate in style.#Full details of this year’s programme, competition entry and ticket sales will be available over the coming months.Visit www.cowalgathering or email info@cowalgathering for more information."},{"url":null,"title":"cyclist mark beaumont supports dambusters ride","story":"The - and -mile cycling event is raising money for the RAF Benevolent Fund, the RAF’s leading welfare charity.It consists of two elements: a virtual ride on the weekend of May -, and a physical #heritage ride# taking place in Lincolnshire on Saturday May .The event pays tribute to the Dambusters, members of the RAF’s  Squadron who were assembled to bomb three dams in Germany’s Ruhr Valley on the night of May - .It was a risky raid, dropping the revolutionary bouncing bomb at low level, and the cost was high.

and Hogmanay festivals from  until .The new producers are being asked to deliver the traditional aspects of Edinburgh’s Hogmanay celebrations including a ‘signicant midnight moment’, which could include fireworks, drones, lighting, or another major spectacle to ring in the bells.However, they will not have to provide a street party.The tender specication document states: “Whilst previous events have incorporated live music and a large street party, the contractor is not obliged to repeat this format but must propose alternative entertainment that maintains or increases the media and audience impact.”Over the past two years, the Scottish capital’s traditional Hogmanay street party has been cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, but normally draws crowds of tens of thousands of people from across the UK and further afield.Historically, Edinburgh’s Christmas and Hogmanay festivals have taken place in the centre of the city at locations such as Princes Street Gardens and St Andrew Square, but in the new specication producers will also be asked to extend the celebrations to other parts of the city outside of the centre, such as light installations at Granton waterfront and Leith.For years, Edinburgh’s Christmas has taken place over a six-week period from around the third weekend in November to around January  and has featured activities including a market, fairground, family attractions and an ice rink.The council now wants to see Christmas celebrations distributed more widely throughout the city centre to avoid overcrowding, and the introduction of alcohol-free times and or areas.The specications were devised in response to the findings of a major independent survey into the future of Edinburgh’s Winter Festivals conducted last year.Edinburgh City Council leader, Adam McVey, said: “Through our citywide conversation with residents, businesses and stakeholders last year, it was clear that there was overwhelming support for the continuation of Christmas and Hogmanay celebrations in the Capital, but with a revised format.“More than , people and  organisations responded to the survey, with % expressing support for a Christmas celebration and % for Hogmanay.“I’m confident that by acting on residents’ feedback, we can remain the home of Hogmanay and ensure our Christmas events, enjoyed by so many across the City, continue in a way that balances residents’ needs and aspirations for how they should look and feel in future.”The tender responses will be used to draw up a shortlist for further consideration, and the council hopes to have a producing partner in place by the summer.For Hogmanay, the successful contractor will be required to “maintain the city’s Hogmanay Festival status as a world class event that promotes the city internationally”.Deputy council leader, Cammy Day, added: “Our winter festivals are internationally renowned and, from our conversation with the city, we were pleased that the majority wanted the capital to keep its place on the world map for Christmas celebrations and as home of Hogmanay.“As well as contributing to the wellbeing of our residents, our winter festivals deliver real economic impact, benefitting tourism, hospitality and leisure sectors in particular.“With these new contracts, we want to continue to provide inclusive, high-quality, festive celebrations, further enhance the city’s reputation and allow the benefits to be shared across our town centres and communities.” "},{"url":null,"title":"fmqs-recap-nicola-sturgeon-told-support-ramp-north-sea-oil-gas-douglas-ross","story":"-Nicola Sturgeon refutes claims expanding North Sea oil and gas production

I think I’m the same person.“I would do the same thingsI wasn’t the captain there and I would always try to help the team so to me that’s not the most important thing.”While the move to Madrid was ultimately doomed to fail, Odegaard used the experience, coupled with spells out on loan in Holland, Spain and finally at Arsenal, to develop.Thrust into the media spotlight at such a tender age could have been the undoing for a player so well protected during his formative years at Stromsgodset – but not for Odegaard.“I was so into football so I didn’t think of everything around me,” he said.“I just wanted to play and have fun and also in Norway when I started playing there was a lot of attention in the media and all those kinds of things. vw,vw,px, px\"Odegaard spent time out on loan at Real Sociedad earlier in his career. “But I didn’t really care at that time, now when I look back I can understand it was crazy but at that time I didn’t think about it, I don’t think I was aware of everything around me.”His £million move to Arsenal last summer was part of a wider transfer strategy as Arteta and technical director Edu set about changing the dynamic of the first-team squad.“The club did really well,” Odegaard said of a transfer window which saw Arsenal outspend any other team in Europe.“I think they had a clear plan what they wanted to do and what kind of players and profiles they wanted to bring in and I think everyone they brought in has done a great job, helped the team and improved the team a lot, so credit to them.”Recruiting younger, hungrier –less-proven – talent to compliment the players already at Arteta’s disposal has allowed Arsenal to challenge for a top-four finish in the Premier League.The likes of Saka and Smith Rowe, first-team regulars and England internationals at  and  respectively, can also benefit from lending an ear to Odegaard. vw,vw,px, px\"Martin Odegaard has been a star performer for Arsenal this season “Yes, of course,” he replied when askedhe can use his experiences of Real Madrid to help aid the development of Saka, Smith Rowe and others.“They don’t need a lot of help but of course I can give them some advice and tips about how I made sure to keep focused on football, have good people in my le.“I think they’ve been through a lot already but we can talk about dferent experiences, I can help with that.”Saka and Odegaard have certainly been helping one another on the pitch lately, with the latter’s opening goal in the recent win over Watford further evidence of their burgeoning understanding.For Odegaard, it was a fth goal of the season to go alongside his four assists so far.Martin Odegaard.

However, a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday that a specic licence could be granted to allow a sale to go through.“The important thing is under no circumstances would any sale allow Roman Abramovich to profit from that or take any money from that sale,” the spokesman said.A document issued by the Treasury states the club can continue to pay the salaries, allowances and pensions of all employees. Fees, idends and other allowances to directors which pre-date the licence can be paid, with the exception of anything due to Abramovich.Fees related to the day-to-day maintenance of club facilities can be paid, but no money can go towards new capital works or refurbishment of Stamford Bridge or any other club-owned sites. vw,vw,px, px\"Broadcasting fees can still be paid to Cha The club can still receive money from other clubs for existing loan or player sale arrangements.Television revenue and performance fees can still be paid to the club. vw,vw,px, px\"Cesar Azpilicueta’s contract expires this summer No new player sales or purchases will be permitted under the licence, and discussions on new deals for players who are out of contract in the summer – such as men’s team captain Cesar Azpilicueta – must go on hold.Its matchday! 😁West Ham v Cha.

But we have two games, two big tests away from home, and the players are all set on working to deliver their best performance.“We feelwe get our performance right, we’re a match for any team in the world. We know that going away against a full crowd is going to be another test of who we are and that’s what we aim to show this weekend.” vw,vw,px, px\"Hamish Watson s for Scotland Scotland have a good record in Italy, but Townsend wants to see a strong start this weekend.“We need to put our own game in place and be accurate and disciplined with that,” he said. “We also need to not give any easy ways for Italy to get into the game. We know they’ll play with a lot of passion and aggression.“The last two occasions when we played in Florence and in Rome, they were the better team in the first half hour of the game. We managed to come back and win both games but we can’t let that happen this time. We’ve got to make sure we win moments at the beginning and the end of the game.”Townsend is delighted to have Hamish Watson and Matt Fagerson back after the key duo missed the defeat by France through illness and injury respectively.“Hamish and Matt played really well down in Wales and both of them played really well against England so it’s a boost to have those two back in our squad,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"roman-abramovich-sanctioned-uk-ties-vladimir-putin   \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Ultimately, though, I think one of the simplest changes we can all make is to buy less and reuse more.“Before shopping in the sales, let’s ask ourselves whether we really need it.

Create a ‘reuse bin’You may already have separate bins for rubbish and recycling, but Moate stresses that lots of our recycling can be reused before we get rid of it. “Why not start a reuse bin ” she suggests. “This can be a place to put clean recycled materials that can be used again for things like arts and crafts.”. Become a water collectorMoate points out that in some parts of the world, fresh water is considered a luxury and a precious resource. “To help us conserve water, encourage kids to collect rainwater in old containers and use it to water the garden or house plants.”. Go on a rubbish rambleGrab a pair of gloves and a bucket, and go on a rubbish ramble, suggests Moate. “When litter ends up in our natural ecosystems it can be harmful to wildle and can take hundreds of years to break down,” she says. “We can do our bit by helping clean up our local environment when we’re out and about.”. Open your own bee caféBees will travel up to two miles in search of flowers loaded with nectar and pollen for food, explains Moate.“Over the years, we’ve destroyed a lot of our native wildflower habitats and this makes searching for food pretty exhausting for our pollinator buddies,” she says. “We can help them out by planting a bee café to help them refuel. A bee cafe is a one-pot stop for our pollinator friends no matter where you live.”Wildflowers bees enjoy include cornflowers, viper’s bugloss, poppies and dandelion, and Moate adds: “I really love bees, so planting wildflowers not only encouraged pollinators but also made my garden more exciting.”. Craft your own recycled paperYou’ll need: old paper, a bowl, water, tea towel and a rolling pin.How to do it: Get some recycled paper and tear it into tiny pieces, and then mix the pieces of paper with some water in a bowl, and squish it all together until it’s really mushy. Squeeze the mushy mixture into balls of pulp, and place each pulp ball on a flat surface and put a tea towel over the top, before using a rolling pin to flatten it and squeeze out the excess water. Leave the pulp to dry and you’ve made your own paper!. Construct a compost bin“Composting at home is great because it reduces the amount of food waste we send to landfills, which create huge amounts of greenhouse gas,” says Moate. “You don’t need to have a garden to start composting either, you can make a mini-compost bin in something as small as a plastic bottle.”You’ll need: an old plastic bottle, scissors, a pin, tray, brown green waste, a spray water bottle and kitchen towel.How to do it: Wash an old plastic bottle and peel off any labels, then ask a grown-up to help you cut the top off the bottle and use a pin to poke some holes in the bottom for drainage. Place the bottle on a plastic tray and add a layer of brown waste – like shredded paper, torn-up egg cartons and crunchy old leaves. Spray the brown layer with water till it’s damp, but not too soggy, and then add a layer of green waste – like vegetables, food scraps and grass cuttings. Place the tray and composter somewhere warm like a sunny windowsill, and give it a stir every day and add a little more water to help micro-organisms break the contents down into compost.Lay a sheet of kitchen towel over the top to keep it damp, and continue to add layers of brown and green waste, but remember it will take time for everything to decompose. When the layers have transformed into compost, you can add it to the soil around plants to give them a healthy snack packed with nutrients.Stuff: Eco-Stories of Everyday Stuff by Maddie Moate, Puffin, £..

The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , led by Environment Minister Edwin Poots, and Green Party NI leader Clare Bailey have bills that have reached the consideration stage in the Assembly.Whichever bill emerges, it is clear that signicant change to our socio-economic model needs to occur to reach any of the proposed targets. In , Northern Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions were estimated to be . million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. Northern Ireland accounted for % of UK greenhouse gas emissions in , compared to approximately % of the UK population. Agriculture , transportand residential buildingswere the largest sectors in terms of emissions. Mindful of the need to address this and maintain a viable economy, Daera has produced a draft green growth strategy which is about creating more green jobs and protecting or re-purposing existing jobs where possible.An important part of the draft green growth strategy is the new energy strategy from the Department for the Economy. It notes an ambition to deliver energy savings of % from buildings and industry by  and meet at least % of electricity consumption from a erse mix of renewable sources by .While the legislation may be edging forward and strategies are emerging, the current Northern Ireland report within the latest UK Climate Change Risk Assessment makes for sobering reading. The Government is required by the Climate Change Act  to conduct such an assessment every five years to inform the UK National Adaptation Plans for England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. The assessment covers  specic risks and opportunities in detail across themes such as infrastructure, health, the natural environment, international dimensions and business and industry.Taking the business and industry theme, issues such as increased flooding of business sites, increased levels of coastal flooding, access to finance, worker productivity and disruption to supply chains could all be at risk from climate change.For example, the annual bill for damage for non-residential properties in Northern Ireland is expected to increase by % by  due to flooding events. The expected annual damages for UK business properties from coastal flooding is expected to increase by % by .The Climate Change Risk Assessment also suggests that there is a risk that access to finance, investment, insurance, and capital for businesses are negatively impacted by climate change through decline in availability and affordability of insurance, a reduction in the value of assets and investment and increased credit risks and cost of capital.Across Northern Ireland, this is currently a medium risk, but it has the potential to rise to high magnitude in future.With these potential risks fast approaching, finding a path to net-zero is crucial.

Matthew Martin played around several Bangor defenders and looked to pass up to Jason Campbell up front, who got into some promising positions.However, it was Bangor who broke the deadlock following a cross to the back post to take the lead.Play continued with both teams creating chances but neither were able to add to the scoreline before the end of the quarter.Bangor continued to apply pressure on lsquoHinch from the start of the second but the home side managed to manufacture counterattacks.lsquoHinch were playing the ball down the wings to Adam Dodds and Ross Connolly.Leslie Harrison played the ball out from the back to Andrew McIlwaine, only to be dispossessed by the Bangor defence.Play became end to end with teams trying to keep possession but unable to do so. Bangor were able to scoretheir second of the day just before half-time with a deflection in a crowded circle.lsquoHinch started the third quarter with a quick push back and passed the ball up the pitch towards Bangorrsquos goal only to be met by a strong defence.Matthew Martin worked the ball up the pitch, passing to Jason Campbell and Adam Dodds allowing them to have some shots towards the Bangor goal.Hugo Melville, Ross Connolly and Ben Chadwick kept the pressure on Bangor players tackling when possible.Aaron Donnell continued to get his touch to send many balls wide of the lsquoHinch goal. Bangor scored their third goal from open play, although many of the lsquoHinch defence disputed the previous foul.

He asked that that all Mournes area councillors are consulted before anything is agreed for this summer in Newcastle.ldquoThere is a substantial amount of money available and Mournes councillors should have a massive say in what happens in Newcastle this year, he added, with his suggestion backed by Cllr Leeanne McEvoy.Cllr Owen proposed that a firm commitment should be made to include the Festival of Flight in the councilrsquos events calendar for next year.She said she had been contacted by a number of business owners and aviation enthusiasts who were concerned that this yearrsquos festival had been cancelled and hoped that it will proceed next summer.Council deputy chief executive Dorinnia Carville said it would be would be premature to determine the events programme for   ahead of finding out how much it would cost.The council official said the organisation had to go through the rates process each year and look at budgets thereafter.Several weeks ago, it was confirmed that this yearrsquos Festival of Flight would not go ahead due to the challenges in planning such a major festival, securing commitments from participants and with the uncertainty caused to date by the coronavirus pandemic.The international festival was cancelled in  because of bad weather and was also grounded in  and last year because of the Covid- pandemic..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Down on the Farm book shows importance of museum collections detailing rich history  ","story":"lsquoI SAW the man jump out of the group and grasp the handles of the plough.

While museums are about objects, those objects have no signicance without people.People make things for particular purposes they use them, they value them, they discard them, they contemplate them. Museums try to understand objects in order to reach the peoplebehind them, understand their lives and so add meaning to our own.Local museums are concerned with all aspects of their communities. Their collections represent the inheritance, the culture, and the trust of their communities.Down County Museum has the largest collection of objects relating to farming in Ulster outside the national museums.Through the generosity of iniduals and families it has acquired not only the complete equipment of two of the last horse-powered farms in the county but a fine example of an early Ferguson tractor, with an invention which not only revolutionised agriculture but brought recognition to its County Down inventor throughout the world.A host of other items represent the history of a basic industry and developing way of le in County Down, from a wooden plough from Mourne to a donkey-powered milk churn from Ballyroney to the first reaper and binder in the area, to hay sweeps, rakes and potato diggers, scythes, rope twisters, turnip cutters, barn fans, churns, butter pats, sheep shears, horse harness, slipes, carts, Young Farmersrsquo Club trophies and records, and valuable medals given for agricultural improvements on the iable soils of County Down.We should not forget that we build on what has gone before and that is as true of our most important industry as of any other.One object which is almost entirely forgotten was the block-wheeled car, with solid wooden wheels, which was the ubiquitous load carrier before the introduction of the large-wheeled lsquoScotch cartrsquo in the s.The agricultural census of  recorded  of these lsquocarsrsquo in the  townlands of the south Ards alone.

","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest secured their spot in the semi-final stages of the Harry Clarke Cup after they dramatically defeated a favoured Ardglass side on Saturday.Despite trailing by two goals with less than five minutes left on the clock, Forest managed to force extra-time, and then penalties, following a bizarre conclusion to the  minutes that ended with a red card and a fairytale finish.Sean Dornan was the hero between the sticks in the shootout after saving two separate Ardglass efforts while converting his chance from the spot for good measure.To add further to the drama, Dornan was initially outfield for Forest before swapping positions with lsquokeeper Brian McVeigh a minute before the final whistle of extra-time sounded.It was a sunny yet bitterly cold Ardglass venue but that didnrsquot deter things from immediately heating up on the pitch as both teams sought to gain the upper hand early.However, it was the home side who would take the lead within the opening ten minutes when striker Michael Magee struck the ball into the net from close range.This lead would be short-lived as the visitors penned Ardglass back into their own half and soon Castlewellan were rewarded for their relentless attacking.A quickly played pass across the box was met by Forest forward Shane Mooney, who made no mistake with his right footed finish beyond the outstretched arms of Ardglass custodian Mark Armstrong.Chances followed for the visitors, including a Sean Dornan effort that cracked the outside of the post from range and an opportunity for striker Scott Kinley, which quickly diminished after he took too much time on the ball.However, Ardglass refused to be bullied for a prolonged period of time from a side a ision below in the Newcastle League and often launched some dangerous looking counterattacks.One such breakaway ended with Shane Teggart earning his Ardglass side a corner which led to a goalmouth scramble before the ball was headed off the line and away from danger.Ardglass began to find their feet and found more success up front thanks to the probing runs of marksman Magee, who was giving the Castlewellan defence plenty to think about.The Ardglass number nine was unfortunate to see his free-kick effort saved at the second time of asking, but he did give his side the chance to go in front when his nty footwork inside the Forest box resulted in a mistimed tackle and a penalty awarded.Stephen Deegan stepped up a coolly dispatched the spot kick, sending Castlewellan custodian Brian McVeigh the opposite direction in the process.Castlewellan continued to battle with Donagh Steele in the middle of the park having a particularly notable performance as he chased down every loose ball available.Despite their good work, Forest may count themselves fortunate not to go into the break further behind as the usually clinical Magee fluffed his lines from ten yards, missing a golden opportunity for Ardglass.The drama of the first half carried onto the second and in a matter of minutes the referee was forced to make another potentially game changing decision.Once again, the hosts released Magee into the danger area although this time he had Castlewellan captain Aidan Dornan hot on his heels.The move ended with Magee on the ground with his hands in the air appealing for a penalty, however, this time appeals were swtly waved off.The contest quickly turned into a feisty affair as Ardglass looked to overrun their counterparts by sending bodies forward in waves of attacks.Jordan Finnegan saw his snapshot smartly saved by Forest lsquokeeper McVeigh before strike partner Magee saw another one of his efforts tipped wide by the impressive Castlewellan number one.Midway through the half Castlewellan were afforded a seldom opportunity, but Sean Dornan opted to pass when he maybe should have tried his luck at goal instead.Soon after, a punt upfield from the Ardglass defence evaded the heads of the opposition, including lsquokeeper McVeigh, and almost resulted in a rather comedic goal.However, the Castlewellan defence recovered just in the nick of time to avoid any red faces.With  minutes left of the , Ardglass would finally add to their tally after a sumptuous dead ball delivery from Neil Teggart lofted onto the head of team-mate Malachy Crangle, who directed his effort into the net.Castlewellan knew the clock was against them but firmly pushed for a way back into the tie. Rossa McCartan was introduced to the fray off the bench in what proved to be a decisive move from Castlewellan head coach Conall Burns.With a minute of regulation time to go, McCartan danced his way down the line and into the Ardglass box where he was adjudged to be brought down unfairly.Forest striker Mooney converted the penalty to notch his second goal of the match but there was little belief from the surrounding spectators that there would be enough time for another opportunity.In what was seemingly one last throw of the dice, Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick inside their own half and players gathered at the edge of the opposing -yard line waiting for the delivery.However, before the free-kick could be taken, some roughhousing from both sides would end with Ardglass substitute Aidan Watson being shown the red card after he seemingly lost his discipline and kicked out at the opposition.A bizarre series would follow, as the initial free-kick was then brought forward to the -yard line where Watson committed his foul, and from here Castlewellan would take full advantage.Sean Dornan struck his lowly driven effort beneath the jumping Ardglass wall, and goalkeeper Mark Armstrong could only momentarily ert the ball away from goal before the onrushing Callum McCabe would tap-in to draw the sides level.With that, the final whistle of regulation time was blown and extra-time was set to commence.To both sidersquos credit, the intensity of the match remained but neither manufactured any real clear cut chances.Ardglass striker Magee picked up a yellow card but the most notable move of extra-time came from the Castlewellan management, whoopted to swap midfielder Sean Dornan for goalkeeper McVeigh a minute before the penalty shootout.This would prove decisive as Dornan broke Ardglass hearts and saved two penalties, giving his Castlewellan side a memorable victory and place in the last four of the Harry Clarke Cup.Following the dramatic encounter, Dornan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe were low on numbers coming down here and we probably werenrsquot as strong as we could be, he said.ldquoBut the credit has to go to the boys, we worked hard and it worked out for us.ldquoWe went - down but we battled hard, got a penalty and a fluky goal.He added: ldquoThe Harry Clarke Cup is blown wide open, Ardglass was probably the favourites and we knocked them out so itrsquos anyones now.Ardglass: M Armstrong, C Kearney, M Crangle, N Teggart, C OrsquoShea, M Rooney , S Deegan, SP Halpin, M Magee, J Finnegan, S Teggart.Subs: S Dorrian, A Watson, J Deegans, A OrsquoShea.Yellow card: M MageeRed card: A WatsonCastlewellan: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, A Dornan , D Gilmore, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, S Kinley, J Murnin.Subs: C McVeigh, R McCartan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  March 11%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash Work has begun on the first phase of a major agricultural marketing centre for the Downpatrick area.Diggers moved in this week to begin excavating a ten-acre site for a co-operative project which is being seen as essential to the future of the local farming community.A pound, livestock mart will form the first stage of an ambitious scheme by the Downpatrick Co-Operative Marketing Centre, a limited company which has been set up by more than  local farmers.A covered sale yard and ancillary buildings on the Bonecastle Road site are expected to be finished in time for trading to begin by late July.

The extension of the scheme sends a strong message of the important contribution of the small business sector.Last month, Newry, Mourne and Down Council imposed a .% rates rise to finance its poundm budget, with the hike the second lowest increase of any of the provincersquos  local authorities.Rates are made up of two parts mdash the regional rate and the district rate.The regional rate is set by Stormont and, along with the block grant from the Treasury, pays for the likes of schools, health and roads. The district rate is set by local councils and pays for services that the council is responsible for, such as refuse collection, leisure provision and street cleaning.While councils have the power to set dferent rates increases for households and businesses, this year they have chosen to instead set one percentage increase for both.Domestic and non-domestic rates are calculated by multiplying the rateable valuation of homes and businesses by the combined district and regional rate.Domestic and non-domestic rates are set in terms of the number of pence in each pound of the value of your home business. For instance, in the Newry, Mourne and Down council area, the domestic rate for the   financial year is . pence, while the non-domestic rate will be . pence.Key factors that councils have to take into account when setting their district rate, including cost of living, inflation, the councilrsquos own financial reserves and other income, and the wider economic outlook.Last year, several councils chose to freeze their rates due to the impact of the pandemic, dipping into their reserves to absorb the loss of income. Others chose to raise their rates slightly, however this has meant playing a degree of catch-up this year, when all councils have opted to hike their rates.As a result of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos rates increase, local communities are set to share a poundm funding boost in the new financial year.The organisation said it recognises that communities have been hit hard over the past number of years, outlining plans for poundm of financial assistance grants for community and voluntary organisations.In addition, the local authority will also manage the establishment of the Peace Plus Partnership as well as the submission and delivery of the Peace Plus Local Authority Action Plan worth around poundm.The action plan will provide priority projects on a cross-community basis, resulting in shared and inclusive local services, facilities and spaces and make a ldquosignicant and lasting contribution to peace and reconciliation for the whole community.In addition, pound.m will be invested on a new fleet of over  modern and more efficient vehicles across a range of services including refuse collection, district cleansing and parks and grounds maintenance with the new vehicles expected to arrive before the end of this year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Sense have been at  the core of Páuric’s  development and they have done a lot for us  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN woman braved the winds and rain last month to walk  miles in aid of the disability charity, Sense.Janine Laverty was inspired to take on Sensersquos Run For challenge to give back to the charity which supports her disabled son.So far Janine has raised an amazing total of over pound, through her challenge, but she is aiming to raise pound, in total.Participants challenged themselves to run or walk a distance of their choosing over the month of February.Janine finished her -mile target on February , completing her challenge with a seaside walk.She undertook the walk to support the charity which has meant so much to her family since her youngest son Paacuteuric, , was born premature and has cerebral palsy, developmental delay and dficulties with his vision.Family and friends have rallied around Janine , joining her on walks and generously donating to Sense.Sense services in Northern Ireland have supported Paacuteuric since he was an infant, providing key interventions such as play therapy, music therapy and guide dog days which boosted his development.Janine also credits Sense with providing some of her most precious family memories support from the charity allowed her to take both her sons swimming at the same time, and the family have attended fun-filled Sense days out to places including Ark Open Farm, Armagh Planetarium and Jungle Northern Ireland.Janine explained: ldquoSense Northern Ireland have been at the core of Paacuteuricrsquos development and they have done an awful lot for us.

In the current situation that is just not possible, he said.ldquoThe only way for people to get out is through the only UK embassy open in Lviv and how are people are meant top get there when they canrsquot leave their own towns without the risk of being bombed Mr Johnston added that he and his we and their children, Liza and Jamie, were frustrated that their family members could be just one plane flight away from safetythey could get the necessary visa, orthat could be waived in the urgent circumstances.He said: ldquoWe are worried aboutthe possibility of Alexander being coned to fight and we are getting reports that landmines have been set around the city.ldquoWhile we are all worried, Iryna has been remarkable throughout all of this and has been really strong but we feel that there is very little we can do.Mr Johnston said that they were in despair of the UKrsquos stance in welcoming Ukrainian refugees but still making them apply for visas.ldquoThe south of Ireland opened up to refugees visa-free which is great but that means we still couldnrsquot bring them to our home as they would be in UK territory.He and his family visited Mariupol for six weeks last summer as it has already proved dficult for his mother-in-law to get a visa to travel to them.ldquoMariupol is such a beautul city. They had spent so much money on the city and now itrsquos ruined.The couple met in Ukraine while Mr Johnston, a flutist, was performing in cruise ships and his we was a concert pianist.To sign the petition to waive visa requirements for Ukrainian refugees coming into the UK visit https:petition.parliament.uk petitions ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":null,"title":"latest","story":"Undefined component: AdRowTaboolaNational Pleas for help as cost of heating oil doubles Graeme CousinsEducation Beattie under pressure to back DUP in vetoing Integrated Education Bill Henry McDonald with one of his passengers travelling across the Polish border.

Non-verbal communication with teachers is lostWhy are Northern Ireland school children still wearing masks Now that the English, Welsh and Scottish governments have dropped the requirement for schoolchildren to wear masks and it is optional in the Irish Republic, why are our children still strongly recommended to wear them in school This is plainly ridiculous.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The overwhelming body of scientic evidence shows that children are almost totally unaffected by the virus, whilst the evidence for the efficacy of masks has always been weak .What is indisputable is that wearing masks cause harm. Teaching, and hence learning, relies on communication, the essential verbal and non-verbal communication between child and teacher cannot take place behind a mask. All those non-verbal cues which teachers use to gauge understanding are being lost.A child’s capacity to express feelings and emotions is being affected by being masked. Some children cannot make eye contact and can’t sleep, clear signs of psychological distress and of course, impacting on their capacity to learn. Referrals to schools’ counselling services have rocketed.How can it be healthy for a child to wear a mask six or seven hours per day How can we justy a measure which has no benefit to children and accept the damage to their education, mental health and social development It is long past the time to end this abuse of our children.Hugh McCarthy, , Newtownabbey——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe -year-old is hoping to use his rise as a teenage sensation to help the likes of Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe cope under the pressure.The Norway skipper has been spoken about as a potential future Arsenal captain and has seen his leadership abilities talked up by manager Mikel Arteta.Odegaard has already been playing top-tier football for eight years and, although Alexandre Lacazette, Kieran Tierney and Rob Holding are the go-to for the armband at the moment, he has experience in that area. vw,vw,px, px\"Arsenal’s Martin Odegaard, Bukayo Saka, Emile Smith Rowe and Cedric Soares “I’ve been through a lot, you know,” he told the PA news agency.“I went to Real Madrid when I was , I played in Norway at  and I’ve been to some dferent clubs on loan and I feel like I’ve been through a lot.“That helped me to grow up and to feel more confident and to use that in a good way now.“Of course, it’s a bit more responsibility with being captain for your country but I don’t feel like I’ve changed after that. I think I’m the same person.“I would do the same thingsI wasn’t the captain there and I would always try to help the team so to me that’s not the most important thing.”While the move to Madrid was ultimately doomed to fail, Odegaard used the experience, coupled with spells out on loan in Holland, Spain and finally at Arsenal, to develop.Thrust into the media spotlight at such a tender age could have been the undoing for a player so well protected during his formative years at Stromsgodset – but not for Odegaard.“I was so into football so I didn’t think of everything around me,” he said.“I just wanted to play and have fun and also in Norway when I started playing there was a lot of attention in the media and all those kinds of things..remove vw,vw,px, px\"Odegaard spent time out on loan at Real Sociedad earlier in his career. “But I didn’t really care at that time, now when I look back I can understand it was crazy but at that time I didn’t think about it, I don’t think I was aware of everything around me.”His £million move to Arsenal last summer was part of a wider transfer strategy as Arteta and technical director Edu set about changing the dynamic of the first-team squad.“The club did really well,” Odegaard said of a transfer window which saw Arsenal outspend any other team in Europe.“I think they had a clear plan what they wanted to do and what kind of players and profiles they wanted to bring in and I think everyone they brought in has done a great job, helped the team and improved the team a lot, so credit to them.”Recruiting younger, hungrier –less-proven – talent to compliment the players already at Arteta’s disposal has allowed Arsenal to challenge for a top-four finish in the Premier League.The likes of Saka and Smith Rowe, first-team regulars and England internationals at  and  respectively, can also benefit from lending an ear to Odegaard. vw,vw,px, px\"Martin Odegaard has been a star performer for Arsenal this season “Yes, of course,” he replied when askedhe can use his experiences of Real Madrid to help aid the development of Saka, Smith Rowe and others.“They don’t need a lot of help but of course I can give them some advice and tips about how I made sure to keep focused on football, have good people in my le.“I think they’ve been through a lot already but we can talk about dferent experiences, I can help with that.”Saka and Odegaard have certainly been helping one another on the pitch lately, with the latter’s opening goal in the recent win over Watford further evidence of their burgeoning understanding.For Odegaard, it was a fth goal of the season to go alongside his four assists so far.Martin Odegaard. 𝗕𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿. #WATARS pic YYaakSpNU— ArsenalMarch , “Football now, it has changed a little bit during the years and I think Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi of course are a big part of that with the goals and the assists and everything,” he added.“Now everyone just judges you onyou score goals or assist but, to me, the most important thing is to help the team to win.“SoI make the last pass, or score the goal, or make the third-last past it is not the most important thing to me, I want to help the team to win and improve.

However, no new tickets can be purchased either by Cha or away fans wishing to visit Stamford Bridge, either in regular areas of the ground or in corporate hospitality sections.Merchandise vw,vw,px, px\"Only existing stocks of Cha merchandise can be sold Third parties who purchased or produced club merchandise prior to March  are permitted to sell existing stocks, on the condition that no funds or other financial benefits are made available to the club or Abramovich.Other points and principlesI have announced a full asset freeze and travel ban on seven more of Russias wealthiest and most influential oligarchs, including Roman Abramovich and Oleg Deripaska.

But we have two games, two big tests away from home, and the players are all set on working to deliver their best performance.“We feelwe get our performance right, we’re a match for any team in the world.

We know they’ll play with a lot of passion and aggression.“The last two occasions when we played in Florence and in Rome, they were the better team in the first half hour of the game. We managed to come back and win both games but we can’t let that happen this time. We’ve got to make sure we win moments at the beginning and the end of the game.”.removeTownsend is delighted to have Hamish Watson and Matt Fagerson back after the key duo missed the defeat by France through illness and injury respectively.“Hamish and Matt played really well down in Wales and both of them played really well against England so it’s a boost to have those two back in our squad,” he said..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Gregor Townsend urges Scotland to finish Six Nations on a high article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityBranded a pro-Kremlin oligarch, Mr Abramovich was targeted with an asset freeze and a travel ban on Thursday after ministers came under sustained pressure to target him over Moscow’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.The updated sanctions list, which hits seven new elite iniduals, said Mr Abramovich has had a “close relationship for decades” with Mr Putin, which the football club owner has previously denied.“This association has included obtaining a financial benefit or other material benefit from Putin and the government of Russia,” it said.Oleg Deripaska, an industrialist worth £ billion who has had close links with the British political establishment, was also targeted, as was Mr Putin’s “right-hand man” Igor Sechin, who is the chief executive of the Rosneft state oil firm.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the Government targeted the oligarchs to “ramp up the pressure on the Putin regime and choke off funds to his brutal war machine”.“With their close links to Putin they are complicit in his aggression,” she said.“The blood of the Ukrainian people is on their hands. They should hang their heads in shame.”Ministers issued a licence authorising Cha to continue playing matches, given the “signicant impact” the sanctions will have.Season ticket holders and those with games already booked can still attend matches, but no new tickets can be sold and the club’s merchandise shop will close.Downing Street was “open” to a sale of Cha, as has been planned by the oligarch, but said a separate licence would need to be approved by the Treasury and “under no circumstances would any sale allow Roman Abramovich to profit from that”.Jets and yachts owned or chartered by Mr Abramovich, who is worth about £. billion, can been seized, the sanctions say..removePrime Minister Boris Johnson said: “There can be no safe havens for those who have supported Putin’s vicious assault on Ukraine.“We will be ruthless in pursuing those who enable the killing of civilians, destruction of hospitals and illegal occupation of sovereign allies.”I have announced a full asset freeze and travel ban on seven more of Russias wealthiest and most influential oligarchs, including Roman Abramovich and Oleg Deripaska. We will not stop in this mission to ramp up pressure on the Putin regime. 👇https:t.co MfWvFtnNuo pic xASSXWG— Liz TrussMarch , Mr Abramovich is the biggest shareholder in Evraz – a FTSE  listed miner in which he owned a near-% stake in February.The Financial Conduct Authority said that it would temporarily suspend trading in Evraz’s shares “in order to protect investors pending clarication of the impact of the UK sanctions”.Mr Deripaska, who has a multi-million pound property portfolio in Britain, has been a prominent figure for years.In , he was embroiled in a row involving Labour grandee Lord Peter Mandelson and then-shadow chancellor George Osborne.Both men met Mr Deripaska on his yacht, while Mr Osborne reportedly attempted to solicit a donation for the Tory party from the oligarch – something he denied at the time.Last week, Mr Abramovich, who has owned Cha since , said he would sell the club, with the net proceeds being donated to a charity benefiting “all victims of the war in Ukraine”.The -year-old’s spokesman said he would be playing a “limited” role in trying to broker a “peaceful resolution” to the Kremlin’s attack on its neighbour.The Government said Mr Abramovich had received financial benefits from the Kremlin, including tax breaks for his companies, the buying and selling of shares from and to the state at favourable rates, and contacts in the run up to the  World Cup in Russia.The four others freshly hit by sanctions are:– Andrey Kostin, a “close associate” of Mr Putin who has “long supported” the Kremlin as chairman of the sanctioned VTB bank– Alexei Miller, the chief executive of state-owned energy giant Gazprom, who is “one of the most important executives” backing the KremlinSANCTIONED:  Russian oligarchs targeted in £bn sanction hit – including Abramovich and DeripaskaThe List ⬇️https:t.co jehzJCjTq pic gsLVKtVxR— Foreign, Commonwealth  Development OfficeMarch , – Nikolai Tokarev, who is said to have served as a KGB officer alongside Mr Putin in the s before rising to be president of the Russia state-owned pipeline company Transneft and– Dmitri Lebedev, the chairman of the board of directors of the Bank Rossiya, which is considered the “Kremlin’s private bank”.Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy welcomed the sanctioning of Mr Abramovich but called for ministers to move “faster” to hit others as he said the Cha owner should have been targeted sooner.“At last! This is the right decision. But it should not have taken the Government weeks,” the Labour MP said in a statement.“Too few oligarchs linked to Putin’s rogue regime have so far faced sanctions from the UK Government.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityFrom ice cream cone creations to vegan and gluten-free chocolate, I wanted to see which Aldi products are genuinely worth buying and whether the more luxurious, grand designs were good value.I must place a disclaimer here, I am a big fan of simple eggs made with tasty, good quality chocolate.For me, it isnt about novelty designs, chocolate shards spiking out and the price tags to match.So when I took a look at Aldis Easter selection, I decided my mission was to find an egg that looks great but tastes even better.One product that really intrigued me was Dairyfines chocolate ice cream egg- a blonde chocolate and wafer cone topped with a milk chocolate scoop, finished with mini eggs and biscuit crumb, as well as a popping candy cone base.Resembling the popular Cornetto ice cream, I was genuinely amazed by the attention to detail when I reached the end of the cone and discovered chocolate-covered popping candy and milk chocolate.It was a real treat to eat and I think Id have been bouncing off the walls in joy I received this as a kid.The one thing that really struck me about Aldis Easter egg offering was the effective use of recyclable materials, leaving you guilt-free when it comes to packaging. Not even the ice cream egg was covered in excess single-use plastic.The cone tasted almost like Caramac -thats a sweet up your street, this is the egg for you. The dferent combinations of chocolate and salty biscuit crumbs sprinkled on top left my sweet tooth feeling more than satisfied.  With the chocolate ice cream egg, you really have a bit of everything and I think its a worthwhile purchase.Salted caramel Easter eggsThere is one major theme in Aldis Easter egg and chocolate collection for : salted caramel. Some of Aldis salted caramel options, pictured. I recruited a salted caramel expert, otherwise known as my boyfriend, to help review the full salted caramel selection. .removeI thought salted caramel was something that didnt really y in quality - yet some of these eggs really stood out as the best. In my humble opinion, one of the best chocolate eggs from Aldi is the Moser Roth salted caramel egg  with hidden truffles, part of the Free From range.Despite not containing milk, egg, wheat and gluten, it gives out little bursts of salted caramel flavours with every bite and it wasnt overly rich. It would have been easy to eat the whole egg in one sitting, not to mention the tempting truffles hiding inside the box. For serious salted caramel fans, the ChocoChanger salted caramel eggis the choice to go for.From the moment you open the box, a strong aroma of caramel jumps out while the chocolate pops with creamy, salty sweetness.One of the more surprising salted caramel items was the rich, vegan, dark Belgian chocolate office bunnies- you couldnt have too many but one every so often would really hit the spot.Moser Roths luxury egg box from Aldi. If salted caramel is your idea of heaven, Id definitely recommend heading to Aldi for a browse. One of the most delicious chocolate treats from Aldi was the indulgent assortment of hand decorated chocolate eggs  with dferent types of fillings.From dark chocolate orange and speculoos to pistachio and macadamia, these chocolates are definitely ones youll struggle not to eat in one go. The flavours really worked well together - an ideal choice for people who love dferent types of chocolate and something visually appealing. One tasted like sticky toffee pudding while the raspberry chocolate had such delicate berry hints - absolutely perfect.Hazelnut filled eggs and hazelnut chocolate rabbits from Aldi. Now Im not the biggest hazelnut fan but Aldi has played an absolute blinder with this flavour in .Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny  leaves you with no words, just \"Mmmm\". Adorned with a cute green bow and bunny charm, the bunny looked great and tasted even better than you could expect.The smooth chocolate melts in your mouth while the hazelnut really hits the spot. If you love Ferrero Rocher, you need to try Aldis mouthwatering crispy hazelnut luxury filled eggs .A mix between Nutella and Ferrero Rocher, these chocolate eggs have a biscuity yet smooth texture with a gorgeous nutty aftertaste. Meanwhile, the Moser Roth Belgian milk and dark chocolate almond eggwas something unique, featuring salted almond butter.The combination of sweet yet salty almond butter with two types of chocolate was well balanced - though it did have a strong aftertaste, meaning its not one for those who can take or leave almond.There was just one Easter egg which left me wanting a little bit more than I got: the Dairyfine Chunky Egg Fruit and Nut .This chocolate egg is described as a thick Belgian milk chocolate egg packed with fruit and nut pieces - a combination Ive been known to enjoy.The chocolate didnt taste as special while the nuts were rather small and didnt have the crunch I yearned for. Saying that, it might be down to personal choice and you could completely disagree.The verdict: Which Aldi chocolate Easter eggs are worth buying From the selection I tried, there are three clear winners: Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny, Moser Roths Free From salted caramel egg with hidden truffles and the Dairyfine chocolate ice cream egg.You can browse the full Easter egg collection from Aldi via the website hereThe Aldi website has even more eggs on offer - featuring cookies and cream, Eton mess and chocolate orange flavours"},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/national/uk-today/19977191.aldi-lidl-middle-aisles-thursday/res","title":"aldi lidl middle aisles thursday","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Granny had died before I was born but her recipes had been passed down through the family and baked throughout my childhood. She was very much a part of my upbringing and she had achieved that by baking her way into the hearts of those who knew her.Teacher Ciara McLaughlin has released a new cookery book, Bread and Butter.\"Baking was Granny’s way of nourishing, caring and loving and that’s something that you will definitely find in my family. You’re hardly in the door until the kettle’s boiled and a scone is plated up with butter and homemade jam. I think there’s an element of traditional Irish hospitality behind it but the same is shared by cultures across the world. Food has the power to connect people – even those who are no longer around –and that’s why I knew I had to write this book.\"The ’university project’ version of Bread and Butter, a small prototype of only  recipes, won runner up in the British Design and Publication Awards .It caught the eye of Michael O’Brien from The O’Brien Press, who offered Ciara a publishing contract for the book.\"I was responsible for every element in the book: the writing, the photos, the illustrations and the design,\" Ciara added. \"Plus I also teach full-time and run my designer baking business, Swallow Barn, so it was a very hectic year!\"When it came to the photography stage, I didn’t even own a camera but over the course of a few weeks I gathered together the necessary equipment and transformed our little outside barn into a makesht photography studio. I would dedicate my weekends to baking and photographing, write recipes late into the night, and called on my design skills when it was time to put the book together. Thankfully my family supported me with their talents as Mummy is a fantastic home baker and Daddy is an expert in graphic design.\"The  or so simple recipes that made the final book are carefully arranged to reflect the feel and flavour of the four seasons. \"Through my writing I wanted to weave in some of the stories that conjure the charm of Granny’s quaint farmhouse, along with tales of my own childhood to show how the recipes are almost this living and changing thing. The recipes in Bread and Butter are there as a starting point to help you fall in love with simple, homemade food and bring the joy of baking to everyone’s table.\"Bread and Butter can be purchased from The Book Nook and The Dairy in Larne, Nook Living and The Secret Bookshelf in Carrickfergus, as well as in-store and online with Waterstones, Easons, Amazon, and WHSmith. It is also available with The Book Centres, who voted the collection as their Cookery Book of the Month for March.Since the books publication at the end of February, Ciara has appeared on Highland Radio, where she made pancakes on a live Zoom stream.She will also be in Waterstones, Ballymena on Saturday March  from .pm-.pm to sign copies of the book and offer a demonstration on icing biscuits just in time for Mother’s Day.Ciaras business, Swallow Barn can be found on Facebook and Instagram"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1646833844820.jpg--oftec_issues_home_heat_advice_as_fuel_poverty_rises.jpg?164683384600","title":"oftec issues home heat advice as fuel poverty rises ","story":"According to latest statistics, Northern Ireland is set to face a surge in the number of households in extreme poverty. The findings by the National Institute of Economic and Social Researchpredict that all regions in the UK will see extreme poverty rise by more than % in the coming year. According to the BBC, poverty levels in Northern Ireland are estimated to rise by a staggering % in the year ahead, bringing ‘the total number of destitute households to about ,.’ OFTEC, the trade association for the liquid fuel industry, is offering households advice on how to keep homes warm and costs low: Only heat the rooms you are using. Turn down inidual radiators in rooms you are not using to save money. If you have thermostatic radiator valves these can be lowered to number one for low background heating. Also, in the rooms you use regularly, ensure radiators are not blocked with furniture as this reduces their effectiveness. The temperature in hallways and bedrooms should be cooler, ideally between  –  degC for persons in good health. Turn the thermostat down by one degree. You can reduce your heating bill by up to % by lowering your room temperature by just one degree.  Identy the benefits available to you: The Government has introduced financial help including the Winter Fuel Payment. Those eligible could receive between pound and pound to help with heating bills. The deadline to make a claim for winter  to  is  March . Search NI Direct for further information. Energy Efficiency Upgrade: Check with your local councilyou qualy for the Affordable Warmth Scheme that aims to assist those in fuel poverty with boiler replacements upgrades and insulation measures. In addition, you can review the many grants that are available for energy upgrades as part of the NI Sustainable Energy Programme – this info can be found on the Utility Regulator’ website. Any energy efficiency improvement will reduce heat loss and save you money. Speak with your energy provider. Always speak with your distributor and agree a payment plan for your energy needs. We would always recommend you use a Member of the NI Oil Federation as their members have signed up to the Consumer Council’s Customer Charter which gives consumers a vehicle for redress should an issue arise. OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings said: “Living in a cold home can be both physically and mentally harmful. No one should have to decide between eating or staying warm, but that is the reality that many are now having to choose between. “We would urge the Government to consider that these are choices currently being faced, as the Decarbonising Heat Consultation approaches.  will be a decisive year that will outline how people will heat their homes going forward in efforts to reach net zero targets by . “Both the Republic of Ireland and England have actioned plans for decarbonising this sector already. Northern Ireland has the benefit of being in a position that allows us to review and reflect on these approaches. “In ROI, the Government are offering a grant of up to  per cent of a deep retrofit, however the average cost is €,, which leaves a large bill for the homeowner to finance, and we don’t see how the savings offered will cover the remaining payments. Similarly, England has offered a pound grant towards an air-source heat pump, however the total bill is expected to be between pound, and pound,. “At a time when households are feeling the pressures of rising costs, it would be unrealistic for the Northern Ireland Government to expect a similar approach to incentivise households to decarbonise. “Heat pumps and retrofitting will be the right choice for many living in a thermally efficient or recently built house, but for those facing financial dficulties and living in an older, colder home, there must be options considered that won’t leave them behind on the road to net zero. “Heating oil is currently used in over , homes in Northern Ireland. A recent analysis by the AECOM engineering company showed that biofuels in home heating could achieve similar emission reductions to retrofitting, but at a much lower cost. The current biofuel being touted as the replacement for kerosene is Hydrotreated Vegetable Oilthat offers an immediate c.% reduction in carbon emissions. “Our message to local Government would be to examine every option available, and to keep low carbon options and no regret pathways on the new Assemblys agenda when considering the heating consultation later this year. A one size fits all approach must be avoided.” For more information, visit https:www.oftec.org   addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_acecdbfde   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cfcffadd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
