Independent presidential candidate Jaime Rodriguez, known as \u0027El Bronco,\u0027 is pictured in AprilThis time around some supporters again fear that dirty tricks could be employed to keep him from office, even as authorities and outside observers say the possibility is remote.\u0027The chances of not winning exist because of the system that has in place for years,\u0027 said Antonio Lopez, a street vendor in Mexico City and Lopez Obrador supporter.Such fears have a basis in history. For most of the 20th century, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, dominated virtually all aspects of politics and held the presidency uninterruptedly for seven decades until 2000, and then regained it in 2012.Mexico\u0027s presidential election has been marred by violence this year, with Al Jazeera reporting that 534 politicians have been attacked since campaigning began in September and 130 politicians have been killed.More than 20,500 homicides have also been reported since the beginning of the year, with May coming in as the deadliest month with 4,381 murders.   Reporters without Borders and its Mexican partner, Propuesta Cívica, said that at least 45 journalists have complained to authorities about physical attacks, which were recorded between January and May.   \u0027It\u0027s very important for the Mexican authorities to sell specific measures of protection for journalists covering the electoral campaigns,\u0027 Emmanuel Colombié, the head of RSF\u0027s Latin America bureau, told Al Jazeera.           Mexico\u0027s presidential candidate Ricardo Anaya, standing for the Mexico al Frente coalition of the PAN-PRD-Movimiento Ciudadano parties, speaks to supporters\u0027As a reminder, Mexico is still one of the most dangerous countries in the world for the press. In 2017, 11 journalists were killed for direct connection to their activities. So far this year, we\u0027ve had five cases of journalists killed in the country,\u0027 he added. Dead people voting, vote-buying, theft or burning of ballots, threats of violence, rigged counting, particularly in remote areas - over the years it\u0027s all been seen.Obrador has run a values-based campaign extolling an anti-corruption message and a promise to clamp down on the deadly violence that has run roughshod over the country for years, mostly caused by ruthless drug-cartels.In 1998 opposition candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas had a narrow lead in early returns when the system for tabulating votes was said to have \u0027collapsed,\u0027 purportedly due to failure of phone lines which were used to report the count.After it came back online, the election went to ruling party candidate Carlos Salinas.For many, the moment exemplified the lengths to which the PRI would go to keep itself in power.

In 2010, more than 90 million minutes of phone calls was made, yet this was just 35 million last year.Despite the dramatic fall in the number of minutes which landlines were used for, more homes now have landlines in 2010 due to the need for broadband.Telecoms analyst for Enders Analysis, James Barford said: \u0027Because of the pricing structure most people have to have a landline to get broadband - but younger people often don\u0027t even plug in a handset.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/29/19/4DA9E9F300000578-0-Critics_accused_Meghan_Markle_of_disrespecting_the_Queen_when_sh-a-37_1530296527547.jpg","title":"I wanna hold hand Royal fans dismiss claims Meghan Markle faux pas","story":"    Meghan Markle has come under fire for allegedly trying to hold Prince Harry\u0027s hand during an event at Buckingham Palace on TuesdayAlthough there is no recorded rule that the married couple can\u0027t hold hands or touch in public, body language guru Robin Kermode said Meghan\u0027s move went against Royal orthodoxy.\u0027The Queen rarely holds hands with her husband in public and this seems to have set an unwritten precedent for the other royals,\u0027 he said. \u0027It is very clear that William and Kate are emotionally close, however, they do not seem to feel the need to prove their love — particularly when on official state business.\u0027 Even Princess Di had her bad days!

The best way to stop the leak would be to shut both main steam stops, which would halt the leak almost instantly.But that would come at a cost – a very big cost. If he did that, the nuclear reactor would be disabled and Revenge would be crippled, dead in the water.‘We would have to surface and signal for a tug,’ Thompson recalls in a book he has just published about his service in this most secretive branch of the Royal Navy.‘Unthinkable. Revenge was a Polaris missile submarine on Strategic Nuclear Deterrent patrol. She was the country’s duty guardian. Surfacing and calling for a tug would mean breaching one of the country’s most highly guarded secrets – where we were.’          NUCLEAR CRISIS: Senior engineer Eric Thompson aboard HMS RevengeHad that happened, the political ramifications would have been huge. With the then Labour Government facing noisy and insistent calls for unilateral disarmament, the image of a crippled nuclear-armed submarine being towed back from waters somewhere near the Soviet Union would have been humiliating and would have increased calls for an abandonment of Britain’s nuclear deterrent.The stakes for Thompson could not have been higher. He was damned one way and possibly killed the other. But then he had an idea, a way that could perhaps save both lives and national prestige. It would be a gamble, but he had nothing to lose.LAST month marked the 50th anniversary of the Royal Navy’s Submarine Service taking on the enormous burden of carrying Britain’s nuclear deterrent.On June 15, 1968, HMS Resolution slipped out of her dock at Faslane on the Clyde to start her first patrol. Resolution would be the first of four submarines in her class, and between them, from 1968 to 1996, they carried out an unbroken series of 229 Strategic Nuclear Deterrent patrols.For the entire duration, they were ready to fire their Polaris nuclear missiles at any target in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc at just 15 minutes’ notice. It was an extraordinary achievement, and it required extraordinary men and machines.Today, that duty is being carried out by the Navy’s four ageing Vanguard class submarines equipped with the Trident nuclear ballistic missile system, the fate of which is, of course, a political hot potato.Iain Ballantyne, author of The Deadly Trade: The Complete History Of Submarine Warfare From Archimedes To The Present, explains: ‘Paradoxically, the only way for Britain to have a voice in multilateral nuclear disarmament may be for it to build the new Dreadnought class submarines to give it the weight to demand an end to the nuclear balance of terror.‘What is deeply worrying is the current situation where Theresa May’s Government – and preceding Labour, Tory and Coalition administrations – have so weakened the nation’s conventional deterrent forces that nuclear weapons become the first resort – rather than the last resort – if the nation is faced with an existential threat from a nuclear-armed foe, such as Russia.’          Some crew members dressed in drag for the ship’s revues.

Eric Thompson once had to inform a chief petty officer his wife had left him, and to another, he had to break the news that his father had died. But there was once worse. On the night before Repulse finished one of its patrols, Commander Bob Seaward had to summon one of his crew to inform him his wife and child had been killed in a car crash seven weeks before.‘After more than ten weeks on patrol, that poor man would have been overjoyed at the prospect of a reunion with his wife and child the following day,’ Thompson observes, ‘only to be told they had been killed.’Deal of the century: UK defence firm BAE wins contract worth...Ex-head of the Armed Forces lashes Theresa May for...Surveillance splurge: Government spends $7 BILLION on six...Bomb squad is called to BAE Systems after suspicious item is...Share this articleIn order to break the monotony of life on board, various entertainments were laid on. Of course, the Polaris subs operated well before Kindles and tablets, and today the entertainments seems almost quaint.Men played games such as Ludo and cribbage, or watched one of the 56 films brought on board. Quizzes were a staple activity and some aspiring disc jockeys even used the sub’s sound system to inflict their favourite music on crewmates. Fitness fanatics could use rowing and cycling machines, lift weights and even play table tennis. More cerebral types studied for public exams.Even plays and revues were staged. The exhibition in Gosport shows that on one patrol, a group called the Polaris Players staged a show called A Deep Distraction, featuring morris dancing, a barber shop quartet, and even a group describing themselves as ‘Scottish opera’.Such theatrics provided an excuse for transvestism, and one snatched Polaroid shot shows a burly crew member in grotesque make-up, wearing lilac tights and a lurid green mesh top struggling to contain a false embonpoint the size of a couple of torpedoes.Eric Thompson recalls one such ‘lady’ being so attractive that pin-ups of him appeared all over the submarine. ‘It’s frightening what eight weeks without female company can do to a man’s judgment,’ Thompson reflects.Such antics were not the only eccentricities that crew members displayed. One commanding officer was known to take a sports jacket and flannel trousers on every patrol and after the Sunday morning service, he would put them on and have a picnic in a private corner of the submarine.Banter and high jinks were also staple fare. Men could find themselves unable to get out of their bunks because they had been trapped inside by a wall of parcel tape. Cigars – yes, smoking was allowed – were sometimes fitted with exploding tips. Sleeping bags were placed into the rubbish compactor and returned to their owners as tight cubes.Naturally, with so many confined in such a small space for weeks, personalities could clash and tempers could flare, but with training and officers keeping discipline, there is no account of things getting out of control. In the main, it appears the men looked out for each other, with many performing selfless tasks.One of the most remarkable in the eyes of Eric Thompson was the supreme act of valour carried out by a crewmate called Tom Chittenden, who went scuba ing in the sewage tank to unlock the valve that released its contents overboard. With all the toilets blocked, had he not succeeded, the results would have been unthinkable. ‘He should have received an honour for that,’ Thompson writes.Had Chittenden become ill as a result of his e, he would have been treated by the submarine’s doctor, qualified to carry out many life-saving operations, as well as keeping his eye on the mental health of the crew.However, if a crewman was critically ill, he would have to survive until the end of the patrol. If he did not, his body would be stored in the food freezers. Nothing, not even life, was more important than maintaining the country’s nuclear deterrent.Of course, it was that which united these men – their exceptional role as the Prime Minister’s trigger if he or she wanted to launch a nuclear strike against, in all likelihood, the Soviet Union. The submarine had to be ready at all times to fire its missiles and to keep the crew sharp, weapons systems readiness tests were carried out at random.When the orders for such tests came in, the crew had no way of knowing whether the test was the real thing, and it was not until the senior officers had decoded the full order that the crew would become aware they were not in fact consigning millions of people to their deaths.It is chilling to reflect that each submarine had more firepower than all the ammunition expended in the Second World War. Of course, no such order has ever been issued for real. However, what was frighteningly real was the situation faced by Eric Thompson back in June 1978, with the critical leak of high-pressure steam.With just seconds to spare, Thompson decided to take a gamble on what he later called an ‘obscure dockyard procedure never used at sea’. Too complex to explain here, Thompson’s gamble involved the equivalent of ‘emptying the domestic hot water tank straight into the toilet’.‘For what seemed like an eternity, nothing happened,’ he recalled.‘The roaring of the steam continued. The humidity was unbearable. Then there was a mighty whoosh down the starboard steam range behind my back. \u0027It was like letting go the neck of an inflated balloon. The boiler had been deflated. The roar of steam had stopped.’Although crisis had been averted, for the next eight weeks, the maximum speed was severely reduced and there would be no extra power to deal with any emergencies. Thankfully, none came.What Thompson soon discovered was that one of the crew had tried to squeeze through the jungle of pipework through the scalding steam to shut down the critical valve, but had been unable to make it.In doing so, he ripped his back open. Thompson recommended him for a medal and the crewman, James ‘Bungy’ McWilliams, was awarded the Queen’s Gallantry Medal.Although there was no chance of a nuclear meltdown or the Polaris missiles detonating, it had been a close-run thing. It was the nearest – as far as we know – that our nuclear ballistic submarines have come to a major disaster.Meanwhile, the four Resolution class submarines are lying in a dock at Rosyth on the Firth of Forth, waiting to be decommissioned in a process costing many millions that will last until 2040.Once the secret killers of the deep, they can now be easily seen with Google Earth. It seems an ignominious ending for these awesome instruments of Armageddon.On Her Majesty’s Nuclear Service, by Eric Thompson, is published by Casemate Publishers, priced £19.99.

Theresa May has summoned the Cabinet to her Buckinghamshire country retreat on Friday to thrash out  our demands from Brussels for our future relationship with the EUThe drama came amid growing fears in Downing Street that Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson could walk out of the Chequers meeting if he is forced to retreat from his Brexit \u0027red lines\u0027. However, sources close to Mr Johnson dismiss the notion as \u0027rubbish\u0027 saying: \u0027Boris knows that he is far more useful around the Cabinet table.\u0027Mrs May\u0027s Cabinet is already in the grip of what one source called a \u0027collective nervous breakdown\u0027, following a series of outbursts including Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson\u0027s attack on Mrs May for starving the military of funds and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss\u0027s criticism of Mr Gove for his environmental campaigns.Brexiteers who held meetings with No 10 last week say they are being pushed towards accepting that, post-Brexit, goods passing between EU countries will still be subject to the rules of the EU single market – which the EU currently only sanctions if its citizens can also move freely into the UK.A senior Brexit Tory said: \u0027If that happens, she\u0027s gone.\u0027 Downing Street moved quickly this weekend to try to calm nerves by insisting that Mrs May would never \u0027trade away\u0027 immigration controls.      Pictured: Former home secretary Amber Rudd I was Home Secretary last year when the UK fell victim to a spate of terrorist attacks after similar incidents in Belgium, France, and Germany.It felt relentless.It was a dangerous period, not only because of the attacks that got through but also because of the ones that were stopped – 16 since March last year alone.The trial against Khalid Ali – arrested in April last year for carrying knives in Whitehall – has recently concluded. I was in the Commons when that arrest happened. Parliament was briefly on lockdown that afternoon. It is now well known that Ali was a trained maker of IEDs.Each time an incident took place, other home secretaries from European countries offered condolences. I would do the same when an incident took place in their country. It mattered because we were all targets for the radical Islamist propaganda that was leading to this violence. We all are still. With European counterparts, I would share experiences about deradicalisation and how to limit access to weapons and stop convicted terrorists radicalising others in prison.But the most important part of protecting our citizens was about sharing data. The UK played a leading role in originating data programmes that allow countries to know more about who is coming into and moving within the EU. We should have no borders in data and intelligence sharing in protecting citizens.It would be madness if intransigence in Brussels led to this shared law enforcement being diluted as the UK leaves the EU, leading potentially to fatal events. Other EU home secretaries agree. I know a little about resignations – that would be the least of their problems.The UK is not threatening the EU Commission. Our offer to them on security co-operation is unconditional. Strong security is not a competition, it is a partnership.The Prime Minister is right. We must have a security treaty that builds on the UK\u0027s role in keeping all European citizens safe. We were ready and patient to make progress last year. Let\u0027s get on with it.

This could be bypassed at high speed, with power instead coming from a ramjet – a type of engine that uses its own forward motion to compress incoming air and generate thrust and is currently used in some missiles.Kevin Bowcutt, Boeing’s hypersonics chief, said: ‘We’re excited about the potential of hypersonic technology to connect the world faster than ever before.‘Supersonic isn’t really fast enough to go overseas and back in one day. For the business traveller or the military, that’s an interesting point. Mach 5 is where you can do that. Boeing is building upon a foundation of six decades of work designing, developing and flying experimental hypersonic vehicles.’Other groups – including Boeing’s Toulouse-based rival Airbus – are racing to bring back supersonic air travel.

Theresa May has summoned the Cabinet to her Buckinghamshire country retreat on Friday to thrash out  our demands from Brussels for our future relationship with the EUThe drama came amid growing fears in Downing Street that Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson could walk out of the Chequers meeting if he is forced to retreat from his Brexit \u0027red lines\u0027. However, sources close to Mr Johnson dismiss the notion as \u0027rubbish\u0027 saying: \u0027Boris knows that he is far more useful around the Cabinet table.\u0027Mrs May\u0027s Cabinet is already in the grip of what one source called a \u0027collective nervous breakdown\u0027, following a series of outbursts including Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson\u0027s attack on Mrs May for starving the military of funds and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss\u0027s criticism of Mr Gove for his environmental campaigns.Brexiteers who held meetings with No 10 last week say they are being pushed towards accepting that, post-Brexit, goods passing between EU countries will still be subject to the rules of the EU single market – which the EU currently only sanctions if its citizens can also move freely into the UK.A senior Brexit Tory said: \u0027If that happens, she\u0027s gone.\u0027 Downing Street moved quickly this weekend to try to calm nerves by insisting that Mrs May would never \u0027trade away\u0027 immigration controls.      Pictured: Former home secretary Amber Rudd I was Home Secretary last year when the UK fell victim to a spate of terrorist attacks after similar incidents in Belgium, France, and Germany.It felt relentless.It was a dangerous period, not only because of the attacks that got through but also because of the ones that were stopped – 16 since March last year alone.The trial against Khalid Ali – arrested in April last year for carrying knives in Whitehall – has recently concluded. I was in the Commons when that arrest happened. Parliament was briefly on lockdown that afternoon. It is now well known that Ali was a trained maker of IEDs.Each time an incident took place, other home secretaries from European countries offered condolences. I would do the same when an incident took place in their country. It mattered because we were all targets for the radical Islamist propaganda that was leading to this violence. We all are still. With European counterparts, I would share experiences about deradicalisation and how to limit access to weapons and stop convicted terrorists radicalising others in prison.But the most important part of protecting our citizens was about sharing data. The UK played a leading role in originating data programmes that allow countries to know more about who is coming into and moving within the EU. We should have no borders in data and intelligence sharing in protecting citizens.It would be madness if intransigence in Brussels led to this shared law enforcement being diluted as the UK leaves the EU, leading potentially to fatal events. Other EU home secretaries agree. I know a little about resignations – that would be the least of their problems.The UK is not threatening the EU Commission. Our offer to them on security co-operation is unconditional. Strong security is not a competition, it is a partnership.The Prime Minister is right. We must have a security treaty that builds on the UK\u0027s role in keeping all European citizens safe. We were ready and patient to make progress last year. Let\u0027s get on with it.

What’s the big deal?I was sitting around the house one evening when I suddenly wondered how tall Rock Hudson was.

She’ll go to Google, type in “What does a 50-year-old woman look like?” and summon pictures I can’t believe they allow on the internet, unlocked, where just anyone can see them. I don’t mean Playboy shots but the sort you’d find in Hustler. It’s as if she’d asked, “What does the inside of a 50-year-old woman look like?”I did the same search and got pictures of Meg Ryan and Brooke Shields, smiling.I said to my boyfriend Hugh, “This computer of mine is so… wholesome.”I said it again after looking up Rock Hudson. “How tall is…” I began, and before I could finish, Google interrupted me with “…Jesus?

But it’s Rock Hudson I was really curious about.Were Amy to open her laptop and type “How tall is…” Google would finish her question with “…Tom Hardy’s dick?” With mine, though, it’s Jesus, who they’re guessing came in at around six foot, which is ridiculous in my opinion. What are the odds that he was both tall and handsome? Is he described that way in the Bible? In some of the early northern European paintings, Christ looks like you flushed him out from under a bridge, but in Sunday-school books and the sorts of pictures they sell at Christian supply stores, he falls somewhere between Kenny Loggins and Jared Leto, always doe-eyed and, of course, white, with brown – not black – hair, usually wavy. And he always has a fantastic body, shown at its best on the cross, which – face it – was practically designed to make a man’s stomach and shoulders look good.What would happen, I often wonder, if someone sculpted a morbidly obese Jesus with titties and acne scars and hair on his back? On top of that, he should be short – five foot two at most. “Sacrilege!” people would shout. But why? Doing good deeds doesn’t make you good-looking. Take Jimmy Carter. Habitat For Humanity didn’t do a thing for those tombstonesize teeth of his. Or at least I remember his teeth as seeming pretty big. I should Google Image them. On Amy’s computer.At five-five, I never give much thought to my height until I do. Whenever I come across a man my size – at the airport, say, or in a hotel lobby – I squeak the way a one-year-old does when it spots a fellow baby. It’s all I can do not to toddle over and embrace the guy. Whenever I do say something – “Look, we’re the same height!” – it turns weird, though I don’t know why. Don’t fellow Porsche drivers acknowledge one another, or people walking the same breed of dog? With small straight men, I often get the feeling that they don’t want their shortness pointed out, that it’s like saying, “Look, I have a bald spot, too!”I want to ask the guys my size if, like me, they find themselves being hit up for money a lot. Hugh and I will walk through one city or another and, while he’ll advance down the sidewalk uninterrupted, I’ll get stopped again and again. “Can you give me a dollar? A cigarette? Whatever’s in that bag you’re holding?”It’s not that I have a particularly friendly face, so I have to assume that my stature has something to do with it, especially when the request becomes a demand. “I said, ‘Give me a dollar.’”“Would you be talking to me this way if I were taller than you?” I want to ask the 10-year-old with his hand out.I know that short straight men sometimes have it hard when it comes to finding a girlfriend, but I thought that for people like myself – “pocket gays,” we’re sometimes called – it was no hindrance. In retrospect, I guess I wasn’t paying much attention. The Washington Post has a regular feature in which they send two people out on a date and then check in to see how it went. Recently the couple was gay. Both stood more than six feet and listed in their “Deal-Breakers” box “short men”. They did not, I noticed, exclude white supremacists or machine-gun owners.Who wants to date you anyway? I wondered, scowling at the photos.I’m not one of those short men who feels he got shafted. Yes, it’s hard to buy things off the rack, but that’s what tailors are for. I fit easily into aeroplane seats. I can blend into crowds when I want to. Added height would be of no more use to me than a square head, so who needs it? I like knowing how tall other people are, though, especially celebrities. That’s why I Googled Rock Hudson, who, at six foot five, had every right to appear in Giant. He towered over his co-stars in that picture, but with other actors it’s hard to tell.I once asked someone in the movie business how tall Paul Newman was. This was back when he was still alive and before I had the internet. “Oh,” said this woman who’d worked with him on Mr \u0026amp Mrs Bridge, “he’s tiny.”“What does that mean?”“He’s a shrimp,” the woman said. “In photos he seems average enough, but in real life you practically need a microscope to see him.”“So he’s, like, the size of a flu germ?”“Just about,” she said. “I’d put him at around five-nine.”“I’m four inches shorter,” I told her, “so what does that make me?”“Well… you know,” she said.Before I learned to never, under any circumstances, read anything about myself, I’d occasionally stumble upon an interview I’d given. Then I’d recall the journalist who wrote it and mistakenly wonder what his or her writing was like. In Australia a few years back, I was surprised when a woman I’d very much enjoyed talking to described me as “bonsai-size”. This didn’t offend me. Rather, I was taken aback. She might have been an inch or two taller than me, but it’s not like I came to her knees or anything. I’ve been called “diminutive” as well, and “elfin”, as if I sleep in a teacup.A few years ago I opened a paper in Ottawa and saw that the journalist I’d spoken to the day before had described me as “slight and effeminate”. Really? I thought. The first adjective seemed fair enough, but the second one threw me. I know I cross my legs a lot, but I don’t think my walk is especially ladylike. I don’t wave my hands around when I talk or address anyone as “Miss Thing”. In the end I decided the word was more about him than it was about me. But isn’t it often that way?It’s one thing for someone to describe you in print, to go through several drafts and, after careful consideration, choose the adjective “Lilliputian” over, say, “pint-size”. It’s another thing when they blurt it out. “You horrible little man,” an Englishwoman once said after I’d written something she didn’t like in her book. In 1987, while I was home for Christmas, my sister Tiffany got into a fight with my sister Gretchen. I came in at the very end, just as it was breaking up, and when I asked what was going on, Tiffany said, “Why don’t you go back to your room and write some more about being a faggot?”How long has that been in there? I wondered. It’s scary the things that come out when you’re mad at someone. Some years back at a small airport in Wisconsin, a TSA agent ordered me to take off my vest. “I’ve been wearing this for three weeks,” I told her. “Every day I’ve traveled to a different city, and this is the first time I’ve been asked to remove it.”The woman was maybe 10 years older than me, which at the time would have put her in her early 60s. Her dyed hair was cut short and was carefully styled in a way that made me think of chocolate cake frosting. “I want it off now!” she barked.“It must be nice to hold such an important position,” I wanted to say as I started undoing the buttons. Then I thought of how snobbish that sounded and was ashamed of myself. Here I was, angry, and my first instinct was to attack her job – her class, really. Have I always been this person? I wondered as I walked through the archway in my stocking feet. What does it mean that my second option, “I’m so glad you’re not my grandmother,” wasn’t much better?I later wondered how this woman might have described me and realized that all she needed to say was “the jerk in the vest”. Actually, in this context, the word “jerk” is unnecessary. As with “the guy in the white boots”, I think it’s already implied. I mean, really, a vest! What was I thinking? It wasn’t the kind that came with a suit but rather a “worker’s vest”, modeled on one from the nineteenth century, with pockets for all my mule-skinning tools.She also might have described me as “the gay guy”. While this doesn’t bother me, I don’t think of it as the cornerstone of what I am. Given all my current options, I think I prefer “the little guy”. Who wants to waste his time bothering a person like that? So tiny. So inconsequential.

He teaches creative writing at the Institute of American Indian Arts and his debut novel, There There (Harvill Secker, £14.99), is a New York Times bestseller.There There is about urban Native American lives. Are these lives and experiences under-represented in fiction?Yes, you already find Native people in fiction, but there aren’t many representations of us as modern, contemporary and living in cities, so that was definitely something I saw lacking.What made you decide to have 12\u0026nbspnarrators?I really liked what a chorus of voices\u0026nbspcould do. I like, within a novel, to jump around and see how the different voices connect. It gives\u0026nbspthe reader a lot to do. And when the reader gets the connection, something really special happens: like a clicking in place. It gives it a kind of propulsion and makes it a really active reading experience.Did you also want to portray as many different Native urban experiences as you could?I guess so. There’s a monolithic version of what a Native is supposed to be. Writing a polyphonic, multigenerational novel is resisting this one idea of what being Native is supposed to look like. If we all have to be historical, with a headdress, looking off into the distance, that’s hopeless as far as building a proper, complex, human identity.Many of your characters are deeply troubled. Why?I wanted to write characters that felt true and real, and there’s a lot of harrowing detail about the lives\u0026nbspof Native people. You can just look at the health statistics and they’re pretty staggering. I wanted the characters to be working-class,\u0026nbspbecause so often the characters in novels that I’ve read are white and upper-middle-class with white, upper-middle-class problems. I didn’t want to go anywhere near the old romanticised\u0026nbspview of the Indian as the warrior, the powerful, the unflinching, the brave. That just doesn’t feel whole to me.The title is taken from a Gertrude Stein quote: “There is no there there.” What’s the significance of that quote?In Stein’s Everybody’s Autobiography, she talks about how someone was asking her what it’s like to come back to her childhood home in Oakland, where I also come from, and she says, “There is no there there.” She was talking about how it had been developed over and was unrecognisable. I was using that as a parallel to Native experience and the “there there” of the land before\u0026nbspit\u0026nbspwas colonised, developed over and\u0026nbspbordered.The novel explores what it means\u0026nbspto\u0026nbspbe\u0026nbspNative American today. What does\u0026nbspit mean for you?It’s meant a lot of different things over the years. Currently it means going back to see my dad, who lives in Oklahoma now, and slowly\u0026nbsptrying\u0026nbspto learn the language,\u0026nbspbecause while he’s fluent\u0026nbsphe didn’t raise us with it. It means making sure my son knows\u0026nbspthat he’s Native too. It’ll keep\u0026nbspmeaning more things along the way.Why didn’t your dad teach you the language?There’s a lot of pain related to the past, and I think he was wanting a fresh start, wanting to raise us in Oakland and have us figure it out for ourselves. I think if we had been born in the 21st century to a dad who was fluent in Cheyenne, we probably would have been taught it from an early age. But my dad had a lot of pain in his childhood. It was a time of assimilation.Which writers have most influenced your writing?Clarice Lispector was a pretty big influence. Also, Andrei Platonov, Denis Johnson, Louise Erdrich, Roberto Bolaño, Haruki Murakami.What’s the book you most like to give to people as a gift?Clarice Lispector’s The Hour of the Star.Is there a classic that you’re ashamed not to have read?I skipped a lot of the classics because I didn’t read in school, and I don’t really feel like I’m missing out. Sometimes I’ll try to go back and read older stuff, but I get really bored with old voices.What’s next up on your reading list?I’m reading a book by Katherena Vermette called The Break and it’s been compared to mine because it has a whole bunch of different voices: it’s urban and it’s Native but it’s set in Winnipeg.Given that publishing is historically white and middle-class, do you think it’s an ongoing challenge to get more erse voices into fiction?There’s a change going on and it’s related to Trump. People are coming to terms with a really ugly, white supremacist, racist side to our country and our history, and so I think although publishing’s still super-white, there’s a lot of people wanting to bring in erse voices. The fear for me is that if we don’t change the institution of whiteness in the publishing industry as a whole, the trend will change and there’ll be a backlash. You know, you have people like Lionel Shriver who are claiming that ersity over excellence is harming literature as a whole, as if the erse voices that are being heard right now are only getting published because of their ersity. It’s so depressing to hear that because as a person of colour publishing now, there’s always the fear of tokenism and this fear that you’re not being published on the merit of your work. And then you hear people like Shriver and you think: “Yeah, that’s what we suspected.”•\u0026nbspThere There\u0026nbspby Tommy Orange is published by Harvill Secker (£14.99).

Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies had way outsold my previous books even before the shortlist. But after the wins, overseas deals multiplied rapidly and the effect bounced along to my backlist. So your previous career is recast, and all your work re-evaluated – both in a marketing sense, and a literary sense.The prize has been nothing but good to me, but I can see that it might be destabilising. Big opportunities open up. It would be possible to spend years floating around the world showing off, and to become a professional winner instead of a professional writer. I imagine also that panic could strike. Luckily for me, I was held safe, because I was committed to a trilogy. So neither in 2009 or in 2012 did I have to ask myself, “What do I do now?”Having been a judge as well as a contender, I know about the vast burden of reading, the chancy and nervous nature of the process, and how much depends on the dynamics of the final meeting. It may be skill that gets you to the shortlist stage, but we winners should remember that we have had a bit of luck, too. It’s important to get back to your desk, sit down in a spirit of humility, and – if you aim to flourish after the prize – learn all over again how to fail.1969:\u0026nbspSomething to Answer For by PH Newby1970:\u0026nbspThe Elected Member by Bernice Rubens\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspTroubles by JG Farrell1971:\u0026nbspIn a Free State by VS Naipaul1972:\u0026nbspG by John Berger1973:\u0026nbspThe Siege of Krishnapur by JG Farrell1974:\u0026nbspThe Conservationist by Nadine Gordimer\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspHoliday by Stanley Middleton1975:\u0026nbspHeat and Dust by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala\u0026nbsp1976:\u0026nbspSaville by David Storey1977:\u0026nbspStaying On by Paul Scott1978:\u0026nbspThe Sea, the Sea by Iris Murdoch1979:\u0026nbspOffshore by Penelope Fitzgerald1980:\u0026nbspRites of Passage by William Golding1981:\u0026nbspMidnight’s Children by Salman Rushdie1982:\u0026nbspSchindler’s Ark by Thomas Keneally1983:\u0026nbspLife and Times of Michael K by JM Coetzee1984:\u0026nbspHotel du Lac by Anita Brookner1985:\u0026nbspThe Bone People by Keri Hulme1986:\u0026nbspThe Old Devils by Kingsley Amis1987:\u0026nbspMoon Tiger by Penelope Lively1988:\u0026nbspOscar and Lucinda by Peter Carey1989:\u0026nbspThe Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro1990:\u0026nbspPossession by AS Byatt\u0026nbsp1991:\u0026nbspThe Famished Road by Ben Okri1992:\u0026nbspThe English Patient by Michael Ondaatje\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspSacred Hunger by Barry Unsworth1993:\u0026nbspPaddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha by Roddy Doyle1994:\u0026nbspHow Late It Was, How Late by James Kelman1995:\u0026nbspThe Ghost Road by Pat Barker1996:\u0026nbspLast Orders by Graham Swift\u0026nbsp1997:\u0026nbspThe God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy1998:\u0026nbspAmsterdam by Ian McEwan1999:\u0026nbspDisgrace by JM Coetzee2000:\u0026nbspThe Blind Assassin by Margaret Atwood2001:\u0026nbspTrue History of the Kelly Gang by Peter Carey2002:\u0026nbspLife of Pi by Yann Martel2003:\u0026nbspVernon God Little by DBC Pierre2004:\u0026nbspThe Line of Beauty by Alan Hollinghurst2005:\u0026nbspThe Sea by John Banville2006:\u0026nbspThe Inheritance of Loss by Kiran Desai\u0026nbsp2007:\u0026nbspThe Gathering by Anne Enright2008:\u0026nbspThe White Tiger by Aravind Adiga2009:\u0026nbspWolf Hall by Hilary Mantel2010:\u0026nbspThe Finkler Question by Howard Jacobson2011:\u0026nbspThe Sense of an Ending by Julian Barnes2012:\u0026nbspBring Up the Bodies by Hilary Mantel2013:\u0026nbspThe Luminaries by Eleanor Catton2014:\u0026nbspThe Narrow Road to the Deep North by Richard Flanagan2015:\u0026nbspA Brief History of Seven Killings by Marlon James2016:\u0026nbspThe Sellout by Paul Beatty2017:\u0026nbspLincoln in the Bardo by George SaundersI’ve always believed that literary prizes should be for the encouragement of the young, and the consolation of the old. In the middle stretch, you should just get on with it. So winning the Man Booker in my mid-60s was indeed a consolation – also a relief (I’d been shortlisted in each of the preceding three decades), but mainly a simple pleasure. I knew there was no danger of it changing the way I might write, and little (I hoped) of it going to my head. My old friend Ian McEwan warned me a few days afterwards: “By the way, you’ll find that from now on you’re no longer ‘the novelist Julian Barnes’ – you’ve been transformed into ‘the Booker prize-winning novelist Julian Barnes’.” This has indeed proved the case, but it’s hardly much of a burden.The highlights of that evening in 2011? A kind friend assuring me as I sat down to dinner: “We’ll love you just as much if you don’t win.” (And me asking her jauntily two hours later, “So do you love me more now?”) My (female, British) publisher jumping into my lap a few milliseconds after the announcement. My (male, American) publisher instantly tapping into his iPhone instructions to up the print run for the forthcoming American edition. Then a general soppy warmth towards everyone in the Guildhall: the judges, my fellow shortlistees, waiters, interviewers – even the journalist overheard before the press conference boasting to a chum that “I’m going to ambush him with The Martin Amis Question”. Nothing could shake my absurd, if logical, good humour. I was overfamiliar with the downside of not winning the Booker, and could see no downside at all to finally winning it.It was an evening with especially good flower arrangements in 2000, the year I won. I’d been nominated for The Handmaid’s Tale (too feminist), Cat’s Eye (too provincial) and Alias Grace (too colonial), and it seemed that I was in the Beryl Bainbridge category – always a bridesmaid but never a bride. In fact she and I had a contest going, who could be nominated the most without winning? When I actually did win, my first thought was “My new shoes are too tight”, because now I would have to walk in them to get photographed and so forth.I probably shouldn’t have said that my earliest literary influence was Beatrix Potter – however true – but as I wasn’t expecting to win, I had no speech prepared. I was of course thrilled and grateful, but also I was simply relieved: I would not have to return to Canada to a reproachful but gleeful media chorus of “Atwood Fails to Win Booker”, as if it were a horse race. It’s much more like Best Pumpkin in Show: the pumpkin does nothing.If there’s such a thing as a Man Booker experience I’ve drunk deep on it. Overlooked, infuriated, longlisted, shortlisted, victorious, overjoyed. I lost friends when I won. Not for winning but for reneging, as they saw it, on my earlier infuriation. Naive of them. If you are angry with a prize that doesn’t seem to value the sort of novels you write you are bound to change your tune when it does.I got lucky with the judges – three women and two men of rare discernment and a sense of humour. Of course I thought myself deserving, but justice is no more than the dice rolling in your favour. Losing had been equally arbitrary.Winning opened doors I thought were shut forever. Overnight, offers came in from foreign publishers, even publishers in Israel who until then had largely ignored my work on the grounds, they told my agent, that it was too Jewish.How Jewish is too Jewish? There’s an argument that the fathers of the novel are Homer and the Old Testament, the Old Testament being responsible for the jokes. That being the case, all novels are Jewish in the disputatious, dialogic sense. If I didn’t expect The Finkler Question to win – and my mother was so convinced it wouldn’t I suspect she went to William Hill and bet against it – that was because I feared it was too overtly Jewish. Which goes to show you never know. Thus my only advice to aspirants to the prize: don’t try to write a Man Booker book. Leave it to the dice. And remember to be graceful in victory. We need all the help we can get.One of the most useful things said to me after the Man Booker came from my medical sister, who looked at me with a cool, diagnostic eye and said, “I usually advise people not to make any major decisions until six months after a life changing event.” I didn’t know my life had changed, I just knew that it was hard to get back to the desk. This was not part of the fantasy of the night, of course. I saw the cameraman lining up a shot on me and thought he was aiming at Ian McEwan, who was sitting over my left shoulder. When the announcement came, I expected a name, but the chairman of the judges read out the title of a book, and it took me a long second to realise that I had written this book. I told all this to a local audience in Dublin the other day and they just loved it: the fantasy of being the chosen one is incredibly strong. But if I am proud, it is of one fact: The Gathering is not just one of the minority of books written by a woman to claim the prize, it is also one of the very few to have a female narrator – perhaps five out of the 50 – and I am happy to have beaten those odds.When I was shortlisted for Illywhacker in 1985 I had never read in public in my life. I was terrified that I would win and therefore have to make a speech. For two days I calmed myself by imagining Doris Lessing or Keri Hulme would win. That worked, for my nerves, and for Keri Hulme as well.When, three years later, I was shortlisted for Oscar and Lucinda I was a different man, not quite ready to punch the air or throw myself on the floor, but confident I would not lose my voice if called on to speak.What I said is fortunately forgotten but I accepted the nice cheque and slipped it in my rented tux. It was only after this, when I had the money in my pocket, that I discovered there was something ahead, more overwhelming than a speech.Oscar and Lucinda had been my fourth publication. I had already done many interviews, I thought. I had been photographed more than was decent. But nothing in my previous life prepared me for what followed. I mean my body had known nothing like these apocalyptic flashbulbs, relentless probes, strobes, questions left, right and over there. I was over the moon. I said I was. I was proud. I said that, too. Others were proud, my whole country even. What did I feel? What did I think? Was I happy? In those hours of media triumph and celebration, while my publishing life changed for ever, the cruellest trick of all was how numb I felt. I had to wait three days, for a stranger to hail me in the arrivals hall of Sydney airport, to really feel the thrill: “Good on you, mate. Well done.”I really didn’t think I was going to win. So much so that I didn’t even write a speech. I was so convinced another book was the winner that right before the announcement I set off to the bathroom, only to be met by two near panicking members of the dinner staff who had run after me. They marched me right back to my seat. The journalist beside me knew I had won and tried to impress on me that I really should write a speech, to which I politely but firmly said no.I was stunned when Michael Wood called my name. You really do slip outside yourself for a second, the way you do with any extreme experience, whether fear, pain, joy or heartbreak. I bumbled through a speech where I think I mentioned my father way too much, and then told people all the reasons why my book was not easy. I wonder if “not easy” referred more to the writing of it than the reading of it.Hilary Mantel wrote a brilliant and hilarious article about not winning awards, which I had read at least three times, mostly in an attempt to get accustomed to not winning. I watched clips of Maggie Smith playing an actor who did not win the Academy award. Because honestly, I never win anything. You try not to be bitter about it, but who are we fooling? “It was an honour to be nominated” can sound as hollow as you think it would.Except that it’s not hollow. No disrespect to the winners at all, but my most surprising reading experiences have come from the shortlist (Monica Ali, for example) and the longlist, (Timothy Mo, for example). So I had come to a quite beautiful moment of acceptance that I was about to join some truly esteemed company. But then I won.Does the winning author ever know the result before it’s officially announced? Not in my year, though there was a clue: the cameras seemed to be focusing more on the winning table. I remember saying to my publisher, “I think we’ve done it!” After that, my memories are a blur of radio and TV interviews and a bank of cameras with flashing blue lights and voices calling out of the darkness, “Look this way!” “Over here!” You feel like a rabbit caught in the headlights.Winning the Booker changes everything. In its power to transform a career it’s more like winning an Oscar than another literary prize. I was always aware of the luck element. A different set of judges might well have chosen another book. The question is, how do you react to your sudden (though shortlived!) fame? Embrace it, wallow in it or run away from it as fast as you can? I ran. As soon as I could, I went home and settled down to being the unsuccessful author of the next book. Though even that wasn’t easy. You’re always aware that the next book will receive more critical scrutiny than any previous book has done and that can be inhibiting. But even sitting in front of a blank screen tearing my hair out I was always grateful to have won.In recent years I’ve become more aware of a downside to the Booker prize-winning label. Too many intelligent, enthusiastic readers take it as a sign the book will be above their heads, and yet many of these books – the shortlisted as much as the winners – are brilliantly accessible. “Give it a go,” you want to say, “You never know, you might be missing a good read.”On the day of the award in 2005, I flew into London from Philadelphia at 6am. I had long before arranged to be in America at that time, as no one, especially myself, had the slightest expectation that my novel would even reach the shortlist. When it did get on, it became imperative that I attend the award dinner, in the fear that if they knew I would not be coming the jury would take offence – though even the notion that I might win made everyone put on a straight face and try not to laugh.I came back to the UK alone, with a return flight to New York arranged for the next day at 10.30am – bad taste for a loser to hang about any longer than necessary. But what, I wondered, could I possibly do with this day, a whole day, on my own in London? I determined that I must not drink – I had made a great mistake in that regard when I was on the shortlist in 1989 – so I simply strolled about the city in the October sunshine, looking in the shop windows at all the things I would no more be able to afford tomorrow than I was today.As the afternoon grew late, and the dreaded dinner hour approached, I found myself in St James’s Park, standing by the little lake there, idly watching five pure white waterbirds fighting with a duck over a crust of bread. The duck won. I took it for an omen, and went off to put on my black tie.At lunchtime, on the day of the Booker dinner, my husband said: “I don’t think you’re going to win, but, just in case, perhaps you’d better think of something to say.” Wise words, as it turned out. I wasn’t the favourite, so the advice I would give to anyone shortlisted would be the same: the Booker is nicely unpredictable, so it may turn out to be you, even if they are all saying that is unlikely. And remember, anyway, that there is no such thing as a best book, merely one on which a group of people have been able to reach agreement.Life after the Man Booker meant a couple of years and more when it was difficult to do what I wanted to do, which was get on with some writing. There was much book-related travel, too much time in airports, too many events. All that is 30 years ago now, and in a way I am quite grateful for the travel: it means that one of the satisfactions of old age is the thought that I shall never see Heathrow again. I have had all the travel I want or need.Once the searchlight is turned on others, your take on the Man Booker is that of any reader – the revelation of books you might not otherwise have come across, and will now read. That is the value of the shortlist (longlist, too) – a swathe of books are highlighted for readers. For me, though, there are also the ones that got away that should have won. Two, to my mind: Adam Thorpe’s Ulverton and Carol Shields’s The Stone Diaries.You take a young poet and novelist flaming with hunger and obscurity and dreams, you put him through the rigours of the short-story form, you unleash him on a novel he had been secretly writing for years, and you gift him with a strange magical night at the Guildhall in October 1991, and what do you get?You first get shock, surprise, retreat, delight, celebration, partying, making up for the hunger years, excessive travel, an explosion of readership, the opening up of the magic casement of African writing, a very English lingering backlash, many beautiful friendships, an initial stunned hiatus in writing followed by a steady, quiet harvest, opportunities for constant literary and spiritual growth, much conflicting criticism, an ebb and flow of fortunes, some smouldering resentment, the curious compliment of being plagiarised, publication in many languages, undue expectation followed by a rush to declare disappointment, many St Sebastian-like arrows patiently and humorously borne, love and kindness directed at me from ever renewing sources, and an abiding, never faltering gratitude for the fact that regardless of how my books are received or not received the flame and the hunger and the dreams are still there, enriched by that destiny-altering night at the Guildhall in 1991.For a participant, one thing the Man Booker prize is strange for is that your days of feverish writing can be two or more years behind you. There’s an extreme Doppler shift: you didn’t write the book with a view to later competing with others. You suddenly find yourself not only in competition but given odds at the bookies (I put a tenner on myself as if I were a horse – you just have to). As if runners ran a race against themselves, and judges were convened years later in a different place or you worked up the strength to lob a bowling ball up an alley over the horizon, and by the time you got over the rise you saw that agents and publishers had kept the thing rolling on. The night itself is numbing. The shortlist is the realistic prize. I don’t know how possible it is to find a single winner among artworks. From the perspective of the dinner table on the night you quickly realise the show’s set up for TV. I remember being told to expect one of five roving cameras in my face as the winner was announced. Those are the cameras that catch your reaction when someone else wins. Only five of them, as the winner will go to the stage. I spotted the cameras early. Watched them wait for the announcement and lived a very long split-second as I realised none were coming to me •"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/454fd648524d97a12aa73d302cd96d410cf437bc/1_0_5200_3121/master/5200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=503ac523343049412712cbedcf6736be","title":"quiz how well do you know business jargon","story":"Want to get soaked in a thought shower?

The pretend landlord of the Queen Vic has figured this out“It’s getting tickly now,” Alex Ferguson famously observed during a title run-in. “Squeaky bum time, I call it.” This was in 2003, seven years after arguably the definitive Premier League bum-squeak. More of a follow-through, in fact, as the then Newcastle manager, Kevin\u0026nbspKeegan, succumbed to his now legendary Ferguson-induced rant. “I will love it if we beat them – love\u0026nbspit!” he frothed, of Manchester United. The rest, of\u0026nbspcourse, is history.To watch Theresa May come out of this week’s EU summit with just six weeks of negotiating time left on the Brexit clock, and declare the EU was risking the lives of its citizens by not striking a security deal with her, was to experience a similar look-away moment. The prime minister is this close to jabbing her finger at the camera and declaring the EU27 have got to go to Middlesbrough and get something. Of the many roles in which May has cruelly miscast herself, that of crap blackmailer is the most excruciating.Still, what happened at the business end of things – the by now traditional bit of an EU summit where May has to leave while the other countries talk about the important stuff? Pas devant les enfants, as my grandmother used to say. In summary, they seem to have\u0026nbspcome to a tentative arrangement on migration. And the EU’s Michel Barnier appears to be broadly in agreement with the Queen Vic’s Danny Dyer.Look, without wishing to involve you in what might sarcastically be described as “my process”, I no longer remark that things are “sentences I never expected to type”. We passed the Typed Lands in 2016. Wherever this place is, this is normal. Nor does my keyboard raise so much as a ??? to report that the prime minister’s official spokesman was today formally asked if the prime minister concurred with EastEnders actor Dyer that her predecessor, David Cameron, was “a twat”. This is where we live now. Try not to choke on it.If you haven’t seen Dyer’s outburst on ITV’s Good Evening Britain, I urge you to take 36 seconds to do so. As fellow studio guests including Pamela Anderson and Jeremy Corbyn cock their heads thoughtfully, Danny begins by observing that Brexit is a riddle. “So what’s happened to that twat David Cameron, who called it on?” he wonders. The inquiry turns out to be rhetorical, as the Real Football Factories legend expands: “He’s in Europe, in Nice with his trotters up, yeah? Where is the geezer?! I\u0026nbspthink he should be held account for it. He should be held account for it.”As the producers pan out to get reaction shots from\u0026nbspstudio guests such as Harry Redknapp and the Conservative party deputy chairman, James Cleverly – like I said, this is where we live now – Dyer can be heard lobbing in a final “Twat”. Speak for England, Danny! Or rather, speak for south-east metropolitan centres, Scotland and Northern Ireland! The rest think you’re the\u0026nbsptwat, but that’s showbiz.Wherever you stand on Brexit, though, we can at least\u0026nbspthank Dyer for his hilarious addition to Westminster’s annals of quotable quotes. God knows, they can always use the material. I was reminded this week that Neil Hamilton once won the Spectator’s Parliamentary Wit of the Year – an award that certainly puts Nigel Mansell winning Sports Personality\u0026nbspof the Year twice into perspective.Danny’s latest pensée is easily as amusing as his rumination on the 11th anniversary of the attack on the World Trade Center. “Can’t believe it’s been nearly 11 years since them slags smashed into the twin towers,” this ran. “Still freaks my nut out to this day.”It is, however, not as amusing as the big-hitting Brexiters and four-star political commentators who have spent the hours since Dyer’s Brexit communique mobilising to condemn the reaction to it. Why are people listening to an actor, wonder various sorts who take themselves rather too seriously. I don’t know, guys – but let’s face it, they’ll probably have better luck down the bookies than if they listen to newspaper columnists.Why is his ghastly swearing being lionised, runs another line of inquiry. That I do know\u0026nbspthe answer to – it’s because it’s funny. And at this\u0026nbspstage in the Brexit U-bend, arguably the best we can hope for is a shit deal on\u0026nbspservices and a cheap giggle. Contrary to what half you lot told us, they can’t do us a bespokehaute-couturered-white-and-bluemoney-spraying Brexit. The pretend landlord of the Queen Victoria pub appears\u0026nbspto have figured this out, and is trying to salvage a point from the tie. Why haven’t you?Chiefly amusing, however, is the erstwhile Danny\u0026nbspDyer’s Deadliest Men presenter scooping David\u0026nbspCameron on his own memoirs. I don’t know what\u0026nbspthe former prime minister has been tossing off in his £25,000 shepherd’s hut over the past 23 months, but\u0026nbspI can already tell you it will lack the sparse precision of Dyer’s summary. In fact, if they want it to sell the book to people other than nerdy completists like me, then the publishers should consider running Danny’s precis as a cover quote. I’ve no idea what the book’s title will be – let’s hope it’s one of Cameron’s catchphrases, like It Was The Right Thing To Do – but I’d love to see the words “Twat … Danny Dyer” emblazoned above the\u0026nbsptitle, to bring in the punters.As for how Theresa May will characterise the coming summer of heatwaves and cabinet warfare in her own eventual memoirs, who can say? But with the UK’s chief Brexit negotiator privately warning there are just six weeks to go before both sides are required to sign a final deal, the situation must – in the words of the Chips Channon de nos jours – be freaking her absolute nut out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32e042e9c82ab1b8fb68001046f1344d449c36c6/0_261_4192_2515/master/4192.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a96abd48d90551299444d68fb2987ea8","title":"graham brady comment tory ministers unite brexit","story":"Disunity at the top makes the PM’s job more difficult as she negotiates with Brussels – and could put Jeremy Corbyn into No 10King Sisyphus cleverly cheated death but was punished with eternal labour: pushing a boulder up a mountain just to see it roll down again. Theresa May might have empathised as she approached yet another EU summit this week. Her seemingly endless task is to deliver an orderly departure from the European Union, with no overall majority in Parliament and in the teeth of opposition from some who still delude themselves that the referendum vote can be ignored. The PM is winning considerable support in the country for her determined perseverance.Unpicking four decades of EU law and regulation so closely entwined with our own statute was always going to be complicated. The arithmetic of this parliament makes it doubly so. The main opposition party might have offered much the same prescription for leaving the Single Market and the Customs Union when it was seeking votes at last year’s general election, but Labour has played all the slippery games of opposition ever since.Governments expect to have to navigate around the traps and obstacles laid for them from the other side of the house. It is harder to see how anyone on the government side can think it is in the national interest to send Mrs May to negotiate the best future relationship with the EU with anything less than a united team behind her.Securing the passage of the European Union withdrawal act after hundreds of hours of parliamentary debate was a moment of huge significance: it provides for the end of the supremacy of EU law in the UK and allows a smooth transition by transposing existing EU law into our own domestic statute.Over the past couple of weeks, most Conservative backbench MPs who have had particular concerns about our exit from the EU have recognised the need to compromise and support this central element of the government’s programme: allowing the prime minister to go off to Brussels with a solid – if not resounding – vote of confidence from the House of Commons. This was built on as the government settled 50 years of dithering over airport capacity in the south-east, securing a majority of 296 for a new runway at Heathrow: supported by more Labour MPs than voted with their leadership to oppose it. This too is a ringing endorsement of our commitment to a future as a global trading nation.So, backbench MPs on the government side have seen the importance of unity in the national interest. Even an increasing number of Labour members have been prepared to recognise that we are dealing with issues that are far bigger than party politics. It is all the more remarkable, therefore, that it has been so difficult to maintain discipline around the cabinet table.Our system of government has been built on a long tradition of collective responsibility – lively debate behind closed doors followed by ministers coalescing around the agreed position. As we move into the final stages of our efforts to agree a close cooperative relationship with the EU after Brexit, it has never been more important for ministers to observe the cardinal rule of cabinet government.The danger of disunity at the top is not just that it makes the prime minister’s job more difficult in negotiations with Brussels, and therefore puts at risk the good Brexit deal that is in reach, but it also gives an impression of ision to the country. Electorates these days are volatile, but one thing is certain: they do not vote for ided parties. They rejected decisively the ided Tory party in 1997. If we were to let Labour in again, it would be a disaster for this country.It’s not just backbench Conservative MPs who expect ministers to pull together behind May: the great swathe of the electorate which either voted Leave, or voted Remain but recognises that a united team will achieve a better trading relationship for the future than a ided one, expects it too.• Graham Brady is chairman of the 1922 committee"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83ccb04dab55324ceb961a8dcffc52ed60e9cf65/0_213_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9abe197f96e10a3d337f58cd4da27419","title":"moving to ireland means remaining in the european union","story":"The day we left London, torrential rain battered our belongings that waited forlornly beside an 18-tonne truck.

So we arrived in Co Kilkenny 12 hours ahead of them, and sat on some borrowed plastic garden chairs, waiting.“Stop telling people we’ve bought a farm,” my bloke keeps saying. “It’s a farmhouse.

I am a person who once had Amazon Prime Now deliver extra provisions in the middle of a dinner party – so sue me.But then we got older, and so did our loved ones, and many of them are in the Republic of Ireland. And then, the killer blow: the Republic of Ireland is in the European Union, and our country, through a combination of hilarious mishaps and outright swindles, is about not to be. In the words of the old commercial for the Irish lager Harp, time for a sharp exit.Actually, it was anything but sharp: several years of waiting for circumstances to align perfectly, then the realisation that they never would and that we just had to make the leap. Thus, we find ourselves engaged in a little light commuting, which itself tees up an interesting process of compare-and-contrast. In Ireland, things that I had no reason to notice throughout years of visiting suddenly present themselves as unromantic daily facts: privatised rubbish collection, more limited booze-buying hours in supermarkets, a marked absence of public transport.But they are as nothing to the delights of small-town and rural life. The shebeen – put simply, a pub in someone’s house – at the end of the road, the only place of entertainment within walking distance, is open four nights a week. And when I say “nights”: it starts up around 10pm and serves until 3am. If the owners aren’t about, they leave an outside light on to let you know it’s fine to go in and help yourself. In the proper pubs in town (use of the word “village” is a very specific business here, and quite unlike the Cotswolds definition), you can buy shotgun cartridges and rat poison along with your pint.At Christmas a few years ago, my roiling Irish adopted family persuaded me and my English father that a complicated-looking tool on the wall of the pub was what farmers used for trepanning sheep suffering from the gid, a brain disease. It turned out to be a standard gouge. Now, I am making arrangements to have my own hay\u0026nbspbaled.I fear terribly that I will become the ex-city dweller of Stewart Lee’s comedy sketch, begging friends to come to visit, promising horses at the end of the garden and finally plaintively requesting they bring cocaine. I am already cross that I can’t access the BBC iPlayer, and that my favourite online makeup company doesn’t deliver to the ROI.But what’s more likely is that I try to out-Irish the Irish. I am already in love with the language, especially as it pours from the mouth of the bloke’s mum. She threatens to give you a fellandibang (“wallop”), or hop your head off the wall anything in her way, particularly a cow, is a Protestant you might want half a cup of tea out of your hand, if you’re in a rush and anybody displaying airs and graces might be displaying gorster, and definitely notions.Already, I am starting sentences with “Sure, lookit” and “Howya”, a sure sign that I must guard against becoming what Danny Dyer would quite rightly call “a twat”. And I must let Dyer also remind me that the British, too, have a brilliant way with the language it’s just that the gift seems to be more widely distributed this side of the Irish Sea.As does the gift of optimism. Another favourite Irish phrase, in response to a piece of gloom and doom, asks: “Could you not have the good word?” In fairness, Ireland has more to have the good word about following a series of dramatic referendums, it is throwing off its constitution to become a progressive and liberal version of its\u0026nbspalready beautiful self.Am I now a citizen of nowhere? It doesn’t feel like it. Through the sheer good fortune of wandering into an Irish family, I feel like I have allowed a billowing gust of air to blow through my life. I feel like I have granted myself the permission not to be chained to a bickering, ided, petty, cruel country, its plight not the fault of its predominantly decent populace but of a bewildered governing elite and a cabal of vicious chancers.

Some schools were found to be engaged in “aggressive marketing campaigns and ‘cream skimming’ aimed at recruiting particular types of students”.The findings form part of a state-of-the-nation study of England’s education system, drawn up by academics at the UCL Institute of Education over four years, which will be published on Tuesday. It includes the examination of Ofsted data over a decade, a statistical analysis of the impact of multi-academy trusts (MATs), 47 detailed school case studies and a survey of almost 700 school leaders.The reforms were largely implemented under the coalition government and championed by Michael Gove as education secretary. A plan to force all English schools to become academies was abandoned in 2016 after a backlash among Tory MPs.The study concludes that any new autonomy handed to schools had been “more than balanced” by testing and inspections that had ensured the state remains in control from a distance. The drive to turn schools into academies, the key part of reforms since 2010, is described as “uneven and often fraught”.There is also worrying evidence of schools improving or keeping their high status by shunning children who qualify for free school meals, whose parents receive state help. “Our analysis of national Ofsted data for the periods 2005-10 and 2010-15 showed a relationship between inspection grades and the changing socioeconomic composition of a school’s student body,” say the authors, Toby Greany and Rob Higham.“Schools that sustained or improved their judgment to ‘outstanding’ in the 2010-15 period saw, on average, a reduction in the percentage of students eligible for free school meals (FSM), while schools retaining or being downgraded to a ‘requires improvement’ and ‘inadequate’ judgment saw, on average, an increase in FSM eligibility.”The study admits it cannot say conclusively why better-performing and improving schools have admitted fewer poorer students.The study amounts to a stark assessment of sweeping education reforms introduced in the past eight years, as part of an attempt to build a “self-improving school-led system (SISS)”. Key measures include forcing schools to become academies, the promotion of multi-academy trusts (MATs) and the rolling back of local authorities from education.Ministers said the reforms would “dismantle the apparatus of central control and bureaucratic compliance” by handing power to schools. However, analysis by the academics shows there is no positive impact from MAT status for pupils in either primary or secondary academies when compared to pupils in similar standalone academies. For secondary schools, there was no statistically significant benefit for students when compared to all other schools.It looked at data from 2009 to 2015, examining average performance and progress of children at primary school, including in reading, writing and maths. For secondary school pupils, it examined the proportion of students achieving at least 5 GCSEs or equivalent qualifications at A*-C including English and maths, as well as their progress in English and maths.School leaders deemed to be leading the way in the new system are being handed new opportunities and power, it finds. However, it adds that they are faced with “conflicting and unreasonable demands” from government, while being treated with suspicion by less favoured schools. The study warns of the power that the new system can hand to “charismatic, authoritarian leaders”.It warns that the system in which the involvement of councils has been stripped back, with fellow schools encouraged to help their struggling counterparts, is actually seeing the creation of a market for advice – with schools charging for their expertise on how to improve.“And thanks to our reforms schools that aren’t delivering for young people are being turned around, with 65 per cent of schools made into a sponsored academy seeing improvement from inadequate to good or outstanding. But there is always more to do, which is why we are investing £23bn by 2020 to create more good school places and we are targeting £72m at the areas that need it most to help improve prospects and opportunities for some of the most disadvantaged young people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/856e7da8bf6475827ed7557154dcffd4f9e719fa/28_0_3444_2066/master/3444.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f6ae86c9895879d539c56a862bf8ca2","title":"observer view on role of schools generating inequality admissions","story":"The government would face a tough battle with middle-class parents, but reform is vital to help the most disadvantagedBritain’s poor social mobility can be summed up in one unfortunate dynamic: from the moment a child is born, disadvantage begets further disadvantage. We like to think of education as the great leveller that works against this. But a report from the Institute of Education at UCL, reported in the Observer today, shows the opposite: our school system itself amplifies social advantage.So much of the focus of education policy in the past two decades has been on school improvement, with hugely varying results. But what this study highlights is that when schools become better, their intakes also become more affluent. Conversely, when school quality has declined, children from disadvantaged backgrounds tend to pool in those schools.While the research does not draw a causal link, it did find that some schools are engaged in “aggressive marketing campaigns and ‘cream skimming’ aimed at recruiting particular types of students”. The result is one of the most outrageously unjust features of the English school system. Children from the most affluent backgrounds are twice as likely to go to a school rated as “outstanding” as children from the poorest backgrounds. And it is those children for whom school quality matters the most in shaping how they go on to do in life.This injustice is further exacerbated in a system with limited resources. Despite the growing school population, the number of teachers working in English state schools has fallen to its lowest level since 2013. Qualified teachers are leaving the profession at a faster rate than new recruits are joining. The best schools find it easiest to attract the best teachers low-rated schools in poorer areas suffer most from teacher shortages, forcing them to rely on expensive agency staff, dragging down standards.It’s not just teachers: school funding is more constrained than it has been for decades. The cash each school gets allocated is overwhelmingly determined by its number of pupils. So it is undersubscribed – read underperforming – schools that tend to face the biggest budget struggles. This is further compounded for schools in disadvantaged areas, which are most affected by cuts to local children’s services and are too often left to pick up the pieces of serious behavioural and emotional problems that require support from specialist services.The UK has one of the most socially segregated school systems in the developed world: a huge problem not just in terms of equity, but in terms of the overall performance of the economy. According to the OECD, the more socially mixed a school system, the better it performs. England is the only country in the developed world in which baby boomers have better levels of literacy and numeracy than young adults. Compared with our competitors, we have high numbers of young people from poorer backgrounds who are failed by the system and never given the opportunity to fulfil their potential.No one would begrudge any parent doing what they can – within the rules – to get their child into their preferred school. That’s why it is down to government to fix those rules to make them fairer. Schools should no longer be able to run their own admissions, and local authorities should instead be responsible for operating a fair system for all local schools, either allocating places by lottery, or ensuring that each school has a distribution of abilities. Either would result in a far more equitable, socially mixed system.It would be no panacea: in some rural areas social mixing would be hard to achieve while still ensuring children can attend local schools. But it would at least put a stop to the best state schools quickly becoming magnets for pupils from the most affluent backgrounds, which limits the impact of any school improvement on disadvantaged children.Instead, by spending £50m on expanding grammar school places, the government has taken school admissions in entirely the wrong direction. In creaming off the most able pupils, grammars increase social segregation to the detriment of poorer children. In London’s comprehensive school system, children from every social background do better than in Kent, which still has grammars.Reforming admissions would undoubtedly be a big political fight to pick with those middle-class parents who would staunchly defend their right to move house to get their child into the best school. But it’s a fight worth picking. Parents will understandably do everything in their capacity to do best by their child, and that’s usually something to be celebrated and encouraged. But when it comes to state schools, it’s the government’s job to ensure that this doesn’t happen to the detriment of the most disadvantaged children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f0e62e88192c5cc32ee7fbb7aba99236dac79ab/64_435_3985_2391/master/3985.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00c7987ad2da667c01dbc83db1102c67","title":"england harry kane colombia world cup","story":"Without the captain, no one would have been plotting the best routes but the top scorer must fire instantly against ColombiaNo one seems to know quite what to make of England’s last performance, which is nothing new in the context of recent World Cups but an unsettling departure in this one. It is quite startling how quickly the ground shifts below one’s feet at major tournaments.When the draw was made England would have been perfectly happy to get out of Group G in any circumstances. Yet when the time to play strongly fancied Belgium came around, Harry Kane was leading the scoring charts, Japan had been identified as the prize for victory and Roberto Martínez had already blinked first by indicating he would be giving some of his best players a rest.Whether England were right to in effect choose the Colombia option will be seen on Tuesday. It is a delicate business deciding whether a supposedly easier quarter-final route is worth the risk of a slightly more difficult opponent in the last 16, and England must also hope that after rediscovering winning momentum for the first time in well over a decade it is not too seriously disrupted by losing a match that was there to be won.Yet in fairness to Gareth Southgate, who would most likely have faced just as much criticism for fielding his strongest side against Belgium reserves, keeping Kane fit and available for the knockout stage was an understandable priority.The Tottenham striker has been described as the only world-class player in the England squad, which at the same time seems a tad premature and a trifle harsh on some of the emerging talents Southgate has brought to the fore, though there can no longer be any doubts about Kane’s value to the national side.He is the captain, the goal-getter, the go-to man. Jamie Vardy can be a marvellous finisher but England would have to completely change their style to play to his strengths. Marcus Rashford is exciting but still improving, not quite the finished article. Even in three starts it is hard to imagine Danny Welbeck or anyone else making the impact Kane has made in two.The opponents faced when Kane helped himself to five early goals were not the strongest, it must be admitted, but as England know only too well and Germany have just found out, getting off to a good start in a World Cup can make a crucial difference.If England have spent the past week or so plotting routes to the semi‑finals with a confidence bordering on cockiness that seems entirely out of sync with their laboured football and defensive outlook at previous tournaments, that is Kane’s doing.Others might have performed well, particularly Jesse Lingard, Kieran Trippier and John Stones, but Kane has scored the goals. The more superstitious among all the amateur England managers out there might have been tempted to give the captain at least part of the game against Belgium, if only to allow him the chance to continue his scoring run and further his claim to the Golden Boot.When something is working so well why change the script, is a question that will have been asked in many a pub debate, especially as Kane has made no secret of his desire to finish as top scorer. The risk of upsetting such an important player will also have had a few airings but, as Southgate was careful to explain, he knows both the player and the risks very well and made his decision accordingly.Why superstitious? Because this is virtually uncharted territory for England and picking up a fair wind in the opening games to set a course for the later stages of a competition still feels like the sort of hazardous enterprise that could be wrecked by any hint of hubris.Terry Venables, the last manager to take an England team to a semi-final, has stated he would never have changed a winning team and could not see any positives in allowing momentum to be interrupted by inviting defeat. “Gareth has turned a reasonably simple exercise into something unnecessarily complicated and difficult,” said Venables, who was Southgate’s coach when the team reached the semi-finals at Euro 96. That seems unduly pessimistic, given that England have breezed out of the group and have a fit and rested first team ready to be brought back, though Venables’s caution is based on the belief that team spirit and a winning mentality are not easy qualities to instil in a side and cannot be turned off and on like a tap.Southgate evidently believes they can and we shall see who is right in a couple of days, with the current manager acknowledging he will be blamed if things go wrong against Colombia.In their first two games England looked as good as anyone else in the tournament, in their last game they looked more like their old selves, though few teams in Russia could make eight changes to their preferred lineup and still keep up the quality and bubbling confidence.That is exactly the point the worriers make: why do it? Yet as Alf Ramsey said to his players as they received massages on the pitch before extra time in 1966: “You’ve won it once. Now you’ll have to go out there and win it again.”To paraphrase that message for the Southgate era, England have already shown the world what they are capable of, they ought to be able to do it again. And who knows, with Kane back in the frontline and hungrier than ever, perhaps even again and again.If Harry Kane scores against Colombia, he will become the first England player to register in six consecutive games since Tommy Lawton in 1939.Kane has played only 153 minutes in Russia but only Gary Lineker (10) has scored more times for England in World Cups than the Spurs striker (five).Since – and including – the 1966 World Cup final, half of England’s knockout games have gone to extra time (seven out of 14).England have failed to score in only one of their 18 knockout World Cup games. That was against Portugal in 2006.

They will meet Uruguay in the last eight. Lionel Messi, for all the hopes freighting his slight frame, will not be winning the World Cup this time.Quite how Argentina have ended up as this strange botch-job of parts that do not quite fit together, bound by nothing more than the magic of Messi, is a question that cannot straightforwardly be answered. But the fact is they are and, as such, they were never likely to survive a meeting with a side that looked into their eyes and were not cowed by their self-romanticising will to progress.That will, though, remains ferociously strong. It was embodied by Javier Mascherano who, at 34, announced his international retirement after the game. As Jorge Sampaoli kept reiterating, Argentina fought and fought and fought. Until the midpoint of the second half, when France opened up a two-goal lead, the game was underpinned by the question of how Didier Deschamps’\u0026nbspteam did not already have it won.There had been talk of Argentina conjuring a repeat of 1990 when defeat by Cameroon inspired a defiant spirit that carried them to the final and, in some of their cruder challenges, it felt they might be following that template rather too closely. But the difference between then and now is that team could actually defend this side can merely struggle.The deployment of Messi as a false\u0026nbspnine as Sampaoli – or whichever cabal of senior players picks the side these days – opted for a fourth different formation in four games, served only to deny the wide men a target when they got the ball in crossing positions. Certainly it did nothing to add a defensive stability. “We tried many different tactics, surrounding him, creating situations for Messi,” said Sampaoli. “We tried to use everything\u0026nbspwe had to allow him to do what he can do. Sometimes we managed to do so, sometimes we\u0026nbspdidn’t.”Well, perhaps. It is all very well to play, as the coach promised they would, with a knife between their teeth, but only if you can actually catch your opponents to use it. Argentina’s lack of pace is a problem that will never easily be resolved, and certainly not by playing the sort of high line they attempted early on. Perhaps Deschamps’ France have become a fluent attacking unit perhaps Argentina just made them appear so.Mbappé’s pace terrified Argentina, provoking the 13th-minute penalty from which Antoine Griezmann opened the scoring. There was something of the Brazilian Ronaldo about his surge, a comparison acknowledged by Deschamps. “Ronaldo was very, very quick,” he said. “But I think Kylian is even quicker.”Quite why Argentina had tried to play so high, against such pace, with such slow defenders, was mystifying but that ergence between Sampaoli’s instincts and his resources is an issue he has never quite reconciled. He was reluctant to accept the excuse but it cannot help that he took over the side only last June. “We adapted to necessity, maybe,” said the coach, speaking of his reign as a whole, “rather than having a clear identity. We had a clear need, and we had to win. That was our main goal, so that was maybe stronger than our football concept.”Yet for all their flaws, Argentina were level at half-time, Ángel Di María scoring with a 30-yard drive. Having scored one brilliant goal, Argentina, as they had against Nigeria, then added a second with the least implausible body part available to them, as Messi’s ball back into the middle was deflected in by the left foot of Gabriel Mercado. Could they cling on? They could not, and did not even come close.It took only nine minutes for Benjamin Pavard to conjure a goal the equal of Di María’s, cuffing a volley from the edge of the box into the top corner. Then it was Mbappé’s time, with two goals in four minutes around the midpoint of the half, a neat turn and finish and then a slick breakaway. At 19 he is already a wonderfully efficient footballer, the first teenager to score two goals in a World Cup knockout tie since Pelé in 1958.Yet still Argentina were not quite finished, Sergio Agüero heading in a late third. From the grave, the hand thrust up through the soil but it got no further. Argentina, at last, were done.France have been criticised for their ungainliness and caution, for being too much about substance and not enough about style. On the day Deschamps became the longest serving manager in France’s history, he could perhaps reflect that a little planning and a little stodge goes a lot further than a slow and shambolic defence and a nostalgic faith in a bastard spirit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abfbee2b5580c6da2e39e4f8574369c6fbc03ec8/4_239_2209_1325/master/2209.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6964b654a3b49f3ef621f3dcb8ab3dd","title":"luka modric world cup croatia unassuming genius","story":"Croatia midfielder is lighting up Russia 2018 in a way that may finally see him ranked alongside Xavi and IniestaSaturday 17 November 2007 and the pitch at the National Arena in Skopje is a bog. Incessant rain has caused severe waterlogging and put Macedonia’s hosting of Croatia in a Euro 2008 qualifier under threat. The game goes ahead, and the hosts go on to win 2-0, but it is a poor contest as players on both sides struggle to control the ball, let along do anything with it.Amid the sodden muck one player does catch the eye. Croatia’s No 14, a small and wiry midfielder who, despite the conditions, looks to use possession intelligently and precisely. Sometimes he fails but he continues to try, continues to trust in his technique, and what makes his display even more impressive is he is 22.The less clued-up reporters double check the player’s name on the team sheet: Luka Modric. Plays for Dinamo Zagreb. Definitely one to keep an eye on. Could be a serious talent and that is precisely what he became.A little under 11 years on, Modric remains small and wiry but professionally he is now a giant: a four-times Champions League winner with Real Madrid and the captain of his country as they face Denmark on Sunday in their first World Cup last-16 tie in two decades. Modric has impressed in Russia and is key to Croatia’s hopes of progressing. From an inidual point of view, these finals offer the 32-year-old a chance to establish himself as the finest midfielder on the planet.It is somewhat odd that Modric is not spoken of in those terms already. He has been a key cog in the most successful European club team of the past 10 years and is a player whose ability to dictate the tempo of top-level matches with brain as well as feet cannot be beaten. There have been others of a similar ilk, most notably Xavi and Andrés Iniesta, but they have at least had their moments in the sun: they are fully recognised and celebrated for their brilliance. Modric operates in relative darkness, passing, moving and gobbling up winner’s medals with barely a nod of approval in his direction.In part that is down to Modric’s unassuming nature. He is a subtle operator who physically gets lost among the game’s honed and toned superstars. As Barney Ronay once put it in the , Modric resembles a “small boy dressed up as a witch”, but the talent is undeniable and now, on the greatest stage of all, comes a chance to lift himself above the crowd.No Croat has completed more passes at this World Cup than Modric (143), or received more (124), highlighting the level of trust the midfielder’s colleagues have in him to do the right thing at the right moment. And it is not just with his use of the ball that Modric has made a telling contribution. He is also second for greatest distance covered (26.09km), third for most sprints completed (93) and, somewhat surprisingly, has made more tackles than anyone else in Zlatko Dalic’s ranks (seven).The captain is here, there and everywhere, having also scored twice at these finals, following up a penalty in the opening game against Nigeria with that twisting, turning howitzer in the 3-0 victory against Argentina. Modric described that goal as one of his best in 109 appearances for Croatia and, more than anything, it reflected his capacity to keep a clear head in the most pressured situations, a somewhat remarkable feat given the player travelled to Russia with a possible five-year prison sentence preying on his mind.The sanction stems from Modric’s involvement as a witness in the criminal trial of the former Dinamo Zagreb director Zdravko Mamic, following which he was charged with perjury. A trial is due to take place after the World Cup and, it would not have been a major surprise had Modric, who denies wrongdoing, performed like a troubled soul at the tournament.Instead he has flourished in the centre of Croatia’s midfield, dictating play with calmness, precision, variety and a quality he is not widely renowned for: robustness.For a man who is 5ft 6in (1.68m) and 10st 3lb (66kg), Modric is incredibly strong, using every element of his frame to hold off more imposing opponents in order to receive and use the ball. It was a trait that was fully on show during Real’s Champions League final victory over Liverpool in Kiev and something Harry Redknapp noticed on becoming Tottenham manager in October 2008, six months after Modric joined the club from Dinamo.“Luka is as brave as a lion,” said Redknapp, having overseen the flourishing of a player who had struggled to adapt to life in north London. “He can make things happen – he has that ability to open the door.”They have also seen that at Real, where Modric likewise suffered early teething problems. He was voted the worst signing of the 2012-13 La Liga season by Marca, having arrived at the Bernabéu for £30m a few weeks before the start of the campaign. He refused to crumble and, having moved from a No 10 role into centre midfield, became integral to Real’s success on the European stage.Now he plans to help Croatia reach grand heights, potentially emulating or even surpassing their success at France 98, when a team who included Robert Prosinecki, Zvonimir Boban and Davor Suker reached the semi-finals. Do that and Modric will well and truly stamp his mark on the global consciousness.“Because we are a small country, Luka gets less attention than he deserves,” Lovren said. “He is one of the best in the world. Maybe even a Ballon d’Or winner.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55eb9039aa868a0fcb7c867e77a2ce41449a2261/0_277_4904_2942/master/4904.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=838beaadeaf4c5d91df19460f50781a7","title":"uruguay portugal world cup last 16 match report","story":"Cristiano Ronaldo walked Edinson Cavani out of this game, helping the Uruguayan to the touchline, but not before Cavani scored the goals that put Portugal out of the World Cup.Cavani departed with 20 minutes remaining, slowly making his way around the edge of the pitch, limping slightly, a lost look on his face after he felt a pain in his calf that prevented him from continuing. Two superb strikes took Uruguay through to the quarter-finals but, while the striker said he hoped that it was nothing, he departed the stadium hobbling and there are doubts now that he will be with them when they face France in Nizhny Novgorod on Friday.Twenty minutes after Cavani departed it was Ronaldo who looked lost: his World Cup is over and he would not be drawn after the match on whether he will continue with Portugal, though the manager Fernando Santos expressed the hope that he will. “There is a tournament in September, the Uefa League of Nations, and we hope that he is with us so that he can help the young players who will need their captain’s example,” Santos said.As the final seconds ticked away Portugal threw everything they could at this, the goalkeeper Rui Patrício sent forward and almost heading goalwards, the Portuguese bench leaping with every tackle and tumble, calling for the VAR to rescue them. But in the end it could not. Cavani had gone but he brought delight to a resilient and often impressive Uruguay, built on solidarity and skill, whose manager Óscar Tabárez talked afterwards about their “absolute commitment”. France will not welcome playing them even if Cavani is absent – without him Luis Suárez occupied an entire defence alone.It was that kind of night and it ended with supporters in blue and white singing. It had begun with a goal that was genuinely breathtaking: brutal in its beauty, beautiful in its brutality – a 100‑yard one-two taking them from halfway line to byline, the ball twice smashed high, hard and with incredible precision diagonally from one side of the pitch to the other and back before it flew into the net.Rodrigo Betancur turned neatly, setting the ball rolling, the play spread to the right for Cavani. His strike partner Suárez was almost the entire width of the pitch away, but while they were distanced they came together once again – the story of their footballing lives. Born a month apart in Salto, population 104,000, Suárez left for Montevideo at seven and they did not know each other until they met at 19 but they have played together almost ever since, 207 Uruguay caps between them. Here they did so to devastating and dramatic effect.Cavani drove a long diagonal across towards the left for Suárez that could be heard from the stands. Suárez controlled, ran at Ricardo, cut inside and sent it back again. From beyond the top corner of the box he bent a vicious, superb ball in a fast, long arc to the far post where Cavani was running in. It might have hit Cavani on the shoulder or the face but the result was perfect, the ball rocketing in.It was a superb start, despite the fact that the first two attempts on goal had been Portugal’s, Bernardo Silva heading over and Ronaldo shooting sharply in a game that had begun as might have been predicted, Cavani unlucky to be penalised as he turned Pepe and then Diego Godín pushing over the Portugal defender while they waited for a corner, though with the ball not in play that one was free. Others would be too, the referee seemingly reluctant to pull out cards.Next, José Fonte headed over and Ronaldo had a shot blocked, but Uruguay appeared reasonably comfortable. There were crosses in, but mostly they were just headed out again. And if Godín and Giménez did not get to them, Fernando Muslera did, advancing from his line. There was sharpness when they sprung too, Betancur offering clarity, Martín Cáceres overlapping, Suárez looking sharp. And just before half-time, Cavani brought down Godín’s wild hoof inside the area, but scuffed his shot past the near post.The game soon reopened. Bernardo Silva’s ball in was flicked back to Adrien Silva. His shot was blocked but from the corner, taken short and eventually delivered by Raphaël Guerreiro, Pepe leapt behind Ronaldo and Godín to head the equaliser.Having conceded their first goal in 2018, Uruguay were under pressure now, unable to get out until a long ball released them and put them ahead once more. Thumped forward by Muslera, it dropped near the Portugal area and Betancur rolled it to Cavani who curled a wonderful shot first time into the corner. He departed not long after, leaving Uruguay with a lead and 20 minutes to protect it.It was not going to be easy. Bernardo Silva offered a little more subtlety to what had previously been a more frontal attack, although he did hit the best opportunity over when the ball escaped the scrambling Muslera. His run on one side drew a corner and then, on the other side, Matías Vecino stood firm as Ronaldo dribbled into the area. There was tiredness and nerves. When Carlos Sánchez gave up possession, Ricardo Quaresma’s curling cross with the outside of his foot just evaded Ronaldo’s leap.As the momentum built, Suárez became an island battling with Pepe but often beating him. And Portuguese chances were few: two long and inoffensive Manuel Fernandes shots and a sliced effort from Ronaldo way wide before Diego Laxalt ed to clear. Then, a long ball found Suárez again, alone against the world, who got away from three defenders and crossed to Cristian Rodríguez. His control escaped him, leaving more minutes of nerves, but Cavani’s two glorious goals would prove to be enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d3c19b2c3617fd4c661dbd1e3a9acf5119cbcf3/0_13_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=978b0eea9bcba323f1522fefbdf986ee","title":"uruguay v portugal world cup 2018 live","story":"Edinson Cavani scored two wonder goals as Uruguay progressed to the quarters at the expense of Cristiano Ronaldo and the reigning champions of Europe.Cristiano Ronaldo: gone.

Uruguay hack clear!90 min +5: Quaresma, just inside the Uruguay box on the right, shoots towards the near post. Muslera saves, but not convincingly, spilling the ball round the post. Corner. Up comes Rui Patricio!90 min +4: If Portugal somehow save themselves, Ronaldo won’t be playing in the quarters. That’s because he’s just picked up a yellow card for dissent. Portugal didn’t get a free kick when Quaresma went over Stuani’s leg: cue fume.90 min +3: Some superb hold-up play by Suarez down the right. He then curls a ball into the centre for Rodriguez, who is clear and should wrap things up. But he miscontrols and it’s a goal kick.90 min +2: Bernardo Silva whips a dangerous ball into the Uruguay area from the left. Shrieks in the stadium, but Godin is the model of calm, and clears.90 min +1: Muslera takes a while over the goal kick, in the professional style.90 min: Ronaldo comes in from the left and shoots from 25 yards. The ball sails 25 yards wide right. There will be four additional minutes. Four minutes for the European champions to save themselves!89 min: Ronaldo threatens to break free down the middle, but he’s crowded out of it. Laxalt bursts down the left and earns a free kick that wastes some more precious seconds.88 min: The busy Suarez starts a move that wastes a minute deep in Portuguese territory. The tension is palpable. The knockout stage of the World Cup, everyone!87 min: Fernandes has another shot from distance. Nope.86 min: This is attack versus defence now. Quaresma crosses deep from the right. Andre Silva meets it at the far post, but can’t find a team-mate.85 min: Joao Mario is replaced by Fernandes, who is soon shooting for goal, 25 yards out on the right. Muslera claims easily.84 min: Pereira tries to brush his way past Godin, down the inside-right channel. He goes to ground in the area, and wants a penalty, but he’s never going to get that decision. The ball apologetically trundles out for a goal kick.83 min: Quaresma sends a lovely cross into the Uruguay box from the left. It’s inches away from Ronaldo’s head. Bernardo Silva then bustles in from the right, but his low cross is hacked clear by Torreira. “Why are the Portuguese insisting on playing these short corner routines?” wonders Prateek Chadha. “Especially when the two or three times they have actually managed to put a cross in, the Uruguayan defenders have been in all kinds of strife.”81 min: A short corner routine comes to nothing. Ronaldo then has a dribble down a cul-de-sac on the right. Uruguay are holding firm right now.80 min: Bernardo Silva makes his way to the byline down the left. His low centre is hacked behind for another corner by Gimenez. Before the set piece can be taken, Nandez is replaced by Sanchez.78 min: Ronaldo shoots from the best part of 30 yards. The effort is easily blocked. The first sign of Portuguese desperation.77 min: Quaresma wins a corner off Laxalt down the right. Ronaldo launches himself at the ball, as it flies past the near post, but doesn’t connect. Guerreiro has a whack from distance, but it’s no use.75 min: Cavani is on the bench, grimacing, as ice packs are applied to his shin. The whole of Uruguay will have their fingers crossed, should they make it through to the quarters.73 min: Cavani has picked up a knock, and limps out of the game. Such a shame after his stellar contribution this evening. He’s replaced by Stuani. Meanwhile Portugal make another change, swapping Guedes for Andre Silva.72 min: Ronaldo breaks down the left, but there’s nobody in the box in support. Another Portuguese attack ends limply.70 min: And yet they should be level again. Muslera fumbles a cross from the left. He tries to reclaim the ball as it bounces around the area, but falls to the ground. The ball breaks to Bernardo Silva, on the edge of the area. The net’s unguarded, but he sends his shot over the bar. It wasn’t a complete sitter - he had to fire through a crowded area - but it’s a bad miss from a player of his quality.69 min: Quaresma probes down the right, but not with any great speed, and Portugal’s attack fizzles out. They look a little deflated right now.67 min: Portugal win a corner down the right. Uruguay fail to clear their lines convincingly, and Joao Mario enters the box from the left. But he can’t get a shot or cross away. Uruguay clear with more purpose at the second opportunity.66 min: That’s not a bad response by Uruguay to conceding their first goal of this tournament, and their first goal in 2018, eh?65 min: ... while Adrien Silva is replaced by Quaresma.64 min: Bentancur is replaced by Rodriguez ...It’s another Uruguayan beauty! This is such a sweet finish. And again so simple. Muslera launches long. Bentancur takes control and moves menacingly towards the Portugal box. He’s got Cavani on the left, and rolls a perfectly weighted pass towards him. Cavani opens his body and sidefoots powerfully into the right-hand side of the net. That’s a wonderful goal!60 min: Guedes shoots to earn a corner. Adrien earns another corner. Some head tennis allows Muslera to claim. But Uruguay are finding it difficult to get upfield right now.59 min: The equaliser has led to some uncertainty in the Uruguay defence. Joao Mario dribbles into their area down the right. His cross isn’t up to much, but a few holes are opening up now.57 min: Laxalt tries to re-energise Uruguay with a burst down the left. He’s clattered from behind by Carvalho, who escapes serious censure. This referee doesn’t get agitated by much.The ball’s whipped in from the left. Ronaldo leaps, but the ball sails over his head. No matter, because just behind him, Pepe has ghosted into space! He rises and blasts a header past a helpless Muslera. Uruguay were uncharacteristically dozy in defence there.54 min: Bernardo Silva fizzes down the inside right and fires into the middle. The ball ricochets to the edge of the box. Adrien Silva shoots. It’s deflected wide left. Corner. From which ...52 min: Bernardo Silva grafts to earn a corner down the right off Laxalt. The set piece is worked out to Guerreiro, who tries to send a rising shot into the top left from distance. But the effort’s well off target.50 min: Guedes drifts in from the left wing. For a second, it looks like he’ll have time to get a shot away, but Nandez steps in to gently relieve him of possession. Guedes fouls his opponent in frustration. It’s not worked out for the Valencia youngster tonight. Yet.48 min: Rui Patricio plays a poor pass out towards Pepe, who nearly loses out to Suarez. Fortunately for Portugal, the ball breaks off the Uruguay striker and out for a goal kick. But that was nearly another calamitous mistake. Some nerves on display out there.47 min: Joao Mario curls a cross in from the right, but it’s easily headed clear by Godin.46 min: Fonte tries to usher a long ball back to his keeper, and nearly has his pocket picked by the buzzing Bentancur. For a second, that threatened to become a disastrous start to the second period for the European champions.And we’re off again! Uruguay get the second half underway. There have been no half-time changes. “I like this ref and his ‘just play on’ attitude,” opines Robin Hazlehurst. “Can someone please please now boot Pepe three miles up in the air so the ref can watch him land and just say ‘up you get son, nothing doing’. Who on the planet would not love to see that?” The rhetorical question to end all rhetorical questions, right there.Half-time reading. The winner of this match will play a quarter final against France, who saw off Argentina earlier in a seven-goal spectacular. Our man Nick Ames was at the Kazan Arena, on hand to riff, be-bop and scat on Lionel Messi’s pain.Cavani chases after a long hoof down the left, but can only shank a weak volley well wide. And that’s that for the first half. It’s not been a classic, but Uruguay’s goal was a thing of real beauty, some spectacular long-distance interplay between Suarez and Cavani. Portugal have 45 minutes to crack the Uruguay code the sky blues haven’t been breached in six-and-a-half matches. It promises to be a thrilling second half. Go nowhere!45 min: Suarez is revived by the magic sponge. Portugal waste their corner. There will be two additional minutes of play in this first half.44 min: Guerreiro elbows Suarez in the back as the pair go up for a high ball. Uruguay want a free kick for the foul, but for some reason don’t get one. Portugal race up the other end with Suarez prone and loud whistling ringing around the stadium. Ronaldo wins a corner on the right. Uruguay take advantage of the break in play to engage the referee in philosophical debate.42 min: From tight on the right touchline, Nandez hoicks a speculative shot high into the crowd behind the goal. It’d have been worth something in rugby.41 min: Uruguay seem happy to turn this into a grind, which is what this has suddenly become. Does this count as breaking news? It doesn’t really, does it.39 min: Another cross into the Uruguayan mixer is easily dealt with by Godin. He even brushes off an accidental clash of heads with Guedes. “The prospect of Pepe and Ronaldo imploding if it stays like this with ten minutes to go is just mouthwatering beyond belief,” salivates Andy Tuohy, looking forward to some traditional Saturday night light entertainment on ITV.37 min: Bernardo Silva slides in on Cavani, and is fortunate not to see yellow. The referee is in an easy-going mood tonight.35 min: Caceres dribbles in from the right and thinks about shooting from the edge of the box. But he checks back and lays off for Nandez, who crosses. Cavani, coming in from the left, tries to tee himself up for a shot, but gets too much on his chest-down and runs the ball out for a goal kick.33 min: Uruguay haven’t done a whole lot in attack since going ahead, but when they do press forward they look dangerous. Suarez bursts in from the left and nearly breaks through the Portugal back line Caceres and Nandez combine on the other flank and are very close to opening their opponents up.32 min: Ronaldo blasts an uncharacteristically witless effort straight into the Uruguay wall. What a waste.31 min: Guerreiro slips a pass forward for Guedes, who is bundled over to the left of the D by Bentancur. That’s clumsy and not so clever. A free kick in a dangerous spot, and Ronaldo’s eyes have lit up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/886e646bb71f69f7827b1e0167737797eb93f26e/108_18_1727_1036/master/1727.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54a76819dddcc78ebf180df80eb7d5dd","title":"americas outcasts women trapped in cruel cycle of exploitation","story":"Caught in a recurring pattern of prostitution and incarceration, they are among the most vulnerable women in the US. Yet gaps in the criminal justice system, ruthlessly exploited by sex traffickers, make escape almost impossibleby  Annie Kelly and  Mei-Ling McNamaraKate had spent three years behind bars at Lowell Correctional Institution, Florida’s largest women’s prison, when the letters from Richard Rawls started to arrive.Men had written to Kate in prison before, but this time was different. Although she had never met him, Rawls made her feel special. He wrote that he’d seen her mugshot online and couldn’t stop thinking about her. Somehow aware that she was getting out soon, he offered her money, a home and unconditional love when she was released.The letters promised Kate a future she never imagined possible – a way out of the cycle of prostitution and incarceration that had defined her life after a childhood of chaos and abuse. Soon, Rawls stopped signing his letters “Rick” instead, he urged her: “Come on home to your daddy.”“When you’re in prison, all you think about is getting out,” Kate says. “The hours go by and it really hurts to know that nobody thinks about you in there.“So when you get a letter it’s like a gift from God. He told me everything that I wanted to hear. He said I wasn’t going to be a prostitute any more, that I could go home with him and live at his house, and that he would be the love that I was searching for.”When Kate walked out of prison, Rawls, a career criminal and convicted felon with more than 47 charges for sexual battery, child abuse, drug possession and assault, was there to pick her up. Just as he had promised.“When I got into the car, he’d brought me two sweater dresses, a bottle of Heineken and a lot of crack,” she says. “I went right back to smoking crack my first day out of prison.”When she got back to Rawls’ house, Kate knew immediately she was in trouble. Instead of the comfortable home she had been promised, the house was filthy and chaotic. Cockroaches crawled up the walls. The windows were sealed shut. And hungry, chained pit bull dogs whined and barked outside. Inside the house, Kate found half a dozen other former Lowell inmates.“It was just crazy in there, really a living hell,” she says. “At first he gave me all the drugs I wanted, but he made sure that I watched him beat the other girls and I wasn’t allowed to leave his room. Then, after two weeks, it switched up and he started telling me that I owed him for all the drugs he’d given me, and now I had to go make him money.”Four months later, a heavily armed Swat team blew in the windows of the house and arrested Rawls, who was later convicted and jailed for human trafficking.An 18-month police investigation concluded that, over the course of five years, Rawls had trafficked Kate and at least 18 other women out of jails and prisons across Florida.At the time of his arrest, he was making thousands of dollars a month from prostituting the multiple women he was keeping at the house. Controlling them with narcotics, prescription pills and brutal beatings, he touted them on street corners and escort websites.Rawls remains the only person convicted of trafficking women out of criminal justice institutions in the US. Yet his case is by no means exceptional.A Observer investigation has found that jailhouses and prison cells across the US are routinely used as recruiting grounds by pimps and sex buyers. Exploiting gaps in the criminal justice system, predators are targeting some of the country’s most vulnerable and isolated women, trapping many in an endless loop of criminalisation and exploitation.State to state, the recruitment methods being used to target victims are broadly the same.The first stage involves finding potential victims. US public record legislation means that, in many states, anyone charged with a criminal offence will have their personal data posted on government websites. The information can include mugshots, home addresses and details of criminal records. In some states, details of arrests and charges are also printed in local newspapers. This means predators can cherrypick potential targets, find where women are being held, and on what charges, and – in some cases – learn when they are likely to be released. Information posted online can also include information on bail bonds set for women awaiting court dates. Becki, a trafficking survivor from Cincinnati, Ohio, said that in 10 years coming in and out of the criminal justice system, she routinely witnessed pimps and sex buyers using corrupt bail bondsmen to access women in jailhouses.Inside prisons and jails, the use of prison and jail commissary accounts – which allow inmates to receive money from outside to spend on food, toiletries and other essentials – is a key vehicle for recruitment. In many facilities, anybody can send money to an inmate.This means that many women are, in effect, financially supported through incarceration by men on the outside, who then demand repayment when they are released.Traffickers are also using inmate bank accounts to pay in-house recruiters to scout out potential targets. “When I was in prison I’d speak to my pimp every week and tell him about what new girls had come in and then he’d send me money,” said Chloe, a former inmate at a state prison in Ohio. “I’d tell the girl he wanted whatever they needed to hear to make sure she got in that car with him when she left. It was like ordering food off a menu.”In a remote and dusty prison complex in Venus, Texas, Anthony Harris, a former pimp who who was convicted of compelling prostitution in 2015, laughs when he is asked if he’s heard about pimps recruiting women from prisons and jails.When women are released, pimps wait outside to collect them “like a line of cabs”, says Harris.Over the course of the investigation, the  was granted access inside the Western Massachusetts Regional Women’s Correctional Center. It is one of the few institutions that acknowledges it has an issue with the trafficking of inmates.Nicole Bell, a trafficking survivor and founder of Lift, a local anti-trafficking organisation, runs workshops inside the jail to prevent inmates being groomed and recruited by pimps and sex buyers. She was repeatedly incarcerated at the jail when she was in the grip of addiction and prostitution on the streets of Worcester. “Trafficking for many of these women started with a relationship that turned exploitative, or a past that has led them to drug use – but because they’re involved in prostitution and addiction and have a criminal record, they’re treated like a throwaway population,” Bell says.In the US, trafficking is defined by exploitation, with victims controlled through fraud, force or coercion.“These woman have been hurt and exploited by people their whole lives, but society doesn’t care what happens to them,” says Bell. Inside the jail, female inmates showed letters from men they didn’t know. In an effort to befriend them, the senders offered to send them cash and provide them with money, drugs and housing after their release. This grooming process often goes on for months. “It gets so lonely in here,” says Jill, 24, her tiny frame swamped by a baggy regulation orange jumpsuit. This is her 22nd time in the jailhouse. “I have a boyfriend on the outside but he lets me prostitute, so does he really love me? And he lies to me all the time. When you get the letters from these men, sometimes you want to believe what they’re telling you is real.”She shrugs her shoulders. “When you’re in jail, you’re all alone. Sometimes, without them we’d have nobody,” she says. “My family won’t help me.”Many of the women here know the men writing to them are pimps or sex buyers, but say that without their support they’d have nowhere to go when released.“I know girls who survive in here because of the men,” says Katrina, another inmate. “Imagine you’re in here for a year and they’re supporting you. What do you think they want when we get out? Imagine you say you don’t want to go back to disrespecting your body. That’s just not going to fly. Nothing’s for free, I’ve learned that.”While many women in America’s booming $9.5bn (£7.2bn) sex trade work independently, pimp-controlled prostitution is now widely acknowledged as one of the most brutal and pervasive forms of human trafficking in the US.Of the 20 trafficking survivors who contributed to the investigation, the majority alleged they had been arrested multiple times for crimes committed while they were under the control of a trafficker.“Vulnerable women who are being controlled and exploited continue to be arrested every day,” says Rebecca Bender, a national anti-trafficking advocate. She says a recent move in many states away from arresting women for prostitution has been falsely held up as a solution to the criminalisation of trafficking victims.“There is little awareness that many women in a trafficking situation are also forced into many different illegal activities, which make them a target for re-arrest by the police,” she says.The impact of having a criminal record often makes it impossible for women leaving incarceration to find employment and safe housing, or to regain custody of their children.“I try to help them when they get out but we don’t have a safe house, so when they’re released the traffickers are the ones who can help meet their basic needs,” says Bell. “It’s a matter of survival.”Solutions, say advocates like Bell and Bender, have to start inside the facilities themselves, where there is an urgent need for staff training and more interventions to support women.Since the Rawls case, the Department of Corrections in Florida has implemented anti-trafficking training and awareness measures designed to educate staff and inmates about human trafficking.In a statement to the , the Florida Department of Corrections said it had fully cooperated with the Rawls enquiry and added: “The department is committed to preventing human trafficking and working with our partners in law enforcement to ensure any inidual involved is criminally prosecuted. We take all allegations of this devastating crime very seriously, and have implemented aggressive measures to protect our most vulnerable populations from this enterprise.”For many, however, support either in prison or outside is simply not available. “These are some of the most vulnerable, high-risk iniduals in our society,” says Bell. “At the moment, most are just trapped in a continuous loop of abuse and exploitation.”• Living in Freedom Together supports survivors of sexual exploitation in Massachusetts"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f370cfbfd584ef0edfed773664b3613bcb9d47a/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f40762e068d6534919ce5aaa610899c7","title":"a letter to my friend with benefits","story":"‘We would regularly congratulate ourselves on avoiding the complications of relationships.

When used as more than just a seasoning, as in this istoo (a corruption of the word ‘stew’), pepper adds a gentle, rounded heat, unlike the sharp hit you get from fresh chillies. The result is one of the most gentle-natured and elegant curries I’ve come across in all my travels across India.For the tamarind shallots 1½ tsp rapeseed oil ½ tsp mustard seeds5 curry leaves 8 shallots, peeled and cut lengthways into quarters 200g vine tomatoes (ie, 2 medium ones), chopped1 green chilli, very finely chopped 1-1½ tsp tamarind paste½ tsp salt ¼ tsp ground turmericFor the potato istoo2 tbsp rapeseed oil 10 curry leaves 4cm cinnamon stick, broken in two1 medium white onion, peeled and sliced 2cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated 4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced 1 green finger chilli, slit650g small jersey royal potatoes, quartered1 tsp each salt and black pepper 1 x 400ml tin coconut milk 250g green beans, tailed and halvedFor the shallots, heat the oil in a large frying pan on a medium flame. Once hot, add the mustard seeds and curry leaves and, when the seeds pop and the leaves crackle, lay in the shallots cut side down and leave to cook for five minutes, until browned. Now stir the shallots, encouraging the “petals” to break loose, and cook for another five minutes or so, until soft enough to cut with a wooden spoon. Add the tomatoes, chilli and two tablespoons of water, and cook until the tomatoes go jammy and break down into a paste (you may need to add more water). Add the tamarind, salt and turmeric, cook for two minutes, then take off the heat and set aside.In a casserole dish for which you have a lid, heat the oil for the istoo on a medium flame and, once hot, add the curry leaves, cinnamon and onion. Cook for eight to 10 minutes, until the onion is as soft as possible without colouring, then stir in the ginger, garlic and chilli, and cook for two minutes. Add the potatoes, salt and pepper, stir in the coconut milk, then fill the empty tin with 100ml water, swirl it around and add to the casserole – you want just to cover the potatoes, so add more water, if need be.

Last February, Drake, already a superstar, became ubiquitous when he released God’s Plan, the opening shot of this sprawling album. The audio broke Spotify and Apple Music records its oft-played video witnessed the Torontonian giving away its $996,631.90 budget. A few songs into the first half of this double album, the emotive Sandra’s Rose, sums up the entertainer’s status succinctly: “Every title doing numbers like I’m Miss Adele.”More pertinent, though, is the question of paternity. The Canadian rhymer has recently been embroiled in a war of words with veteran rapper Pusha T. His diss track, The Story of Adidon, made hay of the persistent gossip that Drake had fathered a secret child with a porn actress, and that there was a plan to reveal Drake’s son as part of a future Adidas branding exercise.When it comes, Drake’s big reveal is almost conversational, a genuine shock. On Emotionless, a track which wrings maximum weepiness from a sample of Mariah Carey’s Emotions, Drake paints a bleak picture of a superficial Instagrammed world. “Look at the way we liveI wasn’t hiding my kid from the world,” he states, “I was hiding the world from my kid.”The rest of this 25-track album is dusted with references to Drake’s less-than-ideal situation, child support (I’m Upset), and single fatherhood. On 8 Out Of 10, Drake huffs: “I’ve settled into my role as the good guy.” The angry flow is at odds with a beat full of vintage sparkly sentiment on this album stand-out.On the very final track, March 14, Drake elaborates. “She’s not my lover like Billie Jean, but the kid is mine.” Drake’s main lament is far more touching, however. The rapper, who as a child ided his time between his mother in Toronto and his father in Tennessee, reflects on how he always dreamed of not repeating history, of starting a family in a loving relationship.Is There More? asks the last song on the A-side of this double album – long, even given the sheer volume of stuff the 31-year-old clearly needs to get off his chest. The track itself finds Drake pondering whether there is anything for a superstar like him beyond money and status. It ends on an affecting interpolation of Aaliyah’s More Than A Woman, sung by guest Nai Palm of the Australian band Hiatus Kaiyote, one of the obscure international artists Drake showcased on his much-admired mixtape, More Life (2016). Lasting love is always the elusive endgame for this rapper, who made his name singing in granular detail about relationships, not guns or drugs.The rest of Scorpion doesn’t lack for talking points. The menacing sub-bass on Nonstop deserves an Instagram account. Much of the aggression feels as if its directed towards Pusha T and Drake’s arch-nemesis, Kanye West the opening track, synth-strafed Survival, hints that Drake is holding back damaging information for the good of all.It is, perhaps, a marker of Drake’s newsworthiness that the existence of an unreleased Michael Jackson vocal collaboration is not the biggest draw here. Don’t Matter To Me (feat. Michael Jackson) finds Drake trading croons about an unresolved relationship with Jackson’s treated-sounding vocal.Another significant guest is Jay-Z, who crops up on the dramatic Talk Up. Like a number of Scorpion tracks, which react to very recent events, it must have been recorded days ago. “Y’all kill X and let Zimmerman liveStreets is done,” spits Jay-Z disgustedly, highlighting the recent killing of Florida rapper XXXTentacion, then boggling at the fact that Trayvon Martin’s killer, George Zimmerman, is still free.Drake has hinted that he might release an all-R\u0026ampB album. Also relegated to the small print here is that the second half of Scorpion is mostly sung, not rapped: a first.It remains a tantalising mystery to whom these more introspective, smouldering tracks are addressed. In My Feelings names “Kiki” and “KB” other candidates include past flame Rihanna and Nicki Minaj.The song ends with a skit from an episode of Atlanta, the Donald Glover TV show, which referenced Drake. Although this album lacks a world-conquering pop hit like One Dance or Hotline Bling, and your interest wanes on side two, Scorpion is the album of the summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55b8177bcdef13f69ee19b23a1380884d463f01a/0_255_4134_2481/master/4134.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ca4ee7d33eb24e3696a0915044e7e20","title":"amy winehouse photographer friend blake wood intimate photos taschen interview","story":"For Amy Winehouse, 2008 was a year of extreme highs and confounding lows – business as usual, in other words, but even more so. The zenith came in February, when the 24-year-old singer dominated the Grammys with five wins, a record for a British woman. She couldn’t be in the US, because of visa complications, but when Tony Bennett, one of her heroes, announced Rehab as record of the year – beating Beyoncé, the Foo Fighters, Rihanna and Jay-Z, and Justin Timberlake – she was shown, by satellite linkup to London, staring straight ahead, mouth agape, briefly speechless.But there were many profoundly distressing episodes, too. Throughout the year, Winehouse battled her addictions to alcohol, crack and heroin, while a gleeful tabloid press documented every tumble from the wagon. Her live shows could descend into chaos and she was roundly booed at both V Festival and Bestival that summer.Blake Wood, then a 22-year-old proto-photographer from Vermont newly arrived in London, met Winehouse in early January 2008. They were introduced by their mutual friend Kelly Osbourne and quickly became inseparable – in red-top parlance, he was “Good Blake”, in contrast to Winehouse’s husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, who had not long been jailed for attempting to pervert the course of justice, though her relationship with Wood was always platonic (he eventually took legal steps to correct false reporting).Their friendship deepened and, on Winehouse’s invitation, Wood began taking informal photographs. After her death in 2011, he could scarcely bring himself to look at them, but now he feels the time is right for a different, more nuanced narrative of that surreal period. “A big reason I wanted to put this out there was to change the conversation about her,” Wood says of his new book, Amy Winehouse, a collection of 150 mostly unseen images, taken in locations from Camden to Paris to St Lucia, in 2008-09. “There’s a false idea that it was all bad during those years and it really wasn’t – I was there.”Wood, on the phone from New York, where he now lives, goes on: “This book, really it’s a love letter to a friend. And it’s a visual diary of us at the time when she was most celebrated by the world, but she was also really misunderstood. She was very much loved by the people around her, and I hope this comes through the work.”Certainly the photographs present a contrasting image of Winehouse from the one that filled the newspapers at the time, or from that of the doomed, self-destructive naïve from Asif Kapadia’s Oscar-winning documentary Amy. Wood says that he wanted to capture “the person, not the persona”. In many of the images she has her natural curly hair rather than the extreme beehive we are used to. The book is dominated by an extended holiday that Winehouse took to St Lucia at the end of 2008, which Wood joined her on for almost four months. Winehouse looks natural and healthy as she rides horses on the beach or exercises on a trapeze, and she appears totally at ease with Wood snapping away on Polaroid and old point-and-shoot cameras that he’d brought on the trip.By the time of the St Lucia holiday, Wood insists, Winehouse was done with hard drugs, but she was still drinking. Either way, Wood – who grew up around addiction but has always been straight-edge himself – didn’t want to document that aspect of her life. “It was this unwelcome friend she’d go deal with and then come back and we’d hang out,” he says. “I just had no interest in taking bad photos of her. Why take a photo of someone who’s struggling? As a society we’ve captured that, we’ve seen that, at least from my perspective. But maybe not. Maybe other people need to connect to that visually and they need to see it more. But for me, I’m good.”Before St Lucia, much of the time that Winehouse and Wood spent together was housebound, hiding from the paparazzi. They would watch TV, talk about their lives, sketch out their creative dreams once they made pillowcases from vintage T-shirts. “We were both outsiders and we connected on that,” says Wood. “When you grow up feeling like that, you don’t feel like you belong, that definitely brought us close.” Winehouse pushed Wood to do photography and it was her encouragement that led him to leave St Lucia and return to the States to pursue it professionally. “She really believed in my work,” he says. “She saw my abilities before I saw any of it. I didn’t really know if I was shit or not. But she pushed me to make work and it was really nice to have a friend like that.”When asked to pick a special memory from their time together, Wood selects the night of the Grammys, and the gathering of friends and family at the Riverside Studios, west London. There’s even been a suggestion that when Winehouse finally found her voice and made a speech – “To my mum and dad. To my Blake, my Blake incarcerated” – she was talking about Wood first and Fielder-Civil second.“I didn’t talk to her about it after, but you can jump to that conclusion if you like,” he says. “But when she won, it was the first time in my life I really cried from joy. Seeing somebody being able to experience recognition sober, they really deserve it, and to be able to really feel it. Just to see her whole family and how proud of her they were, to bear witness to that moment was really big. As much as it was televised and public, it was very intimate that night. It was almost like her own private ceremony.”Amy Winehouse by Blake Wood is published by Taschen on 27 July (£30). To order it for £25 go to  bookshop or call 0330 333 6846.

A slew of Brexit-themed dramas are in production this summer, and the writers behind them face difficulties that go beyond the problem of making the subject entertaining. They have to contend with the way the facts behind the referendum result, and the roles played by the key dramatis personae, keep changing.The production with most at stake is a high-profile Channel 4 thriller, already at the filming stage, with the working title Brexit. It stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Dominic Cummings, the backroom strategist who is said to have shaped the referendum result with his use of personal online data.“I’m obviously aware that there might be a level of scepticism in certain quarters about dramatising something so polarising and momentous,” said screenwriter James Graham this weekend.Graham, already acclaimed for his political work on stage and television, including the plays This House and Labour of Love, added that he has based his account chiefly on two books: Tim Shipman’s All Out War: The Full Story of How Brexit Sank Britain’s Political Class, and Craig Oliver’s Unleashing Demons: The Inside Story of Brexit.“I take seriously the responsibility of being one of the first out of the gates to represent that campaign and its impact,” said Graham. “But I feel confident that, with the access and information we have, this film will be both fair and accurate, while asking tough questions and calling the key figures to account.”Two stage plays are also tackling the subject. One will concentrate on the Islington dinner party at which Johnson, then a backbench MP, made up his mind to back Brexit. Called The Last Temptation of Boris Johnson, it also features the current foreign secretary’s guests that night: Michael Gove, his wife, the columnist Sarah Vine, and media mogul Evgeny Lebedev. It will premiere at the Park theatre in north London next March.The second, more overtly comic, play, again called simply Brexit, is headed for Edinburgh’s Pleasance venue this August. Starring Timothy Bentinck, best-known for playing David in Radio 4’s The Archers, plus comedians Mike McShane, Jo Caulfield and Hal Cruttenden, it focuses on a fictional future Tory leader still attempting to close a Leave deal, and hold his party together.Finally, there is a rumoured Holly-wood version of Leave.EU founder Arron Banks’s diarised account of the campaign. It is claimed that his book, The Bad Boys of Brexit, is to be adapted as a six-part TV serial, told from the perspective of a US pollster advising the Leave campaign.These competing dramatisations have all been written while key issues are still undecided. Not only are the broad terms under which Britain will leave the union unclear, but the Electoral Commission is still investigating whether leave campaigners breached legal spending limits.The Channel 4 film, a 120-minute one-off with Cummings at its centre, is due to be shown next March, as Britain leaves the EU, so must deal with the fact that a ruling on the strategist’s campaign techniques is still awaited. Last Thursday, Damian Collins MP, chairman of the digital, culture, media and sport committee, argued in the House of Commons that Cummings should be punished for “contempt” for refusing to appear before MPs. Cummings said he could not attend the committee on the dates suggested, and that there were “legal issues” because of the separate inquiry by the Electoral Commission.“The drama depicts the events leading up to the vote, rather than what has taken place since,” said Graham, who also wrote Coalition, a 2015 Channel 4 docudrama about the aftermath of the 2010 British General Election. Along with studying Cummings’ own writings, the playwright added that he has based his script on “extensive media coverage, interviews and social media”. “But we have tried to infuse some of the recent revelations, impacts and outcomes into the fabric of the script to make it feel as pertinent and resonant as possible. I’ve also spoken to many key players on either side – including the strategists working on each campaign, and politicians..”Among those interested to see how they are portrayed will be Banks, played by Outlander actor Lee Boardman, who is expected to be depicted cavorting drunkenly with Nigel Farage at his country house. And Labour Leave donor John Mills, played by Nicholas Day and thought to be shown attempting to sack Cummings. Richard Goulding is Johnson, Oliver Maltman is Gove and Paul Ryan is Farage.A spokesperson from Channel 4 said it does not expect to legal complications to emerge over this “well-researched” drama. The author also said he has not yet “come under any personal pressure”, going on to point out that he is already battle-hardened by his recent dramatisation of the controversial newspaper magnate Rupert Murdoch in his recent stage play, Ink.Jonathan Maitland, writer of The Last Temptation of Boris Johnson, is also a veteran of political theatre, with a 2015 hit play Dead Sheep about Geoffrey Howe. He takes a different approach. “I’ve written about the past (2016) and the future (2030),” said Maitland, who researched the historical segment of his drama for a year. “Some facts are indisputable: there was that dinner at Boris Johnson’s in 2016. But when it comes to filling in the blanks, my rule is: can I in good conscience publicly defend and justify what I’ve written? Is it fair to show, for instance, Boris being substantially motivated by personal ambition throughout? Or was it all based on principle and altruism? I’ve gone for the former and if I get slagged off for it, I’ll happily take it on the chin.”The writers of the Edinburgh-bound play, Robert Khan and Tom Salinsky, have perhaps found the place of greatest safety by setting their entire comic drama in the future. Opening in 2020, it chronicles the impossibility of finalising an EU deal as the British government fractures.For all these writers, it seems, penning a play about Brexit in 2018 could prove almost as risky as negotiating the real thing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e8bd3d15228ed51b6bb83228aebd4b0b4fa3f40/164_38_3220_1933/master/3220.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3417de8c01cb0d3a92390f9d621f67ea","title":"sajid javid is surprise choice of tory activists to be next party leader","story":"Sajid Javid, the home secretary, is the popular choice of Tory activists to be the party’s next leader, a survey revealed on Saturday.He replaces Jacob Rees-Mogg who last month topped the poll for the fifth time in succession having been either at the top, or second choice to “other”, since the 2017 general election.Rees-Mogg is now the fourth most popular choice, with Michael Gove, the environment secretary, lying second and “other” third.The poll is seen as a reliable barometer of grassroots opinion although it can shift quickly. The latest result seems to suggest a move away from finding a replacement from the old team and looking for someone new.Commenting on the result, ConservativeHome editor Paul Goodman said: “There may be a sense that change is coming sooner rather than later – that Theresa May might not be prime minister by this time next year, or even earlier, and that the time has come to think more probingly about a replacement.“Javid may offer what party members seem to have been looking for since we restored the Next Tory Leader question: something new – a change from the old gang. “At any rate, his elevation to the Home Office has clearly persuaded many of our panel members to give him a second look, and some like what they see – especially, perhaps, since he has now come round to backing a clean Brexit.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/137643c7a2b6792b555cb17ff88e48d06ecdd2a2/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81e4821d18a5fa6bc3cb8faf93710cb9","title":"unite union brexit poll corbyn labour","story":"Ahead of super-union’s conference, majority of members oppose leaving single market and back a people’s voteJeremy Corbyn is today coming under fresh pressure to back a softer Brexit as a new poll shows an overwhelming majority of members of the Unite super-union – Labour’s biggest financial backer – believe the current Labour position in favour of leaving the single market will be bad for jobs.The survey by YouGov, released before Unite’s annual conference this week, also shows that most of the union’s members back giving the people a vote on any deal Theresa May brings back from Brussels – something Labour also opposes.The survey is released as sources within grassroots movement Momentum say senior figures at the top of the organisation are now keen to ensure a full debate on Brexit at the Labour conference in September, opening a possible way for anti- and soft-Brexit members and delegates to force a change to official policy.Corbyn maintains that he is determined to pursue a “jobs-first Brexit”. But the polling suggests many in the union movement now think his policy will have the opposite effect. Labour is proposing a new relationship with the single market that it says would give the UK access but fall short of full membership. The model has been dismissed by Brussels as unrealistic as it tries to keep all the advantages without having to comply with the EU’s four freedoms, including free movement of workers.Many of the motions submitted to the Unite conference depart from Labour’s policy and express support for the single market, and some for a people’s vote. One motion, submitted by West Midlands car workers to the conference, states: “Only now have voters started to see through the initial referendum campaigns and truly understand the implications and costs of leaving the EU. The final negotiations of UK Brexit terms cannot be left for parliament alone to agree upon because the facts presented to the voting public have changed so much since the referendum vote. The British electorate must ultimately have the final say.”Last week, another group, Labour for a People’s Vote, which is led by several former Momentum figures as well as trade union leaders and has the backing of more than 60 constituency Labour parties, announced that it would try to force a vote at this year’s party conference to change Corbyn’s Brexit policy.The group will call for Labour to oppose the government’s final Brexit deal. The party has said it would do this if the deal with the EU did not meet six tests set by shadow Brexit secretary Starmer. The group will then campaign for the party to go further and campaign for a public vote on the deal with an option to stay in the EU should voters reject the deal.Baroness Margaret Prosser, a former deputy general secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union, which merged into Unite in 2007, said: “It’s becoming increasingly clear that the Tory government is hell-bent on a bad Brexit deal for British workers that will damage jobs, public services and the future of young people. We are already seeing worrying signs about the impact on Airbus, carmakers and other key sectors of the economy. In these circumstances, workers look to our union to stand up for their interests.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98ec1dd51412e0ca225a20008b15590297dfd1dd/0_33_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7325bb1cec625a67ce178706fefdcf4b","title":"hampshire kent royal london cup final match report","story":"Forty years of hurt, and Kent will still be dreaming. While England’s footballers look to rectify 52 years without a trophy, Kent’s last one-day triumph was in 1978 and the wait continues. A Rilee Rossouw century, four run-outs and an unbeaten 75 by their former captain Sam Northeast denied Kent a title once more, with Hampshire ultimately easing to a 61-run victory.Queues around the corner and a crowd of almost 21,000 to witness the occasion gave evidence enough that a Lord’s final, despite the growing uncertainty surrounding domestic one-day cricket, retains an aura. Pre-match, the sense of occasion was not lost on the players. Dale Steyn talked of how special a Lord’s final was, his Hampshire captain, James Vince, spoke of being desperate for the trophy and Sam Billings wanted “the glory days back at Kent”.The last time Kent won a final, county cricket’s Sunday league was one of the few places where consumption of alcohol was permitted on this denoted day of rest. While Billings was trying to re-enact the feats of yesteryear on the pitch, however, Kent’s travelling supporters appeared just as enthusiastic about achieving something similar off it. At least, the presumably beer-induced chanting made it appear so. At first, it was amicable enough. As Darren Stevens entered the Kent attack at the ripe old age of 42 and with 16 wickets in the tournament to date, chants of “Stev-o, Stev-o” started ringing around the ground. They say spinners do not reach their prime until 30 the same might be said of Stevens, a niggling, teasing seamer, but at 40.Although Stevens toiled wicketless for 59 runs, when the left-arm spinner Imran Qayyum had the in-form Vince, his second wicket, caught at long-on for 23, there should have been much to cheer about among the Kent-centric spectators. Cue the ugly side of parochial county crowds. Northeast was booed first on walking to the crease and once again on reaching a sweetly struck 50.Perhaps it was the reprieve handed to Northeast when he was dropped off a sharp chance by his successor, Billings, on 41 that dulled them. Maybe it was the afternoon sun. For only by the time Northeast strode off the field, having steered Hampshire to 330, did the boos finally make way for tentative, albeit reluctant, applause. Sport can be fierce, emotional and at times brutal but this reception, for a man simply trying to achieve his dream of playing for England, was uncalled for.“That’s not really cricket, is it,” said Billings post-match of Northeast’s reception. “Sam’s a classy player, he showed that today, he played very well. Of course, whenever a player leaves a club there is going to be a bitterness but I don’t think that’s fair at all, really, to be blunt.”Not that the ever-sanguine Northeast cared all that much. The England coach, Trevor Bayliss, was present in his bid to watch more county cricket, as was the national selector, Ed Smith, here to keep an eye on the generous smattering of young English talent. It was not a bad time for Northeast, who has missed almost two months of this season through a finger fracture, to deliver.However, while Northeast (75 not out off 60), Daniel Bell-Drummond (86 off 89), Billings (75 off 60) and Tom Alsop (72 off 75) all put in admirable performances, it was another Kent veteran, albeit one 10 years younger than Stevens, who was living up to the spinners’ cliche. Before Saturday, only four wickets had fallen to an Englishman’s leg spin in Lord’s domestic finals. The 32-year-old Joe Denly’s four wickets doubled that tally. The calls, now more in jest, of “Denly for England” have resumed. Alongside Rossouw’s 114-ball 125, this was the standout feat. Combining with Qayyum, spin provided returns for Kent of six for 117, compared with seam’s contribution of two for 211.Asked if Denly might be called a genuine all-rounder, Billings’s response was immediate. “Without a doubt. I think he’s done it consistently now and it’s a great asset to have on your side – if you’ve got that genuine sixth option who can bowl 10 overs. Some people might have thought it was Mumbai with him bowling in the last five overs!”That this is only Billings’ first season as captain was demonstrated perhaps in his reluctance to turn to Qayyum, who picked up the first two wickets, sooner than the 23rd over. Hampshire, by contrast, had gone to great lengths to ensure they had their two England spinners at hand, Mason Crane playing despite a stress fracture, alongside Liam Dawson. Billings might be forgiven, however this was only the second time this season that Kent have not taken a wicket in the first 10 overs. The first-wicket stand of 136, between Alsop and Rossouw, ultimately provided the platform for Hampshire’s daunting total."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb41700811411c6427fb930e3f18314d1e81d1a0/93_88_3243_1946/master/3243.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20b7bf32c6a70b40670429c45e0732bc","title":"reece prescod impresses to secure selection for european championships","story":"When Reece Prescod arrived for breakfast on Saturday he wore a T-shirt with a solitary word on it – Berlin. It was a sign of his confidence, and his powers of prophecy. A few hours later, the 22-year-old showed he was Britain’s best sprinter as he glided away from a stacked field to book his place at the European Championships in the German capital.He will be joined by Dina Asher-Smith, who stormed away to win the women’s 100m in 10.97sec – a championship record – and Morgan Lake, who set a personal best by clearing 1.98m in the high jump.Prescod was hoping to go even better by breaking Linford Christie’s 25-year-old British 100m record of 9.87sec. However, he could manage only a modest 10.06, the result of getting away from the blocks before he got in his stride. From then on, though, he was deeply impressive – gliding past Zharnel Hughes, who took the second automatic place in 10.13, and CJ Ujah, who was third, to win his second national title.“Everyone was watching me, putting the pressure on,” admitted Prescod. “But I got myself in a good zone, ran hard to the line and came away with the win, so I’m really happy.”Afterwards he attributed his victory to his mental strength, which he said had partly come from watching YouTube clips of how Anthony Joshua and Michael Jordan handled the white heat of competition.“It is about taking bits of what they say about mentality,” he said. “Even though I am in a different field it is about embracing that – training hard, preparing right and coming to the championships and doing what you need to do. My mental game is what is going to take me to that next level.“I have also spoken to Greg Rutherford and CJ but there is so much on YouTube with the world we live in. I go on there, put in motivation video and get Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan and take bits from each. I am at a stage where I don’t want to waste any opportunities.”He has every confidence that he can win 100m gold in Berlin – and believes that a British 1-2-3 is also possible. “Me and the boys are doing well,” he added. “Zharnel is in good shape, and me and CJ will be ready to go, so I don’t see why not.”As for Christie’s record, he is just as confident that will come too. “It is about the right conditions and field. If I am surrounded by the top guys in the world I don’t see why not. It is in reach. It definitely will happen.”Asher-Smith, meanwhile, was delighted with her third sub 11-second 100m of the season, running away from the field at halfway to beat Daryll Neita and Bianca Williams.“I can tend to get out great and especially when I race the girls in the Diamond League I’m in a good position at 60m and then they come and overtake me,“ she said. “It’s been a big focus, to end the races faster and stronger. We’re looking to push on to faster times as the season goes on but I’m happy.”It was a far cry from her performance on this track a year ago when – hampered by her recovery from a broken foot – she could run only 11.56sec. “It shows what a difference just being healthy makes. This time last year I was still in pain with my foot, just about running so I would be eligible for the 200m in London. It’s been a bit of a strange year, lots of improvements but I’m just happy to get my third sub-11.”There was annoyance in some quarters as Laura Muir raced the 800m heats despite not appearing on the list of entrants on the official website. As expected, she breezed through to Sunday’s final, where she will meet her fellow Scot Lynsey Sharp and Shelayna Oskan-Clarke.Sharpe, for one, did not appear happy with the late switch. “It made for an interesting dynamic, especially when she gets added to the event on the night before the heats – which isn’t necessarily how the rules stand,” she said. “There seems to be exemptions for some people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a88c5ea76253fb134808359ac4c146841786891/0_113_4409_2645/master/4409.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42ec38523d9b66ca0c6d4bb3c781e670","title":"valtteri bottas austrian f1 gp pole lewis hamilton","story":"Mercedes may have proved they have the edge over Ferrari for Sunday’s Austrian Grand Prix but for the first time this season it was Valtteri Bottas who steered them to pole. His two flawless laps could not be matched by his championship-leading teammate, Lewis Hamilton, who was second, nor by Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel in third. However, crucially, the German’s hopes were dealt a further blow when he was given a three-place grid penalty after qualifying.Bottas absolutely deserved the pole and Hamilton accepted he had been well beaten at the Red Bull Ring but\u0026nbsphad earlier also issued another strident critique of the state of Formula One.Qualifying in Spielberg was closely contested at the sharp end, Hamilton ultimately just less than two‑hundredths of a second back from his teammate, with both Mercedes drivers three-tenths up on Vettel, with Kimi Räikkönen in the other Ferrari in fourth. But Vettel, who trails Hamilton by 14 points, was adjudged to have impeded Renault’s Carlos Sainz\u0026nbspduring Q2 and was subsequently penalised by the stewards. He will start from sixth. It is a potentially major setback given that overtaking is expected to be difficult at the Red Bull Ring, although Ferrari have the right to appeal.Vettel insisted it had not been deliberate. “I couldn’t see him,” he said. “I wasn’t told on the radio, so I can only apologise to him. Obviously, there was no intention.” The stewards, however, concluded that regardless of being unaware of Sainz, Vettel “should not have been so slow on the racing line during a slowdown lap”.Bottas, meanwhile, was jubilant. “I\u0026nbspknew I could improve on the first run and I managed to find it. Apparently I needed it,” he said. “I just need a good clean start no need to be a hero into turn one. I can guarantee I am more hungry for the win than anyone on the grid.”The team need Bottas to execute an error-free race, claim his first victory of the season and ensure he denies Ferrari the maximum number of points, especially with Vettel now under the cosh from the start. After heartbreak in Baku, when a puncture denied him the win in the final laps, and being hit by Vettel at the last round in France, the Finn has come back strongly.Hamilton conceded he could not match him. “Congratulations to Valtteri, he did a fantastic job and ultimately he deserved the pole,” he said. “I made a mistake on the first run and when you don’t have your first lap as a banker you’re kind of building from scratch for the second one.”Hamilton also told the Spanish newspaper AS that, off the track, fundamental problems in F1 remain and that he hoped they would be addressed when the new contract with the teams is agreed for 2021. “I hope that when they do the new concorde agreement that it’s better for the young teams so they can have a better platform for younger drivers,” he said. “It shouldn’t just be wealthy drivers coming through. It’s not just Formula One it’s all the categories. You’ve got only rich kids coming through now. It should be people with talent.”Hamilton has previously criticised the lack of ersity within the sport and his belief that its governance needs to be addressed, feelings he reiterated. “I would probably look at the structure of Formula One and how it’s run, how it’s governed, and probably remove a lot of iniduals that are in place,” he said.“If you look at big corporate companies, if the CEO or iniduals high up, executives or whatever, aren’t doing their job, they get fired. If the racing drivers are not doing their job, they go. But it’s not necessarily the same within this sport.”Change at that level, however, comes slowly in F1, in contrast to the fearsome development fight at the front of the grid. One in which Mercedes now have a slight advantage over Ferrari. The team brought their first major aero upgrade to the Red Bull Ring and it looks to have been successful.To have taken the initiative on a track where Ferrari might have expected to hold a slight advantage has put the Scuderia under pressure, further increased by what will be considered Vettel’s second unforced error in two races after hitting Bottas at Paul Ricard. If tiny margins are to decide the title, these are the moments that may prove crucial.Red Bull, who had been hoping for more from the Renault engine’s new qualifying mode, were to be disappointed, with the Haas of Romain Grosjean getting in between Max Verstappen in fifth and Daniel Ricciardo in seventh. The two Red Bull drivers also had a falling-out at the team’s home race over who was running in front during the final laps, with Ricciardo dissatisfied that he had to go first across for all three runs. However it is a long-standing arrangement within the team to alternate which driver punches the hole through the air at each race and Verstappen had taken his turn in France so he refused to deviate from the procedure.Kevin Magnussen was in eighth for Haas, with the two Renaults of Sainz and Nico Hülkenberg in ninth and 10th.Note: Sebastian Vettel qualified third but received a three-place grid penalty for blocking Carlos Sainz. Charles Leclerc qualified 13th but received a five-place penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fadcfac5c482af85415ab2088518cb502b6beff/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbff77a280153b194f5fcd72bb3553cd","title":"the 50 best podcasts of 2018","story":"From Julia Davis’s dark comedy Dear Joan to track-by-track teardown Dissect, Marc Maron to Meat and beyond, here are this year’s finest audio offerings by  Hannah J Davies,  Hannah Verdier and  Harriet Gibsone.

Recorded in front of a live audience, Dope Queens isn’t a low-key affair, and all the better for it. Interview-based offshoot Sooo Many White Guys - produced by Broad City’s Ilana Glazer - is equally engaging. HJDIf you like this try Another Round, Late Night WheneverBuxton’s open-ended “ramble chats” are a delight, with Bob Mortimer, Aisling Bea and even Wes Anderson among those bouncing off his observational genius. There are moments when it gets hysterical, and one of the finest involves Louis Theroux breaking out a falsetto version of Yes Sir, I Can Boogie that goes on just long enough to make it eye-wateringly funny. HVIf you like this try Richard Herring’s Leicester Square Theatre PodcastIf true crime is the food of podcasts, comedians Rachel Fairburn and Kiri Pritchard-McLean are your mild-mannered chefs cracking jokes as they work. They claim they’re not mocking serial killers they’re simply obsessed with them. Discussing how Ted Bundy only needs one name “like Britney or Madonna” suggests otherwise, and the pair’s understated humour means they just about get away with the grim jokes. HVIf you like this try A Very Fatal Murder If you’re more concerned with the state of Steve McClaren’s hair than Soccer AM, this is the football podcast for you. Bob Mortimer and Andy Dawson are the anti-Carragher and Neville, bringing surreal fun to the sport.

HVIf you like this try The Football Ramble Payne Lindsey had a huge hit with Up and Vanished, his podcasting debut, in which he examined the disappearance of a former beauty queen. Lindsey struck journalistic gold when his DIY sleuthing turfed-up two fresh arrests. For the follow-up, he explores a spate of 28 murders of black children in Atlanta. This time, race and City Hall politics loom far larger than a simple whodunnit.

In a Thick of It-style story that’s got more than a touch of Brexit chaos to it, Harry Enfield plays an inept capital punishment minister, and there’s a cameo from newsreader Jon Snow. However, it’s Fresh Meat’s Charlotte Ritchie and Liam Williams (of BBC3’s Pls Like) who steal the show as warring, ineffectual civil servants. HJDIf you like this try This Sounds SeriousTyler Mahan Coe’s history of country music lives up to its glamorously scandalous title, bringing out the backstories of both high-profile figures and lesser-known names. From the reason why Loretta Lynn’s songs were banned and Wynonna Judd’s life story to a three-parter based around those involved in the record Harper Valley PTA, each episode has more sagas than a country song, making it a gripping listen.

HVIf you like this try The Two Shot PodcastJulia Davis and Vicky Pepperdine’s podcast is offensiveness disguised as polite conversation. Playing a pair of seemingly respectable agony aunts, their audience’s questions solicit filthy answers, dressed up as the kind of advice that comes from women in buttoned-up cardigans.

Next year I want to have this convention in Tehran!”The former New York mayor, who became a cyber security adviser in the White House before being named as Trump’s personal lawyer in April, is one of a long line of American conservative hawks to attend the NCRI annual conference. Another prominent guest on Saturday was Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker and a close Trump ally. In his speech, Giuliani said the fall of the government in Tehran would be brought about by economic isolation. “When the greatest economic power stops doing business with you, then you collapse ... and the sanctions will become greater, greater and greater,” he said.  In May, Trump abrogated the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran and ordered a campaign of intense economic pressure, threatening sanctions against any foreign company doing business with Iran and calling for an end to trade in Iranian oil by November. Giuliani suggested that the current wave of protests in Iran was being orchestrated from outside.It was unclear whether “our people” was intended to mean the US or the MeK.The guest of honour at last year’s NCRI conference was John Bolton, who has since become Trump’s third national security adviser. Bolton told the 2017 rally US policy should be to make sure the Islamic Republic “will not last until its 40th birthday” –1 April 2019.The policy of the Trump administration is not officially to call for regime change, though top officials have often hinted at it. Outlining his approach in May, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said it was up to the Iranian people to relieve the pressure on the country by changing their government.  Giuliani was one of 33 senior US officials and military brass at the year’s conference on Saturday. Bill Richardson, former US ambassador to the United Nations, US energy secretary and Democratic governor of New Mexico, was also in attendance. Stephen Harper, former prime minister of Canada, also delivered a speech advocating regime change in Iran.It was unclear if the speakers at the Saturday conference were paid. The NCRI and MeK have been known for paying very high fees.Most observers of Iranian politics say the MeK has minimal support in Iran and is widely hated for its use of violence and close links to Israeli intelligence.  In sweltering temperatures on Saturday, around 4,000 people arrived by bus at the Parc des expositions centre. Many were draped in the MeK flag, which replaces the sign for “Allah” on the Iranian flag with a yellow lion. Others wore yellow sun hats displaying the hashtag “#Maryam Rajavi”.Around half of the attendees were Iranian. The other half consisted of an assortment of bored-looking Poles, Czechs, Slovakians, Germans and Syrians who responded to a Facebook campaign promising travel, food and accommodation to Paris for a mere €25. Hundreds of Syrian refugees settled in Germany also attended. Many snoozed under trees during speeches.“We saw the deal on Facebook and we agreed to come on a holiday,” said a young Syrian mother as she sat on the conference floor, fanning her two young children. “I have never seen Paris. I don’t know anything about the MeK.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaa457611bd0a689a15cb69db4c36a3d8c4559d8/0_150_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a9ee8d57d5878cce6ed2f5ac9b1cfd4","title":"amlo mexico election president how despair fueled campaign","story":"Violence, corruption and poverty explain why leftwing populist Andrés Manuel López Obrador is the frontrunner in electionIt’s a searing afternoon in Ecatepec, one of Mexico’s most violent and deprived cities, and thousands of followers have gathered under a vast white tarpaulin to hear their pathfinder rage against the machine.For the next hour Andrés Manuel López Obrador – or Amlo to his fans – will deliver a unyielding assault on the scoundrels, mafiosos and influence peddlers he claims have plundered Latin America’s second largest economy and plunged it into a cauldron of thievery, bloodshed and want. “This official banditry is going to end!” the 64-year-old leftist will rail. “Zero corruption and zero impunity!”First, though, he must brush his hair. After pushing through a crush of adorers, López Obrador pauses at the foot of a scaffolding stage, plucks a chesnut-coloured comb from his pocket and calmly runs it through his silver mane. Then the Amlo show begins. “Viva México! Viva México! Viva México!” he shouts from the rostrum, thrusting both arms into the air. “It feels like a dream – but we are just a few days away from achieving the transformation of Mexico!”That transformation is almost certain to begin on Sunday when 88 million Mexicans head to the polls to pick their new president. Amlo, who is making his third run for the presidency, has towered above his rivals in the polls for months. “We’re 30 points ahead!” he boasted to the sea of supporters before him in Ecatepec, who responded with cries of: “Presidente! Presidente!”Experts say three interlinked crises – security, corruption and poverty – explain why López Obrador now stands on the cusp of the Mexican presidency, and nowhere are they more visible than in Ecatepec, a gritty, neglected conurbation that is just 30km (18 miles) from Mexico City’s chic central districts but feels like another world. Ecatepec is Mexico’s most populous municipality and one of its most impoverised, with nearly 790,000 of its 1.8 million inhabitants living in poverty. It is also one of the most dangerous regions in an increasingly dangerous country where at least 200,000 people have been killed since a catastrophic “war on drugs” was launched just over a decade ago.“Environmental degradation, femicide, insecurity, car theft, extortion, kidnapping, the disappearance of women … Ecatepec is a microcosm that illustrates all of the country’s most serious problems,” said Azucena Cisneros, a local politician from Amlo’s party, Morena. “It’s an urban tragedy.”Amlo has built his campaign around pledges to eradicate corruption and rule for the poor. Among the devotees at his Ecatepec rally, many described him as the only man capable of saving them from a crime wave they blamed on venal politicians. A cry for help had been painted on to one banner next to the stage: “We are the most violent municipality! We have been robbed and ignored by these corrupt politicians! We deserve to live better lives! We are good people! That’s why Ecatepec is with you, Andrés Manuel!” “It’s so terribly insecure,” complained Gaby Mejía, a 46-year-old primary school teacher. “My students are always coming up to me and saying: ‘Miss, did you hear about the shootout near my house? That they killed you-know-who?’” Mejía’s mother, Josefina, 74, nodded in agreement, recalling how she had recently been held up by group of armed car thieves. “We’re already in the abyss,” she said, describing Amlo as Mexico’s salvation: “He’s one of those men who is only born every 100 years.”Many describe Amlo’s rise as the result of a furious popular revolt against the two parties that have ruled Mexico since the end of one-party rule in 2000 – the Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) and the National Action party (Pan) – and which are widely blamed for the current crises. “It’s a social-civic insurrection. It’s a collective awakening,” said Germán Rufino Contreras, a former federal deputy and Amlo supporter in Ecatepec. But Viridiana Ríos, an Ecatepec-born member of Democracia Deliberada, a collective of young leftist Mexican thinkers, said she believed despair better explained why voters were embracing Amlo and change. “I think it is just that a lot of people haven’t noticed we have created a country where a lot of people have nothing to lose.”Two days after Amlo’s triumphant rally, Cisneros and a group of Morena activists embarked on a pre-election march through some of Ecatepec’s most marginalized corners, places where many have shockingly little to lose. In Vivienda del Taxista, a rickety shanty built on a rubbish-strewn wasteland, she visited the home of Marisol Gutiérrez, a Morena campaigner and seamstress who supports her daughter and two grandchildren on an income of about 600 pesos (£22) a week. “It’s not enough. But … the truth is, there’s no work,” Gutiérrez said, showing off her family’s battered stone-and-asbestos abode which had a bullet hole in its roof and had been built directly under a transmission line.On 10 December 2006, president Felipe Calderón, launched Mexico’s war on drugs by sending 6,500 troops into his home state of Michoacán, where rival cartels were engaged in tit-for-tat massacres.Calderón declared war eight days after taking power – a move widely seen as an attempt to boost his own legitimacy after a bitterly contested election victory. Within two months, around 20,000 troops were involved in operations across the country.The US has donated at least $1.5bn through the Merida Initiative since 2008, while Mexico has spent at least $54bn on security and defence since 2007. Critics say that this influx of cash has helped create an opaque security industry open to corruption at every level.But the biggest costs have been human: since 2007, around 230,000 people have been murdered and more than 28,000 reported as disappeared. Human rights groups have also detailed a vast rise in human rights abuses by security forces.As the cartels have fractured and ersified, other violent crimes such as kidnapping and extortion have also surged. In addition, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced by violence.\u0026nbspImproved collaboration between the US and Mexico has resulted in numerous high-profile arrests and drug busts. Officials say 25 of the 37 drug traffickers on Calderón’s most-wanted list have been jailed, extradited to the US or killed, although not all of these actions have been independently corroborated.The biggest victory – and most embarrassing blunder – under Peña Nieto’s leadership was the recapture, escape and another recapture of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, leader of the Sinaloa cartel.While the crackdown and capture of kingpins has won praise from the media and US, it has done little to reduce the violence.Mexico’s decade-long war on drugs would never have been possible without the huge injection of American cash and military cooperation under the Merida Initiative. The funds have continued to flow despite growing evidence of serious human rights violations.\u0026nbspOn one moldy wall hung a photograph of Gutiérrez’s son, Geovanni, who killed himself in 2016 aged 20. On another, a portrait of Jesus carried the phrase: “The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want.”In the hovel nextdoor Enrique Hernández, a semi-retired rickshaw driver from Oaxaca state, said he also planned to vote Amlo: “More than anything because we all have the right to an opportunity in life.”Cisneros’s next stop was La Cuesta, a tumbledown slum cobbled together from cardboard, wooden crates and repurposed advertising hoardings above a natural gas pipeline. “It’s a time bomb,” said Arnulfo Reyes Lara, a social worker who fights to keep the community’s kids off drugs and off the streets.At every turn, Cisneros was bombarded with tales of deprivation and crime.Odilia Allende, 55, told of how her son had been murdered just a few streets away. “They shot him in the head … These are people with a future, with a reason to live and it’s not fair that the druggies just take their lives when they are on their way to work.”Juan Juárez, a 51-year-old mecanic, described how criminals had beaten his brother to within an inch of his life: “They had to put a titanium plate in his face,” he said, adding: “These days when we go out we feel fear. We need change.”Finally, a sobbing mother approached Cisneros to recount how her daughter had been abducted and raped before she somehow managed to escape alive. “How long ago?” Cisneros asked. “Five days,” the woman replied, breaking down into tears. “It hurts. It still hurts. I try to be strong. I know we have to go on.” “You will get through it,” Cisneros replied, and hugged her. After each heartbreaking petition, Cisneros grabbed her loud-hailer and marched on through the community, imploring locals to vote for change. “Es urgente un cambio en este país!” she shouted. “This country urgently needs change!”Additional reporting by Hernán Sarquis"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dafcdf3cc086f806ea0e94cf99982d7a7b7031f8/0_102_3765_2259/master/3765.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a56812c3a22fe13aa7062d218be41c4","title":"captain imran khan starts run elections pakistan army","story":"In run-up to elections, the former cricketer has drawn wide support as well as claims he is complicit with the militaryOutside a samosa stall in Lahore, the home town of Imran Khan, a group of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters put down their forks to recall the glories of the 1992 Cricket World Cup, when the final wicket fell like a matchstick before the fast bowling of the team captain. “He was like a tiger,” says Imran Raja, who remembers the final. “I watch it all the time on YouTube,” chips in 21-year-old Hassan, mourning that he was not alive to see Khan lift the trophy.On 25 July, Pakistan holds a general election in which Khan, who founded the PTI in 1996 and goes by the nickname Captain, stands a good chance of a still more significant victory. Posters bearing the party logo, a bat and ball, deck the streets of Lahore. In language typical of a 65-year-old who has transferred boundless energy to the electoral field, Khan warned party workers “not to stop until the final ball” at a gathering in the city on Thursday.Although polls show the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) retaining a lead, most analysts predict that a combination of a spate of defections, court cases and pressure from the military establishment will deny the party a second consecutive term.Families are split. Parked in their car on a side-street in the Lahore constituency Khan is contesting, Mehreen leans over her husband, Yasser, a PML-N supporter, to shout through the window: “Imran Khan is the only hope for Pakistan.”Regardless of who wins, difficulties loom. Pakistan’s economy is teetering and is likely to require a bailout from the International Monetary Fund, after the current account deficit doubled this year. An international money-laundering watchdog put Pakistan back on its “grey list”, indicating insufficient efforts to combat financing of terrorism. And a financial slowdown could reduce the leeway to protect the country from a water crisis, or bolster decrepit hospitals and schools.Since returning from England in 2006, Khan has worked hard to shed the playboy reputation of his cricket career. Then, he was married to heiress Jemima Goldsmith and posed in his briefs for the Daily Mirror. Today he wears the shalwar kameez (trousers and tunic), flicks prayer beadsthrough his fingers, and in January wed his spiritual adviser, Burshra Maneka. In the eyes of his supporters, however, his credibility lies in his clean fingers. Khan is a philanthropist who has set up three cutting-edge cancer hospitals his financial probity stands in contrast to the PML-N founder, Nawaz Sharif, and his family, who currently face trial for money laundering. They have pleaded not guilty and deny any wrongdoing.It was Khan’s dogged campaigning that forced the supreme court to take up the Panama Papers last year, a move which led to Sharif’s ousting as prime minister. “Khan is an honest man,” says Raheel Malik, a 40-year-old IT worker. “He should get a chance to put into practice what he is saying.”Yet the PTI chairman appears less confident than he did in the run-up to the last election. “If you look at the campaign, the PTI hasn’t resonated as it did in 2013”, when it grabbed the votes of the young and middle-class to become the country’s second-largest party by votes, says TV host Fasi Zaka. That partly that comes down to the compromises Khan has made on the way.For the past two weeks long-standing party members have protested outside Khan’s lavish homes in Islamabad and Lahore, furious at being denied tickets to run for election in favour of “electables”, politicians who switch parties with the wind and bring their own vote-banks – and often corruption scandals – with them. The more wizened observers of Pakistani politics argue that picking up “electables” is the only route to power in the crucial province of Punjab, dominated by the PML-N for the past 30 years. “You need the right horses,” says 23-year-old Saeed Zaman, a volunteer in the constituency Khan is contesting. Others feel that by bringing in a third of its candidates from other parties, the PTI has lost its appeal as a purgatory force.“How can Imran Khan’s laundry wash their sins clean?” laments Muhammad Asghar, 60, who says he will no longer cast a vote for the party.Hopes that Khan could deliver the promised “new Pakistan” have also suffered somewhat from the record of his five-year government in the northern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The delivery of health insurance to a million poor families, improvement in public hospitals and removal of political interference in the police draw some recognition from voters, but expectations – whipped into the stratosphere during the campaign – have not been met.Khan has also lost former allies in the elite. “Feminists and liberals are quite shocked that he is still treated by some as a progressive leader,” says Ashaar Rehman, the Lahore editor of Dawn newspaper. He calls liberals “blood-suckers” for supporting the war against the Pakistani Taliban, which he opposes in favour of negotiation. His provincial government granted $30,000 to the madrasa of Sami-ul Haq, a notorious front for Taliban fighters (in return Haq has formed an alliance with the PTI).And similarly damaging is the impression of complicity with military-backed efforts to interfere in the election. Khan has not spoken out as journalists have been abducted, TV stations taken off air, and Dawn’s distribution blocked in some areas.“He enjoys the rumours of establishment support,” says Umair Javed, a consultant. “His understanding of Punjab politics is that he is much more likely to do well if people believe the army is behind him.”Still, Khan has a hot-headed, independent streak that unnerves the military leadership. In a sign of his sympathy for the Pashtun Protection Movement, a civil rights movement that claims the army supports the Taliban, Khan is not running candidates against its leaders in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.In a recent interview with the , he stressed that the famous “umpires” of Pakistani politics would step back if he took power, just as he ensured neutral umpires in cricket matches against India in 1987. Whether, like so many other civilian leaders, he is eventually stumped by the military, only time will tell."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea498bac687a98fdf308a453da1eaced17ac08f1/0_125_5062_3038/master/5062.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca68ec60393d7cd06cb963453d6d735f","title":"syria southern towns surrender to assad forces","story":"UN says fighting has driven 160,000 people towards borders with Jordan and Israeli-occupied Golan HeightsSeveral southern Syrian towns have surrendered to the forces of President Bashar al-Assad, after more than a week of fierce attacks forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes.The United Nations says fighting has driven 160,000 people from their homes, towards borders with Jordan and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Both countries say they will not allow any Syrians to cross.Rebel fighters are trying to negotiate with Assad’s backer, Russia, as the opposition-held enclave in southern Daraa province rapidly shrinks under airstrikes and ground attacks, but say conditions offered are “hard to accept”.Daraa is seen as the cradle of the Syrian uprising against Assad, which led to the seven-year civil war, so recapturing it would be both a strategic and propaganda victory for the government.Fighting, which began on 19 June, continued into Saturday, a second week of conflict that the UN’s Syria envoy has said could match the siege of Aleppo and last year’s assault on eastern Ghouta combined.The fighting in effect rips up a ceasefire agreed last year between Russia, the US and Jordan. It designated the area around Daraa as a “de-escalation zone” and Washington promised a strong response to any campaign that violated the agreement.However, US forces have not taken action to stop attacks, and opposition spokesman Ibrahim Jabawi accused them of having struck a “malicious deal” to stay silent.Jabawi said rebel civilian and military officials held meetings with Russia to discuss surrender, but were offered terms they could not accept. Russia demanded the handover of weapons and said anyone who had borne arms would face trial.Since Russia joined the civil war in 2015, it has helped turn the tide of the conflict with decisive but often brutal interventions, condemned by international agencies, aid groups and human rights monitors.Government forces and their allies have repeatedly hit civilian targets including hospitals and schools, used chemical weapons and starvation sieges, in their battles to take over opposition-held areas around the country.Rebel-held areas have been slowly recaptured, and the south-west is one of just three remaining strongholds still outside government control, along with Idlib in the north-west, alongside territory held by Kurdish forces in the north-east.Even as the rebels negotiated with Russia for some limited protection from Syrian government troops, those forces were taking other towns in the area. Large parts of the rebel enclave has already fallen, and army advances near Daraa city could cut the opposition-held territory in two.State television said at least five towns had agreed to surrender and accept government rule, and one had already raised the national flag, news agencies reported.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says more than 100 civilians have been killed in airstrikes and shelling since the campaign around Daraa started. Tens of thousands of other civilians forced from their homes are gathered in extremely harsh conditions along the Jordanian and Israeli borders, some with tents but many sleeping in the open air. The fighting has been so intense that aid convoys across the border have been halted, Jan Egeland, a humanitarian adviser to the UN said this week, begging Jordan to reopen its border to those fleeing conflict. “I hesitate, in a way, to ask a small and poor county, who has more than a million Syrians on their soil, to take more,” he said. “But I have to do it, because these are women, children, civilians, who have no other place to flee if they are to escape the war zone.” Israel should also be asked to offer refuge, he said."},{"url":null,"title":"dublin s pride parade wows the city as thousands take to the streets","story":"  June 30, 2018This year\u0026rsquos event marks 25 years since the decriminalisation of homosexuality "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3548680.1530298586!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin hose pipe ban could be extended nationwide","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe watering of gardens attached to hotels or other businesses is banned, but garden centres and “visitor” gardens, such at the National Botanic Gardens in Glasnevin, are exempt from the ban. Photograph: Getty ImagesBans on watering gardens, washing cars and filling pools from public water supplies could be faced by communities across the country to avoid nationwide droughts, Irish Water has said.The month-long hose pipe ban which comes into force in Dublin on Monday may have to be extended to other areas whose water supplies are at risk, the utility said.More than 100 water schemes around the country have been deemed “at risk” by Irish Water, and all will now be assessed for a possible hose pipe ban.Customers in Kilkenny, Longford, Athlone, north Galway, Louth and Kerry have already experienced restricted water supply and outages in some cases. Areas in Cork, Wicklow, Limerick, Kilkenny, Carlow, Tipperary, Clare, Mayo, Sligo, Donegal, Galway, Roscommon, Laois, Limerick, Kerry, Waterford and Offaly have been identified as being at risk.Irish Water has mobilised tankers across the country to fill reservoirs that are most at risk to protect water supplies and ensure customers have access to water. The utility said it was closely monitoring the water supply situation on the Aran Islands, and was ready to ship water to the islands in the coming weeks if necessary. “We are in touch with the farming organisations and offering assistance where water shortage is leading to animal welfare concerns. In critical situations we will accommodate farmers who need to collect water by tanker where it can be made available to meet urgent needs.”The measures in the capital will only apply to domestic water use, with businesses largely escaping the ban.“Irish Water is mindful of the impact that a water conservation order might have on businesses and the tourist industry, and for that reason the prohibition is mainly limited to domestic users with the exception of gardens,” said Irish Water’s corporate affairs manager Kate Gannon.The watering of gardens attached to hotels or other businesses is banned, but garden centres and “visitor” gardens, such at the National Botanic Gardens in Glasnevin, are exempt from the ban.Water source levels, especially the main raw water storage facility at Pollaphuca, are dropping at similar rates to previous droughts in 1975, 1976, and 1995. Irish Water can produce 610 million litres of water per day to serve the Dublin area. Last summer an average of 565 million litres of water per day was used. This summer the average has risen to 585 million litres, but by last Monday the levels were at 609 million litres. On Tuesday demand fell to 603 million litres, but the following day shot up to 615 million litres, exceeding the production capacity by 5 million litres. On Thursday usage fell back to 607 million litres, but the recovery was not sufficient to avoid implementing the hose pipe ban, Irish Water said.A similar ban came into force across Northern Ireland on Friday evening for an indefinite period, with its water use running at 25 per cent above normal levels.The Northern Ireland ban covers similar activities to those in the South, but also extends to cleaning windows, walls, paths and patios using a hose."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3543076.1529934908!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"michael viney the beauty of weeping beeches","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWeeping beech: We found a drift of self-sown beech seedlings, a few inches high, and pocketed one for the garden. Illustration: Michael Viney The summer storm swept past in a hectic swirl of branches and I looked out at dawn to a polytunnel plastered with torn, wet leaves. But even on this bare hillside, so open to sea winds, our motley spinney stood firm. I am awed again by its billowing growth, nourished on extra breaths of CO2.The deeper greening of the planet, confirmed by scientific satellite, has encouraged much online enthusiasm. Even one large tree, I read, “strategically placed in a yard, can replace 10 room-size air conditioners operating 20 hours per day”.That would fit the beech beyond our window, now with an extra metre to its arching twigs and dwarfing everything around it in a great, green crinoline of leaves. But as a specimen of Fagus sylvatica, it may have a problem of identity.A tree can take a few years to show you the shape it means to be. Almost 30 years ago, wandering through the old demesne forest at Cong, we found a drift of self-sown beech seedlings, a few inches high, and pocketed one for the garden. A slow ascension in a sheltered corner brought its head up into the wind, green as a lettuce in May, fiery in the winter sun.Ten years later, at about 2.5m tall, its new growth surprised me. Instead of reaching for the sky, its slender twigs arched gracefully earthwards, a first hint that, rather than the common European beech, we might have adopted Fagus sylvatica pendula. Or are the branches just waiting to be hoisted aloft as the trunk piles on height and muscle?The weeping beech is the largest growing of all hardy weeping trees, reaching 25m or so (not on this hillside, it won’t). That’s long after a weeping willow has grown up and decayed.At Florencecourt, Co Fermanagh, there are “immense, round-topped specimens” of the weeping beech, along with the original wild yew, fastigiate freak from the nearby Cuilcagh mountainside and cloned for the sombre, columnar yews of churchyards.Half a dozen other Irish demesnes in the midlands count weeping beeches among their prized trees, and the named cultivars of beeches on old Irish estates run into some 25 variations of form, purple-leaved, columnar or absolutely twisted (“Tortuosa”).Moreover, England’s Kew Gardens have a remarkable walking beech, which is advancing outwards because its branches have rooted down and become a ring of young trees where they struck the ground.Our tree lacks the authentic, perpendicular droop and seems unlikely to start walking anywhere. It may be just feeling down at its singularity and windy exposure than actually wanting to weep (“even to a casual observer,” writes botanist Charles Nelson, “several different habits are obvious”). The arch of its branches does, at least, still admit me to its shade to offer the trunk a hug.Beech was typically a “big house” tree, but happily accepted by the surrounding populace as occasional “pin trees”, studded with pins and nails (later with hammered coins) in pagan, tree-worshipping rituals. But it never became a native.“Some modern ecologists,” Thomas Pakenham has noted, “advocate a kind of ethnic cleansing in which naturalised species, such as beech, are systematically hunted down and destroyed.”He might have been referring to some of those devoted to restoring and extending Ireland’s native woodlands, many in the remnants of ascendancy estates.In Management Guidelines for Ireland’s Native Woodlands, published last year by the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service, the beech is joining sycamore, lodgepole pine and rhododendron as an “invasive alien”.Authors John Cross and Kevin Collins point to its dense, dark shade and prolific seedling-scatter as a threat to the ground layer of woodland plants and the regeneration of native trees. Their advice is to “pluck out” beech seedlings in winter months, their identity marked by the obstinate, golden curl of their leaves.A national survey of native woodlands found beech in 69 per cent of them. But the guidelines are far from absolute in wanting them gone, if “mother trees” among them are doing no great harm. Indeed, their shade can help foster the growth of yews. And mature, even venerable, beeches have a value to the natural world quite independent of their beauty.At Clonbur Woods, for example, on the limestone shore of Lough Mask on the MayoGalway border, a restoration by Coillte has left some stands of beeches intact. Planted originally as part of the Guinness estate, part of their role in bioersity is to offer a home for the birds-nest orchid, Neotinia nidus-avis.It is a somewhat charmless waif among orchids, and its flowers are a pallid, yellowish-brown, and nectarless. Its leafless and parasitic growth depends on digesting a fungus that is part of the network of underground mycorrhizae that helps to feed the beech’s roots. The plant is also rare, protected and declining, with no duty to be beautiful."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3548712.1530380381!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"temperatures to dip but once in a blue moon heatwave to go on","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA man sleeps in the shade in the Phoenix Park in  Dublin.

Malin Head in Co Donegal found itself under sea fog and temperatures had not risen above 12 degrees by mid-afternoon.For the rest of the country, a slight dip from the heat of recent days could be welcome.“It’s been an exceptional heatwave that comes to Ireland once in a blue moon, a generational heat wave,” said Mr Eagleton. “Let’s hope it is.”Despite the weather and the public’s enjoyment of it, emergency services have not reported any serious recent incidents.The Coast Guard said it had only had to deal with routine incidents on Friday, including offshore pollution reports and coming to the aid of broken down pleasure boats and jet-skis.On Saturday, Dublin Fire Brigade reported that it had responded to grass or gorse fires in Deerpark in Howth, in Tolka Valley in Finglas, and in Griffeen park in Lucan.Next week, Met Éireann said it would remain warm or very warm, but with a greater risk of scattered or isolated showers and some cloudier periods.

Photograph: David CheskinPA Wire.Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster has called on Scots to back proposals to build a bridge to Northern Ireland. Ms Foster said there was “growing support” for the idea as she addressed an Orange parade in Fife.She was the main speaker at the Cowdenbeath event, organised by the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland. The DUP proposed a feasibility study into building a bridge to Scotland in 2015.“The connection between our two countries has always been special,” she said. “What better way to cement that relationship than through a bridge?“Amongst all the nasty and abusive comments made about the Orange wouldn’t it be great to become an actual bridge builder between Northern Ireland and Scotland?“Whilst some foolishly attempt to use Brexit to build a border between Scotland and Northern Ireland, we are more progressive, we want to build a bridge.”Speaking before the event, Ms Foster made a plea for certainty on Brexit.“I think most people want to see that now. We’re two years after the referendum,” she said.“It’s important that we get that certainty soon.“It takes two to tango and we need the European Union to step up to the plate and to recognise that Brexit is happening, so let’s make it a good Brexit for us, and a good Brexit for the European Union as well.”Earlier this month, Labour and the Liberal Democrats in Scotland criticised Ms Foster’s decision to attend the parade, stating her time would be better spent in Northern Ireland, where there is no devolved government in place following its collapse more than a year ago.The DUP leader — who addressed the parade but did not participate in the march through Cowdenbeath — said: “I am the last in a long line of unionist leaders coming along here.“I am not really sure why people would object to me coming here today. This is my culture actually, this is who I am.” - Ms Foster also indicated that her party may be unable to block a gay marriage bill in Northern Ireland. She was previously criticised by gay rights activists and Scottish National party politicians after it emerged she had written to ministers in Edinburgh in 2015 asking them to bar gay Northern Irish residents from converting civil partnerships to marriages in Scotland.After the Irish vote to back gay marriage and Westminster politicians demanded the UK government impose reform on Northern Ireland, Ms Foster shifted ground and became the first DUP leader to attend an LGBTQ event, doing so in Belfast last week. She suggested on Saturday the DUP’s objections to gay marriage would be dealt with by negotiation in Stormont when powersharing resumes. “We don’t have a majority so even if we did apply that petition of concern there’s no guarantee that would actually go through,” Ms Foster said. “So these are all issues we need to discuss in the talks and indeed in the devolved administration.” - PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3549975.1530384613!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"record numbers attend dublin pride parade","story":"Thousands have taken part in the annual Pride Festival Parade in Dublin, the theme of which is \u0027We are Family\u0027.

Photograph: Tom HonanA record 60,000 people turned out for the LGBTI+ Dublin Pride Parade on Saturday, about double the previous year’s numbers, organisers said.The event had a particular significance this year, coming 25 years after the decriminalisation of homosexuality in Ireland and a week after an official apology from Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to the men who were convicted under the law.Mr Varadkar came out as gay three years ago. On Saturday his parents Ashok and\u0026nbspMiriam marched in support of their son. Also marching were former president Mary McAleese and her husband Martin, alongside their son Justin and his husband Fionan.Ms McAleese had made headlines this week for criticising the Catholic Church’s teachings on homosexuality as “evil”, “unchristian” and “worse than uncharitable”.At the end of the parade in Smithfield she took to the stage and addressed the crowd on the parade’s theme, “We are family”.Speaking to those who seek to discriminate against the LGBTI+ community, Ms McAleese said: “Take a look at us. Listen to our voices. Listen to what we are saying. We are family. We are family and we will no longer endure the injury and the damage. We will no longer put up with those who tell our children that they are less than us.“We will no longer put up with the situation in many homes today where a child will be told by a mother that they are living in sin.“We will no longer put up with the situation where a child draws into themselves in fear because of who they are and how God made them. Those days are over.”For the first time uniformed members of the Defence Forces marched in the parade. They were led by Vice-Admiral\u0026nbspMark Mellett\u0026nbspand assistant chief of staff Brig-Gen Peter O’Halloran and accompanied by the Army band. Gardaí also marched again this year, having started participating in the parade in 2014.Representatives of all the major political parties took part, including Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald, who told the crowd in Smithfield that “the North is next” in the struggle for marriage equality.The DUP has insisted they will resist any effort to bring in marriage equality for same-sex couples in Northern Ireland after the Republic voted to do so in 2015.“The people here, the people of Pride are an unstoppable force. Rights are for all. Equality is for all. Change is coming and make no mistake, the North is next,” Ms McDonald said to raucous cheers. Speakers at the Smithfield rally acknowledged how far Ireland has come in terms of LGBTI+ rights, but said there was still more to be done. Among the outstanding issues identified were better psychological care for those struggling with their sexuality or gender identity and the need for hate crime legislation. Ms McDonald mentioned the suspected homophobic assault on Collie Aquino Teixeira McQuillan and his husband Gui by a group of men in Portlaoise earlier this month.“Let’s send this message to them: that we are family and that we will be safe. To Collie and Gui, a big loud message of solidarity from Dublin Pride,” she said to loud cheering on Smithfield Square.“You can change Ireland. You already have.”The event began on Saturday morning at St Stephen’s Green, where activists addressed the crowd on topics such as the need for the availability of PrEP, a revolutionary anti-HIV drug, for the gay community and better sex education in schools.They also heard from Senator David Norris, who recalled an early Pride march in the 1980s at which only seven people turned up. “People were sent to prison or the madhouse for compulsory electroconvulsive therapy. We got no funding. I had to put up all the money for the Hirschfeld Centre. They said they couldn’t give us funding because it was encouraging criminality.”Many of the people marching today are not even gay, he remarked. “It’s become Dublin’s Mardi Gras.”After the initial speeches and songs at the green, the crowd set off on a two-hour march through Dublin stewarded by gardaí with rainbow symbols painted on their cheeks.Cars were stuck in traffic for long periods of time while the parade passed, but there was little frustration. Motorists beeped in support and tourists and other pedestrians spontaneously joined in the festivities.Most revellers were wearing the rainbow colours of the Pride movement, while others more able to cope with the heat were wearing drag or even leather.“It’s beautiful for you guys, but some drag queens are going to die today,” drag queen Bunny O’Hare joked to the crowd at one point.Many businesses festooned their shop fronts with rainbow-coloured balloons and flags, while bars advertised their Pride parties. By far the biggest one is on Capel Street outside PantiBar, one of Dublin’s most popular gay venues.Last night a stone was thrown through the window of the premises with a note saying “Piteoga amach as Éireann”, which roughly translates into “Sissies out of Ireland”. Gardaí have arrested a teenager in relation to the incident.There was a heavy corporate presence at this year’s event. Aer Lingus, Indeed and Facebook all had elaborate floats, while many businesses set up tents at Smithfield Square, where the closing party was held.The organisers say such sponsorship is vital to fund the parade, but some in the LGBTI+ community worry Pride is becoming too commercial and is losing touch with its origins as a protest movement.This was reflected in the slogan of Queer Action Ireland, “Queer liberation, no corporations”, which members shouted behind a banner reading: “You only gave us rights ’cos we gave you riots.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3548628.1530299553!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"long hot summer ahead as brexit negotiations drag on","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFrench president Emmanuel Macron greets Taoiseach Leo Varadkar during a breakfast meeting at an EU summit in Brussels, on Friday. Photograph: Virginia MayoPAFor months it was billed as the “Brexit showdown”.The June summit of EU leaders in Brussels was the point at which the UK would have to demonstrate movement on a series of Brexit issues, chief among them the Irish Border.Otherwise, Irish and EU leaders warned, the negotiations would be in trouble. A withdrawal agreement, due to be completed by the autumn, would be in doubt. That meant the transition period sought by the UK – allowing it to ease itself out of the EU after next March, rather than leaving all of a sudden – would become uncertain.Were such a thing to happen it would cause consternation in London, as the UK was brought face-to-face with tumbling out of the EU next March.And yet, the British declined to co-operate. There would be no British proposals on the Border or the future relationship, London made clear, until it was in a position to make them. The UK would not dance to the EU’s tune. It would make its proposals when it was ready to do so. Brexit business continued, but at a snail’s pace.As a group of Irish officials waited for their bags at Brussels airport early on Thursday morning, one senior mandarin who works on Brexit was asked if he was busy these days. “Not really,” was the reply. “I wish I was.”Ireland had wanted to avoid a situation where the Border ended up as one of several issues to be thrashed out at five-to-midnight as deadlines loomed in the autumn. But that’s exactly what Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney now face. There’s just no getting away from that.So in recent weeks, the focus of the summit moved to migration into the EU, as a new anti-immigration Italian government found its feet and German chancellor Angela Merkel, still Europe’s most important political leader, came under unprecedented domestic political pressure on the same issue.The switch in focus was evident as the EU leaders arrived for the summit on Thursday, traversing the long red carpet in the Europa building to make their way for a few words with their national media. Few spoke about Brexit. The Irish understand this it’s not clear the British do. Europe is getting over Brexit. They have other things to be getting on with.Going into the summit, one reporter asked the Hungarian prime minister, the authoritarian anti-immigrant Victor Orban, why he persisted in speaking about an “invasion” when there were hardly any migrants coming into Hungary.“Come to the border,” Orban told him.“I went to the border, there is no one there,” the reporter replied.“Because there is a border,” responded Orban.The truth is that Europe’s leaders are having to accommodate themselves to the fact that in many of their countries, there is no support for admitting large numbers of migrants from Africa. They know that if they don’t address the issue, politicians who will address it – one way or another – will be elected. That, more than Brexit, or Trump, or trade, or budgets, is what this summit was about.Meanwhile, the adjacent Justus Lipsius building, where press and officials were gathering, went into temporary lockdown. Access to the building was shut down – nobody in, nobody out. Police clambered down manholes but emerged a few minutes later shrugging and shaking heads.The security alert didn’t keep out the former Ukip leader – and the man who more than anyone else made Brexit a reality – Nigel Farage, who buzzed about from interview to interview in the vast atrium that housed the hundreds of journalists accredited for the summit.For someone who wants to destroy the EU, he seems remarkably addicted to EU summits. The European Parliament, of course, pays his salary.The Irish Border? “It’s the biggest nonsense of all,” he said. “There’s a lot of Euroscepticism in Ireland,” he told Irish reporters. “Always has been, always has been.”And Farage was withering about Varadkar. “The ultimate Yes man in Brussels,” he said. But Farage is a marginal figure these days, even in the UK. His work is done. It’s left to others to pick up the pieces.Two events dominated Thursday night – the EU leaders’ dinner, and the England-Belgium World Cup match. Journalists tried to make the game a metaphor for the summit, or even for the Brexit process, with limited success.More telling perhaps were the photos released from inside the summit room, which showed Belgian prime minister Charles Michel present British prime minister Theresa May with a Belgium jersey.Varadkar donned a Belgium scarf. Everyone was on Belgium’s side. Nobody was cheering for England. British officials later claimed they had a jersey for Michel too, but were ambushed by the Belgians. Nothing seems to be working out as they hoped.When the match starts, the leaders’ dinner is ongoing they won’t be out for many hours yet. The bars around the EU quarter are packed Farage and the Ukip MEPs bray their way to the Place du Luxembourg, but quieten over the evening as England go down to a 1-0 defeat. In the press bar at the summit venue, there is a quiet smattering of applause when the final whistle goes. Perhaps it is because the Belgians are not a passionate nation perhaps everyone realises it will be duller when the English are not around.Before the dinner, there was a brief bilateral meeting involving Varadkar and May. Their personal relations are said to be not good, but officials insist cordiality and business was the order of the day. Varadkar restated his requirements on Brexit May told him proposals are forthcoming. They agreed to resuscitate the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on the North, which the Irish have been seeking for months. Some progress, perhaps, but not on Brexit.At the dinner, meanwhile, things were not going well. The new Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conti, attending his first summit after taking power on a pledge to stop the boats packed with African migrants arriving in Italy, blocks agreement on anything until the leaders agree a package of measures to address the migration crisis.This is not how the summits work, council president Donald Tusk explains to him. This is not the procedure. Conti doesn’t care. He is, after all, in government with the Five Star movement, whose slogan is “Vaffanculo!” (“F**k off”).As the session dragged on into the early hours, exasperation with the Italians grew. Conte told the group he was unimpressed at the way it managed its business. He was speaking, he said, as a former lawyer.The Swede Stefan Lofven piped up. He was speaking as a former welder. The Bulgarian Boyko Borissov said he was a former fireman. He is also a former bodyguard, karate coach and footballer. Though he didn’t mention that.At 4.35am, having hammered out a compromise that was half resolution and half aspiration, bleary-eyed EU leaders shuffled out into the Brussels dawn. Borissov said they should establish a trade union to defend their rights not to work extra-long hours.The leaders were whizzed back to their hotels for a few hours’ sleep before Friday’s session started, albeit a few hours late. The young guns – Varadkar, Sebastian Kurz of Austria, Emmanuel Macron, Xavier Bettel of Luxembourg – bounded in the old guard looked less lively. After the tortuous Thursday eveningFriday morning session, nobody was in any mood for hanging around. They rattled through the agenda, including matters related to Brexit. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier briefed the leaders on “some progress on some areas” – but none on others, including the Irish Border.After 2pm, Tusk and commission president Jean-Claude Juncker hosted the end-of-summit press conference with Borissov, marking the end of the six-month Bulgarian presidency.He milked the moment, droning on and on in Bulgarian about the achievements of the presidency. Tusk looked on impassively Juncker looked like a man who needed a gin and tonic. Finally, it was time for questions. The first questioner took the microphone. “What was the biggest achievement of the Bulgarian presidency?”Varadkar held his own press conference. He tried to sound optimistic about Brexit, but failed. The EU seems set to reject the forthcoming British white paper. He told Mrs May, he said, that there was “no point” in putting forward something that was incompatible with single market rules.“While we really regret the fact that the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union,” he said, “we’re not going to let them destroy the European Union.” A long hot summer is in store.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

And it is done for exactly the same reasons,” the 74-year-old duke said.“He wanted to establish his very important position and he made sure that people could see that very clearly. He gilded everything in sight. It’s incomparably vulgar. Bling is a big thing in Derbyshire and it’s all his fault.”The 12 Duke of Devonshire recently unveiled a £32 million renovation of Chatsworth House that took 12 year to complete. He described the make over as “vulgar but historically accurate”. A total of 192 tonnes of lead, 2,165 tonnes of stone, 4,000ft of fabric and 1,500 sheets of gold leaf were used in the refurbishment.  He said the first duke’s obsession with the “bling theme” continued as he bought the biggest and most expensive perfume burner, adding that like the US president such ostentatious behaviour was “done for show rather than necessity”.Explaining how his ancestors built up a huge art collection, the sixth duke, William Cavendish, extended the home with a “pretty hideous” wing, before amassing a collection of busts of Napoleon Bonaparte, the French statesman and leader, and his family all by the Italian neoclassical sculptor, Antonio Canova.“Is it not somewhat strange that you have all the family of the nation’s most hated bogey man and enemy in the central place of your sculpture collection?” he asked. “If we had busts of Saddam Hussein people would think it very odd.”He told how his father, Andrew, became “great friends” with the artist, Lucian Freud, whose art he collected.“They liked gambling and racing together. Lucien liked fighting. Thank goodness my father didn’t,” he said.Referring to how the more modern works of art, such as Richard Long’s ‘Cornish Slate Line’ have confused some art lovers, he said: “Each time it was moved, Richard would send two people to work on it. Quite often when they finished there would be one or two wheelbarrows full of slate whose status as works of art I have never been entirely certain about.”Commenting how his title of “Devonshire” is “confusing” because it does not exist as a place, he explained how, after giving a talk in the United States, one American toured the UK for two weeks trying to find his ancestral home.With a collection that includes works by the Old Masters including Rembrandt, Raphael and Velazquez alongside more modern works by Picasso and Lucien Freud, the duke insisted that ‘old’ or ‘modern’ categorisations of art was not entirely accurate or fair.“If you think everything was brand new when it arrived, it’s not really new and old. It’s really mixing new and what used to be new,” he said.The duke is reported to have discovered the word “bling” after hearing how staff used it to describe the recent renovations at his Derbyshire stately home.Education chiefs urged to investigate Steiner schools as official teachers\u0026#39 handbook \u0026#39raises serious questions\u0026#39Wave of universities offering free tuition to

appdigitalservices@telegraphJacob Rees-Mogg MP has made an account with the social media app Snapchat in order to preach Brexit and tell young voters about the “the big issues of our day.”The Etonian joins Jeremy Corbyn as one of a handful of MPs to sign up to the smartphone app as an official channel to communicate politics to the electorate.In his first address on the app on Saturday, in the form of a Snapchat story, he explained why he joined the platform, accidentally referring to it as a “site” rather than an app.  The Conservative MP joked: “It\u0027s the cutting edge of social media that has just taken over from the gramophone record.“If you want to find out more about me, the big issues of our day, please join this site, thank you.”The MP for North East Somerset then gave a two minute speech on the app that is mostly popular among young people, with 77 per cent of its user being under 24. he talked the EU being a “failing organisation” and having its finances in a dreadful state.  He said: “This has been a big week on Brexit with the European Council going ahead, the problem with the European Council is the EU are in desperate trouble.“Brexit has become a secondary issue of this failing organisation.“The biggest issue for the European Union is that its finances are in a dreadful state.”He criticised the The Italian government for asking for more money from Germany, said the EU is “squabbling over immigration” and ended with reminding viewers the strength of the UK in the Brexit deal negotiations.“They need our £39 billion, their finances are already up the spout, without the £39 billion they will be in worse trouble, he said. “This gives us the upper hand in pushing for a strong deal for Britain.”     Mr Rees-Mogg joined the picture sharing app Instagram in May last year. He regularly posts pictures and short videos of his family and constituency work to his more than 50,000 followers.    The Brexiteer posted a video of his son Albert learning to speak, and one of the words Mr Rees-Mogg was teaching him was brexit.He posted a video on Instagram in which he says: Can you say Brexit?His son then repeats the word, but it comes out sounding rather more like biscuit. Mr Rees-Mogg tells him he is a very good boy.Education chiefs urged to investigate Steiner schools as official teachers\u0026#39 handbook \u0026#39raises serious questions\u0026#39Wave of universities

hosepipe ban heatwave continues","story":"digitalservices@telegraphFarm workers picking lettuce in Lincolnshiredigitalservices@telegraphFarmers have warned of a shortage of lettuce while gardeners in England have been told not to use hosepipes as waters shortages deepen as a result of the heatwave.Lettuce and other vegetables such as broccoli and cauliflower could be in short supply as high temperatures put the produce “under stress” and stop them growing.Growers say that with traditionally high summer demand for lettuce they may have to import salad leaves from the US to make up the shortfall, at a time when more than 90 per cent usually originates here.Farmers have also said there could be problems with the wheat and barley harvest if there is no rain in the next few weeks, as these crops depend on rainfall rather than irrigation.At the same time water companies have asked customers to conserve supplies by not using hosepipes or water sprinklers, with the heatwave continuing into the weekend.The first hosepipe ban began in Northern Ireland at 6pm on Friday, and on Saturday Severn Trent Water in the Midlands and United Utilities in the north west began to urge people not to use hosepipes and sprinklers.The recent hot spell has put a strain on water firms, which have been pumping millions of litres into their systems.Severn Trent said: We\u0027re set for another hot weekend, and, with demand for water really high, we\u0027re producing millions of extra litres.We\u0027re asking customers to be careful with their water and for now avoid using the garden sprinkler or hosepipe.Trent Water’s reservoirs were at 88 percent of capacity on June 18, down from 97 percent in April.The British Leafy Salad Growers Association (BLSGA) said the soaring temperatures were causing havoc for growers.In good weather the crop normally grows rapidly, but at current high temperatures it effectively stops growing because it is under stress.Dieter Lloyd, spokesman for the BLSGA, said it looks entirely likely that there will be shortages from the middle to end of next week.One East anglian grower added: I think that if the weather keeps going the way that it\u0027s going absolutely we wouldn\u0027t be in a position to fulfil the demand that we\u0027re seeing with UK-grown produce.”The Met Office said the highest temperature on Friday was 32.5C (90.5F) in Porthmadog, in north-west Wales, and highs of 30C-31C (86F-87.8F) are expected on Saturday.This compares with average temperatures for the time of year of 17C (62.6F) in the north and 21C (69.8F) in the south.Senior forecaster Marco Petagna said: There\u0027s a lot of fine weather still to come.Education chiefs urged to investigate Steiner schools as official teachers\u0026#39 handbook

international monetary fund","story":"Created with Sketch.The message of the Brexit vote - and of similar protest votes in other western democracies since - was that if citizens do not feel economically secure at home, they will reject international commitmentsClick to followThe Independent OnlineBrexit is a done deal - but the social and economic wounds that led to it have not been healedAt the two-year anniversary of the Brexit vote, officials are engaged in fractious debate on the terms of Britain’s exit from the European Union.They are wrestling with several thorny problems, including the fate of the customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.But the political and media focus on the deal to be struck has obscured the real message of British voters. The vote for Brexit was a cry for greater opportunity from those who feel that they and their children are mired in lives that offer little hope. \u0026nbspBrexit is a done deal, and the exact parameters of exit from the European Union will have limited and short-term bearing on the UK’s economic performance.The basic facts are uncontroversial. Britain will trade somewhat less than before, at least until British businesses redirect some of their trade away from the EU to more dynamic Asian and US economies.The expected decline in the extent of international trade will, for a while, reduce Britain’s overall economic welfare. But, as the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik has repeatedly emphasized, citizens’ economic welfare changes only modestly when countries with extensive trade relationships increase or decrease the extent of their international trade.Estimates of large (sometimes very large) costs of Brexit rely on the wildly unreasonable assumption that British productivity will decline precipitously and permanently.True, the UK\u0026nbsphas been growing slower than other advanced economies since the Brexit vote but that slower growth is almost entirely explained by senseless fiscal austerity being pursued by Prime Minister Theresa May’s government while other countries have neutral or even expansionary fiscal policy.There has been much handwringing about the depreciation of the pound triggered by the Brexit vote. Currency depreciation normally makes citizens poorer: they pay more for foreign products and receive reduced prices for their exports. But the UK was running a large (and growing) current account deficit.Put simply, the UK was not richer it was living beyond its means. Prolonged current account deficits would eventually have caused a sharper and, therefore, potentially more disruptive exchange rate depreciation. For now, the depreciation has helped narrow the deficit (precisely by making British exports less expensive for trading partners – stimulating demand for British goods – and making imports dearer for British consumers). Britain is on a more sustainable growth path.Moreover, as I noted at the time, the pound’s depreciation reflected an abrupt decline in “hot money flows” into the UK\u0026nbspThese foreign funds were being used by Russian oligarchs and Indian billionaires to bid up prices of property in London. After the Brexit decision, the rate of rise in London property price increases slowed markedly recently prices have actually dropped.Since the modest trade costs of Brexit are at least partially offset by favourable developments, it is crucial to recognise what is really at stake. The Brexit vote expressed the anxiety of those who felt that their prospects of rising up the income ladder were vanishing. In her October 2016 address to the Tory party conference in Birmingham, Theresa May seemed to understand that the vote was a plea for greater opportunity and fairness. But she seems to have lost track of that insight.As my student Rachel Lurie and I find in ongoing research, those who voted against Brexit were predominantly low-skilled workers stuck in dead-end jobs or unemployed in Britain’s rust-belt areas. As former Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in the days after the Brexit referendum, unable to face Asian competition, British manufacturing “collapsed,” and industrial towns “hollowed out,” leaving semi-skilled workers “on the wrong side of globalisation.”But rust-belt parents had a deeper reason to worry. They were bequeathing poor education and work opportunities to their children. Thus, not only were they themselves stuck, they also felt powerless to create more opportunities for their children and grandchildren.The children, for their part, are as dispirited as their parents. Commentators commonly point out that young British citizens voted more so than their elders to remain in the EU. This ignores the large numbers who did not vote: these were young citizens typically unemployed in socially dysfunctional urban communities.For example, in Greater London, the voter turnout was 79 percent in affluent Kingston upon Thames borough but only 65 percent in Hackney, where large pockets of deep poverty and alienation persist. The non-vote of the young living in bleak urban areas was as much a sign of hopelessness as the exit vote of older rust-belt citizens.Theresa May’s early reading was right: UK\u0026nbspcitizens were indeed pleading through their vote (and non-vote) for a fair shot at the future. They were urgently calling on British leaders to revitalize decaying industrial areas and bring hope to failing urban communities in which they were trapped.The message of the Brexit vote – and of similar protest votes in other western democracies since – was that if citizens do not feel economically secure at home, they will reject international commitments.That crucial message has been lost amid the frenzied Brexit negotiations. Until it is heard, it will continue to haunt, and be repeated again and again.Ashoka Mody\u0026nbspis Visiting Professor of International Economic Policy at Princeton University and former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund’s European and Research Departments.

The setting is spectacular, at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, on the edge of the Swiss Alps. Palm trees line the promenade, there are snowcapped peaks above. You can sit and look at it all day, but when the sun goes down the town shuts down. The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Cale and Nick Cave (Emilien Itim)Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler.

He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Léon Francioli played Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback. By modern standards, this was virtually a live album.Nobs died in 2013, after a skiing accident, aged 76. The Jazz Festival is his enduring testament (he also gets a shout-out as “Funky Claude”\u0026nbspin “Smoke on the Water”). The Casino was rebuilt on the same spot, but sadly they didn’t recreate the Belle Époque splendour of the original structure. The modern replacement is a Seventies eyesore. Just think: if it hadn’t been for that idiot with the roman candles, that beautiful building would still be there. But, then again, we’d have never heard “Smoke on the Water”.Montreux Jazz Festival runs\u0026nbspuntil 14 July and Deep Purple play on 4 July (mjf.ch)Smoke on the waterEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Usually after brushing his teeth. Or when stopping by the bathroom, or anywhere with a mirror.He hooks an index finger into each side of his mouth and pulls gently upward. He puckers his face into a kiss, then opens wide into an O, trying to limber up his facial muscles. He practises both the Mona Lisa – slight, closed-lip – and a wide, toothy smile.At least, he’s supposed to do his exercises every day. Being 13, he sometimes forgets, though he understands their importance.“I need to stretch my cheeks,” he says. “I do it for a couple minutes. I have to do it every single day.” He exercises so much that his jaw sometimes hurts. \u0026nbspDavid and Victoria Beckham smile in \u0027amazing\u0027 family night picture How to get white teeth: Four top tips to achieve a brighter smileMan smiles before lethal injection for murder of two young daughtersKevin was born in New Jersey with a rare malignant vascular tumour, a kaposiform haemangioendothelioma, covering the left side of his face, squeezing shut his left eye and pushing his nose to the right. Immediately after his birth, doctors whisked him away to another hospital in another state – the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. His mother didn’t see him again until he was eight days old.The doctor told Kevin’s parents that the chance of him surviving was slim.\u0026nbspBut survive he did. However, the large tumour and the damage from its treatment prevented him from being able to do one of the most fundamental things humans do.\u0026nbspSmile.Most babies are born immediately able to communicate with the world around them in one way: by crying.The second signal babies send out is a smile. Newborns can smile spontaneously, as a reflex. This is sometimes misinterpreted by new parents as a reaction to their presence, a reward for their intense concern and sleepless efforts. However, it’s not until six to eight weeks of age that babies smile in a social way. Blind babies do this at the same time.That new parents sometimes optimistically interpret the first reflex smiles as meaning something more underscores the duality of smiling: there is the physical act, and then the interpretation society gives to it.\u0026nbspThe smile, and what the smile means.On a physical level, a smile is clear enough. There are 17 pairs of muscles controlling expression in the human face, plus a singular muscle, the orbicularis oris, a ring that goes entirely around the mouth.When the brain either reacts to a stimulus spontaneously or decides to form an expression intentionally, a message is sent out over the sixth and seventh cranial nerves. These branch across each side of the face from the eyebrows to the chin, connecting to a combination of muscles controlling the lips, nose, eyes and forehead.The basic upward curving smile is achieved primarily by two pairs of zygomaticus muscles, major and minor. These connect the corners of the mouth to the temples, tugging lips upward – often accompanied, depending on the underlying emotions and thoughts, by the levator labii superioris, raising the upper lip, and other muscles of the face.And as for the oft-cited folk wisdom about how it takes more muscles to frown than smile – the jury’s still out, especially as different smiles require different numbers of muscles. However, one source suggests that a genuine smile takes about as many muscles as a frown (and that a particularly insincere kind of smile might take not much more than the pair of risorius muscles).It is when we leave the realm of physiognomy, however, that the smile becomes enigmatic. This contraction of various facial muscles resonates across the entire arc of human history, from the grinning Greek kouros sculptures of 2,500 years ago right up to emoji, those little images that pepper our online communications.One study of smartphone users from 60 countries showed that emoji with smiling faces are by far the most prevalent in messages. The most popular overall – the face with tears of joy – was picked as the 2015 Word of the Year by Oxford Dictionaries. \u0026nbspJust as this emoji expresses more than mere happiness – tears adding the ironic twist so popular online – smiles themselves can convey so much more than happiness. Interpreting their nuances is a challenge whether dealing with art history or interpersonal encounters or the cutting edge of artificial intelligence.A 2016 study, published in the Journal of Nonverbal Behaviour, questioned thousands of people in 44 cultures about sets of photographs of eight faces – four smiling, four not.In most of these cultures, people deemed the smiling faces to be more honest than the non-smiling ones. This difference was huge in some countries, such as Switzerland, Australia and the Philippines, but small in others, such as Pakistan, Russia and France. And in a few countries, such as Iran, India and Zimbabwe, there was no trustworthiness benefit to smiling at all.Why? That question is also complicated, but in essence, the researchers concluded it has to do with whether a society is set up so that its members assume that other people are dealing with them honestly. “Greater corruption levels decreased trust granted towards smiling iniduals,” the authors concluded.That attitude harks back to a very old view of smiling as being opposed to pious solemnity. There is exactly one smile in the Old Testament – Job, ironically – though in many passages faces are said to “shine”, which could mean smiling or could mean heavenly radiance.Eastern religions often use the smile to denote enlightenment. The literal name of the 1000-year-old Flower Sermon, which describes the origin of Zen Buddhism, is: “Pick up flower, subtle smile.”\u0026nbspThe Buddha and various religious figures were depicted with serene smiles, though the original Buddhist texts are as devoid of smiling as Western scripture. Jesus weeps but never smiles.Nor did Kevin Portillo, not fully. He did not smile on schedule. At five weeks old, he was already a week into chemotherapy with vincristine, an anticancer drug so powerful it can cause bone pain and skin rashes. Doctors warned his mother that the treatment might leave him blind, or deaf, or unable to walk.“If he survived,” says his mother, Silvia Portillo, in Spanish, speaking through a translator. “The doctor always said he could not give us hope that he would survive.”Whether stunted due to the tumour or killed by the chemo, Kevin’s seventh cranial nerve withered. That nerve originates at the brainstem then branches out across the face. It is susceptible not only to tumours, as in Kevin’s case, but also to rare conditions such as Moebius syndrome, a congenital facial paralysis caused by missing or stunted cranial nerves. You can’t smile, frown, or move your eyes from side to side.“You essentially have a mask on your face,” says Roland Bienvenu, 67, a Texan with Moebius syndrome.Without being able to smile, others “can get the incorrect impression of you,” says Bienvenu. “You can almost read their thoughts. They wonder, ‘Is something wrong with him? Has he had an accident?’ They question your intellectual ability, think maybe he’s got some intellectual disability since he’s got this blank look on his face.”A lopsided smile can be as problematic as no smile at all.“I have half a smile, so even with that I am able to successfully convey emotion,” writes Dawn Shawn, born with a teratoma – a fast-growing tumour that was interfering with her windpipe.“The hardest part for me was seeing photos of myself smiling, because smiling exaggerates the fact that half my face doesn’t move very much. But eventually I learned to own it. That is me. That is how I look.”The challenges stemming from lack of a smile are frequently compounded. When people have a medical condition severe enough to keep them from smiling, other difficulties tend to be involved.“He was different than the other kids,” says Silvia of her son. “He was fed for four years through the G-tube in his stomach. He wasn’t able to have a normal life, because every few hours he had to be connected to the machine to be fed.” Little kids, being curious, would look and ask what happened to him, she says.While those who cannot smile can blame the state of their facial nerves and muscles, those who can smile are often concerned with a different aspect of physiognomy: their teeth. More than $3bn is spent worldwide on teeth-whitening products, with billions more spent on braces and on purely cosmetic dentistry: straightening crooked teeth, for instance, or reducing the amount of gum that shows when a person smiles.Caring for the state of your teeth is not a modern concern. The Romans had dentists and used chewing sticks and toothpaste. They preferred dazzling white smiles, sometimes rinsing their teeth in urine to enhance the effect.Contrary to common modern perceptions, the ancients had surprisingly good teeth, for reasons that have nothing to do with dentistry. A CAT scan of 30 adult bodies recovered at Pompeii found they had “perfect teeth”.Health news in pictures150 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active350 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.450 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.550 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms.

The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4050 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide4150 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4250 Green tea could be used to treat brain issues caused by Down’s SyndromeA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”4350 Taking antidepressants in pregnancy ‘could double the risk of autism in toddlers’Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightened4550 Connections between brain cells destroyed in early stages of Alzheimer’s diseaseScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memories4650 A prosthetic hand that lets people actually feel throughThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other way4750 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4850 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 4950 NHS agree, after loosing legal battle, to fund HIV prevention drugHaving lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP.

The treatment, that works similarly to a vaccine, is a combination of two existing drugs, of which tiny amounts are injected into the solid bulk of a tumour. 950 NHS reviewing thousands of cervical cancer smear tests after women wrongly given all-clearThousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.1050 Potential key to halting breast cancer\u0027s spread discovered by scientistsMost breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites. Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.1150 NHS nursing vacancies at record high with more than 34,000 roles advertisedA record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data. Demand for nurses was 19 per cent higher between July and September 2017 than the same period two years ago.1250 Malnutrition deaths in hospitals in England and Wales at highest level for a decadeThe number of people dying in hospital as a result of malnutrition has hit its highest level for a decade, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show. Death certificates from England and Wales show that malnutrition was listed as the primary cause in a total of 66 deaths in 2016.1350 Fertility \u0027breakthrough\u0027 as human eggs grown in lab for first timeHuman eggs with the potential to become fertilised embryos have been grown in a laboratory for the first time in a breakthrough that could unlock future fertility treatments. 1450 Cannabis extract could provide ‘new class of treatment’ for psychosisCBD has a broadly opposite effect to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active component  in cannabis and the substance that causes paranoia and anxiety.1550 Babies\u0027 health suffers from being born near fracking sites, finds major studyMothers living within a kilometre of a fracking site were 25 per cent more likely to have a child born at low birth weight, which increase their chances of asthma, ADHD and other issues1650 Over 75,000 sign petition calling for Richard Branson\u0027s Virgin Care to hand settlement money back to NHSMr Branson’s company sued the NHS last year after it lost out on an £82m contract to provide children’s health services across Surrey, citing concerns over “serious flaws” in the way the contract was awarded1750 More than 700 fewer nurses training in England in first year after NHS bursary scrappedThe numbers of people accepted to study nursing in England fell 3 per cent in 2017, while the numbers accepted in Wales and Scotland, where the bursaries were kept, increased 8.4 per cent and 8 per cent respectively1850 Landmark study links Tory austerity to 120,000 deathsThe paper found that there were 45,000 more deaths in the first four years of Tory-led efficiencies than would have been expected if funding had stayed at pre-election levels.Hours of commuting may be mind-numbingly dull, but new research shows that it might also be having an adverse effect on both your health and performance at work.  Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2050 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part2350 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.2450 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves2550 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.2650 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.2750 Ketamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors sayKetamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors say2850 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed2950 Measles outbreak spreads across Europe as parents shun vaccinations, WHO warnsMajor measles outbreaks are spreading across Europe despite the availability of a safe, effective vaccine, the World Health Organisation has warned.3050 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3150 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3250 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3350 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3450 Breakfast cereals targeted at children contain \u0027steadily high\u0027 sugar levels since 1992 despite producer claimsA major pressure group has issued a fresh warning about perilously high amounts of sugar in breakfast cereals, specifically those designed for children, and has said that levels have barely been cut at all in the last two and a half decadesScientists have made a “monumental leap forward” in the treatment of pancreatic cancer after discovering using two drugs together dramatically improved patients’ chances of living more than five years after diagnosis.3650 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.3750 Over-cooked potatoes and burnt toast ‘could cause cancer’The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a public warning over the risks of acrylamide - a chemical compound that forms in some foods when they are cooked at high temperatures (above 120C).3850 Cervical cancer screening attendance hits 19 year lowCervical screening tests are a vital method of preventing cancer through the detection and treatment of abnormalities in the cervix, but new research shows that the number of women using this service has dropped to a 19 year low.3950 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaThe ConversationIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4050 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide4150 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4250 Green tea could be used to treat brain issues caused by Down’s SyndromeA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”4350 Taking antidepressants in pregnancy ‘could double the risk of autism in toddlers’Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightened4550 Connections between brain cells destroyed in early stages of Alzheimer’s diseaseScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memories4650 A prosthetic hand that lets people actually feel throughThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other way4750 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4850 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 4950 NHS agree, after loosing legal battle, to fund HIV prevention drugHaving lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.This was due to two factors: short lifes – they didn’t live long enough for their teeth to go bad – and, most importantly, lack of access to refined sugar, that great destroyer of dental health.When piety was an overarching value, smiles were, well, frowned upon as the precursor of laughter, which was held in true disdain. Prior to the French Revolution, broad smiles in art were overwhelmingly the realm of the lewd, the drunk and the boisterous lower classes.“The whole face ought to reflect an air of seriousness and wisdom,” John Baptist de La Salle wrote in his 1703 The Rules of Christian Decorum and Civility, allowing that people might, under certain circumstances, convey the impression that they are happy, provided it is done within limits.“There are some people who raise their upper lip so high or let the lower lip sag so much that their teeth are almost entirely visible. This is entirely contrary to decorum, which forbids you to allow your teeth to be uncovered, for nature gave us lips to conceal them…”In The Smile Revolution in Eighteenth Century Paris, Colin Jones argues that smiling reflected the gathering sense of inidual worth that went along with the beheading of kings:This shift in social practices and in sensibilities involved the emergence of the perception, common in our own day, that the smile offered a key to inidual identity. In late eighteenth-century Paris, the smile came to be viewed as symbol of an inidual’s innermost and most authentic self. In a way that was perceived as both novel and modern, it was held to reveal the character of the person within.Photography, by capturing smiles, eventually helped popularise them. But the sitters in 19th-century photographs still rarely smiled, a neutral continence being both easier to hold over the long exposure necessary at the time and less likely to detract from the gravity of the occasion.“A photograph is a most important document, and there is nothing more damning to go down to posterity than a silly, foolish smile caught and fixed forever,” humorist Mark Twain was quoted as remarking in the 1913 memoir of an acquaintance.Around the same time, however, Kodak in the US launched extensive advertising campaigns to help consumers see photography as a means of recording joyous events and celebrations.Over the century, smiles showed a confidence in keeping with the rise of modern capitalism. “An insincere grin? That doesn’t fool anybody,” Dale Carnegie wrote in his 1936 bestseller, How to Win Friends and Influence People, embraced as a life guide by millions.“We know it is mechanical and we resent it. I am talking about a real smile, a heartwarming smile, a smile that comes from within, the kind of smile that will bring a good price in the marketplace.”Part of the attractiveness of smiles is they are so easily extended. Part of their menace is that they can also be just as easily withheld.“For a salesman, there’s no rock bottom to the life,” Charlie says at the end of Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman. “He don’t put a bolt to a nut, he don’t tell you the law or give you medicine. He’s a man way out there in the blue, riding on a smile and a shoeshine. And when they start not smiling back – that’s an earthquake.”Once Kevin was able to eat food, go to school and enjoy usual childhood pastimes – he became passionate about soccer and playing the drums – he still felt the tremors of having a half-smile in a world solidly established upon “a cultural expectation of pearly perfection”, as Richard Barnett writes in his book The Smile Stealers.“I couldn’t smile on my left, I only smiled on my right,” says Kevin. “My smile was weird … people kept asking what happened to me, why I\u0027m like this. I keep telling them I was like this when I was born.”If you see someone in a wheelchair, you anticipate that the person might have trouble walking and assume a physical condition is involved. But facial paralysis carries no telltale equipment, and is rare enough that the unaffected population is not generally familiar with the conditions that cause it, whether congenital or appearing later in life.One of the latter is Bell’s palsy, an inflammation of the sheathing around the facial nerves on one side that paralyses half the face, causing the eye and corner of the mouth to droop. It usually strikes men and women between the ages of 15 and 60.In most cases temporary, Bell’s palsy generally slowly goes away as mysteriously as it arrives. Doctors suspect it is caused by a viral infection. There are also traumatic events – car wrecks, sporting accidents – that damage nerves and muscles in the face, plus congenital irregularities such as cleft palate.A common condition that can also affect the smile is stroke. A sagging smile or face drooped on one side is one of three signs that a person has had a stroke and needs immediate emergency care (the other two are weakness or numbness in one arm, and slurred or garbled speech).While losing a smile is a serious blow at any age, it can have a particular impact on younger people, who are starting out, forming the bonds that will carry them through the rest of their lives.\u0026nbspOr trying to.“It’s a huge problem,” says Tami Konieczny, supervisor of occupational therapy at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHoP). “When you look at somebody, the first thing you see is their face, their ability to smile or not smile, or an asymmetrical smile. It’s your social world.“If someone can’t read your facial expressions, then it’s difficult to be socially accepted. It’s hugely devastating for kids. I had kids photoshopping their pictures. They are taking mirror images of their good side and copying it, photoshopping their own pictures before posting them to social media.”Photoshopping might work on Facebook. But fixing a smile bisected by nerve damage and subsequent muscle loss – Kevin couldn’t move the muscles on the left side of his face, so they atrophied – is far more complicated. Sometimes, it requires multi-stage plastic surgery spread out over a year or more.There are two major procedures available for facial reanimation, according to Phuong Nguyen, a plastic surgeon and reconstructive surgeon at CHoP.The newest, which has its roots in older techniques, is called a lengthening temporalis myoplasty – taking part of the broad band of muscle that powers the jaws and repurposing it to draw up the lips.That wasn’t ideal for Kevin because he had one side of his face working. The older, more complicated surgery was better suited to him.“Kevin had the most commonly done one, a classic two-stage cross-face nerve graft followed by a free gracilis muscle transfer,” says Nguyen. “To be perfectly honest, when Kevin had his stage, we weren’t familiar with the lengthening temporalis myoplasty procedure yet.”Nguyen later learned the new procedure from facial reanimation pioneer Ronald Zuker, a Canadian plastic and reconstructive surgeon, and from its originator, French surgeon Daniel Labbé.“My preference is to do it when kids are five years of age,” says Zuker. “At the time, if I can restore a smile for them, they can go to primary school, meet kids on the playground, meet kids in class. They have their smiles and are well-equipped to handle that situation.”Why put children through what is still elective surgery?“It’s incredibly important to be able to interact with humans on a face-to-face basis,” says Zuker. “If you don’t have the ability to smile, you are at a disadvantage. People cannot understand your inner emotions. They mistake your appearance for being disinterested, or not too bright, or not very involved in the conversation.”Still, some parents prefer to wait until their children are older and can participate in the decision.“If families want to wait, that’s perfectly fine,” says Zuker. “Sometimes when a kid is nine or 10 they look in the mirror and say, ‘You know, I really want this surgery.’ That’s the time to do it.”Which is what happened with Kevin. He was doing well, “even with that scar on his face, has always been popular at school,” says his mother. “He’s always been a happy kid.”But there were kids that made fun of him, she says. One day when he was about nine, he was sad. “I said, ‘What happened to you?’ He said, ‘Some kids, they’re not my friends. They laugh at me because I look funny.’ It was really hard for us as parents.”“We always wanted the surgery,” she says. “But we were told it was impossible. We had to wait to see how everything was changing.”At age 10, Kevin told his parents that he wanted to do what most people do without giving it a second thought. He knew it would be a long, painful, difficult procedure, but it was one he wanted to undergo.“He’s very engaging, very motivated,” says Anne-Ashley Field, his occupational therapist at CHoP. “His goal, I wrote in my notes, was to have a symmetrical smile.”As with smiles themselves, so the scientific study of smiles reflects the cleavage between the physical and the interpretive. The physical side is entwined with the long history of plastic surgery, which has tended to focus on survivors of diseases like syphilis and of the knives of vengeful authorities and warlords.The father of modern plastic surgery, Harold Gillies, reported in 1934 that restoring the ability to smile made patients’ faces “feel much more comfortable”. In addition, Gillies observed, “the psychological effect is also one of considerable value”.On the interpretive side, Charles Darwin discusses the meaning and value of smiles in his 1872 landmark The Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animals. Like many, Darwin sees a smile as the first part of a continuum.“A smile, therefore, may be said to be the first stage in the development of a laugh,” \u0026nbsphe writes, then reverses course, musing that perhaps the smile is instead the remnant of laughter.He observes his own infants closely, detecting in two their first smiles at six weeks, and earlier in the third. He comments how smiles do more than merely convey happiness, mentioning the “derisive or sardonic smile” and the “unnatural or false smile”, and showing photos to see if his associates can read what they mean.The scientific study of smiles finds differences in gender (generally, women smile more) and culture. Smiles are definitely communicative – people smile more when in public than they do when alone, and more when interacting with others than when not.Scientists have shown that smiles are far easier to recognise than other expressions. What they don’t know is why.“We can do really well recognising smiles,” says Aleix Martinez, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Ohio State University and founder of its Computational Biology and Cognitive Science Lab.“Why is that true? Nobody can answer that right now. We don’t know. We really do not know. We have a classical experiment, where we showed images of facial expressions to people, but we showed them very rapidly… 10 milliseconds, 20 milliseconds.“People can detect a smile even in exposures smaller than 10 milliseconds. I can show you an image for just 10 milliseconds and you can tell me it’s a smile. It does not work with any other expression.”Fear takes an exposure time of 250 milliseconds to recognise – 25 times as long as a smile, “which makes absolutely no sense, evolutionarily speaking,” Martinez says. “Recognising fear is fundamental to survival, while a smile… But that’s how we are wired.”Studies have shown that smiling faces are judged as more familiar than neutral ones. And it’s not just us that can recognise smiles more easily. “This is true both for humans and for machines,” says Martinez. Alibaba, China’s answer to Amazon, launched its new facial recognition payment system called “Smile to Pay” in September 2017.Although scientists have been studying smiles for about 150 years, they are still at the stage of trying to count and categorise types of smile among the millions of possible facial expressions.“One of the fundamental questions in the scientific literature right now is how many facial expressions do we actually produce?” says Martinez. “Nobody knows.”Scientists such as Martinez theorise that smiles – as well as frowns and other facial expressions – are remnants of humanity’s distant pre-linguistic heritage. Human language started developing as far back as 100,000 years ago, but our expressions reach back further still, even to before our origins as human beings.“Before we could communicate verbally, we had to communicate with our faces,” Martinez says. “Which brings us to a very interesting, very fundamental question in science: where does language come from? Language is not fossilised, not found in any other living species. How could something that complex have evolved from nothingness?”One of the hypotheses is that it evolved through facial expression of emotion, he says. “First we learned to move our facial muscles – ‘I’m happy. I feel positive with you! I’m angry. I feel disgust.’ Then language came through a grammaticalisation of facial expressions, which over time evolved into what we call grammar and language.”In October 2015, Nguyen, who plays in a band, cranked up some rock music in the operating room at CHoP – he thinks it was probably something from the Smashing Pumpkins album Siamese Dream.He began work by removing a section of sural nerve from Kevin’s right ankle and attaching it to the working right side of his face, running it underneath his upper lip, to the paralysed left.“We bring it across, parking it, waiting for nerves to regrow from the right side to the left,” Nguyen says.That growth took almost a year. The nerve fibres advanced about a millimetre a day (about 24,000 times slower than a snail).In nerve grafts like this, many of the fibres don’t make it across. This means that the nerve can lose the ability to transmit information – in a few cases, completely.“The thing with nerve-based surgery, you don’t get a lot of instant gratification or feedback,” says Nguyen. “You do the procedure and don’t know if it works or not. You have to wait.”During that time, doctors would periodically tap areas of Kevin’s cheek, to see if the nerve was taking. “When it tingles, you know the nerve is growing,” says Nguyen.The body has a way of covering losses. Removing that nerve did cause a small patch of skin on Kevin’s ankle to go numb. But as he was still growing, the numb patch began to shrink as the neural network took over its function.Once Nguyen was certain the nerve was in place and functioning, it was time for the second stage of the surgery.The mystery of Mona Lisa\u0027s smile has finally been solved Mona Lisa smile \u0027based on his gay lover\u0027, art historian claimsRussian Mona Lisa could be genuineSecrets of the Mona Lisa, BBC2, TV review: the face behind the paintOne morning in August 2016, he took a purple marker and wrote a “P” on Kevin’s left temple and an “NP” on his right, for “paralysed” and “not paralysed”, a common surgical precaution against the risk of cutting into the wrong side of a patient – easier than you might imagine, considering how much of a patient’s body is draped before surgery.“It happens,” says Nguyen. “You want to make it idiot-proof.” \u0026nbspHe also drew a pair of parallel lines, marking the location of a prime artery, and an arrow: the vector Kevin’s smile would take.The surgeon made an incision from the temporal hair line, in front of Kevin’s left ear, then pivoting back under and behind it, extending into his neck – the standard location for hiding plastic surgery scars. The skin on a face peels back easily. He attached three sutures to the inside corner of Kevin’s mouth and gently pulled, to gauge exactly where the muscle should be attached.“So you know it’s in the right place,” explains Nguyen. “If you don’t get this right, they’re going to have to live with it for the rest of their life.”The moment Nguyen put strain on the triple surgical thread was the first time Kevin Portillo ever smiled on the left side of his face.That done, Nguyen removed a 12-centimetre segment of gracilis muscle, along with a section of artery and vein, from the inside of Kevin’s left thigh, as well as the obturator nerve. The muscle was secured in place by a customised splint that hooked into Kevin’s mouth and was sewn to the side of his head to keep the relocated muscle from pulling out before it healed.The section was taken from Kevin’s thigh because the powerful upper leg is rich in muscles. “There are so many muscles that do the same function… you don’t miss this,” Nguyen says.Well… most wouldn’t miss it. Kevin, a diehard young soccer fan, did. “When the surgery came I couldn’t play,” he says. “I didn’t know it would take that long. I thought it would take a couple days and I would be back.”Just how long was he sidelined?“It was more than two weeks,” he says, sorrowfully.“He wasn’t concerned with how serious the surgery was,” his mother says, laughing. “He was more concerned with not being able to play soccer.”Over the next year, Kevin began to get motion on the left side of his mouth.“It’s really kind of a magical thing,” says Nguyen. “We do this procedure, a number of hours and effort, using not a small amount of resources. We don’t know if it works or not.“I saw him post-operatively within the first couple of weeks, he looked like he had this big bulgy thing in his cheek. Nothing was moving. All of a sudden, he was smiling. It was a really incredible moment.”Well, it’s magical, but it’s also hard work. Low-tech and high-tech.\u0026nbspKevin begins his regular occupational therapy session by holding a two-cent white plastic fork in his mouth and showing that he can move it up and down.“Try to purse your lips together to make it stand up,” says Anne-Ashley Field, his therapist at CHoP. “We’ve got it pretty solid in the middle. Try to work it over to the weaker side. Nice try… and that’s harder.”Kevin puts on purple latex gloves and pulls at the inside of his cheek.“You’re going to do your stretch on the inside,” says Field. “A nice, slow hold. Good. Bring that thumb up… Do you feel like it’s getting looser than it was?”“Mmm-hmmm,” Kevin agrees, gloved fingers in mouth.She takes some photos. There is a lot of photography in facial therapy, to track progress.“Now give me the biggest open-mouthed smile you can,” says Field. “Good. Can you make the left side go up even more? Try to make your gums even.”Then, after more exercises, she asks if he is ready for the computer work.They move into the next room, to a $20,000 Lenovo biometric therapy system. Field sticks a surface EMG – an oblong black sensor that reads electrical activity in the muscle – to Kevin’s left cheek and he plays a video game, Load Ship, where he moves animated boxes from a conveyor on the screen by smiling and relaxing.“Give me a big smile,” Field says, calibrating the device. “And relax.”He plays for four minutes, the game burbling a skittery kind of jazzy electronic music.They play a few other games: one trying to get a man to a safe spot as two serrated blue spaces come together. Then a marble maze.“How are you feeling?” she asks.“Hurts,” he replies.Physical rehabilitation is the part of the surgical process that often gets overlooked, but it can make the difference between success and failure.“It’s huge, particularly with facial palsy,” says Nguyen. “You can do technically very sound surgery on two completely different patients and have two completely different outcomes based on how involved they are with their own therapy… It just doesn’t look as good.”How does Kevin feel about being able to fully smile after a lifetime of not being able to?“I’ve been getting better on how I react. I do it automatically,” says Kevin. “Sometimes when somebody says a joke. It actually feels great now. Before it felt weird to not smile. Smiling with both sides of my mouth at same time, I feel I’m one of the other people who smiles right.”His mother remembers the moment she noticed.“We were at the table, we were eating,” says Silvia. “And then we said, ‘Kevin, are you moving there?’ He started moving. Not the way he was doing today little movements.”“We were eating,” he says. “I think she said something funny, and I just smiled.”And how does smiling affect his life?“Before, I was actually shy,” he says. “Right now, I’m less shy, more active.”“I used to have trouble expressing my emotions. Now people know if I’m smiling or laughing. When I laughed, before, I laughed weird. And right now, they know, bit by bit, that I was trying to smile, I was expressing my laughter and my smile. When I play soccer, and score a goal, I’m happy. I’m smiling, to tell everybody I scored.”You’d be forgiven for thinking that classifying and counting the different types of smile would be straightforward. It’s anything but.In the mid 19th century, French neurologist Guillaume Duchenne wanted to distinguish real smiles from fake. Interested in the response of nerves and muscles to stimulation, he applied electricity to particular parts of faces to see the results.He ided smiles into two groups: those that involved the crinkling of the eyes – sincere smiles – and those that used only the muscles around the mouth – insincere smiles.Today, the full smile that uses the muscles around the mouth and eyes is known as a “Duchenne smile” – and the fake one is the “Pan Am smile”, after the kind of smile you might greet someone with if it’s part of your job to be friendly.In 1974, Leonard Rubin described three basic types of smile, based on his study of 100 people:The “Mona Lisa”, where the corners of the mouth go up and outwards and the upper teeth are exposed. The dominant muscle action is from the zygomaticus major. About two-thirds of people studied smile this wayThe “canine” smile, where the canine teeth are exposed. The dominant muscle action is from the levator labii superioris. 31 per cent of people smiled like thisThe “full dentured”, where the lips are pulled back strongly, showing both upper and lower rows of teeth. All muscles are equally dominant. Just 2 per cent of people were found to smile this wayCosmetic surgeons, who have to be meticulous in identifying the smiles that their patients are paying good money to try to achieve, call these three types commissure, cuspid and complex, respectively.Phuong Nguyen, a Philadelphia plastic and reconstructive surgeon, attempts to clarify the matter using celebrities. The Mona Lisa, he says, is the Angelina Jolie. The Tom Cruise smile is a canine smile, and a Julia Roberts is the full dentured smile. This is a subjective matter. Other doctors place Jolie in the second or third categories.Smiling is not a realm given over to easy description. Contemplate the ideal smile as recounted by one clinician in the Journal of Clinical Orthodontics:An optimal smile is characterised by an upper lip that reaches the gingival margins, with an upward or straight curvature between the philtrum and commissures an upper incisal line coincident with the border of the lower lip minimal or no lateral negative space a commissural line and occlusal frontal plane parallel to the pupillary line and harmoniously integrated dental and gingival components.The total number of different types of smile is frequently debated. A recent BBC article gave the total as 19.Arguably the most important researcher into smiles over the past 30 years has been Paul Ekman at the University of California. His 1978 Facial Action Coding System, written with Wallace V Friesen, seeks to create an atlas of nearly all possible human expressions. Ekman says, in his book Telling Lies, that their technique for measuring the face can distinguish over 50 different smiles.Confused? You’re not the only one.

But can he be converted?\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent OnlineI’ll give her this: she is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in rapturesThree hours of Public Enemy: that’s what I got when I let my son have his choice of music in the car recently. Amid his vast collection of Pokemon trading cards is a set featuring the members of Queens of the Stone Age. And one of my favourite moments as a dad was his overjoyed reaction when I told him I’d got us tickets for Metallica. He’s a music-loving father’s dream.\u0026nbspBut what’s good for the goose has to be good for the gander. Or the other way around. So when Taylor Swift announced that her reputation stadium tour was coming to Wembley, it was a case of fair’s fair. It was my daughter’s turn, even if it meant this Metallica Dad agreeing to a descent into musical purgatory on a Friday night instead of catching up with Game of Thrones.\u0026nbsp“On no, you’ll love it, you’ll have such a good time. I’m so jealous!”That was the response of a shockingly large number of female friends and acquaintances, many of whom volunteered to accompany my seven-year-old daughter Rheya\u0026nbspwhen I expressed trepidation at the prospect of an evening in the company of 100,000 screaming Swifties.\u0026nbspThe ersity of those it came from took me aback: people I just couldn’t imagine would be fans were saying it.\u0026nbspThere were culture vultures and rock fans. Twenty-somethings, thirty-somethings, and forty-somethings. Some with no children, others with a hatful, whose daughters, like mine, they were taking. I sometimes found myself saying, “what, you too?”Taylor Swift seems to hold a good chunk of the female population in her thrall. And not a few men too. Quite an achievement for a onetime country singer.\u0026nbspIt seems to be Swift’s particular way with words that has drawn them in. Nashville is renowned for its story tellers. But Swift’s stories have resonated with a far wider constituency than is usual for singers coming from out of that milieu. \u0026nbspRheyaAt her Wembley show, she likened what she does to the opening up her diary. The chronicling of the ups and downs of her love life, her biting back at bad boyfriends, her reflection on experiences many of those who count themselves her fans will have had, speaks to them.\u0026nbspSelina Mills, a writer friend of mine, and one of those who had me saying “what you too?”, says she serves up “emotional truths” with that diary.\u0026nbspAnother friend, Karen Attwood, who runs Nine Media Training, says: “She’s as good with an acoustic guitar as she is with a big pop anthem and I just love her lyrics. She is having a conversation they’re gorgeous, often very funny and sarcastic.”\u0026nbspIt never hurts if you can make ’em smile. Swift does it for her fans in the same way that a cutting rhyme from rapper Chuck D does it for me. Hey, whatever floats your boat.\u0026nbspFrom beef to BFFs to beef again: Kanye West and Taylor SwiftNEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 13:   Kanye West (L) jumps onstage after Taylor Swift (C) won the Best Female Video award during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall on September 13, 2009 in New York City.

Right now, it’s them against us. This shit is ugly to the core. When it comes to the poor, no lives matter!” Now that’s the sort of the conversation I want to have.\u0026nbspFeeling suitably purged and, yes, a little self-righteous, I felt able to spend an afternoon in the company of Taylor. But after the first half hour I almost felt like saying “look what you made me do”\u0026nbspto Rheya. And my editors, because I didn’t find listening to her latest missive any easier than her fans might find sampling Slayer.\u0026nbspIt’s not that I can’t recognise a good pop song. Everyone has their guilty pleasures. But reputation’s hooks seemed swamped in a sea of expensive production. Here a backing singer trills, there a rapper rhymes, as the vocals tail off into electronic distortion. Meanwhile\u0026nbspSwift reflects on the trials and tribulations not so much of being a teenager, but of being an uber-famous member of the 1 per cent, a bona fide mega star, with the requisite stable of hip hop style feuds.\u0026nbsp1989, her first “official”\u0026nbsppop record, I found more approachable, and memorable. I confess, I already had some familiarity with that album on account of indie troubadour Ryan Adams covering the whole thing. He somehow managed to put a wistful and melancholy sheen on an upbeat and feisty pop record, widely recognised as the highpoint of her career to date. Moving further back, Nashville becomes progressively more noticeable, and Swift’s stories more innocent and easier to hear.\u0026nbspBut what about the show designed to showcase it all? If not the hottest ticket in town, it was certainly the priciest, part of an effort, it has been argued, to neutralise the scalpers who would have profited handsomely through gouging fans had Swift left money on the table.\u0026nbspI have to admit: a part of me was intrigued. I’ve been going to gigs for more than 30 years now (it makes me shudder to have to say that) and I’ve seen almost everything. Metal, indie, jazz, rap, soul, punk and more besides. I’ve been to decaying fleapit clubs, massive arenas, festivals and, yes, even great big stadia.\u0026nbspBut what I’d never experienced before my evening with Swift was one those bona fide pop mega tours the sort of thing featuring a cast of thousands, that takes several planes, and a fleet of trucks to move the thing from to venue to venue, and turns over the GDP of a small country.It was a world apart from the stadium shows I’ve previously been to. The Stone Roses, for example, needed only their songs, together with the odd inflatable ball bouncing up and down in the crowd, to make for a thoroughly memorable occasion last summer, one worth the price of tickets that weren’t exactly cheap themselves.\u0026nbspA Swift show, by contrast, majors as much on spectacle as it does on music. There were, at Wembley, enough huge snakes to send an ophidiophobic fan running for a\u0026nbsptherapist. Apparently their presence stems from an insult the Kardashian married to Kanye West lobbed at her, and they’ve since become something of a trademark. One’s probably pending.\u0026nbspThere was fire, and fireworks, and films. There was the obligatory army of dancers. Everyone was given a light bracelet on their way in, which seemed to change colours at the command of someone armed with an iPad backstage. The effect was actually rather pretty, if not exactly environmentally friendly.\u0026nbspThere was even a sort of floating cage of lights to ferry Swift between the three (count ’em) stages and, at the end, a bloke whom I’m reliably informed was once in One Direction, came on to perform a duet. Neither me nor my daughter were quite sure who he was, although his presence seemed to delight the crowd. \u0026nbspAs for Swift herself? Well, I’ll give her this. She is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in raptures.\u0026nbsp“Thank you for joining us on the reputation stadium tour,” she said. It was a line she repeated several times. I could almost hear the business manager whispering in her ear: “Don’t say anything that could be considered controversial, but make sure you reference the brand at least once every 15 minutes or so. It’s good for T-shirt sales.”In the middle of this assault on the senses I was again left wondering whether Swift isn’t in danger of losing that connection she has forged. But then, about halfway through, with her occupying stage number two, she produced an acoustic guitar and just sang. She did the same with a piano later on. It worked too. Whatever Swift is, she is no manufactured talent, incapable of surviving without studio trickery, and solely reliant on others to play the instruments. It made me wonder if all the extra stuff was really necessary.\u0026nbspThe reputation\u0026nbspalbum may not have done the business 1989 did, and Swift may have strained her connection with some, but her still loyal fans lapped up everything she did.\u0026nbspCrucially, so did my daughter. All my criticisms started to pale before her sheer unabashed joy. It would have made any parent melt, and the zone of protection I thought I’d established by wearing my Metallica tour T-shirt, with a suitably gruesome design, was breached. In a world that seems to grow grimmer by the day, I couldn’t help but be uplifted at my child’s innocent delight. I even found myself enjoying myself, if vicariously.\u0026nbspAttwood says part of Swift’s appeal, as a parent, is that “among all the hyper sexualised pop stars she is a fantastic role model for my daughter”.\u0026nbspTaylor Swift brings Robbie Williams on stage to sing ‘Angels’ Taylor Swift launches UK ‘reputation’ tour in ManchesterTaylor Swift marks Pride Month with heartfelt speech in ChicagoIs Taylor Swift off-loading her Beverly Hills property portfolio?And I get that. Even though with all that branding it sometimes seems as if she’s as much CEO as she is musician, she is, to quote Janet Jackson, in control.I don’t think Taylor will be troubling my speakers in future, but this Metallica Dad was able to make an accommodation with her.There is a postscript that may amuse you. Since getting one of those Amazon Echo Dots, my chip-off-the-old-block son has been constantly playing what he tells me are Geometry Dash composers. They play electronic video game music that leaves me cold.My daughter, meanwhile, has developed an obsession with Metallica’s Master of Puppets, to the extent that sometimes she’s even had me saying “can’t we have something else on?”.\u0026nbspIt means I might have to enjoy our next live experience vicariously. Next time they tour she’s made it clear she doesn’t want to be left out.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We don’t know exactly what she is asking for yet, so how can there be?“First the UK needs to decide what it wants, then there needs to be a discussion here and even if it is acceptable, there are processes that have to take place first before everyone agrees to move forward.”Another source close to the European Commission told The Independent: “Now we are looking at December as a more likely option, but there are questions about how much time that leaves for the deal to be ratified in time before March.”There is no hope really for October now. We don’t know exactly what she is asking for yet, so how can there be?In broadcast interviews senior figures also pressed the need for urgency, with commission president Jean-Claude Juncker calling for UK negotiators to finally “make clear their positions”, and Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte saying: “I am not losing patience, but time is getting shorter and shorter to come to an agreement.”On the record Downing Street is still clear that the UK’s intention is to secure a deal as quickly as possible, with October’s summit the goal.Varadkar criticises government for not planning for Brexit before EU referendumA No 10 spokesman said when last week’s get-together concluded: “We have always been clear the Brexit is a challenging process.“But we have made good progress so far, and are publishing a white paper next month setting out clearly what our future plans will achieve.”The food and drink staples at risk of shortages due to BrexitDanny Dyer’s rant about Brexit and David Cameron in fullWhy is Jeremy Corbyn staying quiet on Brexit?What do the ‘bad boys’ of Brexit have to do with Russia and Trump? Danny Dyer’s expletive-laden tirade on David Cameron and BrexitHowever, the view taken off the record by British ministers more closely corroborates the idea that the timetable has now slipped, with senior frontbenchers signalling that October has been becoming less plausible the longer the deadlock in London continues.December is also now being seen as the moment when a deal could most plausibly be struck, something supported by the fact that the government identified 21 January 2019 as a potential staging post on the road to Brexit.A proposed amendment to Ms May’s EU withdrawal bill, which has now received royal assent, committed a minister to making a statement to parliament if that date passes without a deal.But if December is now the new deadline, it leaves the prime minister facing a race against time in the new year\u0026nbspto win parliamentary backing for any agreement before Brexit takes place on 29 March 2019.She will need to win a one-off vote backing the deal and enshrine it in a piece of legislation, which both houses of parliament may wish to amend.People\u0027s Vote march - demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchRecent fraught debates and rebellions as Ms May tried to pass her EU withdrawal act have not gone unnoticed in Brussels, where officials are nervous that the prime minister may yet fail to have the deal they agree backed by enough MPs.But first the prime minister must secure the backing of Brexiteers in her cabinet, in a crunch meeting at her official country residence that should finish with the UK being able to publish its latest Brexit white paper, setting its goals for future relations with the EU.One potential source of friction, post-Brexit immigration rules, has been neutered for now, with government sources telling The Independent that element of Ms May’s future plans is more likely to be explored in a separate paper coming closer to September – but the vexed issue of customs arrangements still needs to be agreed by her top team.The Chequers meeting was originally set up to start the previous day, with only those who sit on the cabinet’s Brexit subcommittee attending.But with that group having already failed to agree to either of Ms May’s options for customs and leaning towards a harder Brexit since the departure of the more Remain-minded ex-home secretary Amber Rudd, the Thursday meeting was scrapped.Holding a meeting of the whole cabinet could give Ms May more cover to pursue a path which would see her keep the UK in a tighter customs deal with the EU and even the single market for good.\u0026nbspBut there has been some speculation that if she goes too far, then key Brexiteers – most notably Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox – could seize the moment and resign from her cabinet, badly destabilising her whole administration.Those close to Mr Johnson, whose name comes up more than the others, have rubbished the idea. Either way, Downing Street insiders admit that Friday’s meeting could well be one that runs into the following day.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Nine per cent said, “don’t know”.Asked whether Unite union, which represents more than 1.4 million\u0026nbspmembers, should campaign for a referendum on these terms, 49 per cent were in favour while 39 per cent were opposed.Members polled also believed that Britain would be economically worse off if it left the single market after Brexit by a margin of 58 per cent to 21 per cent. Just over a quarter (26 per cent) replied that it would have “no real difference to me and my family”.Mr McCluskey has previously refused to rule out a fresh referendum on Brexit but has echoed the views of senior shadow cabinet ministers who would rather have a general election should the prime minister’s deal be voted down in the Commons.If his union does decide to throw its support behind a fresh referendum, however, the ramifications for the Labour party would be significant – Mr Corbyn would undoubtedly face renewed pressure\u0026nbspto make a radical shift towards a public vote.The Labour leader has already faced calls\u0026nbspfrom his own supporters this week, as a new grassroots campaign, Labour for a People’s Vote, urged Mr Corbyn to support another referendum and avoid Ms May’s “kamikaze” Brexit.According to Labour for a People’s Vote, activists in 60 Constituency Labour Party (CLP) groups have pledged to put forward a motion on the issue to both their local party and to the national conference in Liverpool later this year.Pressed in the survey on whether members supported or opposed the approach by the Labour leadership towards Brexit, 52 per cent opposed and 29 per cent said they supported the party’s position.\u0026nbspPeople\u0027s Vote march - demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchBut the respondents said they held more trust in Mr Corbyn than Ms May in making the “right decisions” about Brexit.“This is not about playing games in Westminster but about real lives that are going to be affected by Brexit,” said Baroness Margaret Prosser, an ex-president of the Trade Union Congress.She said: “There are growing calls for a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal and they go far beyond traditional party politics.Lady Prosser – also a former deputy general secretary of the old TGWU which merged into Unite, continued: “I support people being given a democratic right to have their voice heard on Brexit before a final decision is taken to leave the EU.“Unite has an opportunity to back that too this week – we should stand up for members and speak up for a People’s Vote.”\u0026nbspThe poll was conducted by YouGov between June 27 and 30 June among 913 Unite members.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He added that “time is very short” and said UK negotiators should return to Brussels on Monday to intensify talks.The EU says a deal must be struck before October to stop Britain crashing out of the bloc in March without a transition period – a scenario that would be expected to cause economic chaos.Theresa May on Thursday night addressed leaders over dinner about Brexit for 10 minutes but her speech was apparently overshadowed by hours of discussions about the EU migration crisis, the main focus of the summit.\u0026nbspdidn’t realise Theresa May had made a speech in BrusselsAsked about Ms May’s dinner speech on Friday morning, Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, looked confused, and said: “There was a speech? Haha.”The joint statement signed off by the leaders on Friday, which was leaked to The Independent in advance, said coming to a deal “requires further clarity as well as realistic and workable proposals from the UK”.“The European Council expresses its concern that no substantial progress has yet been achieved on agreeing a backstop solution for IrelandNorthern Ireland,” it read.“It recalls the commitments undertaken by the UK in this respect in December 2017 and March 2018, and insists on the need for intensified efforts so that the Withdrawal Agreement, including its provisions on transition, can be concluded as soon as possible in order to come into effect on the date of withdrawal.\u0026nbsp“It recalls that negotiations can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken so far are respected in full.”The motion says that the Council urges “member states, Union institutions and all stakeholders to step up their work on preparedness at all levels and for all outcomes” – diplomatic reference to a “no-deal”\u0026nbspscenario.\u0026nbspThe main sticking point in talks is how to avoid a hard border in Ireland. The UK has flat-out rejected EU plans to give a special status to Northern Ireland that would effectively keep it in the customs union and single market, and says any deal must apply to the whole UK and be time limited. The EU says UK plans so far are not enough to prevent a hard border from happening.The UK also wants to time-limit the policy to placate Brexiteers who fear it could be used to keep Britain in the single market indefinitely, but the EU says it would not accept this.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

And, indeed, free trade is what most people thought they were ­voting for in the 2016 referendum.Free trade, cunningly styled “no deal” by pro-Remain spin doctors, has always been the best option, but has become even more attractive, now that the intransigence and arrogance of EU ­negotiators has become clear.Fair play, Theresa May and David Davis — you gave the negotiations with the EU your best shot but it’s now time to take the road to freedom.Carping critics say they could have done better, but the public instinctively knows that you’ve tried hard and that it takes two to tango.So, let’s be bold and scrap all tariffs on Brexit day, March 29, 2019.It will immediately boost living ­standards, by reducing prices, and will be especially beneficial for the less well-off. Juncker will cry into his claret at the new, competitive UK.Even companies such as BMW and Airbus, which urged us to join the euro and asked their workers to vote Remain, will benefit.Their engines, and other components imported from the EU, would continue to be free of tariffs. However, ­components from outside the EU would also become tariff-free, which is not usually the case today. Not only that, but their workers would be better off too, which is a plus for any business.And instead of sending £39billion into Brussels’ unaudited coffers, let’s invest the money here.Dividing it equally among our 650 MPs would allow each one to spend £60million in their constituency, on local projects. If MPs don’t like that suggestion, the £39billion could instead be used to reduce taxes or government debt. Our democratically elected Parliament can debate the best approach and decide.Most of us understand Chancellor Philip Hammond’s dogged attempts to get public expenditure under control, after the trauma of the credit crunch.But, it must make sense to invest this money in the UK, rather than the EU.Finally, free of Juncker’s shackles, we can regain control of our fishing waters, boosting the morale and income of our beleaguered coastal communities.No longer will 60 per cent of fish in UK waters be landed by EU boats.The public, too, has its role to play now. Project Fear, promoted by the CBI, the Financial Times and big businesses, has tried to frighten us with threats of gridlocked Channel ports and lorry parks across Kent when we leave the EU.Few believe them, but let’s call their bluff. UK consumers and businesses should now start to favour and prefer non-EU and British products wherever possible, dramatically reducing pressure on those ports.Wetherspoon has started by swapping champagne for UK and Aussie sparkling wine, and German wheat beer for the English and Welsh equivalent.As a result of this tactic, the public is benefitting from equal or better quality and lower prices. And there are a large number of other EU products that can be replaced in all pubs and supermarkets in the next year or two.The public instinctively understands the benefits of world trade, so let’s make buying non-EU a national goal for the next few years.It’s tough on our excellent EU ­suppliers, of course, but that’s the price the continent is paying, unfortunately, for a failing and undemocratic system, with unelected apparatchiks like Juncker and Barnier in charge.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And for the sake of society, it is absolutely right that this twisted soul was sentenced to life and should remain behind bars for decades.But the truth is that Kouider is not your average female inmate. In fact, she’s almost one of a kind.In the age of “equality”, it’s not fashionable to say that men and women are ­different. But when it comes to ­criminality, there can be no argument.Women make up a ­vanishingly small minority of those in the criminal justice system, representing less than five per cent — and in all but the most exceptional of ­circumstances, the crimes that get them incarcerated are, to put it plainly, petty.In 2016, more women were sent to prison to serve a sentence for theft than for violence against the person, robbery, sexual offences, fraud, drugs and ­motoring offences combined — and 80 per cent of those locked up for theft were shoplifters.In the past decade, the number of ­community sentences for women has fallen by nearly half. In 2016 alone, 8,447 women were put behind bars, depriving around 20,000 children of their mothers.These children will now be shunted around family members or placed in care, eating up even more limited resources than the £36,000 it costs to imprison someone for a year.And they will be stigmatised, probably for life, through no fault of their own. Whatever the macho “tough on crime” politicians say, it is plain that nothing is achieved by locking up women for minor offences.If we want to avoid pouring more of taxpayers’ hard-earned cash down the black hole of the broken prison ­system, we need to stop lumping ­vulnerable women in with violent men and start confronting the complex ­reasons behind their rare appearances in the ­justice system.Research shows that women in prison have often been victims of much more serious offences than the ones they are accused of committing.More than half report having experienced emotional, physical or sexual abuse as a child compared to under a third of men behind bars — and 57 per cent report having been ­victims of domestic violence.Depressingly, because many women fear disclosing abuse, both figures are likely to be an underestimate.The abusers, it would seem, are also the ones pushing their female partners into a life of crime.Nearly half of women in prison (48 per cent) questioned for the Surveying ­Prisoner Crime Reduction survey reported having ­committed offences to support someone else’s drug use, ­compared to just 22 per cent of men.Manipulated, under-educated and all but broken, these women suddenly ­surface in the criminal justice system, ­desperate for the help which would enable them to put their lives back on track.But instead of offering it, we treat them just the same as the low-lives who ground them down in the first place.And it’s creating a cycle of crime.Overall, 48 per cent of women leaving prison are reconvicted within one year.For those serving sentences of less than 12 months, the reconviction rate rises to 61 per cent.This statistic is hardly surprising when you bear in mind that many women lose everything as a result of imprisonment, and 60 per cent of them don’t have homes to go to on release.Without accommodation, it is much harder to get a job or training ­placement, or arrange benefits or care for children so, understandably, they turn back to petty crime.Women like Kouider must always be locked away and no one is suggesting for one moment that serious crimes should go unpunished. But when you have nearly half of all women in jail to support the drug use of someone else and nearly half having attempted suicide at some point in their lifetime — a figure more than seven times higher than that of the general population — it would very much suggest that ­incarceration is not the wisest response.And at last, the Government is latching on. Justice Secretary David Gauke has now abandoned plans for five community prisons for women in England and Wales. Instead, the Ministry of Justice will trial five residential centres to help offenders with issues such as finding work and drug rehabilitation.It may be a small step — vulnerable men are still at risk of falling through the net and Gauke must address that, too — but it’s in the right direction.If we are to stop our shuddering prison system from imploding entirely, we must start by separating the victims from the criminals.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here, and across the globe. Pourquoi? (That means “why” and is usually accompanied by a shrug and slightly hysterical hand gestures.)Fewer and fewer British kids are learning French in school. The number studying this absurd language has dropped by 30,000 in the past seven years. Instead, our children are learning languages which might actually prove to be useful later on in life.French is useful only if you visit France — and even then they’ll pretend not to understand you.Oh, and a small bunch of arid and desolate African countries which — trust me on this — you are never going to visit. Unless you want a dose of the Ebola virus or your head chopped off. French does not make the top ten of languages spoken worldwide.It only just crawls into the top 20 — between Marathi and Korean, since you asked. Marathi is spoken by some people in India. Not a huge amount of people, frankly. Nice people though, I’m sure.The Africans have learned the utter uselessness of French.In the past few years two countries from that continent have ditched French as the second language and replaced it with — of course — English. That’s Rwanda and Gabon. The switch has proved very popular indeed. More countries are set to follow suit.Do you know where else they don’t speak French any more? France. Well, in French universities. Science subjects such as physics and maths are taught in English.This is because foreign students coming to France don’t want to have to encumber themselves by learning a new language which will be of less use to them later than Swahili or Gaelic.This has been too long in coming. Right now, more and more British schools are switching to Spanish.This makes sense because while 437million people in the world speak Spanish as a first language — i.e. Spain, Central and most of South America — only about 75million speak French.That’s France, half of Belgium and about nine people in Switzerland.But never mind Spanish, important though it is. Foreign languages are too often neglected by British students.And yet we need them to compete in the world. English is the international language of commerce and culture, sure.I would make it compulsory for kids to learn Mandarin from the age of five. And as a second choice, Spanish — which we’re getting good at — or Arabic.Hell, we could do with knowing what that lot are up to. Our security services have struggled because too few English people have any knowledge of Arabic.And how about Russian?We need a bit of a revolution in the way we teach foreign languages here.For too long we have glided by thinking we need to learn nothing. Just a verse or two of Frere Jacques, that’ll do.But the world is changing and our schools need to change with it.Right now they are beginning to do so, but too slowly.Get the kids learning stuff which will help them compete in the world. And shove French in the trash can of history.Ding dang dong, indeed.THE wags seem to have had a nice night out in St Petersburg.Good for them.I do miss Abbey Clancy from the line-up, though.I suppose it would be a bit much to put Peter Crouch up front just so we got a chance to see her again.JUST as the England team looks like it’s going places and everyone’s happy, there’s a beer shortage.This is because of a national shortage of carbon dioxide.How the hell can we have a shortage of THAT?Your average human breathes out almost three pounds of the stuff every day.This is a national crisis and I think I have the answer.We need to get some people who are of no other use to the world to sit in vast vats of flat lager, belching continuously.Diane Abbott, for example.Humans involved in strenuous exercise exhale even more CO2 – maybe 12 pounds a day. So, Diane, on a treadmill, in a vast vat of lager, belching continuously. Yum.SO, the adolescent, unemployable liberal scumbags are still trying to get Donald Trump’s visit to the UK cancelled.Lefties who cannot bear to hear people express different views to their own will be staging infantile protests across London.There are even plans to have a giant blimp of the US president flying across the capital.A typically nasty and childish little prank by people who cannot abide democracy.And who do not care that the US is our major ally – and especially important once we have left the European Union.The protests are being supported by such organisations as ActionAid, which calls itself a charity.Make sure you never give those people any of your money.And one more thing, you protestors. You think Trump is only in power for four years? Think again. He will win again.Just as other populists are winning elections across Europe.The liberals have lost the argument and they are losing at the polls.NOTHING has given me as much pleasure during the World Cup as watching that fat, cheating coke-head Diego Maradona being hauled out of his seat, drunk out of his skull and incapable of standing.Hand of God – yeah. And the septum of Danniella Westbrook.The only downside was that the Argies won their game against Nigeria, undeservedly. They now face France in the next round.Argentina versus France. Like deciding who you want to win in a fist fight between Jeremy Corbyn and Nick Clegg. You kind of hope they’ll annihilate each other and no team goes through.It’s been a great World Cup so far, and very well run by the Russians. Best teams? Croatia, certainly.

Who would have thought?Did he mention that Airbus, who have been warning of plague and pestilence if we dare to leave, have just been found to have received illegal subsidies worth £17billion from . . . the EU?Did he tell his audience that even Financial Times bosses — a paper so comfortable in Brussels’ bosom it could redesign its masthead as a blue-and-yellow brassiere — think German car manufacturers need a UK trade deal, regardless of what BMW say? Did he heck.Big businesses have done very well out of the EU for years. They’ll resist every possible attempt to reform it or improve it and in Greg Clark they’ve got a man unimaginative enough to believe everything they say.There are plenty of other businesses who are looking to the future with confidence and are excited about Britain striking out on their own.And those outfits who are complaining about Brexit will adjust, just as they did when we (thankfully) didn’t join the Euro, because we’ve got the fifth largest economy in the world and they’d be mad to turn their back on us.It’s time the PM backed Brexit voters over corporate doom-mongers.LOVE Island’s Adam is a nasty piece of work.How ITV can justify him still being on the show despite being caught sending sleazy messages to a 17-year-old girl is beyond us.People have been thrown off for much less.

That was exactly what the meeting had been about, and everybody there knew it.The summit was Operation Save Mutti. Their mission: To stop Merkel’s government collapsing by thrashing out a tough stance on immigration to calm her critics. It’s quite a turnaround.Once, Merkel, with her open-door refugee policy, was queen of Europe. Now she’s a beggar. Suddenly, European politics has changed beyond recognition.The tide has turned. Those making the case for an open Europe are haunted and chastised. They are losing elections.Italy’s new coalition of left and right-wing populists is a fiesta of political contradictions, but they share one goal: To stop the migration population from growing.They want a European refugee policy that is pretty similar to what Austria is advocating.Sebastian Kurz, Austria’s young and energetic Chancellor, has begun to talk about “an axis of the willing” between his country, Italy and Germany.He has canvassed allies in Germany for his ideas on migration reform.Many in Merkel’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) are tired of her and her centrist style of leadership and see Kurz as their hero.Earlier this month he staged a press conference with Horst Seehofer, Merkel’s interior minister, coalition partner and chairman of the Christian Social Union (CSU) party.Seehofer now wants Germany to turn away migrants who do not have documents or who first applied for asylum in another EU country. Merkel has refused. If the decades-old CDU-CSU alliance ends over this issue, Merkel’s government would collapse.Until recently, it was assumed that Merkel would last until the next elections in three years’ time.Now many are betting she won’t even make it through the summer.There are two kinds of European solidarity now: The Merkel type and the Kurz type.To survive, Merkel must find a way to reconcile the two, but she is perhaps the only leader in Europe who thinks that is still possible.Countries to the north, south and east of Germany have already moved away from her refugee vision.Denmark and Sweden reinstated border controls in 2015.Viktor Orban, in Hungary, and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, in Poland — often dismissed as loonies and fruitcakes — feel that their views on immigration have been vindicated, not just at home but across Europe. And why shouldn’t they?Much as their migration policies are flawed, they are winning the battle of ideas over border controls and openness.They have many new allies in European capitals. Slovakia and the Czech Republic now have leaders who complain about Muslim immigration.And yes, Emmanuel Macron’s victory was astonishing — but a third of France still voted for right-winger Marine Le Pen.Merkel’s view of Europe was the consensus. When Macron took power, it was hoped Europe would be purged of grubby thoughts about migrants.Merkel’s case for a common European policy on refugees seemed likely to win.But the elections in Italy and Austria changed all that. Having populists in former Soviet bloc states is one thing. Having them running Western European states is quite another.The balance of power keeps changing, shifting ever further from Merkel.The incoming Slovenian PM, Janez Jansa, is a migration hardliner and, like others in the Balkan region, sees Europe’s political future as being represented by Budapest rather than Berlin.So what to do? Merkel now stands as the charity case, not the powerbroker.Macron offers her some respite, saying he will help her by taking back the few asylum seekers in Germany who registered first in France.But far more refugees will have registered first in Italy, and the odds on its new government taking them are slim. In Austria, Kurz is focusing on a plan to force refugees to apply for asylum before they enter the EU.When Austria assumes the EU’s rotating presidency next month, Kurz will make this a centrepiece of his agenda. Kurz’s stance is unacceptable to Merkel. Belgium and the Netherlands are also protesting because they fear that forcing migrants to apply from overseas centres will lead to inhumane migration detention camps, as seen in Australia.But can Merkel fight against it?If she wants to stay in power she will need to be wary of those in her own CDU ranks who are closer to Seehofer.If her leadership recently took them to their worst election results since 1949, what might await them after more years of Merkel in power?Whatever she now chooses to do will cause her reputation to crumble.If she fires Seehofer, it may be the end of the German centre-right as the party in charge.If she goes along with Austrian and Italian demands to turn back migrants, she will be admitting that her open-door policy on migration killed her own vision of a welcoming Europe.She has run out of good options, as well as political authority. She may limp on in Germany for a few more years, but her long reign in Europe has ended.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Since then Johnny has seen his life spiral out of control.He admits to struggling with drugs and depression and he’s lost much of his £459million fortune.He’s embroiled in court battles over money and was pictured recently looking incredibly thin and pale.When I interviewed him at the end of last year he was clearly “well refreshed” and virtually incoherent.Maybe having to face up to his child’s health problems could actually be a turning point for Johnny.His family need him right now and he will have to step up to the mark. ONE of the feel-good ­stories of the week was the kind students who raised enough money to send Bristol University cleaner Herman Gordon to visit his family in Jamaica.Herman was beside himself with happiness and cried tears of joy when he opened his gift envelope to find it stuffed with cash for the trip.He’s clearly a very ­special man and much loved by the students, who said he brightened their lives and they simply wanted to give him ­something in return.Herman was part of the Windrush generation and can’t afford to go back to Jamaica too often.But now he and his wife can have a wonderful visit.This little shaft of light gives me hope for the future and shows there is still a lot of decency in the world.Herman also now knows that he makes a real difference and is greatly valued – and you cannot put a price on that. A HUGE thank you to everyone at Edinburgh Napier University, which presented me with an honorary arts doctorate this week.It was so moving to see all the young, hard-working students come up on stage at the Usher Hall to receive their degrees in front of beaming parents, family and friends.Two years ago I saw my daughter Rosie awarded her honours degree in journalism on the very same stage.I was so proud of her I could have burst.It was lovely to be able to follow in her footsteps and it really was a day to remember.  DESPITE not having watched a frame of Love Island, I’m obviously well aware of the show that has divided the nation.But what really strikes me is how similar they all look in the promos and newspaper photos.It’s no wonder the girls bounce from one chap to another when they are merely identical hairless Ken dolls.The same goes for most of the girls. The hair colour and bikinis might be a different hue, but they have that heavily browned, slightly startled, puffy-mouthed look of a sex doll.Which I suppose is the point.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The online casino also hosts six different variants of Monopoly for players to try."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tp-image-cartoon.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pm theresa may retreats to country bolthole chequers to thrash out brexit plan with cabinet","story":"For on Friday, Theresa May is summoning the entire Cabinet to Chequers, her country retreat, to thrash this out.Cabinet Brexiteers, though, are already nervous about getting bounced — of being presented with a done deal they will have to either accept or resign over at a Chequers meetingThis meeting is taking place far too late. Last October, this column urged Mrs May to get the Cabinet to Chequers and not let them leave until they had agreed on the final deal with the EU they should be aiming for.This delay in setting out what the UK wants is one of the many mistakes that have handed the initiative in these negotiations to the EU.In an attempt to prevent any walkouts at Chequers, the Prime Minister will spend the next few days seeing senior ministers individually. “She’s peeling off people one by one,” I’m told.But I understand there has still not yet been a “model that has been selected to go forward for adjudication by the Cabinet”. I am told the approach at the meeting will be “to rule things out rather than rule things in”.Cabinet Brexiteers, though, are already nervous about getting bounced — of being presented with a done deal they will have to either accept or resign over.One of those co-ordinating the Brexiteer response tells me: “She’ll have to show her hand before Chequers. The idea of bouncing people with papers they haven’t seen is completely unrealistic as to where we are.It might have been possible six months ago, it is not possible now.”Brexiteers are worried about Downing Street’s direction of travel.One tells me: “They’re prepared to give away things, but they don’t understand what they are giving away.”The expectation is that the Government will essentially propose staying in the single market for goods.But what won’t be addressed is what this means for immigration.The EU will — at least initially — demand free movement in exchange for the UK staying in the single market for goods.I understand the current plan is for the white paper to say the UK acknowledges that labour mobility deals normally go alongside trade deals. But there won’t be much more detail than that.Sajid Javid, the new Home Secretary, takes the view that the Government shouldn’t put immigration on the table in these talks until it knows what it wants.He is also of the view that if the EU want a deal on immigration then they should have to ask for it.As a former banker, with experience of commercial negotiations, he — unlike too many people in the Government machine — understands the difference between bid and offer.Among Cabinet ministers there is a growing view that they will all be back at Chequers in September to discuss how much they are prepared to move on immigration.But any attempt to get the UK to allow any EU citizen with a job to come here will encounter resistance.“If you can come if you have a job, that’s basically free movement,” one ally of Brexit Secretary David Davis tells me.Getting the Cabinet to agree at Chequers, though, is only the first challenge for Mrs May.The next — and even more difficult one — is to get the EU to engage with what she is proposing. CONCERNS are mounting in Whitehall about the Nato summit, and what Donald Trump might say and do.Compounding the issue is that Trump will go straight from the summit to a dinner in Britain to mark the start of his visit here – meaning Theresa May won’t be able to avoid having to say what she thinks of his comments.One well-placed Government source insists to me that the Trump/May relationship is better than it is portrayed.But this source admits his telephone manner can be rather surprising.I am told that, in reference to Brexit, he regularly starts their conversations with: “Are you out yet?Mrs May hosts his UK visit on July 13, right after he’s laid the law down at the Nato summit and before he flies out to meet Vladimir Putin. She must stress that lives are at stake. That the West’s security has relied on Nato for 70 years.And that it would be a disaster for the President to undermine it now, with Russia an increasing global menace.THE restoration work at the House of Commons has hit a snag.Some of the oil paintings, which need to be moved, are too big to go through the doors of the rooms they are in.This means that the oil will need to be rehydrated, a complex process, before the canvases are rolled up so they can be moved.This is another reminder of how difficult it will be to do these restoration works without going way over budget. MICHAEL GOVE has ripped up Theresa May’s plan for a new customs partnership with the EU.To the surprise of officials present, Gove tore the document in two at a meeting on Wednesday.After the Brexit inner Cabinet couldn’t reach a consensus on what customs relationship to have with the EU after Brexit, it was split into working groups to look at the two options.Gove was looking at the new customs partnership, which is Theresa May’s preferred model and would see the UK collecting tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Nearly all Brexiteers, including Gove, see this model as bureaucratic, unworkable and fear it will make Britain a far less attractive country to do a trade deal with.Gove and Liam Fox, the two Brexiteers on the three-man working group, had made these points repeatedly in the six weeks of meetings they have had on the subject.But on Wednesday night, when they were presented with the civil service summary of their discussions, they found these points had been downplayed to almost nothing.Instead, the document implied the group thought the new customs partnership was workable.Gove was livid about this and physically ripped it up to show he wasn’t prepared to accept the document as a summary of their discussions.This flash of anger shows that Downing Street would be making a very big mistake if it assumed Gove will accept – and sell to fellow Brexiteers – any deal with the EU, no matter how flawed it is and how much it tied the UK’s hands for the future.Customs will be one of the biggest bones of contention at Chequers.I understand there is talk the model favoured by Brexiteers MaxFax might be altered to include tariff alignment with the EU.But if that’s the case, then Britain WON’T be able to have a proper, independent trade policy.One of the Brexiteers close to the discussions warns this is the “breaking point of what people are prepared to accept”. THERESA MAY is making it clear to everyone in government that she intends to stay on as Prime Minister after Brexit day, March 30, 2019.Yesterday afternoon, Downing Street summoned the Government’s political advisers and told them to start working on measures to be included in the next Queen’s Speech, to take place in spring and after Brexit day.A Downing Street source tells me: “As you would expect, the Government is focusing on a comprehensive programme of domestic legislation for the next session of Parliament.This will include new plans for the country’s future outside the European Union.”This Queen’s Speech will be huge for Mrs May.It will be her last best chance to show her party she has a domestic agenda that justifies her staying on as Prime Minister.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She won’t survive conceding on any of them.We weep for Downing Street’s tactics.They seem ­terrified that the PM might have to walk out of talks. Why? If the EU continues to demand everything on its terms, she must do exactly that.They’ll call back.GOBBY Irish PM Leo Varadkar has no idea how much damage he does with every Brexit utterance.His latest salvo revealed a patronising, pompous arrogance as misplaced as it was sickening.The mighty EU won’t change its rules for little Britain, Varadkar sneered.“We’re 27 member states — the UK is one country,” he said. “We’re 500million people, the UK is 60million. That basic fact has to be understood.”The Sun has some more basic facts:Ireland’s population is 4.8million. The UK’s is 66.5million.Ireland’s economy relies on us so heavily that a “no deal” is forecast to throw 2.5 per cent of its workforce on the dole. It is far more exposed than any other EU country, or the UK.Our billions bailed out broke Ireland in 2010. Has Varadkar forgotten?Is he happy to sour relations with millions of UK customers with long memories, who may take against Irish goods?A wiser man would have acted as peacemaker, constructively helping both sides forge a historic deal in all our interests, including those of his country and its wonderful people.Instead he chose another role . . . as the snivelling suck-up egging on the playground bullies.THERESA May must seize her crucial opportunity to save Nato next month.Donald Trump is rightly berating Europe’s major powers for failing, unlike Britain, to fund their defence. But Nato is not some unfavourable trade deal he can abandon at a stroke.Mrs May hosts his UK visit on July 13, right after he’s laid the law down at the Nato summit and before he flies out to meet Vladimir Putin. She must stress that lives are at stake.

repeatedly referred to childrens services but only getting help when problems reach crisis point.The government must urgently put an end to the punishing funding cuts which give councils no option but to drastically shrink childrens support services.Otherwise more and more vulnerable children will be left at potential risk and without the early help they desperately need.The young boy is now living with long-term foster carers, has lost a lot of weight and is now settled in school."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PP-111.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"640\" width=\"960","title":"theresa may cabinet can score big win for britain","story":"During Friday’s crucial discussions, they must focus on how we can deliver the vision for an outward-looking global Britain which we committed to in our manifesto.The British public have chosen a positive future — to govern ourselves rather than have an unaccountable and undemocratic elite in Europe tell us how to live our lives.This means ensuring that as we depart from the EU we take back full control over our laws, our borders and our money.Britain must leave the Customs Union and the Single Market to deliver  on the 2016 referendum result.To stay partly or wholly in the EU would betray the public.These negotiations are about much more than the UK’s future relationship with the EU. They must also achieve an outcome which allows the UK to take back full control over our laws, our borders and our money.Any wavering or compromise that keeps Britain as a cash cow for Europe, and our people and businesses subjugated to EU laws that hurt our interests, would be a spectacular own goal.Instead of pandering to those who want to keep Britain in the EU, the Single Market and Customs Union, the team at Chequers must now stand firm and not back down.Their strategy and game plan must be to stand up to the EU and stop letting their negotiating team walk all over us.So far we have been negotiating with the EU in good faith and we have conceded too much ground for little in return.We have pledged a divorce settlement totalling £40billion and while we have advanced a package to ensure that the rights of EU citizens currently in the UK are protected, the rest of the EU have made alarmingly little progress on protecting the rights of British citizens living elsewhere in the EU.Conceding further ground to the EU now will leave Britain exposed at the back and will let the greedy undemocratic EU leaders take advantage of our open goal.The country also decided to take Britain on a new path to future prosperity.Outside of the EU the world is growing at a fast pace.Expanding consumer markets present new opportunities for exciting trade and investment partnerships. Technological change and innovation happens worldwide and the EU’s place in the global economy is falling fast.Ministers must not allow Britain to slip in the world trade league by being chained in any way to Brussels as the EU sinks.Without the straitjacket of EU rules Britain will stand out as a strong place for businesses to invest.While an out-of-touch elite who want to keep Britain in the EU continue to spread fear and doom and gloom, in the real world our economy is doing well.We have some great foundations and since the referendum Britain has seen a surge in foreign direct investment to record levels which shows the high degree of confidence investors have in Britain.They see that outside of the EU Britain will be successful and everyone in the Cabinet should stop playing defensively and commit to that vision too.We are at a crucial moment in our history and Cabinet members need to understand the magnitude of the decisions   they are making.Now is not the time for grandstanding or for egos to get in the way. Ministers need to tighten ranks and play as a united team to achieve victory.The future of our country is far too important to leave to chance and if the Cabinet gets its act together this week then we will be in control of our own destiny.In years to come, people will look back at the decisions we make today and judge members of this Government on whether they have advanced the cause of freedom, prosperity and democracy with a well-executed match- winning plan . . . or left our country to the fate and uncertainty of a penalty shoot-out.Priti Patel is a Conservative MP, representing  Witham in Essex. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Girls carry flick-knives and hide razor blades under their tongues.“We have to hold our spots (drug sales points) — it feels like there is no choice.”Her chilling account comes after The Sun on Sunday launched the Beat The Blades campaign last month in a bid to combat the UK’s knife crime epidemic. Nancy claims her experiences on the street have given her insight for an unlikely future career — as a policewoman.She said: “If the police want to know how to stop young people stabbing each other, they should take the time to get to know us.“I’ve met a lot of police in my life. Some of them are really tired and fed up. But some of them get a buzz out of stopping people and being violent.“The best police of all are the ones who try to get along with us and stay nice and calm.“I was in a park recently when some trouble kicked off and a boy I was with took a swing at an officer.“He got restrained on the floor but the officer stayed calm and made me laugh.“The boy was shouting something about me, and the officer told him jokingly, ‘What’s my wife got to do with this?’“It made us all laugh and stopped more violence from happening.”She added: “We are a generation who have grown up watching aggressive things on social media and playing violent video games, but so have the police.“Some people might find it hard to believe I want to be a policewoman but I know I could make a big difference.Words such as “skengs”, meaning knife or gun, cannot be detected by their computer algorithms, according to Barnardo’s chief exec Javed Khan.He warned social media is being used to manipulate vulnerable youngsters to make them join gangs – a practice known as “baiting the skets”. Mr Khan said: “This is dangerous because social media companies or the police may not be aware of the context and may not flag up the content.“Tech companies are simply not doing enough to protect children.”Nearly 80 per cent of Barnardo’s front-line staff believe drugs gangs use social media to recruit children as young as eight for drug running, knife attacks and sex trafficking.Met Police chief Cressida Dick has said social media apps and sites can “rev people up” and make street violence “more likely”.“If they had more people like me, there would be more trust and more officers would be able to build relationships with kids in their schools and homes.“It’s a long shot, I know, but I really hope I get an interview. We’ll have to see if one of the big police bosses is willing to give me a chance.”Last month The Sun on Sunday unveiled a task force including youth workers, community leaders and MPs to try to tackle the problem.It called for a ban on online knife sales, more community sports, specially trained school bobbies, a crackdown on middle-class drug use and help for child drug-deal “slaves”.Home Secretary Sajid Javid backed the initiative, saying: “I’m really pleased you’ve done this.”Nancy, who has had to conceal her identity for her own safety, was just seven when her mum disappeared back to Africa, leaving her to fend for herself for two years.She recalled: “I used to cry every single night, wondering where my mum was and praying she’d come home. By the time she returned I was a different kid — restless and insecure.“It didn’t help that we kept getting evicted. So every time I got settled we would have to pack our bags again.”BAIT THE SKETS: Manipulate kids to make them join gangsSKENGS: GunsBORRAS: KnivesNITTYS: Drug addictsNEEKS: Drug dealersCRASH CORN: Fire your gunHOOTERS: ShootersSPINNERS: RevolversPLUGGING: Carrying drugs, sometimes in your bottomDUMPIES: ShotgunsEASTMEN: East LondonersNancy was permanently excluded from school and said: “I don’t even remember why. I just had a lot of things on my mind.” In Tottenham she witnessed the 2011 riots, which saw widespread looting and the worst civil unrest since the 1981 race riots.She said: “If I close my eyes I can still smell the burning and hear the sirens wailing.“Tottenham was falling down. People were just killing people everywhere.”Nancy soon drifted on to “the road” — street slang for gang life — and was an experienced drug dealer by the age of 13.She does not attend school and spends her illegal income from drug sales on designer clothing.She said: “Girls play a big part in this life.“If you are a drug dealer, having a girl by your side gives you more protection from the Feds (police).“They can make it look like they are hugging or kissing a girl when really they are passing her drugs to sell.“It’s the way it is — if you chill with the mandem (male gang members), they will ask you to do stuff.”For Nancy, a typical day involves going to the bando (drug den) first thing to collect drugs before taking up a designated spot to do shots (sell and deliver drugs). On other days, the olders (senior, usually male dealers) send her out to steal mobile phones, expecting her to bring back two or three in exchange for around £200 each, depending on the models.Just like their male counterparts, girl recruits are expected to be loyal, punctual and never sample the food (drugs) themselves. Punishments for breaking the rules are brutal.Nancy said: “If you don’t give them the right amount of money they will slash you. Sometimes they send girls to slap other girls.“A lot of these people have nothing to lose — they will just box you up.”Some girls are used to cover up the use of knives.She explained: “They get told to stay at home and are asked to hide weapons — knives under pillows, guns under the bed. The thinking again is that they are less likely to be searched.”Nancy says some girls are able to escape gang life by forming relationships with more superior gang members and having their children.She added: “Their lives are lavish. The kids are in designer gear, they live in nice council houses and wear nice trainers.“But us ordinary road girls don’t want to get pregnant because it’s bad for business.“I wish there was a way out for me. It’s just the money that keeps me on the road.“Money has always been tight at home, I’ve never had any and because I left school early there are no other jobs so shotting (selling drugs) is better.“But there is a price. You can get beaten up by the olders and beaten up by the people you are selling to.“Someone I know had their spine broken and people have been stabbed.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The huge injection of cash would top the amount pledged by Theresa May’s Tories by nearly \u0026pound2billion. And today, in a speech marking the this week’s 70th anniversary of the launch of the health service, the Labour leader will say it is “essential” to give it a bigger share of the national income. He will also call for an end to the “shocking inequality gap” across the country where life expectancy in some areas is years lower than others. Yesterday Mr Corbyn joined an estimated 50,000 people who flocked from all over Britain to central London to demand more recognition and cash for the hard-pressed NHS.   Coachloads of demonstrators had set off at dawn from Newcastle to the Isle of Wight, all heading to the capital. Buses poured in from places as varied as Birmingham and Cambridge, Nuneaton and Southampton, Kidderminster and Sheffield. Despite temperatures nudging 30C, the march made for Downing Street to give PM Theresa May a stark message. They celebrated the achievements of the NHS but demanded its staff be valued and urged an end to under-funding and privatisation. There was a party atmosphere as the march snaked around London landmarks such as Trafalgar Square and towards Whitehall as thousands of \u0026shysweltering tourists looked on.  A huge mock birthday cake was held aloft by the Save Lewisham Hospital campaign as the crowd sang “Happy Birthday” to the NHS, which began on July 5, 1948. Banners called for an end to “stealth privatisation” and demanded a living wage for Britain’s care workers. The PCS trade union’s drumming band lent a carnival air while activists chanted “NHS, not for sale”. The march ended at a stage on Whitehall where crowds heard from politicians, celebrities, campaigners and front-line staff. Jeremy Corbyn was given a rapturous reception as he said people had to “go to the ends of the earth” to defend the service, which was being undermined by PFI contacts, private firms providing care and the outsourcing of staff.  He said: “Our NHS was founded when people had vision. The creation of the NHS was a coming together and we’ve got to do it all over again. “I want the NHS to be funded and operated by the public, for the public and in public hands.” The Mirror-backed march comes after a decade-long NHS funding squeeze, the worst in history, with annual increases of around one per cent compared to the four per cent historic average. Daily Mirror Editor Alison Phillips quoted from a 1948 copy of the paper which told readers back then: “No-one in the world has such a powerful force on his side as you have now.”  She added: “Sometimes it’s difficult to imagine now what that force must have felt like to our readers who previously, if sick or elderly, had been entirely on their own. “Our letters pages in those first few months were filled with messages from readers overwhelmed almost with a sense of incredulity that this powerful force was there, on their side.” Former Corrie actress Sally Lindsay, who played Shelley Unwin, took to the stage with her two children wearing “Born in the NHS” t-shirts. She told the crowd: “This is our NHS – let’s fight to save it.” Actor Ralf Little, from the Royle Family, added: “I’m here because the NHS saved my life when I was a kid. “Time and time again we have to assemble to remind the Government there is neither the political mandate or popular appeal to underfund it, to privatise it, or to war with the people who run it.”  TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “The only reason the NHS has kept going is because of wonderful staff. Not just doctors and nurses but porters, cleaners and caterers.” She added: “Don’t let any of those poisonous politicians who want to scapegoat migrant workers divide us. Don’t let any politicians say we can’t afford the NHS. We don’t want Theresa May’s death by a thousand cuts.” Helen Erasmus, a midwife for 30 years, told the Mirror morale among NHS workers had reached an all-time low. She said: “Everybody feels at breaking point. We aren’t able to do the best for our patients because of staff shortages and cuts. “Every day you put in extra hours. Nobody ever clocks off on time.” But the 55-year-old from Newport, South Wales, added: “I’d go to jail to save the NHS – I care about it that much.”  The march came on the day it was announced that hundreds of thousands of NHS patients will be told they cannot have routine procedures. Ops from varicose vein surgery to tonsil removal are now deemed “outdated or risky” by NHS England and will be cut to save money.  Sam Fairbairn, national secretary of march organisers the People’s Assembly, said: “We are now seeing an NHS on its knees due to this Government. It’s a shameful indictment.” Meanwhile Jeremy Corbyn will today give a landmark speech on a visit to Tredegar, south-east Wales, the birthplace of the health service’s Labour founder, the 1940s Minister for Health Aneurin Bevan. He will say: “Under Labour, the share of national income going into the NHS will rise.  “That is essential if we are going to meet the health needs of our people, from cancer care to heart disease.” “We cannot tolerate a situation where one citizen or one community is denied the chance of life and health of another. That can and must change.  “There is clear and mounting evidence that austerity and inequality are killing people.” Mr Corbyn will give the NHS an extra five per cent if he becomes PM, funding it with extra tax on business and a five per cent levy on those earning more than \u0026pound80,000 a year. Tory health spending will hit nearly \u0026pound125billion this year, rising to \u0026pound145billion by 2023.  Labour’s extra money would add another \u0026pound2.4billion. Why they came Among the multitude who turned out to show support for the NHS yesterday were many who owe it their lives or their eternal gratitude. Nine-year-old James Williams dressed as a surgeon to show support after docs in Peterborough stitched his finger back on after a bike accident. Mum Sarah Tomkins, 47, said: “We’ll always be grateful.”  Jacky Mckenna, 55, from Aylesbury, Bucks, owes her life to the NHS after she developed sepsis last year when her kidney got blocked.  She had to be resuscitated and spent three months in a coma at Wycombe Hospital.  “Without the NHS I wouldn’t be alive,” she said.  Shannon Druif, 18, and sisters Katie, 10, and Rebecca, nine, from north London, were there with dad Brindley who said the NHS has helped his colitis.  He said: “If I didn’t have the NHS I’d be screwed.” "},{"url":null,"title":"six year old boy living","story":"NewsSix-year-old boy living in squalor surviving on a diet of crisps, sausage rolls and fried chickenA report by Action for Children raises concerns that high numbers are being repeatedly referred to social services before any action is taken\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByJason BeattieHead of politics10:49, 30 JUN 2018News36,000 kids did not initially get the help they needed from cash-strapped councils in the last two years (file pic) (Image: Getty)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThousands of children are being left in neglect because of ‘severe cuts’ to social services, a charity warns today.

Despite being at risk of abuse or neglect they had to be referred back to social services because they did not get the support first time, the charity says. It says councils are being put in an “impossible position” because of falling budgets and rising demands. As a result they are missing chances to intervene early and prevent harm to children “year after year.” It says one council left an unnamed six-year-old boy living in squalor and forced to survive on crisps, sausage rolls and fried chicken because it rejected “repeated referrals” by a health visitor to take him into care. “Early opportunities were missed to help him and his family a number of times when the alarm was raised. Sadly, the system failed him,” the charity says. Imran Hussain, Action for Children’s policy and campaigns director, said: “It’s simply horrifying that thousands of children are being left to face the potential risk of abuse or neglect, not just once but again and again.

Then it’s probably time to upgrade your stereo to something with more features and better performance…\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByHolly Thatcher17:29, 28 JUN 2018Updated17:13, 29 JUN 2018Advertorial\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhen you think back to the family car journeys from your childhood, there’s a good chance that many of them were spent listening to the crackle and whine of a sporting event played out on an old-fashioned medium wave radio. Given how much the technology in our homes has advanced, it’s surprising how many of us are still using a last generation radio– particularly as DAB upgrades and wireless connectivity for cars are so affordable. If you think it could be time for an upgrade, here\u0027s some helpful tips for choosing a stereo, and some specific recommendations. Upgrading for sound   Depending on the age of your car, even a modest update could improve the sound. Even if your car came with a digital radio, it might even be worth upgrading to one that supports DAB+ for even better digital quality and more stations. What can your car handle?   Car stereos are usually sold in two sizes: either single or double DIN. As a rule, a double DIN stereo will be able to offer you a bigger screen. It’s far easier to create a stereo that offers built-in navigation in a double DIN socket, and with many modern stereos offering video playback when you’re stationary, it’s useful to have the extra screen size. What to look for in an upgrade   If your car stereo doesn’t have Bluetooth built in, then upgrading will give you access to the music on a Bluetooth-equipped phone. That means you\u0027ll be able to listen to music streamed from Spotify or Apple Music while you drive. Many car stereos have a 3.5mm line-in (headphone jack style), while some now offer USB ports. So even if your phone isn\u0027t Bluetooth enabled, connecting an iPhone, iPod or Android phone will allow you to play music over the USB connection and keep your phone charged at the same time. The Sony MEX-N4200BT offers all of the above and costs just \u0026pound99. There’s even a CD player here for your retro music (so the kids can say, what’s that funny silver circle?). Apple CarPlay and Android Auto   One of the greatest upgrades you can get for your car is to add support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Stereos that use these are designed to make your phone an important part of your entertainment system - they allow you to navigate, communicate and play music, with intelligent voice control via Bluetooth (Siri with Apple CarPlay or voice control with Android Auto). You’ll need a recent phone to use either system. CarPlay works on the iPhone 5 and newer, while you need Android Lollipop (version 5) on your phone to use Android Auto. But not all Android phones support Auto, so be sure to check before buying anything. Some stereos support both CarPlay and Android Auto while some only offer one or the other. Again, it’s wise to check before you buy - Halfords experts can help you choose the right stereo for both your car and phone. Once connected to either system, you’ll be presented with a selection of apps: Google Maps for navigation on Android or Apple Maps on an iPhone. You can also access your music and podcasts through the clear and intuitive interface. Many systems will also give you hands-free calling and voice-activated features like Siri. Touching your phone while driving is now illegal, but upgrading allows you to still use your phone while staying within the law. Being able to change songs using Siri or say “OK, Google, send a message to Mum,” is really great if you’re running late and don’t want to stop to safely use your phone.

A new survey found that 22 per cent of amorous couples said it’s the time of year they get down and dirty the most.   August came second in the study, with one in five voting it their steamiest month, and June was third with 16 per cent saying their sex drive was highest at the start of the summer.  The poll also found that two third of couples felt more passionate on holiday because they had the luxury of more time and felt more relaxed than they did at home.  While on vacation, lovers like to spice things up outside the bedroom with 57 per cent admitting to some alfresco romance on the beach. The least sexy month was November with just one per cent saying they got the most action then.  The findings are supported by science. In winter we have more melatonin, a hormone regulating sleep and wakefulness, leading to lower a sex drive and lethargy.  Tests also show men have a third more testosterone flowing through their bodies in June than in January, so for gentlemen more sun spells better sex.

It’s the bucket list that some might say is barking mad. But Nicola Coyle, who runs Britain’s first doggy hospice, is determined all animals should see out their final days in style. Former nurse Nicola, 46, said: “It can be an utterly heartbreaking job. “But I just can’t bear the thought of them spending their final moments without the love they deserve.”  Nicola takes in dogs with around six months to live.

And their policy flouted EU regulations banning mobile networks from charging more abroad for data allowance use. But EE skirted around regulations by making a small change to its contracts before the EU laws came into force. The change meant only customers on 4G EE max plans would get the fastest EU data speeds.  Everyone else would get “standard speeds” which can be slower than in the UK.

The US former TV lighting director then shockingly announced he would not be walking his 36-year-old daughter down the aisle because of his precarious heart conditions. And just over a month later, he revealed in the ITV interview details of his conversations with Prince Harry about politics and blabbed about how his daughter told him she wished to have kids. News of communication between the Markles being cut comes shortly after Thomas took a dig at Her Majesty the Queen over her meeting with US President Donald Trump when he comes to London in a fortnight.  If the Queen is willing to meet our arrogant and insensitive president she has no excuse not to meet me, I\u0027m nowhere near as bad, he told TMZ on Tuesday. While Thomas Sr has spoken to Prince Harry on the phone, he\u0027s never actually met his daughter\u0027s new husband. He told the American site that he still has every intention to jet over to England to be formally introduced to Harry - despite having to be hospitalised with a suspected heart attack just days before the wedding. Thomas said neither the royals or their staff have contacted him since the interview, for which he racked in an appearance fee of \u0026pound7,500. In the interview he revealed how Prince Harry - who is supposed to remain neutral on political issues - was open to Brexit and wants people to give Trump a chance”, risking the rage of Buckingham Palace.

British micro sculptor Willard Wigan’s \u0026shyminuscule masterpieces, such as a Picasso on a pinhead, have been \u0026shydescribed as the eighth wonder of the world. Although their details are invisible to the naked eye the works are highly prized and sell for more than \u0026pound30,000. Wilard’s remarkable creations are owned by the Queen, ex US President Barack Obama , boxing legend Mike Tyson and X Factor’s Simon Cowell. And next Sunday Willard, 61, will be featured in a Channel 4 programme. He has made the Guinness World Records with the smallest handmade sculpture in human history – a baby inside a hair from his chin stubble measuring just 15-20 microns. That is one \u0026shyfifteenth the size of a newspaper full stop.  Willard’s feats have staggered leading nano technology scientists because even the most modern equipment, such as 3D printers, cannot replicate them. And to say Willard’s work in \u0026shypainstaking is an understatement. The slightest breath or reverberation from passing traffic outside can blow away his artistic creations. He once inhaled Alice in Wonderland when working on a minuscule Mad Hatter’s tea party scene. His works are so delicate he has to perfect them between his heartbeats as even his pulse is strong enough to destroy his microscopic world.  But although his works are tiny, Birmingham-based Willard insisted there is nothing small about their messages. He said: “My work is my voice. I wanted to make something small but say \u0026shysomething big. “You can see something very tiny but it means so much, just like you can say something in only a few words and have a wider meaning. When people see my work it puts a different perspective on the way they see things. “I’ve thrown a grain of sand into the sea and created a tidal wave.” Willard works 18 hours a day, often on three or four pieces at a time. His fianc\u0026eacutee Janice Blanchette, 51, has to remind him to eat. He works himself into a meditative state, slowing his heart beat so he can make his fabulous creations using his own handmade tools. These include a tiny pearl drill sharpened into a point, or shards of diamond inserted into the end of a syringe. He then paints them using molecules of pigmentation applied using a human eyelash glued into the end of an acupuncture needle. The process is so laborious that Willard admits his \u0026shydaily tasks are far from pleasurable. He said: “It’s impossible to enjoy \u0026shybecause it drives you mad doing it. I only do it because I like the end of it and \u0026shyseeing the pleasure people take in it.  “Although it is stressful, it disciplines me at the same time, training my nervous system, attention span and dexterity.” His incredible discipline has produced some staggering work. Look through a microscope and you can see a violinist playing a miniature instrument strung with fibres from a tiny money spider’s web, a vista of the Hollywood hills in the eye of a needle and a painting the world’s tiniest 1mm square Mona Lisa using a fly hair as a brush. Beloved characters from Beatrix Potter, the Princess in Disney’s Frozen, a gold galleon on a pin and Alice in Wonderland have also been \u0026shyimmortalised in his \u0026shyminiature world. He has also produced tiny Barack Obama and family, William and Kate , Harry and Meghan and William Shakespeare – complete with the near-invisible painted caption: “To see or not to see.” Willard received a personal letter of thanks from the Queen after he made a replica of the Coronation Crown on top of a pinhead as a private \u0026shycommission for Her Majesty’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations.   Picasso and Matisse paintings stolen from Paris gallery in \u0026pound430million art r  Awarded an MBE in 2007, Willard said: “Being able to beat a machine doing it by hand. That’s the pleasure.” The second of eight kids in a family of first-generation Jamaican \u0026shyimmigrants, he was brought up on a Wolverhampton council estate and produced his first sculpture aged only five. Using his dad’s razor blades he made miniature houses for ants, with furniture and crockery. Willard, suffering undiagnosed dyslexia and Asperger’s, struggled at school. Teachers feared he was illiterate and would amount to nothing in life.  He \u0026shyregularly ran away from school and found solace in his bedroom making art of such minute proportions that it could not be seen with the naked eye. He believed if his work could not be seen then it could not be criticised. He said: “When I was little I believed ants could talk, that there were little \u0026shyfairies and leprechauns in the bottom of our garden. I found my own world.” Spurred on by his mum Zetta, who died aged 63 in 1995, Willard’s works were scaled down millimetre by millimetre.  “Mum would always tell me if you go smaller your name will get \u0026shybigger,” said Willard, who continued working on his creations in the evenings while holding down a day job as a factory worker in Wolverhampton. He had left school at 15 with no qualifications and could not even tell the time until he was 18. Willard said: “It became an obsession, wanting to go smaller.” In 2013 he used a microscopic flake of gold from a chain and a speck of his own stubble to create what was the world’s tiniest \u0026shyhandmade sculpture – a gold \u0026shymotorcycle inside the eye of a needle.

This week the Duke of Cambridge became the first royal ever to travel on official business to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. The 36-year-old father of three was so moved by the stories of those he met – especially the suffering endured by youngsters – he even personally rewrote half an official speech to reflect his own feelings. Now the former military pilot has made it his mission to campaign for a “just and lasting peace”. A highly-placed Palace source told the Sunday Mirror that the Duke is determined to solve the region’s long-simmering mutual hostility – a problem which has stumped a series of world leaders.  Before the visit, unsure of how he would be received, he asked aides to brief him closely on the labyrinthine politics that have doomed previous attempts at peace to failure. And as the trip ended he told them: “This is the start of something new. I will forever honour my commitments to the people I have met.” An insider revealed: “The politicians who affect this younger generation’s lives may only be in office for five, 10 or 20 years – but William knows his duty is for life.” Tradition dictates that royals stay neutral rather than entering the political landscape at home or abroad. But sources say William wants to play a significant role in bringing “peace and prosperity” to the Middle East and intends to use his global platform as a force for good in the region.  His dedication echoes his mother Princess Diana’s work with causes close to her heart over many years, continuing her legacy of helping “forgotten” people. The Duke’s five-day tour of the Middle East was acclaimed by political and religious leaders on both sides as having real potential to be a game-changer. He is seen as the perfect foil for Donald Trump, whose fiery rhetoric and ill-thought-out decision to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem caused huge political uproar, mass protests and violent deaths. In the wake of rioting and hundreds of casualties, it was William’s own decision to give speeches to both sides in the conflict delivering the same message: “Never has hope and reconciliation been more needed”.  The Duke travelled to the strife-torn region without wife Kate, who is on maternity leave following the birth of Prince Louis in April. He had historic meetings with Israeli president Reuven Rivlin, PM Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara in Jerusalem, where he donned a holy skullcap to pray at the Western Wall. Mr Rivlin sent shockwaves round the world when he asked William to deliver a message of peace to his opposite number, President Mahmoud Abbas, when he crossed over the border into Palestine. Far from shying away from the challenge of bringing the two sides together, William is understood to have told aides he intends to “do what is right”. A royal source said: “The visit had a profound effect on the Duke. “The places he visited, the people he met and the stories he heard have all moved him very deeply.  “He spoke at length to his advisors of how the young people affected by the region’s troubles need hope in order to be able to look forward to a brighter future. William is a young, intelligent man who is very in tune with the politics of the world. “No one will forget when he told the Palestinian people they have ‘not been forgotten’. “He has often thought about his mother’s legacy and hopes his efforts will now lead a new chapter for future generations to enjoy.” Diana’s campaigns highlighted a range of causes including marginalised men dying of AIDS in East London, ostracised sufferers of leprosy in India and maimed victims of landmines in Angola. During his visit, William is understood to have been so moved by meeting young people in the Ramallah refugee camps that he sat down and changed the bulk of a speech he had prepared that day. He was also touched by a visit to the West Bank refugee camp of Jalazone, where he went to a school and a health centre as children were being vaccinated. The camp, which holds 15,000, suffers from high unemployment and frequent clashes with a nearby Israeli settlement.  William told locals: “I hope that through my being here and understanding the challenges you face, the links of friendship and mutual respect between the Palestinian and British people will grow stronger.” Palestinians want East Jerusalem, captured by Israel along with the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the 1967 war, as the capital of a state they seek to establish in the two territories. In 2005 Israeli troops and settlers pulled out of Gaza, now ruled by Hamas Islamists. Until now it had been British policy not to make official royal visits to the tinderbox region. But our source said: “William was happy the subject of politics was brought out into the open, as it allowed him to talk freely about the troubles of the Middle East and the quest for peace in the separate states. “The way he was received on the global stage has been very encouraging for him looking forward.” Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, speaking earlier this week, hailed William as “a figurehead for a younger generation”. And one Middle East expert said: “It’s evident Prince William has the will and desire to lead on this issue. The whole world will be behind him to succeed.” During his trip William also paid a visit to neighbouring Jordan and toured the ancient site of Jerash, where his wife Kate was once pictured as a four-year-old. Flying colours after test on world stage Not long ago this would have seemed impossible. A member of the royal family – let alone the future King – wading into the Middle East peace process. For someone relatively inexperienced on the global political stage, would it be a test too far? But the naysayers were wrong – and William’s courageous actions will reverberate around the world for years to come. This was history in the making and I was privileged to have a front row seat. My time with the Duke of Cambridge on his tour of the Middle East, the first time a royal has gone to Israel or Occupied Palestine in an official capacity, is one that will live long in the memory. William seemed to grow in stature with every day that passed, every meeting he successfully navigated and every story he was told.

In Liverpool, police said, among 86 children arrested last year for dealing drugs, two were 12 and five were 13. In London – where 486 child drug dealers were arrested – there were 16 times when boys and girls aged 13 were nabbed. And the statistics showed around one in 12 of those arrested were girls.

Now from 1 July, the fee that banks pay ATM operators per withdrawal is being reduced - and it is expected more will close or will start charging customers a fee. Link, the shared network of ATMs in the UK, is to cut the fees operators receive from banks when the cashpoints are used. The fee – known as the interchange rate - is currently around 25p and will be reduced by around 1p with the first cut. It will eventually fall to 20p. While this might not seem like much, operators have stated that some machines will no longer be financially viable to run. So this will mean more and more consumers will be charged to get cash out.  Link said the effect was expected to be a modest decline in the number of ATMs in areas where they are heavily concentrated but with no diminution in the overall geographical coverage. This will be reviewed annually. Which?\u0027s study found that almost 1,500 machines closed between November last year and April, which it said was a near six-fold increase from a steady rate of fewer than 50 closures a month since 2015. The investigation found that machines in rural communities were at least as badly hit as urban areas - down 2.1% and 2% respectively - across the UK. Which? said such closures would hit rural communities especially hard at a time when bank branch closures were also gaining pace. It said the closures accelerated as operators began to learn of the plans from Link. It has called on the regulator to urgently intervene and halt the cuts until a thorough analysis of the impact on communities is conducted.

She would not be allowed to visit without a parent or  because of her age.

But despite forecasters predicting highs of a sweltering 32C, some very unwelcome weather could also be on the way. Thunderstorms, torrential rain, lightning and hail could batter parts of the country on Sunday, the Met Office warns. A yellow \u0027thunderstorm\u0027 warning is currently in place from 6am until 10pm that day for both South West England and Wales. Up to 30-40 mm of rain in an hour could hit, with the possibility of homes and businesses flooding, the weather service says.  The warning comes as tens of thousands of people are expected to flock to beaches across the UK today and tomorrow to enjoy the hot weather. Forecasters say highs of 32C could be seen over the weekend, with most of the country set to enjoy sunny, warm beach weather. Yesterday\u0027s highest temperature - 32.5C (90.5F) - was recorded in Porthmadog, north-west Wales, according to the Met Office. And today, highs of 30C-31C (86F-87.8F) are expected. This compares with average temperatures for the time of year of 17C (62.6F) in the north and 21C (69.8F) in the south, senior forecaster Marco Petagna said.  There\u0027s a lot of fine weather still to come, he said. There will be low cloud to start the day, especially across central and eastern areas of England and Scotland and possibly in Wales. But that will soon burn away through the morning. However, the Met Office has warned of potential heavy showers and thunderstorms across parts of the UK on Sunday. It says on its website: Heavy showers and thunderstorms may affect parts of South West England during Sunday morning, becoming more widespread and also spreading into South Wales by the afternoon.  Thirty to 40 mm of rain in an hour is possible, though the scattered nature of the showers means it is not certain where these higher totals and any impacts may occur. However where surface water flooding or lightning impacts do occur they are likely to be in only a few places rather than across the whole warning area. The greatest chance of impacts is in the afternoon, with the risk decreasing again on Sunday evening. The whole of Devon and Cornwall is covered by the warning, with residents warned to expect flash flooding and possible road closures. There is a small chance that fast flowing or deep floodwater could cause a danger to life, Devon Live reports. Meanwhile, experts say train and bus cancellations are possible as a result of the bad weather.   Thunderstorms which had been brewing over the sea have already made landfall in Spain and are heading north across the country. Over the next 24 hours, the storm cells are expected to sweep across the bay of Biscay before either skirting west to Cornwall and the edge of Devon or moving east to batter the county head on. The first of the storms is set to strike at 2am on Sunday. It comes as the recent hot spell has put a strain on utility companies, which have been pumping millions of litres into their systems. Water companies have asked customers to conserve supplies by not using hosepipes or water sprinklers as the heatwave continues. The first hosepipe ban began in Northern Ireland at 6pm on Friday, and Severn Trent Water has asked people to be careful with their water.

David Sewell, a real-life \u0027Walter White\u0027, appeared to live a normal life after moving to Udon Thani, Thailand, several years ago. During the day he would visit Buddhist temples, hand out food to the region\u0027s poor, and look after his family\u0027s pet bulldog. But each night, he would disappear in his unassuming grey Honda Civic. The 60-year-old\u0027s Thai wife, Maen, 47, says she thought her husband was simply out drinking with pals when he vanished in the vehicle.  But as it turns out, Sewell was apparently leading a double life dealing drugs to other expats and pensioners in the country, local police say. Cops became suspicious when they saw him acting strangely while parked up on a roadside on Thursday evening with the door open. They walked over to speak with him, but he is said to have panicked. At the time, the retired businessman allegedly had a large bag of cannabis, 80 methamphetamine pills, five bags of crystal meth and seven bags of cocaine on the front passenger seat. Several police cars gave chase at speed for more than six miles, before Sewell ploughed into the back of an 18-wheel truck on a motorway.  He was rushed to hospital but was later pronounced dead. Officers said the drugs were stashed inside empty smartphone boxes.

Police Lieutenant Colonel Pattanawong Janpon, deputy chief of Udon Thani Provincial Police Station, said: \u0027\u0027We saw a car with the driver\u0027s door open and went over to see if there was a problem. We noticed that the driver was a foreigner.  \u0027\u0027He was very surprised when he saw us and panicked. He slammed the door closed and drove away quickly. We knew then that there was something illegal going on so we called for back-up.\u0027\u0027 Lieutenant Colonel Janpon said that several patrol cars joined the chase, before Sewell smashed into the back of a lorry at around 9pm. The police chief added: \u0027\u0027The crash happened at about 21:00. We immediately called for an ambulance. \u0027\u0027The foreigner was removed from the wreckage but his injuries were life-threatening and he died later in hospital.\u0027\u0027 Police contacted Maen, with whom Sewell had one daughter.

Fatima Begum’s husband was shot then had his throat cut as merciless soldiers torched a village in Myanmar. But that is just the beginning of her horrifying story. She then reveals how babies and children were slaughtered in state- \u0026shysponsored war crimes so awful they are difficult to comprehend. In hushed tones, wary Fatima, 25, tells me: “They threw babies in the air and then slashed them with long knives and machetes. “I saw a dead baby cut into four and then they threw the body parts on to a fire. I saw this happen right in front of me. I was struck dumb, totally speechless. I could not believe what I was seeing. “I know a lot of women from my village whose children were killed this way. They burned some \u0026shychildren whole too.  “The youngest women, the beautiful and unmarried women, about 20 of them, they killed them when they tried to get away. They were put in a line in a clearing and shot.” I meet Fatima at a refugee camp in Kutupalong, near Cox’s Bazar, on Bangladesh’s southern tip. In stifling heat she waits patiently in the rice queue – solely responsible for giving her children food and shelter following her husband’s death at the hands of government troops last month. Fatima is one of 700,000 persecuted Rohingya to cross into Bangladesh since last summer. And she is prepared to speak out in a bid to prompt Britain and the UN to take action against generals who sanctioned the genocide. She wants politicians to stop looking the other away. Cradling her 14-month-old daughter Hasina, Fatima tells of being forced to run for her life, leaving everything behind as flames engulfed her straw-roofed home.  She says: “While I hid in the forest, my husband ran back to our home to get food for the journey ahead. But soldiers were waiting. “First they shot him and then they cut his throat with a machete. They killed at least 30 other men by covering them in petrol and setting them on fire. It was so awful we just kept running for four days across the mountains, without any food.” Every person I meet in sprawling camps on a strip of land near the river that separates Bangladesh and Myanmar – previously called Burma – has fled unimaginable horrors to seek sanctuary. Every word of every testimony is equally grotesque. They paint a vivid picture of a co-ordinated campaign of ethnic cleansing by the Tatmadaw – \u0026shyMyanmar’s forces.  Mass murder, rape and torture have been used in what has been described as the worst act of \u0026shygenocide this century. The intense bloodshed has provoked the fastest movement of people since more than half a million fled Rwanda in 1994. On the banks of the river we meet four Rohingya families who arrived by raft the day before. The mountains they crossed on the side opposite are tantalisingly close. Nazima, 27, and her three children lie sprawled on the mud floor, exhausted and dehydrated. The mother says her husband is still in Myanmar after being pistol-whipped by lurking troops as he clambered on a raft. Snipers pick off those trying to get out, she tells me.  There are only women in the food queue. Thousands of husbands have died in the mountains beyond. With foreign observers prevented from entering its killing fields, aid agencies can only estimate the death toll. I meet 20-year-old Amina sitting on a child’s plastic chair with her son Mohammed, eight months, and daughter Mahia, 18 months. Their canvas shelter, reinforced with the help of British aid agency CAFOD, is one of nearly 800 squeezed into a patch of uneven ground the size of a football pitch. Amina’s tale is remarkable, given she was more than eight months pregnant when she made her escape. “They were stabbing our children with knives, slashing them wildly,” Amina mutters nervously. “They tortured my husband but he managed to get away. I couldn’t run fast because I was heavily pregnant. “Everyone was panicking... we became separated. I carried on by myself. When I was still in jungle, somewhere near the river, I had contractions and I gave birth, on the ground, alone. I was crying. Girls from a village nearby heard me and came to help. They cut the umbilical cord.  “I had been walking for 12 days. I was exhausted, so they helped me and Mohammed get on a canoe.” Unsurprisingly, little Mohammed has been struck by continual health problems, having spent his life in the camp. A severe skin condition affects his entire body and he has a fever. It was many weeks after getting into Bangladesh that Amina was, miraculously, reunited with daughter Mahia. The camp is filled with widows also grieving the loss of their children. Tearful Nur Begum, 30, tells me how her 12-year-old son was shot dead. Nur, who managed to escape with her other children, says: “While we were all sleeping, they poured oil on the straw roofs of our houses and set them on fire.  “We all ran out, terrified, and then they started shooting. My son fell down in front of me. He was dead. We all just had to keep running though. I had to leave his body there.” Despite mounting evidence, Britain has been accused of not standing up to the Myanmar government as it presses for post-Brexit global trade deals. International trade Secretary Liam Fox addressed a forum in London last October aimed at boosting relationships with countries including Myanmar – just two months after the military onslaught against the Rohingya started. Scottish Secretary David Mundell travelled to Myanmar on a trade mission last year. And Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson met the country’s de-facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi in February, but failed to convince her of the full scale of the atrocities committed.

They really are sorely needed.“There were a couple of concerns raised about the roads being put in, but almost all the feedback I’ve heard has been positive.“I’ve heard a lot of people saying they hoped they would get one.“It will secure the site, too, which is good as it’s been used as a bit of a drinking den for teenagers of late. But I really am delighted.”Abertay has already completed similar developments to the east and north of the site, with the brief of creating an array of attractive and affordable homes in the area.In a report included with the application, the firm said the new homes would be a good fit for the area due to its proximity to Charleston Community Centre and nearby shops and schools.Pupils were relocated from Charleston Primary in 2013, joining those from Lochee Primary at the new Camperdown campus.The building was later demolished at a cost of £150,000.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/SNS-15161584-Dundee-UTD-Train.jpg-838x564.jpg ","title":"dundee is football crazy i want to earn my shirt says new united keeper siegrist","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe mix of ambition and expectation is why Benjamin Siegrist jumped at the chance to up sticks and join Dundee United.The giant Swiss keeper wanted to quit Swiss football for a new challenge and believes the Tangerines tick all the boxes.“Obviously the expectations here are high, but I believe it is good to be part of something when expectations are high,” said the 26-year-old, who was an U/17 World Cup winner with Switzerland.“The gaffer is very ambitious and very focused on details as well. I like that about him.“When I knew I was moving, these things were very important to me and that’s why I came here.“The tradition of the club I know and I’ve heard good things about it as well. It should be in the top division and I want to be part of helping the team to go up.”Siegrist confirmed a chat with his team-mate at last club Vaduz, Thomas Konrad, was a big help in him making up his mind to move to Scotland.Where he does disagree with the former Dundee defender is which is the No 1 outfit in his new home city.“I’ve played alongside Thomas for the last two years, so when I did make contact here I called him and asked him about the city.“It’s always good to get some information. He has told me some nice things about the city and he was very complementary about the place.“He tried to tell me the other team was the big one, so I didn’t listen. Obviously he played for them, but it’s all good.“He told me about some derbies but I believe he got sent off in one and did well in others. That’s him.“He did tell me that everyone is football crazy here and, when I arrived in the city myself, I couldn’t believe the stadiums are literally across the road from each other.“It’s good to be in a city where football is really a big thing.”With Slovakian goalie Matej Rakovan also signing up, Siegrist’s first challenge is to claim the No 1 jersey.It’s something he’s up for and believes having two keepers battling for a place in the team will prove a good thing for both men.“You come into a new club and you have to prove yourself. You’ve got to do all you can to earn the shirt. We’ve got to make it as hard as possible for the gaffer to pick one of us.“It’s his decision at the end of the day but I will be putting everything I can into making sure I play.“Everywhere you go you have to have competition. Especially the goalie position, there is only one who can play and, in every time you go, that’s how it is.“It is good to be on your toes, it’s good to have someone pushing you either way, so it makes you train that little bit harder.“It’s a long, tough pre-season and obviously my ambition is to be the No 1 goalkeeper and that’s Matej’s ambition as well. That’s how it should be.”Whether he’s between the sticks or on the bench, his focus is already on what every United fan wants to see – the team getting promotion in the coming season.And after a week working with the new-look squad, he’s feeling optimistic about that.“The main focus of the club is promotion. The first few meetings I had with the gaffer, it’s all about getting promotion.“It’s a hard task, obviously it’s a hard league to get out of, but it’s good to be part of an ambitious club that wants to achieve something.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/AB8U9280.jpg-582x564.jpg ","title":"dundee new boy nathan ralph happy to complete switch but wanted his move sooner","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee new boy Nathan Ralph has revealed if he’d had his way he’d have been at Dens Park at the turn of the year.Back in the January window, the Tele reported the Dark Blues were keen on the left-back after being impressed by his performances at National League South outfit Woking.So, too, were several English league outfits but when he heard there could be a chance to head for the Scottish Premiership, the 25-year-old wanted to jump at it immediately.Rather than take the huff when it didn’t materialise, the former Ipswich Town kid, resolved it would happen this summer.“The thing happened in January when Dundee were interested and I said to my manager at the time, look I want to play higher,” he explained.“I don’t think at the time they were keen on me going, so I just thought if I can get a good season under my belt, hopefully, it will still be there at the end of the season. Thankfully, it was and I’m here now.”Over the past week he’s been getting to know his new team-mates in pre-season training.He’s liked what he’s seen of them and is loving the workouts under his new boss Neil McCann.“I’m enjoying it a lot. The training has been very good. Sometimes you feel you are just running and running during pre-season but, to be fair to the manager, he’s had us doing ball work straight away.“With running as well, of course, but it’s been with the ball and match specific stuff so I am really enjoying it.“You can get that hard work when you have the ball as well and it is important because, at the end of the day, we are footballers.“We need to control the ball and things when we are tired in games, so, to me, it makes perfect sense to be training this way.“And I’ve only been here a few days now but already I’ve been impressed with the players. Technically, and in terms of the morale of the squad, they are very good.”While he wouldn’t claim to be an expert on the Scottish Premiership yet, what he’s already realised is that it’s a good place to be right now.With top English Premier League boss Brendan Rodgers already at Celtic and Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard taking the reins at Rangers, he knows it’s a league that’s being noticed.“I don’t know too much about the Premiership up here yet but what I do know is that it’s a good standard and it’s something I’ve been really looking forward to being a part of.“I’m stepping up and it will be a challenge, for sure, but I don’t think I will be out of my depth and I am looking forward to playing in it.“I’ve been told it’s definitely a good time to be coming to this league. There are a lot of good players and a lot of attention with what’s happened at Rangers.“Even without that it is still a good standard and a top league and this has all the makings of a good season for me.”Fans will got their first chance of a first look at Ralph last night when Dundee’s friendly programme kicked off with the short trip up to Brechin.Having finished playing at Woking back in April, he can’t wait to get back to a game situation.“I’m very keen to get started with the games and I’m looking forward to them, that’s what I came here for.“The Betfred Cup is coming soon but I feel with the fitness work we’ve been doing and, with the friendly games coming, we will be ready for them.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1f819d44b02-423x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people customer base like a little community","story":"\t\t\t\t\tChoosing what to have for lunch in a bustling city centre can be a task, however, Brodie’s Takeaway has you covered.The blue-fronted shop on Bell Street is often the go-to place to grab a whole range of tasty homemade grub and it is all thanks to Cate and Ron Brodie who opened the shop almost 14 years ago.Cate said: “We already owned Brodie’s Coffee Shop in Forfar and we wanted to branch out and open another shop.“The premises we are in were already a takeaway when we took over.”After three years of running both businesses the couple decided to sell the coffee shop and focus on their Dundee business and their two children.Cate said: “We found with running two businesses and having two kids that we were just too widespread between the shops and we decided to sell the coffee shop.“It was a really hard decision to make, but with business you have to either go really big and hire managers or stay small and in control so that is what we have done.“It has also allowed us to get our weekends back to spend with our children.”Now the takeaway is thriving with masses of hungry locals heading in five days a week for the huge range of homemade food on offer.Cate appreciates though that the shop is in an ideal location with the High School of Dundee, Abertay University and the DC Thomson offices in close proximity and full of willing customers.“We have a huge amount of regulars now from all the local businesses.“The shop is now like a meeting point with everyone like a little community and we all know each other.“I also like to introduce people to each other while they are waiting in the queues for their food.“It is a way for them to network and meet new people and it’s also great for me getting to know everyone who comes in.”Now after more than a decade the owner couldn’t imagine not having the takeaway shop.“Although it is very hard work with my days lasting easily 12 hours and starting between 5-6am, I couldn’t imagine myself not having Brodie’s.“People may think it is easy, but there is a lot of work that goes on in the background that customers don’t see.Whatever you fancy to eat Brodie’s is more than likely to have it with an extensive menu ranging from homemade soups, sandwiches and burgers to daily specials including chicken curry and stovies, there is something for everyone.But owner Cate says it wouldn’t be possible without her three employees and her 81-year-old dad, Gordon Bruce.She said: “My dad is basically on call whenever we need him.

Stuart has done both during his time there.”Armstrong added: “Southampton seems a really good fit for me. Watching from afar, I really enjoy the attractive football that they play and I’m very happy to be here.“Every season, I put demands on myself to create and score goals. I hope going forwards from here that it will be the same this term at St Mary’s.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ex dundee united coach ian cathro teams up with former boss at wolves","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Hearts boss Ian Cathro has been appointed first-team coach of Premier League newcomers Wolves.Dundonian Cathro, who spent eight months at Tynecastle, was Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo’s assistant at Rio Ave in 2012 and at Valencia.The pair met on a Scottish Football Association coaching course in 2009.“I am very excited about joining Wolves and looking forward to working with a coach and staff I know, trust and believe in,” said Cathro.“All of us share the same footballing philosophy and that is such an important factor for a successful coaching team.“Wolves is a fantastic club with a rich history and lots of potential, and I can’t wait to get started.”Cathro, who began his coaching career at Dundee United, has also been assistant boss at Newcastle and met the Wolves squad on Wednesday.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b35f002de9f2-846x564.jpg ","title":"female custody unit planned for dundee school doesnt fit in with new image of area","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPeople in the Hilltown have vowed to keep fighting controversial plans for a women’s custody unit in their neighbourhood.Residents were given a second chance to find out more about the scheme and voice their concerns to representatives of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) on Thursday.The SPS wants to build the unit on the site of Our Lady’s Primary School, after pupils move to the new Coldside Community Campus later this year.But people attending a consultation event at the Maxwell Centre remained adamant it is planned for the wrong place.Ian Kinsey, 69, secretary of Coldside Community Forum and chairman of Coldside Regeneration Forum, said he couldn’t back plans for the community custody unit (CCU) at the proposed site.He said: “I support strongly the concept of the CCU but definitely not in this location.“If it goes ahead it would be beside a school and a nursery and a homeless unit.“We are trying to reshape the image of Coldside and the Hilltown and this unit does not fit in with everything else that is happening here.”“Whether we like it or not there is a stigma attached to a unit like this.“It doesn’t fit in with the regeneration of this area, which we are currently working hard on.“There are other places in Dundee better suited.”Norman Ewan, 74, a retired engineer from Coldside, said: “I am not against the unit – it is the location that is my concern.“There are plenty other places in Dundee where it could be located that are much more suitable.“We have old business parks in the city that are no longer used that would be much more suited to a unit of this type.“The safety of the area is a major concern.“It would be located beside a school and a nursery.“My concern is the safety of local people if women from the unit are moving about freely on the streets, for example when they are going to get transport.”Annette Dryburgh, of the SPS, said prison chiefs were doing everything they could to reassure locals that the unit would be properly run.She said: “The unit will be staffed 24/7, with discreet CCTV at all times.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b35efb001e13.jpg ","title":"fifty dogs join in fun at local hawaiian beach party","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAloha there!

It was my first real job in coaching and their academy was doing well but the club got relegated to the Conference and couldn’t afford to run their academy.“It’s a big outlay and, unfortunately, it folded and jobs went with it. I would have loved to have stayed, it was a great job and I had an excellent lifestyle.“The job wasn’t there so I came back up the road and there wasn’t much happening. I applied for jobs and I got close to a couple.“I ended up doing a bit of labouring and it was great, it was the best thing for me. I kept myself busy.“I was taking down cabins, near St Andrews funnily enough, and then building. I’d never had any experience of it but enjoyed it. Every day was different and the guys were brilliant. A lot of good people – I still keep in touch.“I always appreciated what I had as a footballer but sometimes you need to go out of it and get back in just to be reminded what you have.“So getting out for a bit was good, it got my appetite back without me realising I’d lost it. And just doing something different, seeing another side of life, meant I learned a lot.”His return to football came at Raith where an excellent record with the youths sparked interest from others.Determined to repay the faith Raith showed in him, he rebuffed the chance of a quick move but when United came calling he admits his affection for the place where his career started made it an offer he couldn’t refuse.“I enjoyed Raith, there were good people, a good club and it was tough to leave but I couldn’t turn this job down.“This is a big responsibility because United have produced some great players over the years. There’s a lot of good players come through and a lot of good people looked after the kids here, so there’s a lot to live up to. I was lucky to work with a lot of those people.”In recent years, the conveyor belt of young talent at Tannadice has slowed but Craig’s confident, along with assistant Scott Robertson, talent will flow.That’s in no small part because the mechanism required to produce players is still in place.“We know how important it is to keep bringing players through at this football club and there is talent here.“There is so much that goes on before us to get it to the stage where we take the players. It’s not about us, it’s about everything that goes before that to get them to the point where Scott and I take them.“Brian Grant (academy head) is on top of that and making it better all the time. It’s about us then doing the extra wee bit to take them to the first team.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b35eff05a3fe-846x564.jpg ","title":"gulls are going nowhere bird expert says dundonians should learn to live with noisy neighbours","story":"\t\t\t\t\tEverywhere you look, our noisy urban neighbours are raking in bins – and even attacking unsuspecting pedestrians in a bid to steal their lunch.But according to one expert, the much-maligned gull is going nowhere in a hurry.Peter Rock, one of the leading authorities on urban gulls in Europe, said there is “no chance” that the gulls will return to less densely populated areas – regardless of any measures Dundee City Council puts in place to reduce their numbers.After studying the species for 38 years, Mr Rock dismissed claims the birds are congregating in the city to gorge on people’s rubbish.And he also said claims they are becoming more aggressive after feasting on human food are untrue.He said: “Despite the fact that so many people hate gulls, you’d be surprised to know how many people are actually feeding them.“Even if you stopped people feeding them, it’s going to make no difference – they are totally adept at finding food.“There are ways of curbing the problem, by removing eggs from nests. I’m sure the local council is aware of this and it would cost thousands of pounds.“This would need to be carried out for at least 10 years and even then, you wouldn’t visibly notice a big drop in the population.“I’m afraid to say you’ve got urban gulls and you’re not going to get rid of them. You may – with a great deal of expense – reduce the population slightly over time. But there is maybe a case to start embracing them.“Down at Bristol City Football Club, the team has celebrated the fact they share the city with their neighbours with a gull painted on one of the stands.”But some residents said many Dundee streets have such a problem with gulls they look like a scene from Jurassic Park.German Doner Kebab manager, Michael Dobson, 29, reckons the problem is largely man-made.He said: “I understand the council needs to look at other measures. There needs to be more awareness to stop feeding them. The residential bins are a nightmare – in the street you see gulls feasting on the rubbish.”Charlene Hutchison, 33, a supervisor at German Doner Kebab, said she is “terrified” to walk down Reform Street.She added: “If I’m on a day off I won’t walk down the street. My niece got attacked when she was only seven.”Heather Davidson, 40, from Broughty Ferry, said in her area the problem is just as bad.She said: “These birds are so big now it’s like a scene from Jurassic Park.”Taffy Barrington, 50, from the city centre, said the gull’s had become “fearless”. He said: “A couple of Saturdays ago I actually saw gulls scrapping over a pizza.“They are completely fearless of cars as well now.”A Dundee City Council spokeswoman said: “We know that gulls can often be a cause for considerable distress and annoyance and we continually pursue tried and tested as well as innovative solutions to the problems that arise from these birds.“We are proactive in improving the waste disposal facilities in and around the city centre. Bins have been provided in many areas where previously waste bags were placed on the footpaths and became magnets for gulls.“Routine monitoring of this situation ensures that problem areas are swiftly identified to enable further action to be taken. We would also ask that people do not feed seagulls as this exacerbates the problem.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b35ef77343e9-375x564.jpg ","title":"its the penguin parade colourful trail goes live across dundee and tayside","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPenguins are popping up across Dundee and Tayside as part of a much-anticipated charity trail.And now, all 80 giant fibreglass birds which make up the Maggie’s Penguin Parade are in place.The colourfully decorated penguin sculptures will be displayed in the city and beyond over the summer, with families being challenged to locate them all.Each 5ft bird has been uniquely designed in aid of cancer charity Maggie’s, by artists who have taken inspiration from topics including footballers and the history of Dundee.The penguin parade is a partnership event between Maggie’s Dundee and Wild in Art.Maggie’s Dundee fundraising manager Annie Long said: “It’s wonderful to have our penguins in place and ready to be enjoyed by people from across the Dundee area and hopefully far beyond.”Famous names such as Judy Murray, Simple Minds and Lorraine Kelly have been involved in designing or sponsoring a penguin.Artist Tom Harris-Ward customised his penguin, located at Verdant Works, by adding a piece of wood from the RRS Discovery.Abertay University students have also been involved in the initiative after collaborating with Maggie’s to develop an app for the “Maggie and Fleur” penguin positioned outside Abertay University Library.Director of Wild in Art, Charlie Langhorne, said: “Maggie’s Penguin Parade is a celebration of creativity and of Dundee.The whole Maggie’s team is to be congratulated on such a fantastic spectacle that will bring a smile to the many thousands of people who will come and enjoy the trail.Now ‘waddle on’ and do the Penguin Parade.”More than 70,000 people took part in the city’s previous trail featuring Oor Wullie, in aid of the Archie Foundation.Funds from the penguin parade will help towards the cost of running the Maggie’s centre based at Ninewells.

care \u0026ndash is being proposed by a newly appointed champion.After months of stinging criticism over its treatment of people with autism NHS Highland has appointed occupational therapist Arlene Johnstone to be its first head of service for learning disabilities and autism.The health board faced a storm of criticism over its decision to withdraw a \u0026pound23,000 grant for the Highland One Stop Shop (HOSS) autism support service last year and it was subsequently criticised by autism expert Dr Sue Fletcher-Watson, of Edinburgh University\u0027s Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, regarding an equality impact document that showed \"total ignorance\".Ms Johnstone says she is now keen to move on from the past, bringing a determinedly inclusive approach to her work.Acting as an advocate within the health service for autistic people and those with learning disabilities has already seen her challenging NHS colleagues drawing up policy in a range of areas to make sure their needs are properly considered.Beyond what is happening internally within the NHS she says she is also keen to reach out to partners in both the third sector and business.\"I think it is easy to say \u0027the NHS has to change\u0027 and there are things we have to change, absolutely, but there is also lots of things that have to change outside of the health service and the social care world,\" she said.Listing banks, bus companies, cafes and shopping centres as the kinds of private organisations she would like to talk to about boosting their autism-friendly credentials she added: \"I think it is crucial, because most people\u0027s quality of life is not about when they visit the GP it is when they go out with their pals socialising.\"A spokeswoman for Autism Rights Group Highland has given a cautious welcome to Ms Johnstone\u0027s appointment, saying the group knows her well and is eager to find out more about her role.Ms Johnstone is happy to hear from anyone with concerns or ideas for improvements.She can be contacted by email at Arlene.johnstone@nhs.netSunday 1 Jul 2018 1:36

grandmother is celebrating the approval of new technology that could benefit a million people in the UK who, like her, suffer from a debilitating condition.Non-invasive ultrasound equipment created by Israeli medical technology firm Insightec has had the blessing of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) which advises British health authorities.Essential tremor (ET) and similar conditions impact people\u0027s ability to perform everyday tasks due to uncontrollable shaking.Sufferers treated at St Mary\u0027s Hospital in London have experienced substantial improvement after access to the equipment, according to senior surgeons.The machine enables ultrasound waves to pass through the skull to the part of the brain responsible for the tremor.Due to the incision-less nature of focused ultrasound, there is no risk of infection and patients recover quickly.Mary Ramsay (61), a lifelong ET sufferer, has had to travel 450 miles to Newcastle \u0026ndash but for an alternative and invasive treatment. No other relevant technology was available anywhere in Scotland.Her case sparked a recent debate in the Scottish Parliament in support of her campaign for specialist equipment nearer home.She said: \"I\u0027m highly delighted. It\u0027s now up to the health boards.\"I\u0027d urge those in the north and east to consider having the focus ultrasound scanner because there\u0027s currently nothing for people with neurological problems, ET or otherwise, in these areas.

I’m not going to leave anything.“With the budget we’re going to try to spend it and get the best level of players in.”Despite already landing three midfielders in the window McInnes had remained keen to sign Hibs’ Scotland international McGeouch.However, sources indicate Sunderland are confident of bagging McGeouch before they leave for their training camp in Portugal early next week.The 25-year-old travelled to the Stadium of Light for talks last week and the Black Cats are confident of pushing a deal through.It is understood McGeouch is keen on a move south of the border.Rangers, Fulham, QPR, Blackburn and Coventry City were also keen on securing the midfielder.Aberdeen signings Forrester, Gleeson and Ferguson were today set to make their debuts against Cobh Ramblers.Centre-back Mikey Devlin, who signed for the Reds in January, is also set to make his long-awaited debut.Defender Devlin has been ruled out for more than a year having suffered cruciate ligament damage in May 2017.The friendly will be played at the Reds’ Fota Island Resort training complex on the outskirts of Cork, Republic of Ireland.It is the first step in a series of friendlies that will culminate in a clash with West Brom on July 20 before the Battle of Britain with Burnley.McInnes said: “When we were drawn against Siroki Brijeg in the second qualifying round last year I felt we were undercooked a bit.“So this year, even before we drew Burnley, we decided to get more games in.“Now we know we’re playing against a team from the English Premier League, those extra matches are a necessity.”Aberdeen have exited at the third qualifying round stage of the Europa League in four straight seasons.

Now that they are back in I am sure they will feel an obligation and that excitement about it.“It is a competition I wouldn’t imagine Burnley will take lightly.“The Europa League is a competition a lot of English teams think they can do well in as Manchester United won it in 2017 and Arsenal reached the semis this year.“Burnley are a team that have done fantastically well in recent seasons.“For them to finish just outside that big top six in the English Premier League is a fantastic effort.“They will be excited for the European adventure.“Facing an English Premier League team is as tough a game as we could have at this stage.“Burnley were the stand-out team in our pot during the draw and the most difficult one.”European football normally means overseas scouting missions for the Dons to get the lowdown on their opponent.That will not be needed this time although the Reds could yet have someone travel back across to Ireland next week as Burnley face Cork City in a friendly on Friday.Mcinnes said: “Rather than talking about some obscure team and trying to say how good they are we are well aware of the strength of Burnley.“It is different from our European experience of recent years but there is still that excitement nevertheless.“We are very proud that we have qualified for Europe for five years in a row and we want to do well.“It is clear we have a really tough task ahead of us but one we will be ready for.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"artists japan project set to peak interest in cairngorms","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA north-east artist will travel to Japan to compare its famous Mount Fuji with the Cairngorms as part of a project.Julie-Ann Simpson, originally of Sheddocksley, is currently preparing for a two-month residency in Kofu City, where she plans to explore how residents interact with the natural landscape.Through her painting, she hopes to draw potential parallels between Kofu and Aberdeen’s proximity to mountainous regions.The 25-year-old will stay at AIR-Y – Artist in Residence Yamanashi – an artist-run space during her self-funded stay.Julie-Ann, who previously attended Hazlehead Academy before studying at Robert Gordon University’s Gray’s School of Art, hopes to gather research for a wider collection of work based on her time abroad, looking at human experience and nature.She said: “The location of Kofu is interesting to me as it is located in a basin surrounded by mountains, the most iconic of which is Mount Fuji.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This is the same distance Mark averaged every day during his epic cycle round the world in 80 days last year.In other words the team of 80 intrepid cyclists will pedal the equivalent of Mark’s incredible feat – taking them around the world in a day.Participants are asked to raise a minimum of £240 each for the STV Children’s Appeal, which supports children and young people affected by poverty in Scotland, with the hope of raising as much as £80,000 for the charity.Mark said: \u0026#8216This stunning route from Argyll to Aberdeen was my last 16-hour training ride before I set out on the world challenge and it holds fond memories \u0026#8211 but it is very long and very hilly, so I’ll be impressed by everyone who signs up for this epic day of endurance.\u0026#8216The STV Children’s Appeal has gone from strength from strength, supporting so many brilliant charities and causes across Scotland. The last time I crossed Scotland for the appeal I was swimming and running, so cycling has to be easier… right?\u0026#8217He added: \u0026#8216Thanks to everyone who gets involved and I look forward to riding with you.\u0026#8217Mari Slavin of the STV Children’s Appeal said: \u0026#8216Mark is a fantastic ambassador for the Appeal and we are all in awe of the gigantic challenge he’s about to take on, together with cyclists from across the country. STV’s cameras will be there – and trying hard to keep up! – to capture the highs and lows of this incredible marathon venture\u0026#8217After a 4am start in Argyll, Mark’s 240-mile cycle route will pass through Tarbert, Ardrishaig, Lochgilphead, Inveraray, Tyndrum, Crainlarich, Killin, Aberfeldy, Pitlochry, Glenshee, Braemar, Ballater and Peterculter \u0026#8211 among many other towns and villages \u0026#8211 before finishing in Aberdeen.If you think you’re up for this epic feat of endurance, get in touch with Mark on aroundtheworld@thehunterfoundationA corporate offer is also available with four-person relay teams invited to enter for a minimum donation of £5,000.Can’t face the cycle but still want to be involved?

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

Sheryl is a Lochgilphead woman \u0026#8211 middle-aged, celibate without choice and with plummeting self-confidence and a loathing for her body shape. Belly dancing appears to let Sheryl, and Kerrie, rediscover a love of their own body.\u0026#8216You’re using parts of your body, probably out of commission for a while, like the pelvis and it makes a part of the body, you’re maybe not keen on, sexy.\u0026#8217The female characters in the book get up to what loud ladies in a small town would enjoy gossip and drama.\u0026#8216There is an element of bitchiness about it, which I exaggerated in the book. Or maybe it was just me that was bitching.\u0026#8217But two books later in the series, Kerrie is changing direction. Her new book, Rebel Without A Clue, is a sci-fi dystopian novel about a male alien from a female-dominated planet landing in Glasgow.\u0026#8216There’s actually not a lot of sex in my books,\u0026#8217 says Kerrie. \u0026#8216Except maybe nobody having any.\u0026#8217The story starts out as a reversal of The Handmaid’s Tale, with women of this planet no longer needing men to reproduce and evolves, through a plot described as \u0026#8216mad\u0026#8217, into an outsiders perspective of Glasgow.\u0026#8216The male alien Legless goes down to earth and goes around fertilising all these women, and doesn’t understand this world where he’s in charge.\u0026#8216Most of the time I was the only woman living in a culture different from my own. I began to see stories in outsiders.\u0026#8217Being an Australian in Scotland \u0026#8211 and on top of that marrying into a Bangladeshi family \u0026#8211 would give that outlook, of everything being familiar but just off a little. The language is the same, with the accents different. The rural community is the same, only with less terrifying monsters to deal with in Argyll. This is the outlook Legless finds himself in as a dominated man in a world of dominant men.Such an off-the-wall plot with no clear message makes the book an ink blot test \u0026#8211 you take what you’re looking for from it. Maybe you even see something else with another look.Kerrie explained: \u0026#8216Originally I wanted it to be all humour. I suppose I’m driven about power and control and it’s really fascinating when you start to think about it because people dominate in quite small ways.\u0026#8217So maybe the point was to gain the women’s perspective for men to relate to?Kerrie is currently working on her fifth book, the sequel to her dystopian sci-fi named Rebel Without A Bra, and she will keep belly dancing around Lochgilphead.\u0026#8216At the beginning you just write, and you just open up your mind and stuff comes out and you’ll find that all this stuff comes out that you didn’t realise you were thinking about.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"its gonna be a close shave gavin","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/06/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIt\u0026#8217s been eight months in the making, but it\u0026#8217s getting hairy now.The razors, however, will soon sort that out for Gavin Allan.He has been growing his flowing locks and bushy beard since October last year, but Gavin will be shorn for charity on Saturday June 30.Gavin\u0026#8217s head and beard shave is being carried out in aid of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) research and the Doddie Weir Foundation.Former Scottish rugby international lock forward Doddie Weir revealed in June 2017 he was suffering from MND, a degenerative condition affecting the nerves in the brain and spinal cord that tell your muscles what to do.

Would you know who most at risk is, how to protect the area or whether you should remove the helmet of a downed rider?Following the success of the Biker Down courses last year in Oban Community Fire Station, new dates have been set for this summerTwo free sessions will be held in Inveraray Community Fire Station on July 8 and August 26 .As many bikers ride in pairs or in groups, it is often the case that the first person on scene following a collision involving a motorcycle will be a fellow biker.Actions taken in the first few moments after an accident can be crucial in minimising injuries and can make a real difference to the lives of those involved. But there can be some uncertainty about what to do in these situations.Training motorcyclists in how to deal with a casualty can save lives and Biker Down courses include ways of keeping the scene safe, first aid appropriate to common types of injury and the issues of safely removing a helmet.The course \u0026#8211 aimed at motorcyclists of all ages and experience \u0026#8211 uses the expertise of the emergency services to prepare motorcyclists should the worst happen on the roads. Biker Down is not about lecturing riders on the consequences of things going wrong – it is about equipping them to make a difference if they encounter an emergency.The course will show you:How to manage the scene of a bike crash, using the same principles the Fire Service uses. We will show you how to protect yourself and others, how to prioritise your actions, how to collect information for the emergency services and how to make use of the resources you have available to you, including other people.Ways of taking care of a casualty, including basic life support and the why, when and how of removing a crash helmet.What may work (or not work) when it comes to making yourself more visible to other road users. You will also learn about how people look for and recognise objects and how you can help to make sure that other road users see you.Scottish Fire and Rescue Service’s group manager for Argyll and Bute, Stuart McLean said: \u0026#8216Firefighters are frequently called to the scene of collisions and when a report comes through of one involving a biker there’s always great concern.

Road users will be sent on the usual lengthy diversion via the A819, A85 and the A82, though access will be maintained  for emergency vehicles.Following completion of the surfacing, further minor construction works to complete the project will take place ahead of the A83 opening to both lanes again later in July.Eddie Ross, of trunk road management company BEAR Scotland, said: \u0026#8216We thank motorists and the local community for their continued patience while teams work to complete the project.\u0026#8217\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"council pays formal tribute to islays ww100 group","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 2:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowArgyll and Bute Council has formally recognised Islay’s ambitious programme of events commemorating two World War One tragedies off the coast of the island.Council members thanked Islay\u0026#8217s WW100 committee for providing an inspirational programme of events to commemorate the centenary of the sinking of SS Tuscania and the collision of HMS Otranto, which took place off the shores of Islay during the Great War.At a meeting of the full council this week members paid tribute to the group for their part in organising the national remembrance events, honouring those who lost their lives in the incidents, and providing a lasting legacy for the local community.Provost of Argyll and Bute, Len Scoullar said: \u0026#8216The WW100 group both national and local must be congratulated for arranging such a well-organised series of events to honour and pay respect to those who lost their lives in these tragedies, and commemorate the people of Islay who were involved in the response to the incidents.\u0026#8216The island really came together, engaging young and old, showcasing resilience, compassion and kindness.

Our two shear was placed sixth in one of the strongest classes and we got a fifth with the ewe lamb, which is quite pleasing after the way the weather was earlier in the year.\u0026#8217Duncan Buchanan, Shenavallie, Benderloch won second with his north country Cheviot shearling tup.Among the Texels, Keith, Allan and Roy Campbell from Lochgoilhead won fourth prize in the performance recorded ram lamb class.Brian and Janet Hill had a successful trip across from Plan Farm on the Isle of Bute. In the Hampshire Down show ring Janet took second with her two shear senior stock ram. There were two third places \u0026#8211 for an aged ewe and a ewe lamb \u0026#8211 and a sixth for a gimmer. The star of the show for Brian and Janet, however, was a home-bred ewe which took first prize in her class and was reserve female champion.Campbeltown\u0026#8217s John MacLachlan was there showing Blue Faced Leicester sheep for J\u0026ampM Turner, Killdalloig with the help of Gavin Semple and Scott Thomason.He came home with a first place and reserve male champion rosette for his tup lamb, sired by Mossvale Masterplan (AI) from a mother out of a Hazelwood ewe.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s the first time out for this lamb, said John, and this is the first time I\u0026#8217ve won with a male at the Highland Show, it\u0026#8217s normally females we do well with.\u0026#8217Kildalloig also secured sixth places for their tup and ewe lamb and fourth for a shearling tup.In the coloured Bluefaced Leicester ring, Lochgoilhead\u0026#8217s Andrew Campbell came second with a tup lamb and sixth with his ewe. Andrew also secured a fourth prize in the Scotch Mules with his ewe.From Heylipol on Tiree, Alasdair MacLean did well in the Beltex section, taking home to the island second prizes for his shearling tup, shearling ewe and ewe lamb.Among the cattle lines, R\u0026ampP McAlister from Bute were handed a third place rosette with Langalbuinoch Kojack in the beef shorthorn class for bulls born in 2016.The Highland cattle classes have been an area where Argyll breeders have historically done well at the show. This year Queenie Strickland\u0026#8217s Cladich fold from the banks of Loch Awe \u0026#8211 brought out by farm manager Stuart Campbell \u0026#8211  took home a second prize with one-year-old heifer Princess Mairi 4th of Cladich. There was also a third for Capleadh Buidhe Beg 4th of Cladich in the four-year-old cow section and a fourth for one-year-old bull Monadh Mor of Cladich.A native of Kilfinan, Catherine McKechnie farms with husband Jim at France Farm, Gartocharn. Their three-year-old heifer Kirsty 2 of Gartocharn, by Brogach 1 of Balmoral and out of Kirsty Morag of Ubhaidh, won her class and also secured the reserve overall female title. The McKechnies also took home a second for a home-bred cow and her February-born calf.Catherine said afterwards: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s satisfying when you come to the show with two beasts and they go home with red and blue tickets \u0026#8211 and a reserve female champion \u0026#8211 so we can\u0026#8217t ask for much more.\u0026#8217The majestic heavy horse classes are a sight to behold, and there was a prize for a Clydesdale which has won both Kintyre and Mid Argyll shows in recent years.

Collapsing ceilings and water leakage have led to a further deterioration in the fabric of the Victorian pile.  Now it is understood South Ayrshire Council bosses want to step in before it is too late. It is believed a last minute paper may go before councillors at full council in County Buildings on Thursday. The paper would ask politicians to approve the repair work. The council slapped a Dangerous Building Notice on the hotel in March, which gave the owners 21 days to respond. There are fears Ayr train station could end up shut if no action is taken. And it has been slammed a risk to the public. The Post revealed earlier this month how the hotel has been bought by new Malaysian owners from Eng Huat Ung.  Station Hotel Action Group founder Esther Clark believes the hotel could be turned into a community centre and accomodation. She said it should be “split up and dispersed” but must generate an income. She has uncovered research, which reveals the hotel was built to a “high standard” with luxurious materials. One idea mooted by Ayr Renaissance is for a part of the building to be demolished and a new train station built. Others folk have called for the council to adopt the landmark for offices. It was hoped a big hotel group would step in and carry out refurbishment but it has failed to attract interest so far. Network Rail carried out scaffolding work on the building to safeguard the operation of the station and line in 2015. The hotel, a Grade 2 listed building, has remained shut since it closed suddenly in 2013. Glasgow and South-Western Railway Company built the hotel, designed in the style of a French chateau, at a cost of \u0026pound50,000.

It is the latest diversification at Corton Farm, just outside Ayr. Customers can buy a litre glass bottle for \u0026pound2 and use it again and again at the milk machine. And farmer Alison Kerr said: “You cannot get any fresher. “We’re really hoping it catches on so we can sell more and more directly to local people.” The Kerrs – five generations at Corton since 1925 – have constructed The Milk Hoose and the Milkbot vending machines providing “untampered, non-homogenised” milk from the Corton herd.  Customers on Friday gushed praise on the creamy taste, saying it is nothing like mass-produced products. The Kerrs are charging \u0026pound1.50 per litre and say it cuts out plastic waste from supermarket bottles. Although it is more expensive than supermarket pricing, they say their milk compares favourably to speciality gold top products. Willie and Alison, both 46, have been joined working the farm by son David,19, and are being helped by daughter Joanne,16, when she is not at Belmont Academy. Willie said: “It would be a dream to sell every litre we produce right here. “But we have had a great start and it has been so well received.” The farm produces between 5000 and 6000 litres of milk a day, depending on the time of year.  That is courtesy of the 220 Friesian-Holstein milkers. The Kerrs own 260 acres and rent another 250. Fourteen years ago they expanded into the Corton Plants nursery and 14 months ago the Coo Shed coffee shop. But Alison said: “The Milkbot really completes the story of selling your own product. “We siphon off what we need into churns to be pasteurised and it is put into the Milkbot. “I guarantee it tastes completely different as all the fats and proteins have not been stripped out. “It is non-homogenised and the cream settles on top like the the old-fashioned milk.” At the moment it is thought only three farms in Scotland are selling direct via a vending machine.  Alison added: “People now are so detached from where the food comes from and I think supermarkets are to blame for that. “Some kids think milk comes from a bottle in a supermarket. “Plastic has just become a huge issue and it has been good timing for us. “People are loving our branded glass bottles.” Peak time for the new vended milk is between 5pm and 7pm and there can be 20 cars in the car park at a time with people leaving work keen to top up their supply. Alison added: “Hopefully this continues to grow. Milk is sold too cheaply in supermarkets and farmers have been down-trodden for a long time. “We have just had to take what we can get and be paid sub-30p a litre. At the moment the Milkbot is doing a couple of hundred litres a day so we have a long way to go to reach 5000 a day.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"holiday goer caused ruckus prestwick","story":"NewsHoliday-goer caused ruckus at Prestwick AirportIan Graham acted in an aggressive and intimidating manner towards Steven Ringtoul, and made threats of violence in the presence of children.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post16:00, 28 JUN 2018NewsAyr Sheriff Court (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA holidaygoer who caused a ruckus at Prestwick Airport has been fined.

And one glance around a packed Troon Town Hall said everything about the young woman Vanessa Riddle had become. Her impact was deep, her reach was far. “Vanessa would wonder why everyone was here for her,” said dad Chris. “That’s just the kind of person she was.” Friends, family, school pals and members of the community all touched by Vanessa’s courage joined for the special service.  Her battle with neuroblastoma had been one that ensured she will never be forgotten by all lucky enough to know her. Speaking to more than 400 people at her memorial service, Chris said: “She lit up our world. “And in her short life, she packed in so much happiness. “Vanessa was a thrillseeker with a soft side – great with old and young alike. “She had the Midas touch.” And he added: “No words can describe how utterly proud we are to have been your father, mother and sister.  “This is not the end for you, you have now moved on to something new.” The emotional speech came as the Town Hall paid tribute to Vanessa, of Loans, who lost her brave battle just days short of her 18th birthday. Some of Vanessa’s closest childhood friends took their feet to recount memories of happy times of the girl with a smile for everyone. And Vanessa’s infamous parking skills and ability to make everyone laugh were just two of the themes to strike a chord. Graham Hobson, deputy head at Marr College, was another to speak warmly of an immensely popular pupil. Chris said afterwards: “I thought the speeches were great, especially Vanessa’s friends, who at only 18 spoke so eloquently and passionately about Vanessa - they belied their age doing this.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"a-decade-of-singing-about-to-be-celebrated-in-peebles","story":"IT all began with an advertisement in the Peeblesshire News almost a decade ago.\nAndrew Russel, realising that contemporary choirs could be the next big thing, asked for anyone interested in singing as part of a community choir to pop into the Eastgate on September 2, 2008.\nHe expected around 30.\nWhat he got was around 130.\nEven after auditions had taken place, there were still over 100 members.\nAnd many of these founder members are still with this big choir today as it prepares for its 10th birthday celebrations.\nInChorus quickly became known -for their vibrant enthusiastic performances.\nThey were invited to sing at the public opening of the Scottish Parliament in May 2010.\nThe same year, they were asked by the American organisers of the September Concerts - a programme set up following the 9/11 atrocities to promote peace through music - to stage a concert on September 11, which took place at a packed Edinburgh Festival Theatre, and was streamed around the world.\nThis led to the choir travelling to New York to take part in the 10th anniversary commemorations of 9/11 in 2011.\nInChorus embarked on a huge fundraising programme for this and were blown away by the support they received from the community.\nOne fundraiser was a concert in the Usher Hall where they were joined by, among others, Mhairi Campbell and Dougie Maclean. InChorus subsequently performed with Dougie at the Amber Festival in Perth.\nThe trip to New York was hugely memorable with the choir singing on the Red Steps in Times Square, at the annual NYPD concert, at various September Concerts in the city, and, most poignantly, at the British Memorial Garden to the relatives of the British people who had died on 9/11.\nMoira Pearson, who is one of the founding members and choir manager from 2009 to 2012, told us: \" When the advert for a New Peebles Choir was placed in the Peeblesshire News in September 2008 no-one could have imagined just how important InChorus would become to so many people.\n\"It was a great privilege to be the choir manager for three years, during which time we travelled to New York to support and sing at commemorative events for the 10th Anniversary of 9/11.\n\"The fundraising effort to enable the journey was immense but made much easier by the unstinting support of the Peebles community.\"\nAlthough the 9/11 concert will remain a highlight of the InChorus story, the successes and landmark achievements continued after they came home.\nThe next year, 2012, saw the choir performing to another full house at the Festival Theatre, this time raising funds for other charities which is what InChorus likes to do.\nThe following year they embarked upon their \u0026lsquoChoirathon\u0026rsquo in aid of Comic Relief, when they sang from 9.30am to 9.30pm in the sleet, but raised \u0026pound3,500 in the process.\nIn 2013 they also had their first foray to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in what was to be come a biennial venture, winning the covered sell-out laurels in 2013, 2015 and 2017.\nIn 2014 the choir decided to try its hand at competition winning themselves a \u0026lsquoChoir of the Day\u0026rsquo award at the Scottish auditions of Choir of the Year, proving that even a very large choir can be sufficiently disciplined in all the nuances of choral singing to make a good impression.\nOver the years InChorus members discovered they rather liked performing at music festivals and have sung at T in the Park, Meadows Festival, Fringe by the Sea at North Berwick, Big Burns Supper in Dumfries, Eden Festival, Lindisfarne, and last year on the main stage between Texas and the Manic Street Preachers, at the BBC Children in Need\u0026rsquos Carfest in front of an audience of 20,000 people.

While there, they performed on the bandstand in St Stephen\u0026rsquos Green and at the famous Cobblestone pub, as well as appearing as a flash mob all over the city.\nAly Skidmore, herself a long serving choir member, took over as Musical Director in 2014. Aly was responsible for the huge flash mob \u0026lsquoDancing in the Street\u0026rsquo event last year, involving the whole community.\nShe told us: \"Whilst singing is at the heart of everything that InChorus has achieved over the last 10 years, it\u0026rsquos never been only that.\n\"Through this organisation we have seen people\u0026rsquos friendships, confidence, skills, self-esteem and both emotional and physical health all flourish and grow over the years.\n\"In return the members give their time freely and generously to learn, rehearse and perform music for the benefit of others.\n\"In its time InChorus has achieved and given so much more than any of us really ever anticipated at the outset and I think every member feels so proud about that.\nIt\u0026rsquos amazing what a community can achieve when they group together, take a collective breath and burst into song.\"\nThey say that into every life a little rain must fall, and InChorus has not escaped, losing three much loved ladies to cancer.\nIn 2016 it was founder members Kitty Lyle and Celia Hayton and, just a few weeks ago, Bernice Brown - all are missed greatly.\nThroughout its 10 years the choir has raised over \u0026pound60,000 for other charities, both through its own concerts and through specific charity events.\nThis is something that is at the core of InChorus, something of which they are proud, and something which will continue in the years to come.\nAt one charity dinner they even put up an InChorus performance as an auction prize and were \u0026lsquosold\u0026rsquo for over \u0026pound1100. This, in turn, led to a performance at a very prestigious charity dinner in aid of breast cancer.\nTo celebrate its 10th birthday, the choir will be travelling to Barcelona in October for a long weekend of performances.\nBut before that they have a bit of a party planned in Peebles.\nOn September 1, the actual birthday weekend, they have organised their \u0026lsquoTen out of Ten\u0026rsquo day - when they will sing throughout the day from a list of at least ten different favourite songs, at ten different locations in Peebles.\nAlthough the earlier locations have yet to be revealed the finale will take place at the Eastgate Theatre, where it all started ten years ago, for an evening concert.\nThis will also be the final event of the 2018 Creative Peebles Festival.\nThe choir hopes you will join them or, at least, come and say hello.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"united-front-to-boost-the-borderlands","story":"HUNDREDS of stakeholders had their say on proposals to transform the Borderlands economy at a special conference in Dumfries on Monday.\nLeader of Dumfries and Galloway Council, Elaine Murray, welcomed more than 370 business representatives, public sector organisations and individuals to the first Borderlands conference.\nShe said: \u0026ldquoI am delighted that so many people attended on the day, this shows what an important project the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal is.\n\"One attendee described the conference as an \u0026lsquoIlluminating and fantastic event\u0026rsquo, which reflected the enthusiasm I perceived on the day, that this is a once in a generation opportunity which must be seized.\nFive local authorities from north and south of the border are working in partnership to put together a proposal that should have huge implications for those who live, work and visit the area.\nIt was the first opportunity for interested parties to hear about the themes that are being developed to underpin the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal \u0026ndash and to give their views on the major projects they believe would kickstart transformation.\nThe conference was held at a key time for the partnership, made up of Carlisle City, Cumbria County, Dumfries and Galloway, Northumberland County and Scottish Borders Councils.\nResponses from the conference will help the partnership to build a case to present to both the UK and Scottish Governments later this year. Views were sought on the Borderlands\u0026rsquo key themes: Digital Energy Destination Borderlands Rural Productivity Business Growth Transport Innovation and Skills and Quality of Place.\nThe conference had backing from both governments who have pledged support for a deal.\nKeith Brown MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Jobs and Fair Work, said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government has made clear our support for a proposed Borderlands deal in our budget statements. And we look forward to negotiating the detail of that deal when the partners are ready with their proposals. This is a key part of our commitment to 100 percent coverage of deals across Scotland.\n\u0026ldquoWe want to see an ambitious deal that focuses on driving inclusive growth and the priorities that will make a difference and help the economy thrive. We want a deal that helps address the area\u0026rsquos connectivity challenges, supports growth in sectors particularly important in the Borderlands, and creates more opportunities for all to attract people to the area.\n\u0026ldquoWe are working to tackle the economic challenges in the South of Scotland, having already committed to establishing a South of Scotland enterprise agency, and we want to ensure that priorities align to maximise impact and success.\nSpeaking ahead of the conference the Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell said:\n\"The Borderlands Growth Deal represents a unique opportunity to provide a real shot in the arm to the economy of our region, a region that faces similar challenges wherever you live or work within it.\n\u0026ldquoWorking with the proposals that have been prepared by local authorities, businesses and individuals, we will spend the summer shaping these in to a coherent deal that will support the economy of the region by encouraging people to invest in new opportunities, by building on our strengths and improving the lives of those who live here.\n\u0026ldquoIn that way, we will bring to the Borderlands the benefits that are now being seen across the UK as investment in City and Growth Deals progresses.\nDumfries and Galloway Council Chief Executive Gavin Stevenson said: \u0026ldquoCrucially we now sit between the emerging powerhouses of the central belt of Scotland and the Northern Powerhouse in England. Unless we act they will continue to suck up our young talent and skills.\n\u0026ldquoWe need to re-position ourselves, we need to stabilise and to stop our productivity falling and then we also need to reinvent. This feels like a once in a generation opportunity.\n\u0026ldquoWe know our potential, our children will not forgive us if there are no jobs in the future. I think we are at that point where we either put up or shut up. We get out there, we shout, we demand and we create the business opportunities.\nThose attending quizzed a panel, chaired by the UK Government\u0026rsquos Borderlands champion John Stevenson MP, on how the deal could support inclusivity, tourism projects and benefit small rural communities.\nFor more information visit the partnership website www.Borderlandsgrowth or email info@borderlandsgrowth\n"},{"url":null,"title":"youngsters-make-a-splash-at-braw-lads-swimming-gala","story":"SPECTATORS crammed into Galashiels Swimming Pool on Tuesday night for the Braw Lads\u0027 Swimming Gala.\nBraw Lad Greg Kelly, Braw Lass Kimberley O\u0027May and their attendants were given a rousing welcome as they came to support the young competitors.\nAnd the swimmers from all age groups put on a fantastic display throughout the evening, which culminated with the mixed aged group Braw Lads\u0027 Relay Race.\nThis event didn\u0027t disappoint.

Before that, in December 1828, Peebles Town Council had agreed that if a gas company was set up, it would be allowed to open up and lay pipes in the streets and if that proved successful, it would then have the street lamps lit by gas.\nInitially a site for a gasworks on the Old Town Green (now Greenside) was chosen, but it proved to be unsuitable. A site was found on the area of ground lying to the west of the Parish Church. Today the site is still visible and forms part of the parkland and walkways close to the modern swimming pool.\nOne of the factors which made the development of a gasworks feasible was the great improvement in major roads serving the town following the Turnpike Acts. That allowed coking coal to be brought to the town from the coalfields of Lanarkshire and Midlothian.\nTo begin with gas was produced for only ten months of the year and the street lights were lit for only about a third of the year, during the darkest winter months.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the demand for gas had greatly increased and as well as street lighting, was beginning to be used for household appliances such as gas cookers. In 1898 the assets of the Peebles Gas Company were acquired by the Town Council. Within a few years demand was outstripping supply and in 1905 it was decided to build a new gas works at Eshiels as the existing site, which also served as the council yard, was too restricted to allow for expansion. By then the existence of railways made it possible to import coal directly to the Eshiels site.\nIn 1948 the Town Council starting converting all street lighting to electricity. The gas works at Eshiels became part of the national system and continued in operation until the advent of North Sea gas in the late 1960s.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"were-so-proud-of-him-parents-of-galashiels-scout-with-adhd-hope-to-inspire-others-to-join-group","story":"THE parents of a Galashiels Scout with ADHD hope others will be inspired after the youngster won a prestigious award.\nAfter weeks of working hard to complete an array of challenges and tasks, Blair Valentine took home the Reiver Award at the Gala Scout Group annual general meeting last month.\nThe 10-year-old, who attends St Peter\u0026rsquos Primary School in Galashiels, received the award in recognition of his hard work after being nominated by numerous members of the Scouts.\nProud parents Dave and Mandy now hope their son\u0026rsquos success story will inspire other parents of children with ADHD.\nThe youngster was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in July 2013 at the age of six.\nBlair\u0026rsquos mum Mandy told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore so proud of him, Blair has worked very hard to get where he is, and we want others to know that just because a child has ADHD, it shouldn\u0026rsquot hold them back from going on to do great things.\n\u0026ldquoBlair gets especially inspired when hearing that celebrities have the same condition as him.\n\u0026ldquoUntil we looked into it, we had no idea just how many well-known people were also affected by it.

SS took his portion of fish after his family were fed and satisfied.\nLater that same day, SS returned with more fish and he was certainly making up for lost time.\nHe began to feed the youngsters himself while Mrs O was preening. The chicks were visibly stronger and more energised than the day before when they were hungry.\nAfter the first chick was full it lay down on its side while the other chick fed and when it had had enough to eat, chick number one would get up and come back over for seconds.\nThe week progressed into warm weather and scorching sunshine and the chicks ranged from being sleepy and still, to being far too adventurous, toddling about the nest using their budding wings as little stilts to enable them to clamber around.\nThese little excursions led them to venture too far to the edges and the parent birds used distraction with fish to bring them away and back into the middle.\nThey also began to pay more attention to the nest construction, by moving sticks around and building up the edges, like little safety barriers to prevent any toppling over the edge.\nSadly, for one osprey family in the Borders, two chicks did fall to their death from the nest during the recent high winds.\nBut the attentive Mrs O and SS seem to have metaphorically red taped the danger zone by building stick walls just high enough to prevent any earnest climbing from a curious young osprey wanting to peer over the side.\nvar panels = panels || []var panel = {    name: \u0027RelatedArticles\u0027,    target: \u0027related-articles\u0027,    params: {ns: \u0027redesign\u0027, \u0027article_ids\u0027: \u002716325156,16324961,16324950,16324926,16324091\u0027, \u0027more_articles_heading\u0027: \u0027More articles\u0027}}panels.push(panel)\nBy now, the young ospreys have grown stronger and the fluffy down is spotted with the onset of growing feathers.\nThey no longer look feeble and weak and their fortunes have rapidly turned around since the fish supply has picked up.\nWe finally have news of PX1 (Paxman\u0027s bird) whose satellite tracker alerted us to the fact that he had died in the north of Scotland near to the Helmsdale River.\nThe carcass and tag have been recovered and it seems that his neck was broken, we believe, from colliding into newly erected deer fencing along the side of a forestry plantation.\nIt is such a terrible shame to lose this wonderful, healthy, two-year-old male osprey.\nJeremy Paxman was very saddened to hear of the loss of this bird and we are very grateful to him for his interest and support for the Tweed Valley Osprey Project.\nHe has agreed that his involvement will continue in the future, through the tracking of further ospreys.\nThe volunteers for the osprey project were invited to attend the ringing of goshawk chicks this week in Tweed Valley Forest Park and they were privileged to witness them being fitted with red darvic rings with white letters of JP and PL, by Tony Lightley, after Eve Schulte climbed the fir tree to lower them to the forest floor.\nRhona Anderson took some great photos of these magnificent birds and she has also been filming pine martens in the forest.\nThe captured footage of the whole pine marten family together and the antics of the three little kits with their mum and dad can be viewed in the video above or at \nhttps://www.flickr/photos/borderslass/28099626057/in/photostream/\nRead the latest Tweed Valley Osprey News every week throughout the summer in the Border  and Peeblesshire News newspapers\n"},{"url":null,"title":"500-mile-cycle-across-scotland-raises-20k-for-charity","story":"AN INNERLEITHEN man has cycled 516 miles in five days \u0026ndash raising \u0026pound21,000 for charity.\nMountain biker Kevin Marshall recently completed the mammoth challenge around the north Scottish coastline \u0026ndash all in aid of a cause close to his heart.\nThe idea to take on the challenge originated during a mountain biking trip to Glencoe last August, when Kevin, and his friend Steve, both agreed they wanted to do something to support the charities Macmillan and Friends of Anchor, who helped Steve\u0026rsquos mum and dad, and Kevin\u0026rsquos mum, before they passed away.\nKevin said: \u0026ldquoWe agreed that the North Coast 500 (NC500) was a suitably tough challenge, both to raise awareness and hopefully raise a reasonable amount of cash.\n\u0026ldquoThe team that completed the ride with me are all very close friends, the majority of us met when we were 18 when we started university in Aberdeen and have been close friends ever since.

The route starts in Inverness, weaves along the west coast to Applecross and then northwards towards the towns of Torridon and Ullapool.\nFrom there, the team ventured to some of the most northerly coastal points in Scotland, passing by Caithness and John o\u0026rsquo Groats before heading south again through Dingwall and back to Inverness.\n\u0026ldquoDay one was probably the most challenging followed closely by day three, Kevin added.\n\u0026ldquoIt included 2,200 metres of climbing, eight hours of riding, and a top temperature of 27 degrees. However, the highlight was riding up the Bealach na B\u0026agrave.

The atmosphere here is just amazing.\u0026#8217Away from the World Cup frenzy taking place across the country, Michael described life and work in Peru’s capital, the third-largest city in the Americas.He said: \u0026#8216Lima is a crazy, bustling city.

I have practiced more and more with Carla as she speaks it fluently and I would like to become fluent too.’Back in football-mad Lima, Michael described the scene before Peru’s play-off win over Oceanian champions New Zealand last November, which sealed qualification.He said: \u0026#8216Peru\u0026#8217s fans knew they were one game away from the World Cup, and rightly or wrongly, did everything to help their team advance.\u0026#8216People set off fireworks and cars beeped their horns outside the New Zealand squad\u0026#8217s hotel in the early hours of the morning of the match.\u0026#8216When Peru won 2-0, there was pandemonium.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.

Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"haddington-pub-seeking-new-owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Publication of the report followed a visit to the school by a team of inspectors last September.  The quality indicators for the school were listed \u0027good\u0027, with one, for ensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion, rated \u0027very good\u0027.  Inspectors found the following strengths in the school\u0027s work:  - Strong relationships exist between staff and children across the school and nursery which are based on shared values  - In the nursery, children are motivated and confident, and are able to make choices about their play, particularly outdoors. Across the primary stages, children are committed to and proud of being part of their school community  - The committed staff team, led by the headteacher, work well together in their goal to secure positive outcomes for children. Wellbeing is central to the whole school community and staff provide a nurturing learning environment where children receive effective support.  Areas for improvement were identified and discussed with the headteacher and a representative from East Lothian Council.  They were:  - Increasing the opportunities for children to be more active and independent in their learning  - Continuing to improve attainment, ensuring that the pace and challenge of learning meets the needs of all children  - Continuing to develop the opportunities for leadership at all levels to support the school improvement. Increasing the scope for all members of the school community, including parents, partners and children, to be involved in discussions about aspects of the life and work of the school.  The quality indicators for the primary school showed a \u0027good\u0027 result for: leadership of change learning, teaching and assessment and raising attainment and achievement. The school achieved \u0027very good\u0027 for ensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion.  The nursery received a \u0027good\u0027 quality indicator across the board for: leadership of change learning, teaching and assessment securing children\u0027s progress and ensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, said: \"I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the school staff and pupils for their hard work in achieving positive outcomes for children and their families.  \"I wish to thank Sarah Ogden in particular, our headteacher, for the strength of leadership and commitment that she has shown in recent months for the school to achieve this positive recognition.  \"I am pleased to report that Education Scotland has advised us that no further inspections are planned at the school.  \"I am also delighted to report that the school has made good progress with the areas for improvement identified within the report.

Organised by the darts team at The Riverside Tavern, the event was one of several held throughout the year which raised a total of \u0026pound7,787.  The cash was divided between Prostate Scotland, which helps prostate cancer sufferers, and ward 1, unit 4, oncology, for patients with cancer at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh \u0026ndash each receiving \u0026pound3,893.  The latter was chosen as the darts team\u0026rsquos captain, Michael Burgess, was treated there for leukaemia.  \u0026ldquoI wanted to give something back as they really looked after us, he said.  The walk was the pub\u0026rsquos fourth and final charity event of the year and followed a bowls competition, eight-hour darts marathon and darts competition. Participants walked six miles from The Riverside to Portobello via the promenade.  In April, a thief stole the pub\u0026rsquos collection bottle containing about \u0026pound400 but local taxi owner John Cullen stepped in to hold a bonus ball fundraiser when he heard about the break-in.  Over 32 years, the pub\u0026rsquos darts team has raised more than \u0026pound100,000 for different charities. Led by John Campbell from Whitecraig, the players have held everything from collections to 12-hour darts marathons and competitions, and annual fancy dress sponsored walks during their time based at the Deantown Bowling Club and former Dolphin Inn at Whitecraig, and now The Riverside.

Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.  The family have also received support from the charity \u0026lsquoFinding Your Feet\u0026rsquo, which helps families affected by amputation or limb difference.

North Berwick\u0026rsquos Law Primary School P6 pupils were looking forward to the trip to Yellowcraig, by Dirleton, where one class was due to camp out tonight (Wednesday) and another tomorrow (Thursday).  Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.  The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out. This has various implications for our risk assessments for the trip and, having taken advice from a number of sources, we have decided not to stay overnight at the site this week.  \u0026ldquoWe realise this will be disappointing news and apologise for any inconvenience, but we will look into the possibility of the pupils having a night in tents at another venue after the summer.  The camping trip is usually held in a field on the left of the road leading into the car parks at Yellowcraig.  An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWhile the pupils will be taking part in all of the planned activities, arrangements are being made for them to be picked up at 7pm instead of camping overnight.  \u0026ldquoThis decision has been taken as the school understands there may be a number of people already using the area.

A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders. That\u0026rsquos why I\u0026rsquom pleased cabinet has agreed that the council will hold a consultation and carry out a feasibility study. This will be launched in due course.

Margaret and Keith Morris moved from a Dunedin Canmore property in Bathgate last September into the phase two of Mill House \u0026ndash an amenity housing development for residents aged 55 and over.  Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.

The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.

Numerous complaints were made on social media regarding cars and, in particular, car windscreens being covered in dust late last month.  Residents such as Seona Mason-Chadburn, who lives in Dunbar town centre, contacted the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and Tarmac, which operates Dunbar Cement Plant to the south-east of the town, about the discharge.  She told the Courier how she had attempted to use her window wipers to clear her front windscreen, only to discover the dust.  She said her windscreen felt like \u0026ldquosandpaper and compared the dust to the \u0026ldquobloom on a black grape.  A spokesman for SEPA added: \u0026ldquoEvery day SEPA works to protect and enhance Scotland\u0026rsquos environment and we are clear that compliance is non-negotiable.  \u0026ldquoIn response to local complaints, SEPA officers responded to reports of significant dust in the Dunbar area.  \u0026ldquoOfficers identified the source of the dust and are working with Tarmac to prevent a re-occurrence.  \u0026ldquoWe would advise members of the public to contact our 24-hour pollution hotline on 0800 807060 to report pollution events.  Tarmac has confirmed that the dust escaped, with an internal investigation being carried out.  Oliver Curtin, plant manager, said: \u0026ldquoIn the early hours of May 24 we experienced an isolated and brief incident where a small amount of limestone-based dust escaped from the site.  \u0026ldquoWe took action quickly and have been working with SEPA and conducting our own investigations to prevent a recurrence.

As soon as the discharge was detected, the process was \u0026ldquoimmediately shut down but \u0026ldquounfortunately some dust had already escaped into the atmosphere, said Tarmac.  The dry weather and wind direction resulted in the dust being carried towards Dunbar.

Councillor McMillan said it had been a great honour to be joined by veterans from East Lothian at the flag-raising ceremony which took place on Monday morning.  He told those in attendance: \"Today is an opportunity to recognise the enormous contribution made by service personnel - past and present - and pay tribute to those who very sadly paid the ultimate sacrifice.  \"This November marks a century since the end of the First World War. A large number of residents left East Lothian in service of their country \u0026ndash many of whom, tragically, would never return.  \"Sadly, in the 100 years since, the world has seen all too many conflicts \u0026ndash some on a large scale, others more confined. In war, and in peacetime, our armed forces have promoted peace and security, confronted terrorism, and delivered aid to those in need.  \"That\u0026rsquos why, as Provost of East Lothian, I value occasions such as Armed Forces Day. A chance to give thanks, remember, reflect and look ahead.\"  Mr McMillan also paid tribute to the role of women in the military and in times of conflict, noting that 2018 was also the 100th anniversary of the first women being given the vote.  He said: \"Women played a significant role in the war effort, taking on work such as farming, transport and munition production, and the perseverance of Suffrage activity subsequently led to women being given the right to vote.  \"For a number of years now women have deservedly been playing a full and active role in our Armed Forces \u0026ndash reflective of the increasingly inclusive society in which we all live and are so keen to protect.\"  Veterans who attended the ceremony on Monday were invited to enjoy refreshments after the event."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7979931.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scotlands-best-black-pudding-made-in-east-lothian","story":"              A NORTH Berwick-based butcher is celebrating after it was judged the makers of Scotland\u0026rsquos finest black pudding.

The debate during Health Question Time at Holyrood last Wednesday followed a recent public meeting which was organised by East Lothian MP Martin Whitfield and Lothian MSP Kezia Dugdale (both Labour) at the Fisherrow Centre, which attracted more than 200 people.  Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"              VIKTOR Krum, Percy Weasley and Malfoy\u0027s sidekick Goyle are all heading to Musselburgh this summer to join in the fun asHarry Potter\u0027s \u0026lsquoSchool of Witchcraft \u0026amp Wizardry\u0026rsquo arrives in the town.

He said: \"Ilma\u0026rsquos entry, which included simple messages such as \u0026lsquoBe kind to each other\u0026rsquo, and \u0026lsquopick up litter because we need to save the environment\u0026rsquo really summed up what we can all do to make East Lothian \u0026ndash and life - better for everyone, not just for young people.\"  Louise, meanwhile, was joined at the prizegiving by her grandmother Sheena Watt, who said: \"I am just so proud of her.\"  And of her entry, Haddington and Lammermuir ward member Cllr McMillan said: \"Louise\u0026rsquos entry, which focused on education and teaching young people, used a really creative approach and asked us to think \u0026lsquooutside the box\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash that we need to remember that everyone is unique and that we can all learn from each other.

WE ALL know that tadpoles turn into frogs. Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7919320.jpg?htype=160\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"what-the-papers-say-july-1","story":"              Brexit, peace in the Middle East and the latest from the World Cup in Russia are among the stories making the front pages on Sunday.

On Thursday, Glasgow recorded its hottest day since records began as another sweltering day saw the temperature peak at 31.9C (89.4F).  The city beat Wednesday\u0026rsquos high of 31.3C (88.3F) in Aviemore in the Highlands, and came close to matching the hottest June day ever recorded in Scotland - 32.2C (89.9F) at Ochtertyre in Perth and Kinross in 1893.  As tens of thousands of music lovers flock to Glasgow for TRNSMT at Glasgow Green and Fiesta x Fold in Kelvingrove Park, revellers are being urged to stock up on sunscreen and water.  Temperatures in the city will dip slightly, but it will still be warm for the week ahead with plenty of sunshine and temperatures around the 25C mark.  The first hosepipe ban is likely to come into place in Northern Ireland this weekend.  Northern Ireland Water said demand is outstripping supply, leaving them with no option but to bring in the ban in order to save water.  Scottish Water said it is managing supplies across the country and will continue to monitor the situation closely.  Only two localised areas in Scotland have been issued with advice to \u0026ldquouse water wisely - parts of Moray and the Stornoway area of Lewis.  Other parts of the UK have urged water consumers to take simple steps to reduce the amount they use.  Top tips include taking a shorter shower, not leaving the taps running and re-using paddling pool water for plants in the garden.  Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said: \u0026ldquoWe are going to see a continuation of the current warm spell, but the temperatures over the next few days are not likely to be the warmest of the year so far.  \u0026ldquoI think, for now, temperatures have peaked and we are not expecting to see any records today.  \u0026ldquoWe will begin to have a slightly fresher feel, bringing the temperatures down, not by much, by one or two degrees.  Gritters have been deployed in some areas, spreading crushed rock dust onto melting roads to create a non-stick layer between the surface and vehicles.  Motorists have been advised to use warm soapy water to wash sticky tar from their vehicles.  Some railway tracks have soared to nearly 50C (122F), leading them to expand and bend.  ScotRail customers have seen massive disruption across the Glasgow network for three days now as the railway lines buckle in the hot weather, with many speed restriction in place for train drivers.  The Met Office\u0026rsquos heat-health watch alert has remained at level two all week, meaning social and healthcare services are at the ready to reduce harm from a potential heatwave.  This week is the first time since 2013 all four nations in the UK have seen temperatures of 30C or above, the Met Office said.  The rising temperatures have also come with warnings to be careful near water and in the countryside, where fire crews have been tackling wildfires, including one in Bathgate.  The heat has already claimed casualties.  The family of 13-year-old Ryan Evans, whose body was recovered on Wednesday, two days after he got into difficulty at Westport Lake in Stoke-on-Trent, warned of the dangers of playing and swimming in open water.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe just cannot emphasise enough the dangers of swimming in open water, especially where young children are concerned.  \u0026ldquoOur message is simple: please don\u0027t do it.  A 17-year-old boy was found dead in the River Aire in Leeds in the early hours of Wednesday morning following a search and rescue operation.  It is believed he got into difficulties while swimming on Tuesday evening.  The body of a man was also recovered from a lake in Nutfield, Surrey, on Monday.  The RNLI has urged those heading to the seaside to seek out beaches with a lifeguard.  There is bad news for farmers growing crops and the firefighters and soldiers battling the ongoing incident on Saddleworth Moor in north-west England as no significant rainfall is forecast in the coming days.  Parts of the Moor have been alight for six days, with firefighters saying it could take weeks to extinguish.  A new moorland blaze - on Winter Hill, near Rivington, Lancashire - broke out on Thursday with huge plumes of smoke visible from the area surrounding the moorland.  Firefighters are also still fighting a 500-metre long gorse fire on the Glenshane Pass in County Londonderry, more than 48 hours after it first broke out.  The RSPCA called on pet owners to keep a close eye on their animals in the heat after receiving 625 calls about animals in hot environments between June 11 and 24 - the majority about dogs in hot cars."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7996889.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"trnsmt-2018-bar-prices-at-glasgow-festival-revealed","story":"              THE bar prices have been revealed for TRNSMT festival.

We are fond of our city, us citizens of Glasgow, and we are just as fond of talking about it. If you choose to take a journey by taxi and would rather not become involved in a stilted conversation with your driver\u0026rsquos back just ask him to tell you what makes Glasgow special and why we regard our city as the business the berries the jinkies the most refined of the cat\u0026rsquos whiskers.  In an arboreal little embankment set back from Woodlands Road, the esoteric thoroughfare that connects the city centre to its polished West End, is a modest construction that defines this city like little else. It is the world\u0026rsquos only two-legged equestrian statue that pays homage to the great cartoonist and poet, Bud Neill. This wee bronze treasure depicts the three main characters of Neill\u0026rsquos Lobey Dosser cartoon strip which ran for decades in the Evening Times from 1949. It chronicled the happenings in an imaginary Glasgow township called Calton Creek which is somehow located in Arizona in the middle of America\u0026rsquos Wild West. The horse is called El Fideldo (Elfie) and she carries on her back Lobey, sheriff of Calton Creek as well as his arch-nemesis Rank Bajin. In the strip the residents of Calton Creek all enjoyed a polite relationship with the local Native Americans whose leader Big Chief Toffy Teeth is often received with polite hospitality and offered fish and chips.  I was delighted that the Bud Neill memorial has been included in a book entitled 111 places in Glasgow That You Shouldn\u0026rsquot Miss. Yet how could it not have been? The author is Tom Shields, one of the best journalists to have written for The Herald and whose Diary columns and those of his friend Jack McLean inspired a generation of young Glaswegians to join the newspaper game.  Tom was too modest to record his own part in making the Bud Neill memorial happen, so I shall. Having floated the idea of a statue in his Diary column, his army of readers duly took up the cause and the sculpture and design was paid for out of their subscriptions, for which they were all sworn in as honorary deputy sheriffs of Calton Creek.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos difficult to convey just how successful Bud Neill\u0026rsquos cartoon stretch became, said Shields. \u0026ldquoAt the end of the working day, people formed queues at newsagents to wait on his latest offering in that day\u0026rsquos Evening Times. He had a forensic wit that seemed to capture Glasgow life and culture and the humour of its people.  Shields\u0026rsquo Diary column in The Herald made it the best-read feature in the paper and it often bore the imprint of Neill. It too chronicled the people and events of Glasgow and it was peppered with a quiet wit that seemed almost subversive. If Bud Neill could have written a newspaper column he would have made it look like Tom\u0026rsquos.  I MEET Tom on a glorious Glasgow day where the temperature has long ago climbed beyond the critical \u0026lsquotaps-aff\u0026rsquo mark in Cathedral Square at the top of the High Street. It\u0026rsquos here too that I encounter one of the many surprises in his book. \u0026ldquoI was once told that many of Glasgow\u0026rsquos treasures are hidden in plain sight. I\u0026rsquom not sure exactly what that means but I think that they have been airbrushed out of the history of our city and that often we walk past them or through them or above them not knowing of their presence or the stories that they carry.  I\u0026rsquove arranged to meet him at the old Police Box that sits towards the front of Cathedral Square and which has metamorphosed into the Empire Coffee Shop. It is run by barristo and chef Rocco Conforti and the following conversation takes place.  \u0026ldquoDo you take a card as I\u0026rsquove only a couple of quid of change.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not working today, but not to worry you can hand it in any time.  \u0026ldquoWell, I\u0026rsquom meeting my friend here so he can cough up the extra 20p for your cappuccino. I used to look after his expenses, so he owes me a few.  \u0026ldquoAh, so what do you do? I work in newspapers and \u0026hellip  \u0026ldquoAh, you\u0026rsquore here to meet Tom \u0026hellip I am in his book.  And Rocco then brandishes a copy of it and it\u0026rsquos clear that he\u0026rsquos as happy as Luigi to be included in it. \u0026ldquoI am selling them here.  The coffee is brand new, by the way, but there\u0026rsquos a reason why an apparently historically and culturally unremarkable place such as this appears in a book about places in Glasgow you shouldn\u0026rsquot miss. It tells a story of a time when the city had more than 300 of these and how a smart idea followed by hard graft and a little tenderness has resurrected them. It begins a theme running through this book which is much, much more than a quaint travel guide. \u0026ldquoWe all have our own ideas of Glasgow you know it when you see it sometimes, says Tom. This was one of those times and one of those places, said Tom.  Behind Rocco\u0026rsquos Police Coffee Box is a statue whose existence until last week was unknown to me. It sits in its own grove, sheltering under trees and fenced off with iron railings. It\u0026rsquos as if it is here only on sufferance, yet it is a high and handsome thing: a bronze equestrian sculpture and a rider brandishing a sword and clad in the style of a Roman General. It\u0026rsquos none other than King Billy himself or \u0026ldquoGlasgow\u0026rsquos favourite Orangeman as Tom has described it. \u0026ldquoThis one\u0026rsquos a bit of an enigma, says Tom. \u0026ldquoIt also might be deemed to be curiously Vaticanesque by some of the Order\u0026rsquos present-day adherents. It began life near the foot of the street on which he is currently perched in 1735 at Glasgow Cross.  Across the road behind Provand\u0026rsquos Lordship there\u0026rsquos another hidden delight. This is beginning to get embarrassing. In the space of half an hour at the top of Glasgow\u0026rsquos most historic street (still beautiful despite the wrecking ball that Glasgow City Council and Strathclyde University have taken to it) I have been introduced to three landmarks previously unknown to me.  This is St Nicholas Garden where Bishop Edward Muirhead set up St Nicholas Hospital to care for indigent, elderly men. The place exists only in its name and in this garden, landscaped in 1995, and which carries echoes of its original purpose. We\u0026rsquore both enchanted by it. \u0026ldquoI like that some imagination and sensitivity to its original use has gone into its design. The gardens are full of medicinal herbs and spices which recall its origins. It\u0026rsquos beautifully landscaped and you can be peaceful here. If only the same care and attention had gone into that faux-baronial piece of kitsch across the road. This is the only mention of the new and unlovely Museum of Religion in this book.  A pattern is stitched into the pages of this book and these places at the top of the High Street carry glimpses of it. The book will be marketed as a travel guide or a travel companion but this is no insipid selection of the usual Glasgow landmarks that appear in tourist brochures. Most Glaswegians who read this will be unfamiliar with more than half of these chosen places. Many of them have slowly been scrubbed out of the city\u0026rsquos narrative because they shine a torch on the rapacious vandalism and rank stupidity of planners and politicians who levelled some lovely old neighbourhoods and eviscerated others.  One of these districts is Anderston, a vibrant old working class neighbourhood which formed a gateway to the city centre on its western approach. But Glasgow\u0026rsquos civic vandals drove a motorway through the middle of it, cutting it off from the centre and then leaving it to twist in the wind as the families moved out and some beautiful tenements came down. \u0026ldquoWhy couldn\u0026rsquot they just have built it under this neighbourhood, or over it? Why did they take a wrecking ball to an entire community? asks Tom.  And yet a remembrance of what this place once looked like lives in the stones of a remarkable building surrounded by dismal modern apartment blocks that possess all the charm and imagination of a port-a-cabin. This is the old Savings Bank, a gorgeous A-listed, red sandstone tenement inlaid with a craftsmanship and artistry you\u0026rsquoll travel far to match. Tom warms to its tale and the themes which suffuse the rest of his book. \u0026ldquoI love the carving of that wised-looking chap, clutching a bag of money and lifting a finger as if to caution prudence in the ways of handling it. This is Henry Duncan, founder of the Savings Bank movement who studied at St Andrews University before being sent to Liverpool to work in a bank. But a life in the service of The Lord beckoned and as a minister he was able to combine his sacred calling with his practical training and the concept of bank to help ordinary people survive hard times. What would old man Duncan have made of today\u0026rsquos banks which drive people and small firms into hardship and then feed off their carcasses?  And then there\u0026rsquos the tragedy of Springburn which seems to encapsulate how a working class community can be hollowed out and left to rot. In the book Tom takes us to Springburn Park set in the midst of a proud inner city neighbourhood to the north of the city centre. Here, his anger is barely concealed: \u0026ldquoIt its day it was home to the world\u0026rsquos biggest chemical works and Europe\u0026rsquos biggest manufacturer of railway engines. But instead of fixing its slum housing and attempting to manage industrial downturn, the decision was taken simply to doze 85 per cent of vibrant Springburn to the ground. The most vicious wound was a huge dual carriageway punched through its heart for the benefit of commuters from wealthier suburbs. Other cities protect and develop their old communities and help them in hard times Glasgow builds concrete freeways like this and the M8 and the M77 (another road built through a working class community to accommodate the lifestyles of affluent people in the southern suburbs).  The book is infused with a gentle subversiveness and a whispered humour as though providing a voice for the Glaswegians who have gone and whose lives went uncelebrated and often disrupted by planners and politicians. Some time soon I will take a two-week vacation to my own city and discover it once more get to know the people who made it. This will be my guide.  111 Places in Glasgow That You Shouldn\u0027t Miss, by Tom Shields, is published by Emons, \u0026pound12.99  TOM SHIELDS\u0027 HIDDEN GLASGOW GEMS  Wallace\u0026rsquos Well (Auchinleck Road)  The historic significance of this modest shrine to Scotland\u0026rsquos most famous freedom fighter cannot be over-stated. It was here in 1305 that William Wallace had his last sip of water as a free man.  The Berkeley Suite (North Street)  A bar and ballroom frozen in time and known only to Glasgow\u0026rsquos hip cognoscenti and demi-monde. The pawn shop fa\u0026ccedilade is just that, a fa\u0026ccedilade, to deter those who really ought to know. It carries echoes of swinging, 60s Glasgow.  Buffalo Bill statue (Whitehill Street)  This evocative sculpture holds a story that is at once tragic and hilarious, involving a native American called Kicking Bear, his belligerent chum Charging Thunder, an assault on a city impresario and allegations of spiked whisky in an east end pub.  The Cuningar Loop (Dalmarnock)  The site of the original Gorbals and a geographical curiosity on the Clyde it became a dumping ground for building rubble. Now it\u0026rsquos happily re-invented as a children\u0026rsquos adventure park hosting a vast assortment of wildlife, sculptures and activities.  Homeless Jesus (Nelson Mandela Place)  Perhaps only in Glasgow, this stunning bronze depicts Jesus curled up and lying on a bench. The wounds on the feet are the clue and it\u0026rsquos a stark reminder of Glasgow\u0026rsquos poor and downtrodden in the middle of its main palaces of consumption.  La Pasionara Memorial (Custom House Quay, Clyde Street)  This simple tribute to Dolores Ibarruri, the great Republican activist in the Spanish Civil War stands as a memorial to the Scots who joined the International brigade to fight against Franco and fascism. Its construction led to a small civil war in Glasgow\u0026rsquos City Chambers too.  The Women\u0026rsquos Library (Landressy Street)  The only accredited museum in the UK devoted to women\u0026rsquos lives, struggles and achievements. It\u0026rsquos also a lending library and is housed in an Edwardian architectural jewel funded by Carnegie in 1906."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7991908.jpg?type=article-full","title":"top-10-scotlands-all-time-favourite-albums","story":"              Scotland has always punched above its weight when it comes to pop and rock, producing some of the most talented, sublime, quirky and best-loved bands and performers of the last 50 years, from influential indie pioneers to global superstars.  Picking a favourite Scottish album from such a packed field was always going to be a tough task, and so it proved when we asked readers to do just that.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  We were inundated with hundreds of votes from across Scotland, the UK and as far afield as the Netherlands, Sweden and the US, and our quest got folk talking and reminiscing in offices, pubs and on social media, revisiting and celebrating the music that has been the soundtrack to their lives.  So, here we have it: Scotland\u0026rsquos top 10 favourite albums.  10 \u0026ndash Raintown, Deacon Blue, 1987    The band\u0026rsquos debut is packed to the rafters with sheer quality and from beginning to end simply never lets up. Dundonian singer-songwriter Ricky Ross showcased his talent, intent and also a keen political and social awareness across 13 songs, among them Scotland\u0026rsquos other national anthem, Dignity.  9 \u0026ndash High Land, Hard Rain, Aztec Camera, 1983    Could Roddy Frame really only have been 18 when he recorded Oblivious, Walk Out to Winter and We Could Send Letters? East Kilbride\u0026rsquos boy wonder emerges fully formed on this astonishing debut album from 1983, having soaked up the pop, soul and punk influences of his prodigious musical youth and reimagined them as perfectly-crafted jangle-pop. The sound of young Scotland has rarely sounded this fresh.  8 \u0026ndash Strange Kind of Love, Love and Money, 1988    Though Love and Money\u0026rsquos particular brand of literate, glossy soul-pop looked to America for inspiration, lyrics about \u0026ldquoraining on Jocelyn Square were resolutely, affectionately Glaswegian. In another place, another time, Love and Money could have been the biggest band in the world.  7 \u0026ndash If You\u0026rsquore Feeling Sinister, Belle and Sebastian, 1996    Second albums are supposed to be difficult but Belle and Sebastian arguably never surpassed the stunning collection of songs that comprised their sophomore effort, giving a masterclass in how to mix melody, melancholy, nostalgia and humour.  6 \u0026ndash Bandwagonesque, Teenage Fanclub, 1991    The album that thrust Teenage Fanclub into the indie big league. From opening track The Concept to the closing echoes of Is This Music?, it is jam-packed with all the qualities fans have come to love about Bellshill\u0026rsquos finest four-piece: Byrds-influenced, melody-rich songs delivered in an endearing, gently shambolic fashion.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  5 \u0026ndash Heaven Or Las Vegas, The Cocteau Twins, 1990    Elizabeth Fraser\u0026rsquos otherworldly voice set over Robin Guthrie\u0026rsquos ethereal soundtrack is one of Scotland\u0026rsquos greatest musical pleasures and treasures, and this most accessible of Cocteau\u0026rsquos albums is simply awash with blissed-out grandeur. Could they really have been from Grangemouth? Oh yes.  4 \u0026ndash A Walk Across the Rooftops, The Blue Nile, 1984    Sounding nothing like anything else that came out of Scotland, the UK or indeed anywhere else in 1984, this debut fused spare synth precision with exuberant vocal sincerity to stunning effect. Tinseltown in the Rain, that bittersweet slice of cinematic perfection, remains the ultimate ode to Glasgow.  3 \u0026ndash The Midnight Organ Fight, Frightened Rabbit, 2008    Since Scott Hutchison\u0026rsquos untimely death in May, listening to the music he and his bandmates created has been a particularly sad and difficult task. But this album is simply too good to stop listening to. Revisiting is painful but cathartic, and like all of the \u0026nbspHutchison\u0026rsquos work, it makes you feel like it\u0026rsquos okay to be sad.\u0026nbsp  2 \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, The Trashcan Sinatras, 1993    From post-Smiths jangleism on their debut the Ayrshire gang blossomed to reveal an emotionally rich and enduring marriage of musicality and lyrical nous never before seen within spitting distance of Irvine or anywhere else, crowned by flawless performances by one of Scottish pop\u0026rsquos most devastating singers, Eddi Reader\u0026rsquos younger brother Frank.  1 \u0026ndash Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989    Only seven songs in length, Hats is a masterpiece of love, loss and redemption writ large over a lush, soulful and at times overwhelmingly beautiful soundscape, inseparable from the city of its birth, Glasgow. For more than 25 years it has offered endless inspiration and comfort. \u0026ldquoWhen all the rainy pavements lead to you, sings a heartbroken Paul Buchanan on From a Late Night Train. The rainy pavements of Glasgow will always lead to Hats.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  Here\u0027s what you said about Hats:  Christine Gardner, Rotterdam: Head and shoulders above the rest. A magnificent album that I continue to listen to regularly after almost 30 years. It is quite simply a masterpiece. It continues to draw you in, delight your senses, touch your emotions and somehow mirror your own very personal experiences. And yet it is also essentially Scottish \u0026ndash maybe something to do with our collective psyche, despite all our individual differences.  Martin McCarthy: Hats has so many layers, from dreamy songs like Over the Hillside and Let\u0026rsquos Go Out Tonight to more upbeat songs like Headlights on the Parade and \u0026ldquoThe Downtown Lights.  Saturday Night is just a sublime song, I love the pitch perfect bass, the stunning keyboards and Paul Buchanan\u0027s emotional voice. This was played at our wedding to a full dancefloor and will always be so special. The songs on Hats convey love, beauty, pain and loss, and can push me to tears of utter joy and euphoria.  Alex Watkins: It\u0026rsquos the album I always return to just something about the memories and emotions it always conjures up.  Kevin Jackson: Hats is the best album ever recorded anywhere by anyone. It touches you in a way that others must stand back in awe and adoration of. It is a thing of perfection. When some of the finest innovative talents of our time see it as one of the greatest albums ever, it is because it has no peers.  Peter Morgan: I\u0027m going to plump for Hats, that lush, aching, bruised and battered homage to love and loss.  John Reader: I listen to a lot of music, including lots of new stuff but always have Hats on at some point every week. Still hooks me in with its lush simplicity. I remember saying to someone more than 25 years ago that of all the music around at that time I reckoned I\u0027d be listening to Hats for the rest of my life. Not wrong so far.  Colin Lunn: I love A Walk Across the Rooftops, the best first album by any group, not only in Scotland but worldwide. However, Hats was probably a better, more perfect album although it didn\u0026rsquot have the same influence. Tough, tough choice but I\u0026rsquoll go for Hats by a very, very fine margin.  Here\u0026rsquos what you had to say about some of the other music on the list:  Kyle Wallace: I\u0027ve Seen Everything by the Trashcan Sinatras is part of the soundtrack to my life. Listened to it through my dad\u0027s death and the college years. So many great songs associated with great memories.  John Richards: This was a very difficult choice. Scottish groups (I\u0027m Welsh) have a disproportionately large place in my music collection \u0026ndash particularly those who came to prominence in the 1980s. My top 20 regularly features the work of the Blue Nile, Danny Wilson, Aztec Camera, Deacon Blue and Love \u0026amp Money. However, it\u0027s got to be an album from the year I turned 19, when I went to university and the myriad possibilities that life had to offer opened up before me. The song (and album) that soundtracked that life-changing period is still my favourite Scottish album: Strange Kind of Love by Love \u0026amp Money.  Stuart Duncan: My vote is for The Midnight Organ Fight by Frightened Rabbit. An album that, as your writer said, \u0026ldquomakes it feel it\u0026rsquos OK to be sad. The lyrics hit home more than any album I\u0026rsquove ever listened to. Scott Hutchison gave me a feeling that everything was going to be OK, that I would get through things. I\u0026rsquod say he helped changed me as a person. It still hasn\u0026rsquot stuck in that he\u0026rsquos no longer here [Hutchsion took his own life in May] but my vote would be the same regardless of the circumstances.  Danny Tennyson: My favourite album by a Scottish band \u0026ndash or any other band for that matter \u0026ndash has to High Land Hard Rain, by Aztec Camera. The fact that Roddy was probably only 15 or 16 when he wrote most of the tracks for the album makes it all the more remarkable. He continues to be a genius to this day.  Shane Brown, Illinois: Why is it that I live in the centre boring part of America (the states you fly over to get somewhere else interesting), and should by location and birthright be a huge fan of Slipknot, but instead find myself with a vast collection of Scottish indiepop? From the Cocteaus to the Fannies, Belle \u0026amp Sebastian to Teen Canteen, Scottish indiepop has been the soundtrack to my life. How and why the music of your land speaks to me, I\u0027ll never know, but no album speaks to my soul more than Cake by the Trashcan Sinatras \u0026ndash a record I find as comforting as a cup of coffee on a cold winter morning. I really, really love it to this day, and why those lads aren\u0027t universally revered as musical genius is beyond me to this day. I\u0027ve travelled hundreds of miles to see them live and I\u0027ll continue to do so as long as they grace us with the occasional American tour.  John Jauchler, Connecticut: Lots of good stuff on your list, but my vote goes to the Trashcan Sinatras\u0026rsquo I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything. Outstanding musicians and really nice guys as well. Their music has made a difference in my life.

But this latest chapter in its chequered history takes some beating.  For over a century this majestic building which sits on a hill off Sauchiehall Street has been the beating heart of Glasgow\u0027s cultural life. It\u0027s no exaggeration to say that Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0027s Art Nouveau masterwork has fostered some of the brightest and most creative talents Scotland has ever produced.  It survived two world wars and one almost catastrophic fire four years ago. Now, with the news that large sections of The Mack will be \"dismantled\" within days following a second inferno two weeks ago, it looks like the end is nigh for The Mack.  No-one could have predicted the turn of events which led to the almost-renovated building being burned to a crisp. It was late on a Friday night \u0026ndash graduation day as it happened for Glasgow School of Art\u0027s latest cohort of students \u0026ndash when the fire was first noticed by a passing policeman. Within an hour, it had spread like wildfire. The flames licked over to the adjacent O2 ABC venue and soon its roof caved had in like a sunken blancmange.  Today, all around The Mack\u0027s majestic teetering walls, there is both physical and mental turmoil. Since that fateful night, people have been unable to return to their homes in the area around Garnethill and Sauchiehall Street. Businesses in the immediate vicinity have been locked out, with business owners and staff facing penury. Crowdfunding campaigns have even been started by small non-funded creative business based in the nearby CCA on Sauchiehall Street looking for financial help to pay staff.  Yesterday, First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, revealed during First Minister\u0027s Questions at Holyrood that a hardship fund to help people forced from their homes thanks to a safety cordon around the building will give \u0026pound1,500 to residents affected which will be matched by Glasgow City Council.  In the immediate aftermath of the fire the painter, Alison Watt, who graduated from GSA in the late 1980s and whose artist father James also graduated from the art school in the 1950s, talked on national radio about her intense feelings of loss on hearing that The Mack had been engulfed by flames yet again.  Turner Prize winning artist and GSA alumni, Douglas Gordon, flew back to Scotland from his home in Paris to see \"the corpse of the Mackintosh\". He speaks for many former students and staff when he added, \"part of my life has been cut out.\"  It all feels so distant from the cold February day last year when Gordon led me on a tour of the empty Mack for a feature in The Herald magazine. \"It [The Mack] was a place of real freedom,\" he told me. \"I haven\u0027t lived in Glasgow for nearly 30 years but it all feels really immediate. I feel both nostalgic and melancholic all at the same time.\"  While we were there, Gordon picked up a couple of pieces of green plaster from the floor which had fallen off one of the studio walls. \"Here, take this,\" he whispered conspiratorially. I still have these shards of green plaster from The Mack. They are sitting winking at me as I write.  In the two weeks since the Mack fire, mark two, I have watched as people\u0027s feelings turned from shock to anger. I have read accusations of mismanagement on the art school\u0027s part and rumours that there was inadequate insurance in place.  A statement put out by the Glasgow School of Art the day after put it so baldly, the Mackintosh Building had been undergoing a period or extensive restoration following the fire in 2014 \u0027and therefore has not been a part of the GSA\u0027s operational campus for four years.\"  The blame game started immediately in the media and on social media. All over my virtual world \u0026ndash admittedly filled with people linked to the creative community in Scotland \u0026ndash there has been much wailing and gnashing of teeth. People are livid and looking for someone to blame.  Where was the sprinkler system in the renovated building, people asked? That same question was asked four years ago and the same people feel they didn\u0027t get answers.  Leading GSA-trained architect, Alan Dunlop, prompted anger when he suggested that The Mack should be demolished and an international competition be launched to create a new building with the same spirit. Mackintosh was an innovator, he said, and he would not have wanted a facsimile\u0026hellip  Since Mackintosh isn\u0027t around to give his view, we will never know.    Friday\u0027s cartoon by Steven Camley  Labour MP Paul Sweeney, who is director of the Glasgow Building Preservation Trust, was one of the first public figures to be allowed behind the cordon around The Mack after the fire. His observations that the walls were still solid led to some optimism in among the initial gloom. Last night, he said he was \u0026ldquoopen minded about holding a public inquiry, but insisted there first needed to be more clarity about how the fire started.  So what was it that was so special about The Mack? In my eyes, it was like the most charismatic lover you\u0027d ever been with \u0026ndash or never been with. I\u0027d have given anything to have been one of the thousands of students who passed through these magical swing doors in Mackintosh\u0027s famous elongated art nouveau script with the words ART (on the in door) and SCHOOL (on the out door).  I visited it as a sixteen-year-old and fell in love on the spot with the place. How could I not, with these doors and that library? When I went home to Ayrshire and told my normally mild-mannered dad I wanted to apply to get go to this magical place, he swiftly put the kibosh on the idea. \"But how would you get a job as an artist,\" he spluttered?  As it turned out, getting a job as anything in the 1980s was going to be hard but if my subsequent degree in English and Scottish Literature had any use, it led me (eventually) into writing about art. And that meant I got to visit The Mack as an almost-insider.  As one alumni and former member of GSA\u0027s management staff wrote to me in the wee sma\u0027 hours of June 16: \"We all smoked in the building and had done so for decades. Stamping cigarettes out on timber floors surrounded by white spirit. Rennie, the librarian, was a chronic chain smoker in his wee office in the library. Maybe this is too much information, but I\u0027m probably one of many who made love in the building. This latest news is death.\"  The fixtures and fittings rescued from the last fire at GSA remain off-site. Its beautiful library had been rebuilt and is sitting in a warehouse in Edinburgh. Like a confused child piece waiting for a home.  I sent the painter Alison Watt a message last night asking her what one thing she\u0027d like to tell The Mack.  Almost instantly, she wrote back: \"You continue to live inside all of us who love you.\""},{"url":null,"title":"greens-demand-details-on-30m-loan-to-sturgeon-advisers-business","story":"              THE Scottish Greens have demanded more information about a taxpayer-funded \u0026pound30m loan to a business bought by one of Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos economic advisers.  The SNP Government yesterday announced it was giving the money to Ferguson Marine Engineering Limited (FMEL), despite questions over its financial disclosures.  Finance Secretary Derek Mackay said the money would provide \u0026ldquoworking capital for the Clyde shipbuilder alongside private investment intended to help diversify the business.  The Port Glasgow yard was acquired by billionaire Jim McColl, a member of the First Minister\u0026rsquos Council of Economic Advisers, after it went into administration in 2014.  However it has been flagged on the Companies House website for not yet filing its annual accounts for 2016, which were due by September 2017.  The most recent public accounts are for the year ending December 2015.  Its immediate parent company, Ferguson Marine Engineering (Holdings) Ltd, is also nine months overdue filing its annual accounts, according to the Companies House website.  Ferguson Marine last night said it had an approval for late filing, but did not explain why it needed it - extensions are normally granted for events outwith a company\u0026rsquos control.  There is no public record of a late filing approval on the Companies House website. Both firms are ultimately owned by Mr McColl\u0026rsquos Clyde Blowers empire.  Green MSP John Finnie said: \u0026ldquoTransparency is vital when public funds are concerned, and this substantial loan must be held up to scrutiny.  \u0026ldquoShip servicing and repair, low carbon marine projects and decommissioning work are all very worthy but it\u0026rsquos clearly a concern if public funds are being used to support a company with a chequered history.  Mr Mackay said one of Mr McColl\u0026rsquos investment vehicles, Clyde Blowers Capital, would also invest alongside the loan to diversify the yard\u0026rsquos work.  Mr McColl recently spoke of expanding into green energy.  The year after Mr McColl acquired Ferguson\u0026rsquos it won a \u0026pound97m contract to build two new \u0026lsquodual fuel\u0026rsquo ferries for government-owned CalMac, securing work for the 150 staff.  However the contract has not gone smoothly, with the first vessel delayed from May this year to the winter, despite Mr McColl assuring ministers in early 2017 that it would be on time.  Ferguson Marine finance director Tom Cousins said: \u0026ldquoThis loan will allow us to accelerate our diversification into areas of innovation in green energy and marine transport and other opportunities such as decommissioning, on which where we are well-place to capitalise.  \u0026ldquoWe have approval from Companies House for the extension on the filing of our accounts. This was not a government bail-out. The investment alongside Clyde Blowers Capital is to support continued diversification.  Mr Mackay said: \u0026ldquoCommercial shipbuilding on the Clyde has a long and proud history, and it is essential that we continue to support this important industry and help it reach its full potential.  \u0026ldquoThis investment allows FMEL to further diversify their business by moving into innovative areas, like low-carbon marine projects, and target decommissioning work.  \u0026ldquoThe loan is a strategic investment in our industrial capability as both the marine engineering sector and commercial shipbuilding have vital roles to play in Scotland\u0026rsquos future."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-new-47m-meadowbank-sports-centre-given-the-go-ahead","story":"              Plans for a new \u0026pound47 million sports centre on the site of Meadowbank Stadium in Edinburgh have been given the green light.  It will replace the existing Meadowbank, which was originally constructed for the 1970 Commonwealth Games and closed in December.  Building work could start before the end of the year, with planners also agreeing \u0026ldquoin principle to the wider development of the site. The new Meadowbank will include a 3G football pitch in the centre of the running track, an indoor athletics track and an outdoor throws area.  It will also offer badminton courts, a gymnastics hall, a gym, studios, a cafe and offices.  But the plans have sparked controversy.

Now it seems flocks of tourists have their sights set on Scotland\u0026rsquos other island beauty spots.  New figures show the Outer Hebrides has seen a staggering tourism boom, with a 54 per cent jump in leisure visitors since 2013.  The 2017 Islands Visitor Survey reveals tourism is now worth nearly \u0026pound65m a year to the Western Isles, with visitors spending a third more per head than they did just five years ago.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspOutlander brings \u0027phenomenal\u0027 tourism surge  Last year there were almost 220,000 visitors to the islands, 68 per cent of them holidaymakers who spent an average of \u0026pound344 each during their visit.  But while 82 per cent said they were \u0026ldquovery satisfied with their visit, citing friendly locals and high-quality accommodation, the lack of adequate digital connections such as mobile phone signals received a \u0026lsquothumbs down\u0026rsquo from travellers.  The findings have sparked calls for new investment in infrastructure to help maximise the tourism boost, and a fresh focus on ferry services to help maximise the potential.  Ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne recently warned that challenges with its ageing fleet could lead to widespread summer disruption, with Western Isles routes already hit by problems. A Transport Scotland study into the future of ferry links for the Western Isles is currently underway. Its findings are expected at the end of the year.  Comhairle Leader, Cllr Roddie MacKay, said: \u0026ldquoThe findings of this survey are very welcome and encouraging. However, in order to sustain and develop the success of the tourism industry, the islands require excellent transportation links, not only for the economy but for the people who live and work here.  \u0026ldquoWe need to particularly look at the robustness and the capacity of the ferry services to maximise the potential that tourism offers for the islands.  AGENDA:\u0026nbspBrexit talks must address the issue of tourism  The leap in Western Isles tourism appears to reflect the dramatic rise in visitors to other island destinations such as Skye. Roads there were clogged with summer visitors last summer, sparking debate over whether the island had reached saturation point and leading to calls for greater investment in infrastructure and the possible introduction of a tourist tax.  According to Norma Macritchie, assistant manager at the County Hotel in Stornoway, Lewis is already approaching capacity during the peak of summer, with many visitors who attempt to reach the island being turned away before they arrive.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos been a real increase in phone calls from people who want to book, but we are full year on year. \u0026ldquoWe have to tell visitors to go elsewhere.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a real need for investment but it has to be balanced. There\u0026rsquos no point spending a lot of money for visitors who are only here from May until September, she added.  The 2017 Islands Visitor Survey showed 19 per cent of Western Isles visitors were there for business, while a further 12 per cent were visiting friends and relatives. The average spend per capita of visitors was \u0026pound309, up from \u0026pound245 in 2013, and was higher among leisure visitors.  Overall the estimated value from tourism spend in the Outer Hebrides in 2017 of \u0026pound64.5m - and increase of 20 per cent from \u0026pound53.5m in 2013.

While 55 per cent of visitors travelled from elsewhere in Scotland, 28 per cent were from the rest of the UK, 16 per cent from Europe and North America accounted for six per cent.

It is the world\u0027s longest defined coastal touring route, and has a passport scheme.  Cllr Donald Crichton, Chairman of the Western Isles Council\u0027s Sustainable Development Committee, said: \"The potential of tourism to create employment, generate income and retain population in the Outer Hebrides has been recognised for some time however it is only in recent years, with a truly strategic and co-ordinated approach from stakeholders, that significant growth has been achieved.  \u0026ldquoThe findings of the survey are extremely welcome and encouraging, demonstrating that the region is on-course to achieve the ambitious sectoral targets outlined in the Tourism Outer Hebrides 2020 Strategy."},{"url":null,"title":"art-graduate-and-travis-singer-fran-healy-we-should-rebuild-the-mack","story":"              THE lead singer of the Scottish rock band Travis has joined calls for the Mackintosh Building in Glasgow to be rebuilt.  Fran Healy, who studied fine art at the Glasgow School of Art before rising to fame as a singer and songwriter in Travis, said the elegance of Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0027s plans would mean a re-build would not be impossible.  He spoke to The Herald as a new petition was launched to urge the rebuilding of the \u0027Mack\u0027, which is to be partially dismantled following a second disastrous fire.  He said: \"It\u0027s been horrible to watch the Mac burn and now be pulled down but it\u0027s a building, one of the UK\u0027s best, it\u0027s insured, they have all the drawings and laser scans of every interior, and it\u0027s a very simple build.  \"No intricate angels to re-carve or elaborate structural engineering to backward engineer.  \"That was the beauty of the Mac. It was simple. Like a giant dove tail joint.\"  Mr Healy, however, suggested that the new building, if constructed, could be modernised.  He added: \"I do think this time they should fit a functioning sprinkler system.  \"I don\u0027t think Charles Rennie Mackintosh would feel this interfered with the integrity of the original.\"  Healy is one of many alumni of the GSA and admirers of the building who has expressed the desire for a new version of the world famous building to be created.  The lauded painter Alison Watt and Turner Prize winner Martin Boyce have also said it should be rebuilt, while a new petition, backing the idea to \"Faithfully rebuild the Mackintosh Building\" has garnered hundreds of names within hours.  Boyce told Frieze magazine: \"We have an architect and a building and it\u0026rsquos one of the greatest.  \"It is crystal clear to me that the building must be rebuilt. This moment, the fires and the voices around this issue are just a blip in history. What matters is that in 20 or 50 years from now people can push open those swing doors, walk in and study art in the Mack.\"  The petition says: \"It is still too early to say what damage the structure has undergone, but we hope that, in time, plans can be put in place to save and restore as much as possible, and to rebuild the remainder.  \"Irrespective of how much has been lost, the undersigned support the decision to reinstate this masterpiece like for like.\"  It adds: \"We have faith in the knowledge of the restoration team which has been hard at work since 2014: faith in the skills of the artisans and craftspeople who have been restoring the building and faith in the people of Glasgow who wish to see the building emerge from the ashes.\"  Sir John Leighton, the director general of the National Galleries of Scotland said \"we must do all we can to ensure that the school can thrive in the future.\"  He said: \"The nation is still reeling from the news of the second fire in the great Mackintosh building but there is also a growing determination across the country to do everything possible to support the Glasgow School of Art in the aftermath of this terrible event. \"Generations of graduates from GSA have had a massive impact both at home and abroad \u0026ndash many now rank as world-class artists and are represented in the national collection.  \"I cannot emphasize enough how important GSA is to the cultural fabric of Scotland and we must do all we can to ensure that the school can thrive in the future.\""},{"url":null,"title":"unspun-the-political-diary","story":"              THE reshuffle kerfuffle prompted an unusually sombre performance from Tory MSP Jackson Carlaw. Mayfly minister Gillian Martin\u0026rsquos 2007 blog about \u0026ldquoAmerican blacks was \u0026ldquoshocking, he tutted. Unspun wonders how he\u0026rsquod feel about the clown who told Tory activists in 2005: \u0026ldquoThe only person recorded as saying de-feat is marvellous is Robert Mugabe\u0027s chiropodist. Oh yes, that would be Jackson \u0027I apologise unreservedly\u0027 Carlaw.  UK Environment Secretary Michael Gove gave video-link evidence to MSPs on Wednesday about Brexit and the great outdoors. The prize moment came after Nat Angus MacDonald asked how anyone could take what he said as gospel. \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot think you should take anything I say as gospel because by definition I\u0026rsquom not an apostle or a discipline, replied the Gover drily. \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not Matthew, Mark, Luke or John - I\u0026rsquom just Michael. Touch\u0026eacute.  THE reshuffle also saw Ben Macpherson appointed minister for Europe. There\u0026rsquos nothing like a bit of poetry to liven up a speech on the Euro-circuit, and there\u0026rsquos certainly nothing like gentle Ben\u0026rsquos own epic verse \u0026ldquoShould Scotland become an Independent Country? on Youtube. The minister whispers soulfully: \u0026ldquoNow, Devo Max may be attractive / But it won\u0026rsquot be enough / It won\u0026rsquot keep us out of wars we disagree with / Or such other awful stuff. Brussels, you have been warned.  MEANWHILE robot prefect Ash Denham became minister for community safety. Besides representing Edinburgh Eastern while living in the Borders, and axing her Regan-Denham double barrel, the pseudo-lefty is best known for her pedagogical passion. \u0026ldquoEducation is not a commodity to be bought or sold! she railed in her maiden speech as an MSP. A noble sentiment only slightly undermined by Ms Denham buying her own kids an education at private school.  PROMOTION, too, for bearded sage Michael Russell, but on what evidence? Although known as Brexit minister in his past role, his full title was actually Minister for UK Negotiations on Scotland\u0026rsquos Place in Europe. Rather awkwardly, those negotiations ended with Scotland heading out of Europe. Now he\u0026rsquos Constitutional Relations Secretary. Presumably relations with the UK will now deteriorate beyond repair.  THE most brutal bit of the reshuffle came not when Ms Sturgeon was culling ministers, but praising them. She poured warm words on Keith Brown, Angela Constance and Shona Robison. But then she turned to the \u0026lsquobonfire of the nobodies\u0026rsquo, and the sacking of Alasdair Allan, Annabelle Ewing and Maureen \u0026lsquo15\u0026rsquo Watt. Each \u0026ldquohas left their own legacies on government, she said casually. Ouch.  GREAT excitement on Tuesday, when SNP deputy presiding officer Christine Grahame appeared to predict a Ruth Davidson victory in 2021. \u0026ldquoI ask the Conservative members to calm down a little, please, she told impatient Tories. \u0026ldquoYour time will come. At which the Tories went berserk. \u0026ldquoI should clarify that that is because [Tory MSP] Mr Tomkins will lead for you shortly, she added hastily.  MS Grahame also featured in a rare moment the next day, when solicitor general Alison Di Rollo had to speak because a minister had been chopped. At the end, Ms Di Rollo moved that MSPs approve a Bill. \u0026ldquoI know that you are not used to this, said Ms Grahame from the chair, \u0026ldquobut the motion has already been moved. Quick as a flash, the law officer quipped: \u0026ldquoSorry, Presiding Officer. That was corroboration."},{"url":null,"title":"kevin-mckenna-leonard-must-confront-the-right-wingers-in-scottish-labours-ranks","story":"              IF, as Albert Einstein observed, madness is defined by doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results, then some senior Scottish Labour figures ought to be going for an extended lie-down under close supervision.  It\u0026rsquos been nearly two decades since Mike Watson, one of Labour\u0026rsquos original intake of MSPs proposed to outlaw fox-hunting.It might have helped his cause if this was a major issue in his constituency. I\u0026rsquom not sure, though, if the plight of foxes is anywhere near the top of any list of social priorities in Castlemilk, that sturdy and edgy neighbourhood on Glasgow\u0026rsquos southern uplands.  Watson\u0026rsquos vulpine intervention was an early marker for political stupidity at Holyrood and one that generations of his colleagues in Scottish Labour have seemed eager to emulate. In recent years they have re-written the playbook on political ineptitude. This is a party that was ill-equipped to meet the demands of devolution and the enhanced expectations of the Scottish electorate. That much was clear from the outset when the Scottish Labour establishment opted to rule out so-called trouble-makers such as the charismatic Dennis Canavan from its preferred list of potential MSPs.  In came an assortment of placemen and party worthies who had done little more than keep their heads down and their noses clean. When genuine talent did emerge such as Wendy Alexander and Susan Deacon they were forced to cut short their political careers by a combination of shady, in-house political machinations and a lack of support. Complacency and a sense of entitlement in traditional Labour constituencies blinded them to the threat of the SNP. The Nationalists began working the doorsteps as the Labour old guard remained inert in their Westminster drinking clubs.  The unthinkable became the inevitable as the SNP came to power in 2007 and then achieved the seemingly impossible landslide in 2011 that was the gateway to an independence referendum. It was during this campaign that Labour in Scotland first exhibited traces of Einstein\u0026rsquos theory on madness. The breadth of a cigarette paper couldn\u0026rsquot separate Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos high command from the Tories during the referendum with people like Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling and Jim Murphy going the full British bulldog and losing a generation of voters in the process.  Mr Murphy became leader and effectively finished the party as a serious electoral force. By the time this became official with third place at the 2016 Holyrood election, it was clear to his successor, Kezia Dugdale, that the process of dilapidation had reached such an advanced stage that she also resigned. After a decade in the wilderness, it seemed at last that the party in Scotland might have come to acknowledge the delusions of the recent past.  It elected Richard Leonard as its leader, a trade unionist and that rare thing among senior Scottish Labour figures, someone who seemed to be in tune with authentic, old-school socialism that had emancipated British working people and improved their lives. His call for the provision of elderly care to be nationalised and thus liberated from the get-rich-quick exploiters and speculators was a welcome one. In electing Mr Leonard the party chose to reject the pretensions of his rival, Anas Sarwar, a decent enough chiel but one whose depth of commitment to the party can be measured in direct proportion to the height of his personal ambitions.  When it was revealed during the leadership campaign that his family firm didn\u0026rsquot recognise a trade union and failed to pay its lowest-paid employees the Living Wage his bid to be leader was effectively over. This hasn\u0026rsquot stopped his closest party associates from seeking to destabilise Mr Leonard\u0026rsquos leadership. Thus the party finds itself consumed in a civil war that is not in its best wider interests and that could extinguish all hope of any kind of electoral comeback in Scotland.  The fate of the so-called and ridiculously self-styled \u0026ldquoAberdeen Nine is the weapon by which this vociferous faction has chosen to damage Mr Leonard\u0026rsquos leadership. The \u0026ldquonine are Labour councillors in Aberdeen who have chosen to prop up a Conservative administration on Aberdeen City Council by working in a coalition with them to keep the SNP, the largest party on the council, out of office. For this they were rightly suspended by Ms Dugdale. They have since refused to back down and now face expulsion.  There are some red Labour lines that form the basic conduct party members expect of their elected representatives. First is: Thou shalt not give succour and support to any Tory administration (and certainly not one run by the most reactionary and right-wing Westminster parties in living memory).  Laughably, some of these self-important Labour councillors have advanced the view that their Tory masters on the council are decent coves and quite progressive, really. I hae ma doots.  The petition to defend the \u0026ldquoAberdeen Nine was launched by Professor Hugh Pennington, a man who has wrapped himself tightly in the Union flag.  Astonishingly, a raft of senior Labour figures in Scotland has chosen to back the nine. They must know that many former Labour supporters were among those who returned the SNP as the largest party in the Aberdeen council elections. Do they really think they have the slightest chance of getting them back by indulging these cranks?  Of course, this isn\u0026rsquot really about the councillors at all. Rather it bears all the hallmarks of a right-wing coup against Mr Leonard orchestrated mainly by those figures who almost destroyed Labour in Scotland. As such, it isn\u0026rsquot about Labour values (how could it be?) it\u0026rsquos about thwarted personal ambition.  Mr Leonard needs to act decisively in this and expel the \u0026ldquoAberdeen Nine immediately and without referring the decision to London. Then he needs to act with similar ruthlessness in rooting out his enemies closer to home. It\u0026rsquos the first big test of his leadership."},{"url":null,"title":"teachers-pupils-guessing-answers-to-tests-because-they-are-too-hard","story":"              PUPILS are \u0026ldquoguessing their way through new national standardised tests because they are too difficult, teachers have warned.  The suggestion is contained in a range of views gathered by the Scottish Government following the introduction of the assessments.  One of the responses, released under freedom of information legislation, states: \u0026ldquoSome children became uninterested and just started to click random answers, particularly in the reading and writing assessments. We noted children who it was apparent were guessing. One child did exceptionally well with his guesses.  Another said: \u0026ldquoThe majority of the children just guessed at the answers, not giving a true reflection of their ability.  A third teacher noted there was a \u0026ldquosuspicion that guessing got a lot of children through.  Others highlighted the difficulty of the assessments for children in P1 in both numeracy and literacy.  One teacher said: \u0026ldquoMany questions in the numeracy are beyond the expected stage for them with language they are still unfamiliar with.  \u0026ldquoIn literacy, the texts they are expected to read on their own are way beyond anything we would expect at that stage.  The feedback comes after the Scottish Government introduced new standardised national assessments for all pupils in P1, P4, P7 and S3.  The tests were introduced by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon as a response to concerns over falling standards of literacy and numeracy and a lack of consistent data across the country.  However, critics argue the move to test pupils, particularly in the first year of primary school, is counterproductive.  One of the responses suggested some teachers were ignoring the assessments completely.  It said: \u0026ldquoOne school chose not to do P1s since the children were not ready for it and didn\u0026rsquot have capacity to do it.  There were concerns over the length of time the assessments took, which can be as much as 50 minutes, as well the level of computer skills required.  One teacher said: \u0026ldquoP1 pupils need good competent keyboard skills to complete the assessments, such as click and drag, do not double click and scroll.  Another added: \u0026ldquoSome children were overwhelmed by the length of the tests.  \u0026ldquoSome pupils in P4 became upset during the assessments despite reassurances. Therefore were given breaks to support.  There were also concerns about the different approaches taken in different schools.  One response said: \u0026ldquoSome teachers have read aloud passages to the children and then they have answered the questions.  \u0026ldquoIf some teachers are reading passages to children and others are not, how will the results be truly realistic?  However, there was also positive feedback on the tests, with one teacher of 17 years\u0026rsquo experience saying: \u0026ldquoPupils in my schools where I facilitated these assessments all enjoyed doing them. There was no stress involved as it was not built up into anything high stakes beforehand.  \u0026ldquoI love to see them so engaged and trying their best. I also find the information invaluable to my teaching and the pupils\u0026rsquo learning.  Another said: \u0026ldquoMost children found it quite enjoyable. No-one was particularly distressed by it."},{"url":null,"title":"arlene-foster-to-attend-orange-order-parade-in-fife","story":"              Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster is expected to attend an Orange Order parade in Scotland.

Surrounded by mature Ash trees and Hawthorn hedgerow, this natural burial ground is quiet and peaceful, set in a long established designated rural area it has stunning countryside views only interrupted by a scattering of farms far off in the distance. The \u0026ldquoWoods is part of Craufurdland Estate, lands given to the Craufurd family in 1245 which has remained in their careful ship ever since. The Craufurds are dedicated to the continued stewardship of the estate, and it is with this in mind that the woodland burial ground was established to allow other families in the West of Scotland and further afield to secure a beautiful and peaceful resting place for their loved ones.

Early each year, families are invited to plant their chosen tree (from the list of indigenous native species). The plot is pre-prepared for the family to plant the tree, Simon or Alex is on hand should the family request help in planting the tree.  \u0026ldquoThe families who have chosen Craufurdland Woods as a resting place for their loved ones tell us they like the fact that the tree planting is sometime after the funeral as it gives them the opportunity to celebrate their loved ones continuously, long after their passing says Simon Craufurd. Security isn\u0026rsquot an issue at the burial grounds. With the gates unlocked, and right of responsible access means anyone can pass through the land. \"With no tombstones, there\u0027s not much to steal, only peace, stillness and beauty to enjoy. says Simon Craufurd.

This is one of the easiest questions to answer. It\u0026rsquos a privilege and it\u0026rsquos impossible for us to call this a job when it so intertwined in our lives. It is not a case of closing the office and leaving our work behind us. Every family we meet and help their story stays with us.

No request is either too small or too farfetched. If a bereaved family member or friend find it important, it is.

Since then customer numbers have soared, with up to 200 hour-long sessions now running each week.                                                    Clients, who suffer from a range of respiratory issues, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and allergies, spend their time relaxing in one of two treatment rooms where the walls and floor are clad in salt. A specialist machine then finely grinds medical grade salt that is released into the air at prescribed concentration levels for the duration of each session.                                                    The therapy, also known as halotherapy, dates back to the ancient Greeks who sought the benefits offered by naturally occurring salt caves for improved health and wellbeing. Providing a 100% natural and drug free complimentary treatment, halotherapy, derived from the Greek alas, meaning \"salt\", is believed to loosen mucus and reduce inflammation making breathing easier.        Donna said: \u0026ldquoWe were increasingly aware of the vulnerability of the oil and gas industry, and although we both had good jobs, our working days were getting longer and more stressful which began to impact on our family life, so the timing seemed to lend itself to a total lifestyle change.\"My mum and grandmother are regulars at Salt Caves in Inverness and Edinburgh, and both had seen a significant reduction in their respective symptoms and an upturn in their general wellbeing. My grandmother, who\u0026rsquod had to give up singing due to breathing problems a number of years ago, is now back performing with her choir and she says that\u0026rsquos thanks to The Salt Cave.\u0026ldquoTheir positive experiences coupled with our desire to change career direction, led us to research the industry. When we realised there was a local Salt Cave franchise available we jumped at it. It hasn\u0026rsquot been an easy journey, and securing the right premises was difficult.\"It was at this point we met with Business Gateway. Our adviser undertook a property search on our behalf and provided invaluable information on commercial leasing and the documentation we needed to provide to secure it. Since then we\u0026rsquove had help with our business plan, HR, marketing, and have attended workshops on sales and customer care. Having access to impartial advice like this has given us greater confidence in our own abilities.

Sue Ryder launched an appeal in June 2017 to double the size of its local neurological care centre, which cares for people living with long-term neurological conditions including Huntington’s disease, multiple sclerosis and acquired brain injuries.                                                    The expansion project was introduced in response to the growing demand for neurological care in the North East of Scotland. Sue Ryder Dee View Court is currently home to 24 people living with complex and long-term conditions, with a waiting list double this amount.        The appeal has already reached £2.2million, with the charity now encouraging community fundraisers to set their targets in £1,000 segments, or ‘bricks’ as part of the Brick by Brick campaign - each £1,000 raised equates to one brick in the new centre. Emma Leiper Finlayson, Capital Appeal Manager for Sue Ryder Dee View Court said: “There’s a desperate need for unified neurological care in Scotland and our waiting list increases all the time.  We urgently need to expand, and our Dee View appeal is the first step in Sue Ryder’s strategy to care for more people who need help to live well and thrive across Scotland.“Since launching the appeal, we have been overwhelmed and delighted with the response from the community. In particular, the Brick by Brick initiative, which has been a fantastic platform to engage local companies and schools in some fun and creative fundraising. By buying a brick for the extension they are quite literally helping us build brighter futures for people in their community.“Of course, our residents have been involved in the appeal too, with one recently taking part in the Aberdeen Kiltwalk with her family, whilst other residents have encouraged their friends and family to undertake challenges, such as the Great Aberdeen Run.

Demand for good, fleshy cows for the processing market is particularly strong and we have seen prices hit a top of £1,830,” said Mr McDonald.He also suggests it would be worthwhile for dairy farmers to consider feeding cull dairy cows to put on more flesh rather than marketing them in lean condition at the end of lactation.“The auction system is leading the way in cull cow prices and dairy farmers have the opportunity of making more money from well-fleshed cull dairy cows to supplement their income from milk,” he said.                                                                                                        The first real marker of the new season will be the show and sale of store cattle at Thainstone Centre on Friday, July 13, and as always some of the top suckled calves and stores from the summer shows will be on offer at the annual Spectacular show and sale on August 24.Turning to the sheep market, the phenomenal market for old season lamb continued right through the spring and ANM’s weekly sale at Thainstone Centre was still attracting up to 2,000 head right to the end of May.Prices peaked on April 5 when 4,782 head averaged 284.3p/kg (£126.21/head) with record numbers the following week attracting a massive entry of 7,952 to average 250.5p (£109.72/head).“The strongly rising market saw the auction ring come into its own as prices increased week after week,” said deputy livestock manager, Colin Slessor. “The level of prices achieved would never have been attained without the auction system leading the way and resulting in the strongest spring market for sheep we have seen for many years.“Those hoggs will have been bought in the trough of last autumn’s store trade when prices were down £5/head on the year. Finishers have enjoyed the double benefit of a lower purchase price and a high sale price which will have boosted margins and should augur well for this year’s autumn store lamb sales.”                                                                                                        Trade is being driven by a combination of strong demand, both on the home market and for the export market to Europe, and reduced imports from New Zealand.This season’s prime lamb market has started off on a high with some lambs hitting £130 - £140/head, and the cull ewe trade also rising sharply, peaking at £200 with pure Texels and Suffolks realising £170 - £190/head.The prospects remain encouraging and numbers will start building up from July onwards. Again, the auction system will be a vital element in ensuring producers achieve the best price available on the market.Despite weather problems during lambing, many farms are reporting a good lambing and good lamb numbers. The fantastic weather through May has transformed the performance of lambs as grass growth has taken off and lambs are set to reach the market early and in good order.The availability of grass has also triggered the market for ewes with lambs at foot with prices up around £10/head. Mule hoggs with single lambs have been making up to £140/head.“The strong prime market will hopefully impact positively on store markets which were in the doldrums last autumn,” says Mr Slessor.“The store lamb trade has been buoyant and prices have increased significantly, with finishers achieving good margins on last year’s lambs. Lamb producers in the Highlands and Islands certainly need a lift in price to give them a much needed boost following last year’s disappointing autumn trade.”With more ewe lambs being culled this year, rather than retained for breeding, trade and demand for gimmers is also likely to be stronger.Aberdeen and Northern Marts’ auction staff look forward to meeting customers at the forthcoming summer shows. The mart will have stands at the New Deer, Caithness, Turriff, Black Isle and Keith shows where auctioneers and field staff will be present to discuss the prospects for the autumn trade.

Universal Credit is simplifying the system and revolutionising welfare by making work pay. It also helps those who are in work to increase their hours and earnings.                                                     Universal Credit replaces six benefits with one monthly payment and is already being claimed by single jobseekers. And from today, people who would previously have made a claim to Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, Income support, Working and Child Tax Credit and Housing Benefit will instead claim Universal Credit.        A £1.5bn package of improvements making it easier for people moving onto Universal Credit was announced in the Budget. People applying to Universal Credit can now receive a 100% advance on their first payment and the 7-day waiting period for new claimants was removed earlier this year. Among other improvements, from April 2018 the Government also continues to pay Housing Benefit claimants’ rent for two weeks - which is non-recoverable - when moving onto Universal Credit.Minister for Employment Alok Sharma said: “Universal Credit is central to our commitment to help families improve their lives by moving into work. We know it’s working – with Universal Credit people are moving into work faster and staying in work longer than under the old system. “And now we are rolling it out to a wider range of people in a safe and controlled way. From today, more people, including families and disabled people, can claim Universal Credit and access the extra help it provides.”Single jobseekers are already receiving support from their dedicated work coach to find employment or increase their hours and earnings. Now, all types of claimants will be able to benefit from the improved, personalised, one-to-one support that Universal Credit offers.                                                                                                        Carol Sadler, from Jobcentre Plus said: “Universal Credit offers tailored support, which includes more personalised help from a work coach. The new system is also more flexible, which means people can take on short-term work to develop their skills and build up their experience. “Our staff are trained to support people throughout the claim process. We’d encourage anyone who needs extra help or information to come and talk to their work coach.”Those on Universal Credit will now have 24-hour access to an online account that they can use to manage their claim, including reporting changes of circumstances, checking the details of their claim and date of their next Universal Credit payment. With the application process now completely online, Universal Credit streamlines the system, making benefits simpler to navigate and easier to understand.

He will be succeeded by Ian Ross, the former East Sutherland and Edderton Highland councillor.Sir Anthony\u0026rsquos decision to step down ends a long association with the area which started in 1993 when he was appointed as chairman of the then UK Atomic Energy Authority. He later chaired AEA Technology and in 2004 took on the role of leading the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) which was responsible for decommissioning Dounreay.In 2008, the then local MP John Thurso asked Sir Anthony to chair Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership. He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed. People were very gloomy. I would say the mood now has changed and is pretty optimistic, although there are challenges. That will always be the case.\u0026ldquoThe big advantage we have here is that it will be a number of years before Dounreay is closed so we had an opportunity to plan for the future. If it had been a car plant it would have been closed in three months.Sir Anthony highlights positive developments such as the improvements at Scrabster and Wick harbours as well as the pioneering MeyGen tidal energy project and the Beatrice offshore wind farm.The North Coast 500 is also making an impact and bringing economic opportunities to the area. The Nucleus archive across from Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport is another plus for Caithness, he adds. Sir Anthony played a part in bringing the facility to the county during his time as chairman of the NDA.Engineering and environmental courses at North Highland College UHI can also help regenerate the Caithness economy. \u0026ldquoThere are real opportunities here, he declared.Improving infrastructure and transport links in the far north are key to helping the area\u0026rsquos economy. Good schools and hospitals are another factor.\u0026ldquoI think the partnership has made a real contribution in the last 10 years, Sir Anthony said. \u0026ldquoWe have worked with other agencies to help create around 1000 jobs over that time but we all had to work together to do it. I am very pleased to see progress being made.Sir Anthony feels it is important to make Caithness as \u0026ldquoattractive as possible for people to come and work in the area.\u0026ldquoThere are still issues to be addressed but, overall, I think significant progress has been made. We played a part but it has always been a contributory role. The partnership is an enabler. The Scottish government has said this area could be an example for other places to follow.Sir Anthony says there is an expertise at Dounreay which \u0026ldquoa lot of places would give their eye teeth to have and it could be used to help the local economy.Caithness strengths are its people, their skills and the natural beauty of the place, but access to the area needs to be improved.Asked about any disappointments during his time as chairman of the partnership, he replied: \u0026ldquoI hoped MeyGen would have got the Contract for Difference \u0026ndash it covers an agreement on the price for the electricity generated \u0026ndash from the UK government, but they did not. That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor. I have had discussions with him and would be willing to help him in any way I can.Sir Anthony, who is 80, will keep a watchful eye on what is happening in Caithness and plans to stay active with his many other interests and hobbies. He enjoys opera, and swims five times a week.He started his career as a systems engineer with IBM in 1962 and went on to become its chief executive and chairman.Sir Anthony and his wife Jennie live in London and have a son, Paul, and a daughter, Caroline.Sunday 1 Jul 2018 1:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Subsea 7 order hailed as very good news for Caithness","story":"A MULTIMILLION-pound order that has been won by Subsea 7 and will create up to 130 jobs was described yesterday as \u0026ldquovery good news for Caithness.The company has been awarded a contract by Shell for a development at its Penguins field which lies 150 miles north east of Shetland.Subsea 7, which has yards at Wester and Hastigrow, will build two pipeline bundles in Caithness as part of the deal. One is 4.6 kilometres long and the other 2.7 kilometres.They will be used by Shell to develop the potential reserves in the Penguins field.Subsea7\u0026rsquos local site manager, Willie Watt, said: \u0026ldquoWe would be looking to make a start on this project by the autumn of next year and launch in the late spring of 2020.\u0026ldquoThis is very good news for the site and for Caithness. It is a testament to the capabilities of the people and the product that major companies keep coming back to us.The confirmation of the latest contract comes just months after Subsea 7 won an order from Statoil for its Snorre oil and gas field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. Its total value was said to be between \u0026pound150 million and \u0026pound300m.Work on that contract is expected to get under way in September with three launches due to be completed by November next year.The orders will see the company\u0026rsquos local workforce increase from around 30, at present, to up to 160.\u0026ldquoThis will give us continual work in Caithness until 2020, although there will be peaks and troughs along the way \u0026ndash but this is great news all round, Mr Watt added.Jonathan Tame, company vice president for the UK and Canada, said: \u0026ldquoWe are pleased to have the opportunity to bring our extensive expertise to a project of this importance.\u0026ldquoIn doing so it demonstrates Shell\u0026rsquos confidence in our value-adding solutions, and continues a successful North Sea collaboration that has been in place since 1984.The Penguins field was discovered in 1974 and first developed in 2002.The three pipeline bundles for Statoil will involve the largest diameter pipe assembled in the far north.The bulk of the fabrication will be done in Caithness, with design and project management work due to be undertaken at Subsea7\u0026rsquos premises in Aberdeen and at Stavanger in Norway.At the time that order was announced in December last year, Mr Watt said: \u0026ldquoIt is good to have Statoil back. The last bundle we did for them was in 2003.\u0026ldquoIt is an important project and shows pipeline bundles are the preference for developing the North Sea sector. It is the right product at the right time.The Statoil order will include pipeline bundles and control umbilicals required for the development.The Snorre field is sited within the Tampen area of the Norwegian North Sea.Since the last pipeline was launched in Caithness in March last year, the company has refurbished the rail track which is used to transport the bundles to the sea and on to the tugs before being taken to their destination.Sunday 1 Jul 2018 1:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116349.jpg","title":"Technical issues force delay to new Pulteney post office service","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe long-established Pulteneytown Post Office in Smith Terrace closed its doors for the last time on Thursday.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism.

His first order of priority, however, must be the unfinished business of implementing cheaper ferry fares on ferry routes serving Orkney and Shetland.“Having already waited a decade since the government first introduced RET on west coast routes, people in the Northern Isles should not have to wait any longer.“The First Minister promised RET in the first half of 2018. That means Michael Matheson must deliver before parliament rises for the summer recess at the end of this week.”Mr Halcro Johnston says that the Northern Isles have been left in limbo by the RET uncertainties, adding that he has written to Mr Matheson in a bid to see the RET commitment delivered.He said: “The new transport secretary has just days to implement RET for ferry fares to Orkney and Shetland, in line with commitment made by his predecessor and after years of promises from the SNP.“The constant delays we have seen regarding RET have caused real uncertainty in the Northern Isles and have left residents and visitors unable to plan journeys knowing what the eventual costs will be.\u0026#8221\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

All we are now waiting for is confirmation that it’s fully legal and then we can get on with implementing it. Our lawyers have told us that because we are a commercial operation and currently receive no subsidy whatsoever, we have to be 100 per cent sure that this scheme complies otherwise our whole business is at risk. We are not sure why it is taking so long to get simple confirmation.“Although not one penny of the proposed subsidy comes to us, it goes directly to the passenger, we would be forced to pay it all back if it doesn’t comply, that could ruin us and we can’t take that risk. All we are asking for is for the Scottish Government to check that it’s legal with the EU and UK and then we can get on with it. We have written to the new Minister Michael Matheson MSP and invited him to visit the island and meet our staff so we can share our concerns with him directly and hopefully he will visit soon so we can get this unlocked.“We have also today asked for a meeting with our local MSP Liam McArthur to see if he can do anything to get things moving forward on our behalf. This is extremely frustrating but as a family run, fully commercial Orcadian business, employing 70 people and with exciting expansion plans, we cannot put at risk our business until we are certain the Scottish Government’s proposal fully comply.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That is simply not acceptable.Whatever the outstanding disagreement there may be between the government and commercial operators, Mr McArthur feels that people in Orkney have every right to expect both sides to get this sorted without delay.\u0026#8220The Transport Secretary also needs to confirm that the fare reductions, once agreed, will be backdated to 30 June, in keeping with the firm promises made by his predecessor and the First Minister,\u0026#8221 he said.“This sorry saga has rumbled on for far too long.

Blind from the age of seven as the result of smallpox, the legendary Blind Piper was a pupil of the great MacCrimmon of Skye, going on to compose perhaps the finest piobaireachd ever.The aim of the festival is to encourage pipers under the age of 18 to participate in friendly and relaxing competitions. Chairman Ian Blake of Aultgrishan said it was an exciting setting for competitors and \"will provide visitors to the gardens with a unique opportunity to hear some of the most gifted young inheritors of our much cherished Highland heritage\". Entries are now open in a variety of classes.

It also found that 62 per cent of posts are in professional occupations.Eilean Siar, Glasgow and Highland are the three areas with the highest number of jobs in which Gaelic is considered essential, together accounting for 93 per cent of the Scottish total.The study was welcomed by Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, who commented that the growth in desirable and essential jobs making use of Gaelic language would provide young people with a wealth of exciting career choices.\"I hope that this report will encourage more people to consider learning Gaelic,\" he added.As well as looking at the demand for Gaelic language skills, the report looks at Gaelic education, analyses the opportunities and challenges, and suggests future action.Damien Yeates, chief Executive of SDS, said: \"Developing a detailed evidence base of current and future skills demand is essential for all parts of our economy, and the Gaelic language labour market is no exception.\"Last year SDS published the second edition of its Gaelic language plan, and this study was one of the key commitments contained in that plan.\"The evidence will help inform future investment aimed at promoting the Gaelic language and culture.\"Shona MacLennan, chief executive of B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig, commented: \"B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig is clear that growing the number of Gaelic-essential jobs and jobs which use Gaelic is important in ensuring that Gaelic is used more often, by more people and in a wider range of situations.\"The key challenge is to ensure that the flow of people with high quality Gaelic language skills entering the labour market is matched to the demand from employers across the public, private and third sectors, and from across Scotland.\"\u0026nbspFuture actions proposed in the report include forming a national group with responsibility for Gaelic language skills, and increased monitoring and evaluation of the activities supporting the language.Charlotte Wright, Chief Executive of Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), said: \"Gaelic is fundamental to HIE\u0026rsquos unique remit which integrates economic and community development throughout the Highlands and Islands.\"Our support has helped numerous organisations which enable Gaelic to flourish, and we look forward to continuing to work with businesses, social enterprises and community organisations that can add value through using Gaelic to help realise its full potential.\"Sunday 1 Jul 2018 1:40 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Most damaging of all, Loganair noted, was the announcement by Flybe that it was entering a new franchise agreement with Eastern Airways and would compete head-to-head on six routes.            Despite the turbulence, Loganair booked record turnover of £110.7m, a rise of 7 per cent. Passenger numbers were up 6.2 per cent to an all-time high of 812,541, but the load factor – the percentage of seats filled on scheduled flights – fell from 62.8 per cent to 59.8 per cent, due to the overcapacity on routes with Flybe competition. Just under 78 per cent of flights ran on time.Chairman David Harrison said: “This year’s results bring to an end 17 consecutive years in profit for Loganair, and the fact that we forecast last year that we would be loss-making in 2017/18 makes it no less painful.“The extent of the loss is a direct result of competition on six of our eight largest routes, and from the outset we maintained that the markets on these routes were simply not big enough to sustain the level of seat capacity being introduced. This indeed proved to the case.“However, these costs are non-recurring, and Loganair is now on the front foot and ready for a successful year ahead.”Managing director Jonathan Hinkles added: “In a challenging year, I’m delighted to say that the transition from franchise partner to an airline operating in its own right was completed on schedule.            “In the last 12 months we have transformed our operation with wholesale changes to our reservations, revenue accounting and check-in systems.“We have carried out a full rebrand, repainted our aircraft in tartan livery, introduced new crew and ground staff uniform, brought in a comprehensive system of service improvements for our customers and launched a significant sales and marketing programme.“I’m equally pleased to be able to report that the response from our customers to these developments has been extremely positive.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4754753.1528987528!/image/image.jpg","title":"in pictures how to make your own scottish morning rolls","story":"\t\tMorning rolls are one of Scotland\u0026#8217s best loved foods, Scottish food writer Fraser Wright provides a recipe on how to make your own.\t\t\t\tYou need to start these the night before you want to eat them, however they last well and toast very well too.            What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4762144.1530348395!/image/image.jpg","title":"alex salmond the vow did swing the indyref result","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...\t\tAlex Salmond has called into question a claim made by the former editor of the Daily Record that The Vow was not responsible for the No campaign winning the 2014 independence referendum. \t\t\t\tThe former First Minister welcomed Murray Foote as “a new recruit to the independence cause” after he came out in support of separation this month.

Although a major study three years ago found it did not change the result of the vote, it led to the creation of the Smith Commission and the devolution of significant new powers to Scotland. Mr Foote, who stood down as editor of the Record in March, said his motivation for publishing the pledge was to ensure the politicians kept to their word. He added there was no evidence it lost the campaign for Yes which he believed failed because the economic case for independence was not strong enough.READ MORE: SNP put IndyRef2 ahead of vote on Brexit deal            However, Mr Salmond remains convinced The Vow had an impact on the vote. He said: “I warmly welcome Murray Foote as a new recruit to the independence cause but he heavily underrates the significance of the Vow which was a journalistic masterpiece but politically disabled Scotland at a crucial moment.“It presented a No campaign then in total disarray with a rallying point in the final week of the 2014 referendum. “The Daily Record provided an infinitely more credible vehicle than George Osborne and the Tory Government who first wanted to proffer the panicked promise of more powers.”            He added: “The votes that drifted back to No in the final days of the campaign were mostly older Labour inclined voters to whom Gordon Brown and The Record still spoke to with some authority and of course offering people an apparently easier path can always be presented as attractive in a climate of fear mongering. “It only needed to influence one in 20 of the population to swing the vote and I think it did just that.”Mr Foote admitted that an independent Scotland would face “financial challenges” in the years after a Yes vote. “The difficult decisions our independent nation would face and the sacrifices we may need to make do trouble me,” he wrote.

Having proposed that Martin should be made a new minister in last week’s reshuffle, Sturgeon was forced to withdraw her nomination when it emerged she had made a series of offensive blog posts.            Her withdrawal has left the post vacant as teenagers are waiting for Higher results and the Scottish Government is supposed to be concentrating on widening access to university for poorer entrants.Professor Lindsay Paterson of Edinburgh University, one of Scotland’s foremost education experts who has advised the Scottish Parliament, said the position that Martin was to have held was a “very important post”.He said the sector was undergoing major changes including moves to widen access, close the attainment gap between rich and poor and a debate about funding for colleges. “I think it would certainly help [if Gillian Martin was replaced soon],” Paterson told Scotland on Sunday. “When people talk about the attainment gap – the social class related attainment gap –  the thing that is probably prominent in most people’s minds is widening access to university, especially to the older universities.             “Some of the initiatives the government has taken are attempting to address that and some of the criticism of the government has said it is not enough. It is absolutely at the heart of the debate and it continues. “One of the most intense periods of debate about this is the summer when the Highers results come out, \u2028and then when new students start arriving at university and the new cycle of university applications starts in the autumn. It is a very good opportunity for a prominent politician to stimulate debate and it would be a pity if there was to be a vacuum there.”Liam McCabe, president of the National Union of Students, Scotland, said a new minister had to be appointed as soon as possible.“It is vital that the government prioritises appointing a new minister as a matter of urgency,” said McCabe. “There are a number of opportunities that require immediate ministerial attention. Universities are falling short of their widening access targets, there’s a growing mental health crisis on our campuses, and we need to see steps taken towards achieving the government’s newly announced ambition to give every student a support package tied to the real living wage.”            Martin’s promotion was reversed on the last day of the Holyrood term after details of a blog mocking trans people and discussing the restaurant tipping habits of “blacks” and “Jews” were publicised.Sturgeon took the decision not to put her nomination before parliament when it became clear it would not secure widespread parliamentary support. With Holyrood now in recess for two months, Martin’s successor cannot be formally approved unless parliament is recalled. In the meantime, the Scottish Government has said a “minister designate” could be appointed. However concerns have been expressed that such an arrangement would see the new appointee lack legal status.Sturgeon’s spokesman said the position would be filled “in due course”. He added: “As Education Secretary, the Deputy First Minister [John Swinney] will be in charge of all of these things in the meantime.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4762243.1530385329!/image/image.jpg","title":"snp westminster leader ian blackford reshuffles team","story":"\t\tChanges to the front-bench team in the SNP\u0026#8217s Westminster group have been announced by the party.\t\t\t\tSNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford has appointed Stuart McDonald, the MP for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East, to the team to cover immigration.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al.

Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"health board in talks for better airport waiting area in aberdeen ","story":"NHS Shetland has been in talks to look at an alternative waiting area for patients flying back from Aberdeen Airport – rather than what has been described by a councillor as \u0026#8220a drafty corridor\u0026#8221.\nHealth board chief executive Ralph Roberts raised the issue during a Zetland Transport Partnership meeting on Tuesday afternoon.\nMr Roberts said there had been discussions with Loganair to look an alternative and he was having more talks about the matter on Friday.\nHe said there had been a suggestion that NHS Shetland should be obliged to pay for a lounge for passengers, but added in his own view it was a matter for all passengers travelling to Shetland.\nMr Roberts argued if the waiting area were adequate for all passengers it would be adequate for patients too.\nZetTrans chairman Ryan Thomson thanked Mr Roberts for bringing it to members\u0026#8217 attention.\nMr Thomson added \u0026#8220it\u0026#8217s a drafty corridor\u0026#8221, the issue had been raised at other transport meetings and Loganair was aware of the issue.\n\n \u0026raquo\nYet again, this is just so typical.

As is perfectly right we have therefore responded to this by looking at how we can respond to these concerns.\nIf this does result in improved facilities for our patients then obviously any individual who doesn’t want to use them would be perfectly entitled to make that choice.\n@ Ralph Roberts \u0026#8211 Thank you for that insight, it\u0026#8217s a shame it wasn\u0026#8217t mentioned in the original press report here as it came across (to me) that you were responding only to a councillor.
