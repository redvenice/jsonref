The Titanic is an object of great interest in China following the 1997 film  The families of the victims and survivors have said the replica of the doomed ship doesn\u0027t suit the situationAccording to Wang Weiling, deputy manager of the ship building process, the site does not have modern shipbuilding capacity. As a result, the workers have had to develop a reasonable construction plan. The ship is made in parts and will be then pieced together.The 50,000 tonnes of steel cost some £105 million to build. Back in 1912, the original ship cost around £1.5 million to build, the equivalent to about £33 million today.According to the information released at the launch ceremony of the replicated Titanic project in 2015, guests who wish to visit the copy will have to pay 3,000 Yuan (£315) a night for a cabin, while more expensive rooms will cost around 100,000 Yuan (£11,251).In addition, there will be ballroom dancing, pool parties, and Las Vegas style entertainment on the ship to transport guests back to 1912.   Guests will have to pay £315 a night for a cabin on board the ship, while more expensive rooms will cost around £11,251          Exact copy: Every detail from the door handles to light switches will be painstakingly reproduced on the Titanic replica          The Titanic sank during its maiden voyage from Southampton on April 15, 1912, five days after it set sail and more than 1,500 people died. The liner had many fans in China after the 1997 film (pictured), featuring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate WinsletThe RMS Titanic sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on April 15, 1912, after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York.More than 1,500 people died when the ship, which was carrying 2,224 passengers and crew, sank under the command of Captain Edward Smith.Some of the wealthiest people in the world were on board, including property tycoon John Jacob Astor IV, great grandson of John Jacob Astor, founder of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel.Millionaire Benjamin Guggenheim, heir to his family\u0027s mining business, also perished, along with Isidor Straus, the German-born co-owner of Macy\u0027s department store.The ship was the largest afloat at the time and was designed in such a way that it was meant to be \u0027unsinkable\u0027.It had an on-board gym, libraries, swimming pool and several restaurants and luxury first class cabins.There were not enough lifeboats on board for all the passengers due to out-of-date maritime safety regulations.After leaving Southampton on April 10, 1912, Titanic called at Cherbourg in France and Queenstown in Ireland before heading to New York.On April 14, 1912, four days into the crossing, she hit an iceberg at 11:40pm ship\u0027s time.James Moody was on night watch when the collision happened and took the call from the watchman, asking him \u0027What do you see?\u0027 The man responded: \u0027Iceberg, dead ahead.\u0027By 2.20am, with hundreds of people still on board, the ship plunged beneath the waves, taking many, including Moody, with it.Despite repeated distress calls being sent out and flares launched from the decks, the first rescue ship, the RMS Carpathia, arrived nearly two hours later, pulling more than 700 people from the water.It was not until 1985 that the wreck of the ship was discovered in two pieces on the ocean floor.                                                     "},{"url":null,"title":"Cuba holiday stuff nightmares family arrive filthy toilets green pool","story":"      The Evans family from Stourport in Worcestershire booked their dream holiday to Cuba for mother Gayle\u0027s 50th birthday          It was their first ever holiday abroad together and they were left far from impressed with the standard of accommodation including this green swimming pool          The holiday cost the family £10,000 but five of them had stomach bugs during their stay and they were unhappy with the state of the bathroom facilitiesMrs Evans said: \u0027I just burst into tears.

Thousands of civilians are still trapped there as human shields, he said.The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the SDF had taken control of all of Baghouz after the jihadists there surrendered. SDF officials denied this.Spokesman Mustafa Bali said the SDF had caught several militants trying to flee among the civilians. Others had handed themselves over.Their fate, and that of their families, has befuddled foreign governments, with few ready to repatriate citizens who pledged allegiance to a group sworn to their destruction, but who might be hard to legally prosecute. The SDF does not want to hold them indefinitely.The fate of Baghdadi is also a mystery. He has led the group since 2010, when it was still an underground al-Qaeda offshoot in Iraq.Its capacity then for strategic retreats in hard times, followed by rebounds when circumstances changed, has prompted numerous warnings that Islamic State\u0027s defeat has not ended the threat it poses to the region.Islamic State suffered crippling defeats in 2017, when Iraq recaptured Mosul, the SDF seized its Syrian capital of Raqqa, and the Damascus government pushed it east to the Euphrates.          Trump announced on Friday there would be \u0027great announcements\u0027 about Syria over the next 24 hoursBut in Iraq it has switched to guerrilla hit-and-run tactics, aimed at undermining the Baghdad government. It has also claimed responsibility for a series of bombings in swathes of northeast Syria held by the SDF, including one last month that killed four Americans.That attack came soon after Trump pledged to pull out, saying Islamic State was already defeated, rattling allies and prompting defense secretary Jim Mattis to resign.Turkey, which regards the SDF\u0027s strongest component, the Kurdish YPG, as terrorists, has threatened to march deeper into northern Syria to drive it back.On Friday U.S. Army General Joseph Votel, who oversees U.S. forces in the Middle East as head of Central Command, said the end of the territorial caliphate would lead to a more dispersed, harder-to-detect network of fighters waging guerrilla warfare.That should require continued help from Washington, he said."},{"url":null,"title":"Royal biographer Andrew Morton Meghans desire Diana 2 0","story":"  The Duchess of Sussex and Princess Diana both faced frosty coverage as they entered the royal householdTaking a leaf straight from Diana\u0027s book, five of Meghan\u0027s friends spoke to People magazine this week, in which they addressed the accusations of her being a bossy bride and, crucially, made stinging remarks about her father, Thomas Markle.Mr Markle, who in the run up to the Royal wedding consorted with tabloids and  made a series of humiliating gaffes, then leaked the five-page letter sent to him last August, which describes how his behaviour had \u0027broken her into a million pieces\u0027.

It let me check in for my outbound but not my inbound one.\u0027Irish low-cost airline Ryanair announced it would be recruiting former Flybmi staff at East Midlands Airport on Monday.             The airline said it was sorry to have cancelled flights to its 25 destinationsThe Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said travellers should contact their insurance provider as their policy may include cover for scheduled airline failure.It advised passengers whose flights were part of a package holiday to contact the travel firm they booked with.If the firm holds an ATOL (Air Travel Organiser\u0027s Licence), it is responsible for flight arrangements and must either make alternative flights available so the trip can continue or provide a full refund, the CAA said.A spokesman for the Association of British Insurers (ABI) said: \u0027Where alternative travel plans are made, any existing travel insurance policy can usually be transferred to cover the new arrangements.\u0027However, the ABI said standard travel insurance policies may not cover the failure of the air carrier and said passengers should check their policy.          Some passengers were able to rebook flights with alternative airlines such as British AirwaysThe airline said it carried 522,000 passengers on 29,000 flights last year.However, Flybmi\u0027s sister airline Loganair insisted the collapse of the Midlands-based company would not have an impact on its operation. In a statement, Loganair management said: \u0027The two airlines are separate businesses, operating separate aircraft fleets on their own distinct route networks.\u0027As such, the closure of bmi Regional - which flew Embraer Regional Jet aircraft on routes throughout 12 European countries - has no impact on Loganair\u0027s continued operation, which predominantly uses turboprop aircraft on routes within the UK and in particular to, from and within the Scottish Highlands and Islands.          Flybmi customers need to check whether their booking has Atol protection. They may also be covered if they booked with a credit cardIf you are a Flybmi customer holding a ticket for future travelYour rights depend on whether your booking has Atol Protection, or not.Atol Protection means that you are guaranteed a refund if a company collapses, and you\u0027d be found an alternative flight home if you\u0027re stranded abroad.But, you won\u0027t automatically have Atol Protection if you\u0027ve a flight booked - it will depend on how you booked it.The Atol scheme applies if you book a package holiday that involves a flight.When you make a holiday booking, make sure your travel company has a licence. Firms must display their Atol licence number on websites and brochures.Booked flights directly with the airline? If you book your flight and then book hotel accommodation through an airline\u0027s website, this may not be covered, unless it\u0027s a linked travel arrangement.If the airline has gone bust before you depart you need to contact your travel agent to make sure your booking is still in place. If it is, then your travel arrangements should continue relatively unaffected, although your flight times could change. It\u0027s important to keep all your booking information should there be any problems.          Passengers might be able to recover the cost of their cancelled flightsCan I recover my costs if I don\u0027t have Atol Protection?You could claim against your credit card company under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act.To be eligible, you need to have paid more than £100 for your flights or holiday, and used your credit card to book direct with the tour operator or airline - usually this means it needs to be either the airline or holiday company listed on your credit card bill.But, some credit card companies will give a refund even if you\u0027ve paid via a travel agent and it\u0027s the agent\u0027s name listed on your credit card bill.If you book a return flight, the total value must be at least £100 – if you book flights inidually, each must be at least £100.Flights costing less than £100 booked on a credit card, or any flights booked with a debit card, may still get some protection via the chargeback scheme.If neither of these approaches works you\u0027ll have to join the list of creditors, but it\u0027s unlikely you\u0027ll be able to get any money back.Rory Boland, Which? Travel Editor, said: \u0027Some customers have claimed that tickets were being sold in the hours before the airline went bust, knowing full well those tickets would never be honoured, and passengers will rightly be outraged if this is proved to be the case.\u0027As all future flights have been cancelled, Flybmi customers should explore their options for refunds. If you purchased your flight as part of a package you should be ATOL protected, which means you should get a refund. However, if you didn\u0027t book as part of a package you may be able to claim the cost back through your travel insurance or credit card issuer, but it depends on your circumstances.Visit www.which.co.ukconsumer-rightsadviceyour-rights-if-an-airline-goes-bust for more information about your rights in the event of an airline going bust.For more information on Atol, click here.                          Hundreds of FlyBMI passengers stranded after airline goes bust at start of half-term and thousands of holiday flights axed"},{"url":null,"title":"US military planes land near Venezuela border aid","story":"An United States Air Force C-17 cargo plane (pictured) loaded with humanitarian aid lands at Camilo Daza airport in Cucuta, Colombia on Saturday   The U.S is sending aid in an apparent effort to undermine socialist President Nicolas Maduro (right) and back his rival to leadership of the South American nation Juan Guaido (left)Guaido is the congressional leader who is recognized by the U.S. and many other nations as Venezuela\u0027s legitimate president.\u0027This wasn\u0027t the first, and it won\u0027t be the last,\u0027 said USAID Administrator Mark Green, standing on the tarmac in Cucuta at a ceremony to receive the aid. \u0027More is on the way.\u0027Share this articleCommercial planes had been used for earlier shipments of aid, which is aimed at assisting the country in it\u0027s economic crisis - including hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine - gripping Venezuela.  \u0027We are saving lives with these airplanes,\u0027 said Lestor Toledo, an exiled politician who is coordinating the international aid effort for Guaido.Maduro has been using the military, which remains loyal, to help him block the aid from entering Venezuela. The United States is airlifting additional humanitarian commodities to provide relief to Venezuelans suffering from severe food and medicine shortages  Food and medicine aid for Venezuela is unloaded from a US Air Force C-17 aircraft at Camilo Daza International Airport in Cucuta          Two of three scheduled Air Force C-17 cargo planes that took off from Homestead Air Reserve Base in Florida had landed in CucutaHe described it as \u0027crumbs\u0027 from a U.S. government whose restrictions have stripped his administration of control over many of its most valuable assets.\u0027They hang us, steal our money and then say \u0027here, grab these crumbs\u0027 and make a global show out of it,\u0027 Maduro told The Associated Press on Thursday. \u0027With dignity we say \u0027No to the global show.\u0027 Whoever wants to help Venezuela is welcome, but we have enough capacity to pay for everything that we need.\u0027  Venezuela\u0027s self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guiado greets the crowd during an event  in Caracas, Venezuela on Saturday His vice president has alleged, without evidence, that the aid packages are contaminated.

But we stand now at a crucial moment.\u0027I do not underestimate how deeply or how sincerely colleagues hold the views which they do on this important issue – or that we are all motivated by a common desire to do what is best for our country, even if we disagree on the means of doing so.\u0027But I believe that a failure to make the compromises necessary to reach and take through Parliament a Withdrawal Agreement which delivers on the result of the referendum will let down the people who sent us to represent them and risk the bright future that they all deserve.\u0027          Attorney General Geoffrey Cox will set out what changes would be required to eliminate the legal risk of being indefinitely trapped in the controversial Irish backstop in a speech on TuesdayShe reiterated that without a Withdrawal Agreement the UK risks a \u0027combination forming in Parliament that will stop Brexit altogether, whatever the long-term consequences for trust in our democracy\u0027.It was confirmed last week that Labour will back a cross-party plan from backbencher Yvette Cooper – expected to go to a vote on February 27 – which would force the Government to conclude its deal by March 13 or allow MPs to vote on no-deal or a second referendum.Mrs May also warned the UK could leave without a deal or an implementation period if Parliament fails to unite behind a plan.\u0027Instead, our party can do what it has done so often in the past: move beyond what ides us and come together behind what unites us sacrifice if necessary our own personal preferences in the higher service of the national interest and rise to the level of events in a way that restores the faith of the British people in our political process,\u0027 she said.

There is no safe exposure to PM2.5, but the World Health Organisation recommends air is kept below ten micrograms per cubic metre.Professor Vance warned the ‘ultra-fine particles’ found in the house are known to deposit in organs such as the heart, liver, lungs and brain, adding: ‘Similar tiny particles are produced by diesel cars and have been linked to heart disease, stroke and lung cancer.’Professor Joost de Gouw, pollution expert at the University of Colorado, said: ‘All of us were just blown away by how high concentrations can get inside.‘You will be exposed for an hour, it’s not a few minutes... Roasting will see you exposed for two or three hours.’Scientists said toasters, alongside scented candles, wood-burning stoves, and gas cookers, could create pollution as people cook and clean inside their homes.          Scientists said toasters, alongside scented candles, wood-burning stoves, and gas cookers, could create pollution as people cook and clean inside their homes (file photo)A study by the University of Texas at Austin found that toasters release toxic particles into the air from the moment they are turned on, the Sunday Times reported.The safest way to make the breakfast food is to \u0027go for gold\u0027 and only allow the bread to become a light brown colour, experts said.Ms Vance said: \u0027When you make toast, the heating element starts warming up the debris and gunk in the toaster which includes oils.\u0027Add to that the bread itself - it\u0027s going to emit a range of things. We found ethanol, a by-product of yeast. If there\u0027s tiny pieces of bread touching the heating element you can see from the smoke, maybe from the crumbs at the bottom of the toaster - they will all make a lot of particles.\u0027It\u0027s led to what would be considered very unhealthy air pollution levels compared to the outdoor air quality standards.\u0027 The research team used advanced sensors and cameras to monitor the indoor air quality of a 1,200-square-foot manufactured home on the University of Texas at Austin campus.The pirate queens of the Caribbean: Fearless pair who...Four people are killed and suspect is in custody after...Share this articleOver the course of a month, the researchers conducted a variety of daily household activities, including cooking a full Thanksgiving dinner in the middle of the summer.The experiment\u0027s results are still pending, but Ms Vance said it is apparent homes need to be well ventilated while cooking and cleaning.Even basic tasks like boiling water over a stove top flame could contribute to high levels of gaseous air pollutants and suspended particulates, damaging health. Scientists noticed a surprising surge of toxic particles and chemicals when household cleaning sprays, scented candles and wood-burning stoves were used. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends no more than 25 micrograms of fine particulates per cubic metre should be found in the air.This is far less than the 3,000 to 4,000 particulate levels which were found in the atmosphere when toast was allowed to turn dark brown.Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from products such as shampoo, perfume, hairsprays and cleaning solutions are said to eventually make their way outside.          A study by the University of Texas in Austin found that toasters release toxic particles into the air from the moment they are turned on (file photo)These have been blamed for triggering asthma in children and worsening it in adults - and raising the risk of heart disease.VOCs also contribute to fine particle formation on a massive scale - making up an even greater source of global atmospheric air pollution than cars and lorries.Ms Vance, a mechanical engineer at the University of Colorado Boulder, said: \u0027Homes have never been considered an important source of outdoor air pollution and the moment is right to start exploring that.\u0027We wanted to know: How do basic activities like cooking and cleaning change the chemistry of a house?\u0027 Breathing in VOCs can inflame the eyes, nose and throat, cause difficulty breathing and nausea and damage the central nervous system.Carpets, vinyl flooring, paint, heating and cooking fuel also cloud households with them. The problem is worst in homes built in the past 20 years thanks to \u0027green\u0027 rules that require energy-efficient impermeable glazing and insulation.This means such homes do not breathe - and nor do older ones boosted to meet new standards.Air pollution causes about 40,000 Britons to die each year, according to studies by the Royal College of Physicians and Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.Evidence also shows air pollution causes more than six million sick days and costs an annual £22.6 billion in terms of ill health and disability - such as heart disease and lung conditions."},{"url":null,"title":"Aerial photographs reveal 125m Chinese replica Titanic taking shape","story":"    Aerial view of life-size Titanic replica under construction on a bank of Qijiang River at Daying County on February 15, 2019  The replicated Titanic being built in Suining, south-west China, was half complete in 2017, according to the Chinese media.

Our reporter spent three weeks training to work at the betting giant’s customer service centre, where he encountered a culture of cashback incentives and VIP perks.During a training session for new staff, a Bet365 worker gave an example to the reporter: ‘If they’ve lost, say, £15,000 in that week, then we’ll give them a weekly rebate, normally on a Tuesday, and we’ll give them maybe 10 per cent of that back.’Another Bet365 employee speaking about cash bonuses said: ‘It’s like incentivising people to bet. It doesn’t look good.’Although gambling companies are allowed to offer rebates to customers, campaigners expressed serious concern that the practice could encourage problem betting.One top gambling lawyer said the industry is rife with cashback incentives, with some firms offering returns as high as 25 per cent on losses.          Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, vice-chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on gambling (APPG), led calls for a sweeping overhaul of UK gambling laws\u0027Time to find a new vocation\u0027: Ben Barba is banned for LIFE...Pokies venues accused of plying gamblers with free booze to...Share this article    Pictured: One of Bet365\u0027s live casino games available on their websiteIncredibly, I’m told that a customer who loses £15,000 in a week could receive £1,500 back to keep betting.‘A VIP will have things like they might get a weekly rebate on how much they’ve lost. So if they’ve lost, say, £15,000 a week, then we’ll give them a weekly rebate, normally on a Tuesday, and we’ll give them maybe 10 per cent of that back.’The practice of giving rebates is part of the byzantine system of ‘enticements’ Bet365 offers to its biggest spenders, including VIP treatment and the chance to win tickets to high-profile sporting events such as the FA Cup Final and the Irish Open.I ask the training officer, who says she has previously trained the VIP team, if winners are rewarded in the same way as VIPs. Matter of factly, she explains they are not, because ‘they’re not making us any money’.‘You could put a single 20p slot bet on and win the jackpot of half a million pounds. That doesn’t make them a VIP. It just means they’re very f***ing lucky.’They certainly are. During my training, which was three weeks out of a 15-week course, the emphasis on rewarding players who lose was remarkable. After just 15 weeks of training, I was told that even I would have been qualified to hand out a £50 bonus to anyone who called the customer service line.We were given examples of a string of other offers – bingo loyalty nights, live blackjack cashback schemes, ‘bingo booster’ nights and chances to ‘double your winnings’.Campaigners have spent years accusing bookmakers such as Bet365 of putting their £683.4million-a-year profit before people, aided in no small part by an industry regulator regarded by many as not fit for purpose.After becoming the first journalist to infiltrate the heart of the online betting industry in Gibraltar, I could not agree more.Our trainer invited us to explain why bonuses and ‘perks’ are so important to Bet365.          A training officer  explains the company\u0027s policy of awarding bonuses to playersShe listed them on her flipchart: to attract new customers, to reward loyal customers, to rebate losers so they can continue playing, and to lure back customers whose accounts have been inactive for a certain amount of time. She explains: ‘Bonuses are there to say you spend this much, or you use this much, over a certain amount of time then we’re gonna reward you with something. We’re rewarding loyalty.’So the more you lose, as I understood it, the more opportunities you are offered to lose even more.At one point, she explains that the other group – beyond big losers and high spenders – who are guaranteed kid-glove treatment are those in the public eye.‘Well-known customers are guaranteed exceptional customer service,’ she says.‘This could be your celebrities, let’s say it was Messi or Rooney or somebody very well known.‘They will never have an account which is in their own name, but you’ll be able to see from their status it’s a well-known person. It could also be somebody well known in the industry.’          Heart of operations: Bet365’s Gibraltar headquartersIt did not look great when during our presentation on responsible gambling our trainer told us: ‘I hate this PowerPoint. But I have to do it.’ Cutting the ‘very dry’ document short, she took us through the issues via the website instead.She did explain that the company has a ‘moral responsibility’ to identify and protect potential gambling addicts. But to me this seemed somewhat at odds with our tutorial about returning money to people who had big losses, which would surely allow them to keep betting – and losing. We are shown Bet365’s ‘live casino’, for example, where players can wager on table games hosted by real-life named dealers. These are mostly women in revealing clothing working out of low-budget TV studios based in Latvia and the Philippines. These 247 live shows are produced by a third-party provider, but Bet365 pays them £10,000 a month to run tables carrying company branding. Our trainer jokes that the girls get more tips if they wear fewer clothes, which appeared highly inappropriate set against the harsh reality of Britain’s gambling problem. This country has 430,000 problem gamblers and further two million are at risk.Staff are clearly proud of the global success of Bet365 – which provides betting services to 35million people worldwide, most of them British – as our trainer tells us gleefully: ‘You can’t watch TV any more without Bet365 popping up everywhere.‘The amount of markets that we’ve got is huge … Really, really random ones. Third league football, reserves league. Really random ones. We’ve got volleyball, greyhounds, e-sports.’She reveals the company’s ultimate aspiration is to expand into North America, where it is currently not licensed to operate. ‘One day we might be … It would be lovely to have Bet365 on the Vegas strip next to Caesar’s Palace.’ For now, however, Bet365 bestrides the gambling industry from what our trainer describes as the ‘great tax haven’ of Gibraltar, where the company goes to great lengths to keep the details of their training programme and customer information from prying eyes. We were told: ‘Anything you do in this company stays within the four walls of this company. That includes your job, details of what your job title is … no information given to anyone outside.’Access to every room is controlled by scanners in staff ID cards which pinpoint our location in the building. All computer screens must be ‘locked’ if we are more than a metre from our desks, every document shredded after use.Such attention to detail has no doubt played a part in Bet365’s extraordinary success, and in the wealth of its £265million-a-year chief executive Denise Coates.But such wealth comes at a price. At one point, I ask our trainer if desperate customers are ever allowed to reclaim their losses.Describing ‘one of the worst conversations she ever had’, she recalls: ‘A person sent an email and it was pages and pages long – about how he’d spent his wedding fund on gambling and he needed to have these bets voided for him, otherwise he’d lose his future wife. It was horrendous to read. And you think, “you are at rock bottom – I would love to be able to just give you your money, but you’re probably going to do exactly the same thing in an hour’s time”.’We were told he was not given his money back."},{"url":null,"title":"Flock sheep Bedfordshire garden","story":"    Two-hundred sheep descended on the back garden of a semi-detached home in BedfordshireThe telecoms manager was left ‘shocked and bewildered’ when he looked into his back garden to find it packed with the farm animals grazing on the lawn.Their shepherdess – the aptly named Sally Shepherd, 27 – had been leading them through the village of Harrold, Bedfordshire, from one field to another on Friday afternoon. ‘We’d gone ahead and checked all the garden gates, so thought there was nowhere else for them to go but towards the right field,’ she said.

He is following in the footsteps of fellow Brexiteer billionaire Sir James Dyson, who recently announced that he, too, is jumping ship by moving his company headquarters to Singapore.Unlike the majority of Britons, the two businessmen have the luxury of spouting their pro-Brexit opinions safe in the knowledge they are insulated from any of the consequences by their vast wealth. They can hedge their bets and cut their tax bills by shunting their assets – or themselves – offshore.And what a way for Ratcliffe to repay the honour of the knighthood bestowed on him by the Queen only last summer for services to business and investment. But in his mindset, patriotism and principle come a long way behind profit and personal enrichment.          Keeping afloat: Among his ‘boys’ toys’ is the superyacht Hampshire II, which cost £130millionAll of this is a terrible shame because there is much to admire about the 66-year-old tycoon.He is the first UK-born industrialist ever to top the Sunday Times Rich List, which he did last year with a fortune of £21billion. In fairness to Ratcliffe, he also appeared in that newspaper’s list of the UK’s biggest taxpayers for 2018 when he paid £110million.Ineos, the business which he created from scratch, is Britain’s biggest private company with a turnover of nearly £47billion and 19,000 employees in 24 countries. That’s a success in any estimation.          Rooms with a view: Aerial view of Sir Jim’s Hampshire mansion, one of several properties he ownsThe son of a joiner and an office clerical worker, he is living proof of how far determination, energy and hard work can take an entrepreneur. He is often described as self-made which is true – but he was in fact made in Britain – with the help of this country’s tax and social system. It was the public purse that paid for the council house, on Dunkerley Avenue in Failsworth near Oldham, where he spent his early years. Public money also financed the grammar school he attended, and his chemical engineering degree at Birmingham University in the days before student fees and loans.He was part of a post-war generation for whom dramatic social mobility was possible, thanks to taxpayer-funded housing and education.Now surely is his chance to acknowledge that, by paying taxes here with good grace. Instead, he is skulking off to Monaco. Unlike Gates, who acknowledges he does not ‘deserve’ his great wealth, it came through ‘timing, luck and people I work with’, Ratcliffe shows no trace of humility.          Contrast that attitude, the maturity and modesty shown by a titan like Bill Gates, with Ratcliffe’s tawdry plans to deprive the UK Treasury of huge sums in tax by moving to Monaco.The move looks like pure self-interest, and for what? He hardly needs the money: his wealth last year increased by an estimated £42million a day. He already has a superyacht, a grand home in Chelsea and an estate in Iceland, among many other assets.And he has more than enough to fritter on a partnership with Olympic sailor Sir Ben Ainslie to compete for the America’s Cup in 2021, on which he is reported to have spent £110million.Surely there are only so many vanity projects, toys and baubles any man could want.Sir Jim is a brilliant entrepreneur but does not seem to realise that with great wealth comes great responsibility.Ineos declined to comment when contacted by the Daily Mail. There is a little I agree on with Marxist shadow chancellor John McDonnell. But when he says ‘the greed of these super-rich tax avoiders seems to have no bounds’, it is hard to demur.Employing highly-paid accountants to avoid tax within the law plays straight into the hands of Labour under Jeremy Corbyn.How sad that a man like Sir Jim, who has achieved so much for Britain, has chosen a course of disloyalty and ingratitude when he could have emulated Gates and made his country proud. "},{"url":null,"title":"80 000 Daily Mail readers pledge pick litter Britain Tidys Great British Spring Clean","story":"More than 80,000 volunteers have pledged to join Keep Britain Tidy\u0027s Great British Spring Clean, which is backed by the Daily Mail.

Acknowledging he suffered from PTSD after he finished writing Columbine, Cullen offers a more uplifting biography of the lives of the teenage survivors at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school following the 14 February massacre. He doesn’t once reference the shooter by name. Instead, the author takes pains to show how hard Parkland’s students have been working to put anti-gun legislation back on the US national agenda. Tracing their journeys from courtrooms to marches to bedrooms and back again, Cullen’s book is full of unforgettable details, such as the no-adults-allowed rule in the students’ office space, that illustrate how trauma became a catalyst. Cullen’s narrative suffers from some superfluous logistics, but it’s an important testament and unexpectedly hopeful.In 1910 in Philadelphia, emancipated slave Spring is narrating her family history to her son as he lies on his deathbed in a debut novel that deftly explores generational trauma and the nature of enterprise, and gives a perspective on slavery not often explored: what happens directly after “freedom”. In style and theme, the most obvious comparison is with Toni Morrison’s Beloved and its evocation of “rememory”, but narrative is less silky and sometimes brutal. Still, her characters get under your skin.There is an intellectual, if humorous, arrogance to Abi Andrews’ 19-year-old feminist narrator, Erin, that some may find offputting as she sets off on a journey into the wilds of Iceland, Greenland and Canada in relentless pursuit of self-knowledge. Even so, Andrews’ debut, dotted with true stories of trailblazing women (such as those enrolled on Nasa’s first female astronaut fitness programme), contains razor-sharp insights and poetic passages, and will hook those interested in the whole idea of wilderness and self-discovery.• To order Parkland by Dave Cullen, Remembered by Yvonne Battle-Felton, or The Word for Woman Is Wilderness by Abi Andrews, go to bookshop or call 0330 333 6846.

His new novel is a hotly anticipated African fantasy epic and here he talks about loving the X-Men, coming out and writing about violenceIt’s two days before the US release of Marlon James’s much-hyped fourth novel, Black Leopard, Red Wolf and the prizewinning Jamaican author has an air of baffled, exhausted ebullience about him. He’s no stranger to critical success: he won the 2015 Man Booker prize for his violent, multi-voiced epic, A Brief History of Seven Killings. But it feels like this new book will propel James into a new galaxy of literary stardom.We’ve arranged to have lunch – on a balmy Sunday in early February – at the Commodore, a carefully shabby Williamsburg diner near his Brooklyn apartment. Brawnily broad-shouldered, his dreadlocked hair tied back in a ponytail, James has arrived before me. We’re shown to seats at the bar where low winter sun slants through the blinds on to the bar top. James tells me it feels like summer to him – he spends much of his time teaching creative writing at Macalester College in Minnesota – and as if to prove it asks the waiter for an Aperol spritz.We order and I pull out my tattered proof of the book. I’ve read it twice already, I tell him, and love it as much as any book I’ve read for a long time. James’s UK publisher, he says, was worried that it would be “too literary for fantasy fans, too fantastical for literary fans”. But the best novels defy the narrow clannishness of genre labels and Black Leopard…is one of them. It’s complex, lyrical, moving and furiously gripping. The critics, whose panegyrics have been appearing over recent weeks, seem to agree. Ron Charles of the Washington Post said that “James has spun an African fantasy as vibrant, complex and haunting as any western mythology and nobody who survives reading this book will ever forget it” the notoriously sniffy Michiko Kakutani of the New York Times declared that “with Tracker and the Leopard, James has created two compelling and iconic characters, characters who will take their place in the pantheon of memorable and fantastical superheroes” there was also a rave on the revered speculative fiction website Tor, with the reviewer, Alex Brown, getting himself into a right tizzy: “Y’all, Marlon James’s Black Leopard, Red Wolf is a miracle. It’s a gift from Anansi himself. This book. This book. THIS BOOK.”Black Leopard, Red Wolf is the first instalment of the Dark Star trilogy, with each novel in the series telling the same story from a different perspective (James tells me he’s planned the next two, but has been too busy promoting this book to start writing them yet). Set in a version of Africa that feels at once ancient and fantastical, Black Leopard… is narrated by Tracker, a flawed, wounded, beautifully nuanced protagonist who has the uncanny ability to scent out people wherever they might be in the various kingdoms he travels through. It’s a quest narrative – the search for a missing child – but one whose result is established in the book’s very first lines: “The child is dead. There is nothing left to know.” At almost 700 pages long, with a vast cast of characters both human and mythical, and with a plot whose labyrinthine agations are dizzyingly complex, it’s not an easy novel, but then that’s not why people read Marlon James.We speak about Kazuo Ishiguro’s The Buried Giant, a fantasy novel that literary critics only seemed able to embrace by viewing it through an allegorical lens. “I don’t write allegory,” James says. “Many critics can only process fantasy as a commentary on the now. Do you review Wolf Hall looking for modern-day parallels? Well if you do, then that’s on you. There are other things to be said about humanity than the contemporary experience.” I ask him why he thinks the literary world’s apparent animus against genre writing persists. “Make no mistake, there’s formula detective fiction, there’s formula science fiction,” he says, jabbing his finger on the bar top, “but there’s formula literary fiction too. It’s genre snobbery that we’re only ready to acclaim stuff that’s of the genre but different in some way. It’s sci-fi but, it’s fantasy but… I didn’t want to write a but.”The central event in James’s Man Booker-winning third novel, A Brief History of Seven Killings, is the 1976 assassination attempt on Bob Marley, in which the singer was shot in the arm and his wife, Rita, through the head. The novel is unflinching in its portrayal of the violence that swept across Jamaica at the time, the gun-toting criminals who segued from political thugs into murderous drug gangs. James was six at the time, his parents both police detectives.He must, I reason, have had some sense of this turbulent atmosphere as a child, particularly given his parents’ occupation. “Even then, given everything that was going on in Jamaica, my childhood was frustratingly middle-class,” he tells me. “But what I remember about when Bob Marley got shot was that I rarely saw my parents get scared for long, but they were afraid after that. They were always chill, they were always in control. Marley changed all that. The fact that the most untouchable man in Jamaica could get shot was what threw them off.” There was another event that stuck with him. “I remember election night 1980, gunmen shot up my mum’s workplace. She was in there. She was so matter-of-fact about it. ‘Yeah, they shot up HQ.’”Against this dramatic backdrop, the bookish, reclusive James lived out an adolescence that mixed solitude with bullying from the jocks at his Kingston high school, who called him “sissy” and “Mary”.“My teenage years before college, I spent pretty much all of my time in my bedroom,” he tells me. “I spent so much time there that my neighbours thought I did high school in America. I’d go to class, then I’d disappear. I’d just basically come home to eat dinner, sleep, draw comics.” He had few friends. “This made a comic like X-Men really resonate,” he says. “They’re outcasts, they’re outsiders, they’re disliked by a world that they’re still a part of. Even other heroes didn’t trust the X-Men. And that connected with me in a really, really major way.” He drew his own comics, then started writing a fantasy novel. “I was a very pretentious teenager and I was trying to write something heavy.”While Game of Thrones has been the go-to cultural reference point for Black Leopard, Red Wolf, it feels like there’s also a good deal of Tolkien in there. He shakes his head. “I never read any of the foundational fantasy novels when I was a kid. Not the pantheon. Those fantasy novels that you might have thought would be everywhere, like Dune and Lord of the Rings, really weren’t. I read whatever cheap crap got dumped on the third world. I didn’t have a community telling me, ‘Read this, read that.’ A lot of what I write about in terms of the fantastic I picked up from comics, particularly Marvel comics. And even that idea of a group of people banded together, which people think I got from Fellowship of the Ring, it’s more like X-Men or one of those anti-teams like Doom Patrol or Suicide Squad. Because comics were easier to get hold of than books.”James went from high school to the University of the West Indies, still living at home, still writing, but now reading whatever novels came his way, from Fielding – “Oh my God, Tom Jones was so much fun” – to James Clavell – “I’m sure that hasn’t aged well.” He studied literature and accounting – “that was a terrible idea” – but it was writing that made his trips to campus worthwhile. “One of the absolute great things about college was creative writing classes. I didn’t even know they existed until I got there. The teacher was John Hearne, one of the first great novelists of the 20th century in Jamaica. It was a game-changer for me. Here was a class where I was going to be judged on the thing I was doing so much at home anyway.”On leaving UWI in the early 90s, James found himself a job at an advertising agency, figuring that it would be a continuation of the creative, geeky world he’d built around himself at university.“When I hit advertising it was nothing like I’d imagined. It was like going back to high school. People were narrow, not open-minded, homophobic. But people gotta eat. And I was good at it.”It was while at the advertising agency that James found himself drawn into a local evangelical church. Alongside a ready-made community, it seemed to offer a means of dealing with the fact that it was becoming increasingly clear to James, who’d lived a monkish life thus far, that he was gay. He described in horrifying detail in a recent New Yorker article how he underwent exorcism at the church. It was during this traumatic time, though, that he wrote John Crow’s Devil, his lowering Faulknerian debut, which tells of two rival priests, each with a guilty sexual secret to hide, competing for primacy in a fictional Jamaican village in the 1950s. It’s a fabulous book, dark and angry and experimental, every page bearing traces of the linguistic daring and visionary imagination that would later characterise James’s work.In that same New Yorker article, he said that he was sceptical of pop psychology and trying to read too much of his personal life into his books, but he concedes that his first novel plays out the conflicts he was going through at the time.“I was trying on being a writer for size,” he tells me. “I was trying on writing about things that are close to me for size. Like sexuality. At the time, I wasn’t in any form of gay relationship. It’s funny that I’ve gone from hating pop psychology to being way too Freudian. I can see all my fears and desires in it. Ones I could never give in to because I was deep in the church and I was a super-suppressed gay dude.”In the end, James’s novel was read by an American author, Kaylie Jones, who passed it on to the indie press Akashic Books in New York. John Crow’s Devil was published to a warm critical reception in 2005. The narrative from here is often painted as an inexorable rise to literary stardom, but James reminds me that his second novel, The Book of Night Women, a brutal 18th-century slave narrative that takes place on a Jamaican sugar plantation, was also turned down almost 20 times, before being picked up by Riverhead Books and published in 2009.It was his next book, A Brief History of Seven Killings, which established James as a major literary force. When Michael Wood, the Man Booker chair that year, was asked how long deliberations about the winner had taken, he replied carefully that they’d been in the room for two hours. Someone else who was there tells me – on the assurance of anonymity – that it was barely 10 minutes before they agreed on James’s extraordinary novel. “Even among these enormously sophisticated readers, they had never read anything like this... everyone was blown away.”He suggested to his agent a “quiet, literary” novel about Jamaicans in New York. Then he began to speak about fantasy. “There are people who follow the Booker with over-ambitious books that fail. I worried that this –” he taps Black Leopard... – “might just come across as me going bigger, harder, faster. It was more reason for me to choose the quiet, literary, observant, contemporary novel. The mature and wise follow-up instead of a book with flipping monsters in it. But I was still thinking of myself as a kind of underdog writer, someone who’d be able to get away with it.”One thing the new novel shares with its predecessors is a uniquely intense presentation of violence. I ask him whether he ever feels that his work strays close to gratuitousness, to a kind of wilful lingering over scenes of pain.“You have to risk it or you won’t get close to the power or the horror of it,” he says. “You have to risk going too far. Man, I sound like Foucault. I actually think this kind of antiseptic, clipped, edited version of violence I see in literature sells it short. If you don’t read the scene of the murder of a child and find it unbearable, then that scene failed. I think people are used to violence, but they’re not used to suffering. In Hollywood films, we see violence, but we don’t see suffering. In my writing of violence I do not escape suffering and I think one of my violent scenes is equivalent to 30 of someone else’s. I get this rap of being too violent, but actually what I’m saying is that violence comes with consequences and suffering and I don’t blink at either. So it’s going to reverberate longer in my books.”It feels like there’s something particular about the fact that a Jamaican relocated to the US (James left Jamaica in 2007) should be writing this great syncretic African epic, that both his distance and his closeness to the cultures from which he draws at once give the novel the perspective and authenticity it requires. I ask if there were any authors whose work inspired the vision of Black Leopard…As far as other literary inspirations, there is always Salman Rushdie, he says – Shame is one of his favourite novels. I email Rushdie on my return and he says he hasn’t read the new book yet, but that James is “a writer of prodigious imaginative gifts and, judging by the advance praise, he’s about to have a monster hit”.There’s also Ben Okri, whose The Famished Road, also one of a trilogy, won the Booker in 1991. “When I read Famished Road,” James tells me, “the urbanity of it is distinctly African. It’s the noise, the cacophony, the spirits and the magic. You can smell the groceries, the shit, but you can also see the zombies. I actually reread The Famished Road while I was writing this. The one thing we all have in common is that we recognise that realism can’t express what we’re talking about. We’ve all at some point reached the end of ourselves in realism. Our reality can’t be expressed by the Victorian novel. Okri is such an influence on me. I’ve read Famished Road like four times.”Okri speaks to me on the phone when I’m back in England. “What he’s trying to do is amazing,” he says. “Particularly given the context of the CaribbeanAfrican relationship. The depth of culture is historically very important, that we have this reciprocity, this dialogue in our literature through history. We all have this rich, unacknowledged African past. This is something that has been felt by many writers and we’ve been looking for a means of articulating it in a universal way, looking for those deep myths, those deep histories. There’s been a lapse of a generation in the literary relationship between African, Caribbean and American writers, and what Marlon is doing seems to signal to me the return to something that’s important for all three linked cultures and is therefore a sign of hope.”As we leave the bar, James speaks to me about the Windrush scandal, which he’d been following closely. “It struck me as very British-colonial,” he says. “I was reading in the  today where it was talking about British people living in Spain who are really apprehensive about losing their benefits and yet they support Brexit. They want Spain to support them but they don’t want to support Spain. Such entitlement to something that you have no intention of returning. Windrush hit me in the same way. You’re talking about the descendants of people who fought in both world wars. If anything, they should be giving them subsidies. You made so much money colonising all of these countries, leaving each one in far worse shape than you found them, but you can’t bring yourself to accept any of these people in your country, people whose parents and grandparents helped build it.”A couple of days after the interview, it’s announced that Michael B Jordan, one of the stars of Black Panther, has bought the rights to the new novel. I call James, who’s at an airport on his way between book signings, to congratulate him. He loved Black Panther, he tells me. “I saw it five times. I started this book in 2015, so I don’t know that they’d even announced that it was going to be made. But from the moment they announced it I was super-excited. I’ve known the comic since the 70s, since Denys Cowan used to write for it.” There was no concern that it might seem too close to the material in the novel James was halfway through writing by the time the film came out? “I didn’t think about Black Panther when I was writing the book. I knew it was a different story, I think we still expect the same story. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie speaks about the danger of a single story. There are a million stories that can be told about Africa – that was one and what I was writing was another.”There was an instant rapport between James and Jordan. “We spoke on the phone for nearly two hours, about what we want to achieve with our work and representation and what stories need to be told. We were on the same page in that regard before we even talked about movie deals. We were so much on the same wavelength as to what stories we want to see.“As people of colour in the diaspora, we’re particularly interested in stories that go beyond slavery. I’m tired of that being seen as the furthest in the past we can go or that swords and sorcery aren’t available to us.”I ask James if he’s going to write the script – he worked on a screenplay of A Brief History… that is yet to be aired. “I’m too busy,” he says with a laugh. “I’ve got part two and three of this series to write.”• Black Leopard, Red Wolf by Marlon James is published by Penguin (£20).

In February 2015, 15-year-old east London schoolgirl Shamima Begum travelled to Syria with two friends, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana, to join Islamic State. Last week, she was discovered in al-Hawl, a Syrian refugee camp, by the Times reporter Anthony Loyd. She is nine months pregnant and wants to return to Britain.For some, Begum is a victim, a child brainwashed into jihad. For others, she is a villain who willingly joined Isis and should be barred from this country. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, insists that he “will not hesitate to prevent” her return if necessary.Both sides are wrong. Britain should let Begum return. Not because she’s a victim but because she’s a British citizen. We do not yet know of her actions in Syria. But, whatever they may have been, she remains someone to whom Britain has legal and moral obligations.Refusing entry to Begum would not simply keep her out of Britain. It would also force another state or organisation to take responsibility for her. The al-Hawl camp is run by the largely Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The SDF has endured staggering loses in its battles against Isis. Why should Britain now expect it to be responsible for a British citizen who helped its monstrous enemy?Earlier this month, Sajid Javid authorised the deportation to Jamaica of 29 people convicted of crimes in this country. They were deemed “foreign nationals” despite many of them having spent most of their lives in this country and being, in most meaningful senses of the word, British. Yet Javid now suggests that he might refuse entry to British citizens who may have committed even worse crimes and force other nations or organisations to take responsibility for them. That is ethically grotesque.If Britain cannot discard its responsibility for Begum, neither can Begum evade responsibility for her actions. We should be careful of treating Begum primarily as a victim.Yes, Begum was just 15 when she left for Syria. She was likely to have been more easily persuadable than had she been an adult. The fact remains, however, that she and her two friends chose to travel to Syria to join Isis. They made their plans surreptitiously and took measures to evade detection. They might have been drawn into Isis by online handlers, but they were ideologically attracted by the idea of a caliphate.Four years on, Begum still appears to be. She has clearly been through a terrible experience. Yet, in her Times interview, she shows little regret or remorse. She is ashamed not of joining Isis but of not being “strong” enough to stay with the caliphate to the bitter end. She was not “fazed” by seeing a severed head in a bin, thinking “only of what he would have done to a Muslim woman if he had the chance”. There is a shocking disjuncture between her blindness to the horrors of Isis and her desire to “come home and live quietly with my child”.One cannot make assessments on the basis of a single interview given to a journalist in a refugee camp in a war zone after four traumatic years. There may be many reasons for Begum speaking as she did. She may well change her views over time. A humane society always acknowledges the possibility of redemption.In any case, views alone, however odious, should not be a matter for criminal sanction. If Begum is to face due process, it should be for her actions, not her views. Could Begum pose a security threat to Britain? Possibly. But then she would equally do so to Iraq or Syria or Kurdistan or wherever else she ends up. It would be morally contemptible for Britain to insist that some other nation take that risk. Britain’s obligations to its citizens – and to other nations – are not diminished by the fact that those citizens may have committed appalling acts.Begum will not be the last British jihadist wanting to return home. Many will have committed more terrible crimes. Their cases will pose even more difficult moral and political dilemmas. The principles of moral responsibility, on either side, will, however, remain the same.What separates a nation such as Britain from the barbarism of Isis, politicians often claim, is that Britain abides by the rule of law and is defined by humane values.

It shows how the widespread availability of sophisticated advertising techniques is going to give considerable power to people who previously had no way of getting their message across to large numbers. In the most recent US campaigns against vaccination, 147 different advertisements have been used and some viewed more than 5m times. There is an arms race under way, whether we like it or not.Facebook and YouTubeGoogle must take some responsibility for the consequences of their profit-seeking algorithms. Neither company should be profiting from an activity so detrimental to public health as anti-vaccination propaganda. Both ban tobacco advertising but permit propagandising against vaccination, even from people with a commercial interest in quack remedies. Yet the withholding of children from vaccination might be considered even more anti-social than tobacco smoking. The teenager who smokes puts their own body at risk more than that of anyone else, whereas the parent who refuses a child vaccination is unlikely to harm their own health at all: only that of their offspring. If this were just a decision to allow their own children to run a small risk, it might be defended. But it is not. Because of the way that herd immunity works, such parents are threatening other people’s children too, some of whom cannot for medical reasons be vaccinated.In some western countries threatened by campaigns against vaccination there are rules in place to stop unvaccinated children from attending school. This protects communities and sends a powerful signal to the wider world, but it is a drastic step. It risks punishing children twice for their parents’ faults. If parents trusted the state, the medical profession, or the gatekeepers of the media, this problem would not arise. The roots of the protests against vaccination lie for a large part in the inarticulate but powerful sense that modern life is dehumanising, and that powerful forces are conspiring to turn us into obedient robots and to squeeze out our humanity. When power is no longer trusted, it does not matter that it telling the truth. Yet the distrust of anti-vaxxer parents is a threat to everyone’s children and not just their own.One step is obviously a campaign of public education by figures who are trusted by the target audience in the way that their friends on social media are. If public health campaigns were run with half the ruthless ingenuity displayed by betting companies, we might be better off. But not everything can be left to governments and large companies. Parents who care about their own children’s health must be prepared to take the argument to the playgrounds and on to social media as well."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d4b137d1c2f4a2f82c71aaaa155273cf77a8748/0_116_3664_2199/master/3664.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c26d7a1b907af488d5100e7af822ae7b","title":"theresa may election referendum vote brexit","story":"Fifty years ago, in an address to the nation, the US president Richard Nixon immortalised the phrase “silent majority”. In the febrile context of 1969, he was referring to the millions of law-abiding Americans who were not involved with, or sympathetic to, 1960s counter-culture, the protests against the Vietnam war and angry campus campaigning.Does the idea still have meaning? Social media, smartphones and the resulting digital cacophony have pretty much seen off the possibility of “silent” anything. But noise is not the same as democracy.All the same there is, I think, something approaching a majority in this country that – however it votes in first-past-the-post elections – does not feel truly represented by either the nativist Conservative party or Corbynite Labour. And this group does not fare well in a political culture that favours polarisation and amplifies shrillness.On Brexit, they may not be remainers in the sense that they feel a passionate allegiance to Brussels or the treaty of Rome. But they have observed the following, with growing anxiety: that the nation decided in June 2016 to follow the path to departure from the European Union that the voters were lied to and electoral law broken in the preceding campaign and that, after nearly three years, the path has led us all to the edge of a cliff. They wonder if it really would be “treacherous”, “anti-democratic” or a violation of the “will of the people” to pause at this political Beachy Head and – at the very least – reflect upon our next steps before we head over the precipice. That’s the great thing about cliffs. You can pull back from oblivion as often as you like. You can jump off only once.So, with less than six weeks to go until the official Brexit date, this group feels not that it has “taken back control” but precisely the opposite. Polling by YouGov shows there is a clear majority against leaving the EU when voters are asked about specific forms of departure – “no deal” or Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement, for instance. Who speaks for these people?There is an alternative path, and it is becoming clearer by the day. Taking it will not be easy, but this is no time to prioritise convenience or simplicity (the great sin of the populist).First, the UK must seek an extension of article 50 from our 27 EU partners: the Commons will have the opportunity to lay the ground for such a request when it votes (again) on Yvette Cooper’s amendment on 27 February.But that in itself will not be enough: the EU will not grant any such postponement unless we persuade its members that we are seeking something more substantial than a few more months of can-kicking. There has to be some sort of plan.And that plan has to involve a final-say referendum. How many permutations of impossible do we have to watch the Commons consider before we all accept that there is no distinct parliamentary solution to this conundrum? The only proposal for action that MPs have approved – Graham Brady’s amendment on 29 January – was successful precisely because it was meaningless. Its demand for “alternative arrangements” to the Irish border backstop was simply another way of saying: we agree that we don’t have an answer.Which is why, having voted for the Cooper amendment, MPs should also back the plan put forward by the Labour MPs Phil Wilson and Peter Kyle, and backed by several Tory remainers. This would give the Commons the chance to back a deal that would then be put to the electorate in a referendum. It combines the best of parliamentary responsibility and plebiscitary democracy.There was a time when I believed a general election might break the impasse: but no longer. Jeremy Corbyn has made it overwhelmingly clear that he has no interest whatsoever in a people’s vote indeed, that he actively favours Brexit, and the sooner the better. When he says the option of a public vote remains “on the table”, one thinks of all those copies of Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time that were put on display, untouched, in middle-class households. If you believe Labour under Corbyn is ever going to give collective, official backing to a fresh referendum, you really haven’t been paying attention.May, for her part, has become so fixated by what she sees as her historic duty to deliver Brexit that she would rather lose a general election than oversee a second vote that might thwart our EU departure. Many Conservative prime ministers, after all, have been kicked out of office by the voters: Edward Heath, John Major, even Winston Churchill. But if May were in No 10 at the time of a public vote to block Brexit she would always be damned in the folklore of the right as the prime minister who betrayed the dream of national independence. For a lifelong Tory such as May, this is an intolerable prospect.Which is why I do not believe most cabinet ministers when they insist the “last thing” they want is a general election. For a start, they believe, with quietly growing confidence, that they can beat Corbyn unambiguously this time. And – remarkably – they’d rather take that chance than risk the wrath of the far right by acceding to a new referendum. Which, when you think about it, is seriously pathetic.Yet, in these urgent and decisive times, another head-to-head between May and the Labour leader would simply not offer the choice that the nation needs. Perhaps uniquely in the history of modern general elections, it would be a sideshow. So – given this tragic abdication of responsibility by the two main party leaders – it is for members of parliament to shrug off the chains of tribalism, the discipline of the party whip and the growing threat of constituency deselection. If ever there was a time to think, without fear, of the public interest, and to set aside partisanship, this is it. We inhabit a digitised culture of political cantonisation, reflexive hostility and snarling defensiveness. Which is to say that what is needed is, in the truest sense of the word, counter-cultural.There is still a chance for MPs to prove themselves worthy of the public trust, and a way of giving voters – including those who opted for leave in 2016 – a final chance to say whether this is really what they had in mind. A few steps away from the cliff’s edge, we still have time to think again. There is no direction to history, no implacable force of providence driving us towards an act of irrevocable, collective self-harm.What happens now will happen because of human agency, or its absence. The parliamentary technicalities may be complex but the choice could not be simpler: what do we actually want?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f72d6cbe91718637f1204284ec3d733e20fbe92e/0_169_3307_1984/master/3307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d488f0baaed434ae4eaedbf752e53364","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of time","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘time’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘time’.Share your photos of what time means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 20 February at 10am.

Peak indoor pollution lasted for about an hour.“We were all surprised at the overall levels of particulate matter in the house,” said Marina Vance, who led the research at the University of Colorado in Boulder. She advised people to open windows and use extractor hoods if possible to ventilate the home while cooking.PM2.5s are particles that are smaller than 2.5 micrometres across. They are small enough to be inhaled deep into the lungs where they exacerbate respiratory disorders and cardiovascular disease. Smaller particles can spread from the lungs into the bloodstream where they build up in the liver, heart and even the brain, where they may contribute to depression and other mental health issues.In what Vance described as the most comprehensive investigation yet into chemicals in the home, the researchers cooked a series of meals in a three-bedroom test house fitted with indoor and outdoor pollution monitors. One day they cooked a Thanksgiving dinner with roast turkey, roast Brussels sprouts, boiled sweet potatoes, bread stuffing and cranberry sauce.During the day of cooking, PM2.5 levels in the house rose to 200 micrograms per cubic metre for one hour, more than the 143 micrograms per cubic metre averaged in Delhi, the sixth most polluted city in the world, and far higher than the central London average of 15 micrograms per cubic metre.Ranked on the US air quality index, a measure applied to city pollution, the indoor air was either “unhealthy” or “very unhealthy” for nearly two hours. The levels breached World Health Organization guidelines of 10 micrograms per cubic metre for eight-and-a-half-hours. The simple act of making toast sent PM2.5 levels up to 30 micrograms per cubic metre.While gas flames and charred food churned out fine soot particles, others came from animal fat, cooking oils, and grime in the oven and and on pots and pans used in making the meal. Still more came from tiny particles of skin that the cooks and their guests shed from their clothes.“We know that inhaling particles, regardless of what they’re made of, is detrimental to health. Is it equally bad as inhaling exhaust from vehicle emissions? That we don’t know that yet,” Vance said. “This compares to a very polluted city, but what’s important to remember is that this was for a short period of time. When you live in a polluted city you’re in it for 24 hours a day.”Instruments around and inside the test home in Austin, Texas, found that when no one was cooking, the house kept outdoor air pollution out. But during a full day of cooking, the levels of particles indoors rose to about 30 times that outside.Ian Colbeck, an expert in air pollution at the University of Essex who was not involved in the study, said he had measured particulates in his kitchen for the past 10 Christmases. “PM levels are much higher than in cities in the UK,” he said. “A roast is one of the worst ways of cooking as regards indoor air pollution.”In one study, researchers looked for chemical contaminants in the blood and urine of children in 190 families. Some came from homes that had sofas containing flame retardants, and had six times the levels of the chemicals in their blood than other children. When children lived in homes with vinyl flooring, levels of hormone-disrupting phthalates in their urine were 15 times higher than those found in other children.“As with any pollution there will be more susceptible groups such as the young and elderly,” said Joost de Gouw, another pollution researcher at the University of Colorado. “What’s clear is people spend a lot of time indoors and they are exposed in some cases to much higher levels than what you see outdoors.”Vance advises people open windows and use kitchen extractors to remove the invisible pollution, but said it was unclear whether fans would help, since they recirculated air without adequately filtering it. “The joke we’ve been telling each other is boil everything, avoid roasting, but it’s too delicious,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46e4e9085ab58b44e221b64abfad882285db152c/0_34_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66d0c12d7b83e8a7a25fdb4a2886a8d2","title":"michael gove food waste bins weekly","story":"Drive to ‘reduce, reuse, recycle and cut waste’ could include plastic tax and deposit schemeMillions of homes could have their food waste bins collected weekly, if new proposals from the environment secretary are implemented in the wake of a government consultation on the UK’s waste system.Michael Gove’s proposed measures to ensure consistent recycling collections come after a number of councils cut the frequency of collections, leaving residents with overflowing bins.Free garden waste collections for households with gardens may also be introduced while councils in England will be obliged to provide weekly pickups of food waste. The policy area is devolved to national government level.“We are committed to going further and faster to reduce, reuse, recycle and cut waste,” Gove said. “That’s why we are leading the way to move away from being a ‘throwaway’ society and drive up domestic recycling. We are committed to cementing our place as a world leader in resource efficiency, so we can be the first generation to leave our environment in a better state than we inherited it.”Local authorities would receive more money from the government to pay for the increased frequency of collections, many of which are outsourced to private companies. The services were reduced variously from once every one or two weeks to every three or four weeks after deep cuts to council budgets.This led to reports of overflowing food waste, which attracted insects and rats. Government figures showed that complaints about missed collections had increased by a third across England and Wales since 2014.Councils received more than 1.8m such complaints, about 4,500 a day, the BBC reported, with the actual number of missed collections likely to be much higher.The issue is particularly acute in parts of Surrey, Sussex and the West Midlands, where refuse workers in Birmingham have been striking over a longstanding industrial dispute. Fortnightly collections are set to temporarily resume there.Spending on waste collection by local authorities fell from £1bn in 2010-11 to £888m in 2017-18 after accounting for inflation.The consultation will also look at bringing in a deposit return scheme for cans and bottles. The scheme, whereby people would pay a small upfront charge refundable upon return of the empty container, could drive up the recycling of the estimated 3bn plastic bottles that are currently incinerated, sent to landfill or discarded on streets.Philip Hammond, the chancellor, said: “Plastic packaging makes up two-thirds of all the plastic waste that pollutes this country and wreaks havoc on our environment. It’s our responsibility to do something about it, and that’s why we will introduce a new tax on the producers of plastic packaging that don’t use enough recycled material.”The changes are a central plank of the government’s upcoming environment bill, which will be introduced early in the second session of parliament after Easter.Environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth welcomed the proposals, but said bigger steps were needed. “A radical overhaul of waste strategy is urgently needed to deal with our waste crisis – but this must include bold targets to substantially cut the waste that squanders precious resources, blights our environment and harms our wildlife,” Julian Kirby, a plastics campaigner at Friends of the Earth said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3401bd8de4e64e89f552133c1a9920c69c96da5d/2451_542_2709_1625/master/2709.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=754ce21c215836a03b49b77ff5387c11","title":"burberrys new show brings rave culture back to life","story":"Designer Riccardo Tisci draws on memories of London as a student for second showA Burberry show is about acting out what Britishness looks like, on the stage of London fashion week. France and Italy each have multiple powerhouse brands, but as the only British fashion brand listed on the FTSE100 index, Burberry stands for Britain. “To me Burberry isn’t just fashion, it’s everything about British life. It pretty much represents a country,” the designer Riccardo Tisci said backstage on Sunday after his second Burberry show. Tisci, who was born in Italy and spent much of his career in France, is bringing to Burberry the theatrical bent that made his Givenchy shows appointment-viewing at Paris fashion week. Following Kingdom, his debut show in September, his second Burberry outing was named with an equally Shakespearean flourish as Tempest.Arriving at Tate Modern, the audience found that those with gold tickets were ided on arrival from those with silver, and directed into two distinct spaces. One was plush, with guests seated in inidual upholstered armchairs the other raw and industrial with scaffolding and cube seating. As the lights went down, the theme music for News at Ten resounded through both spaces, followed by snippets of news reports of the early 1990s rave scene and the clash between the establishment and youth culture in the pre-Criminal Justice Act era.Oversized puffer jackets in high-shine nylon were worn with check baseball caps and thick creeper-soled sneakers. With a soundtrack designed for the collection by MIA around classic 1990s tracks (1994’s Incredible by General Levy, for instance) the show brought rave culture faithfully back to life. There were oversized bumbags, slip dresses, track pants pooling around trainers. Backstage after the show, Tisci said that he had drawn on his memories of living in London “as a student, with no money” when he was 18. “I was very lucky to be here in the 90s. It was a great era – one of the best, I think. And I was here, and I was 18.” The concept for the two contrasting spaces, he said, was for one side to represent the British establishment, and the other side streetlife. “But both of them are Britain, both of them are part of the same culture, and Burberry lives in both of those worlds.”A year into his second stint living in London, he believes that “British kids these days don’t have the freedom that we had back when I was a student here. It’s a difficult time, and it’s not easy for them to express themselves. They are scared.” He was encouraged “and amazed, impressed” by the school student strike on Friday. “They are fighting for their rights. That’s amazing. It’s their future.”Like his first show, this was a collection in two parts. Just as his first season morphed from pleated skirts into punk, this collection’s Shane Meadows-esque section segued into silk scarves and tailoring. The chic house codes of check and trench have an added frisson, thanks to Tisci’s bad-bourgeoisie twist. A trench coat comes with a faux-fur lining, like a parka a blouse is painted with oysters, each one with a pearl stitched on.Successful Burberry shows connect with the audience by capturing something about British culture, and this one did that. The street-style clothes had an authenticity from being rooted in Tisci’s own experience, and lent excitement to the more sedate pieces. Christopher Bailey, Tisci’s predecessor at Burberry, made his Burberry sing by tapping into a vein of bookshoppish, cardigan-wearing bohemia hitherto unseen at a luxury brand. The new Burberry is very different, but underscored with the same sense of Britishness.

Luckily for menswear, this spring is all about tailoring, on and off the catwalk – and not a fusty old suit in sightRead more from the springsummer 2019 edition of The Fashion, our biannual fashion supplementThe streetwear brand Supreme shocked the fashion world last year. No, it wasn’t the red-and-white logo-covered pinball machine, inflatable kayak or even the branded breathalyser it was selling. It was something so innocuous, so unexpected yet quotidian, the virtual opposite of a “shock tactic” in fact. Tucked away among all the hoodies, track pants and baseball caps typical of the much-hyped label, there was – wait for it – a classic two-piece suit. The item more readily associated with commuters and politicians than hoodie-wearing hype beasts had entered new territory.It sent ripples through the streetwear community. GQ called it the Supreme piece they would most like to buy and, in an unlikely turn of events, suddenly trainer-hungry superfans were salivating over a blazer.This season there were four major menswear designer debuts at luxury labels and all rallied behind the two-piece. At Kim Jones’s first outing at Dior, he gave the suit his blessing, with lightweight double-breasted ones in pastel pink and Big Bird yellow. Virgil Abloh, in a much-anticipated collection for Louis Vuitton, steered away from what might have been expected when looking at his streetwear-infused label Off-White, and instead opted for roomy tailoring in white, mint and candy-apple red. Riccardo Tisci, a pioneer of gothic-chic streetwear during his reign at Givenchy, showed tasteful, meeting room-friendly suits as part of his first Burberry collection. Meanwhile Hedi Slimane, showing menswear for the first time at Celine, presented his signature razor-sharp skinny suits in black.The suit is obviously nothing new. It has been with us, in one form or another, for centuries – from French aristocrats’ matching redingotes and breeches in the early 1700s to England’s more conservative version popularised by Beau Brummell in the early 1800s and the preppy postwar American iteration championed by Brooks Brothers. Its longevity can be put down to its chameleon-like qualities. The suit has been spun in many different directions over the years, from the traditional (Gianni Agnelli, JFK Jr) to the foppish (Bryan Ferry, Wes Anderson) to the outright eccentric (David Bowie, André 3000). Then, of course, there are the myriad varieties seen in offices every day.Interestingly, though, as its fashionability grows, the suit’s place in the corporate landscape is fading. Silicon Valley startup culture has ushered in a new age of casual dressing that makes off-duty clothes appropriate for the corner office. Two years ago, JPMorgan Chase announced that “business casual” was its new official everyday dress code. Last year, the business publication Inc. released a guide for companies to attract millennials with a more relaxed approach to workplace attire. With white-collar workers increasingly casual, the stuffy totem of adulthood and nine-to-five dressing that is the suit can be reassessed by a new generation of men who associate hoodies and trainers with the uniform of establishment figures such as Mark Zuckerberg or Evan Spiegel.Andrew Cedotal, a 32-year-old Silicon Valley game designer, is an interesting case. He wears a suit or mixed suit separates, despite his notoriously casual environs – and likes what it semaphores. “Wearing a put-together outfit is a way of very easily communicating that you know how to build an organised and visually appealing presentation,” he says. “It’s a sign to people who are marketing experts that you know how to tell a story in a single glance.”Cedotal is an outlier in the Bay Area, and can remember seeing only two other suit-wearers in the wilds of San Francisco. At companies he’s worked for, it’s mostly relegated to the legal team. In the tech industry, where “disruption” is a cherished value, he is in fact the rebellious one for wearing a throwback uniform. “I’ve had multiple people say that to me,” he laughs.Michael Adebayo, a 32-year-old GP based in the north-east of England, is someone for whom wearing a suit is optional – but he often does it anyway, he says, “in a more relaxed manner, without a tie or pocket square. These days, seeing people combining a suit with trainers or even shorts is amazing.” Adebayo uses suits to stand out – “Velvet and natural wool fabrics are my favourites” – rather than blend into a crowd. “I feel I can take on any challenge when wearing a suit and, most importantly, it makes people listen.”This new era of suiting won’t simply be a return to the slim-fitted “suited-and-booted” movement of the early noughties when Slimane’s skinny tailoring for Dior Homme dominated, but will bring the swagger of streetwear into the more traditional world of tailoring. Look at the mint green, oversized Louis Vuitton double-breasted suit Kanye West wore (with no shirt and slide sandals) over the summer, or Michael B Jordan’s Off-White suit with a belted waist and bright orange armband. Then there’s the floral appliquéd Haider Ackermann suit – a mix of rock’n’roll and romance – that Timothée Chalamet wore at the Toronto film festival in September, or DJ Benji B, more usually found in a bomber jacket or hoodie, in a Virgil Abloh-designed, loose-fitting Louis Vuitton suit at the Fashion Awards in December. Footwear is key – see Stormzy, a tracksuit devotee, on the front of Elle’s February issue in tailoring and trainers – a surefire way to de-corporate any suit.Of course, for some, the suit never went out of style in the first place. Finance manager David D’Costa, 31, wears one as his “work uniform”. “A mentor in my first job guided me through the basics of suit wearing and over time I’ve developed my own style,” he says. Despite the suit’s formerly fusty reputation, he says seeing hordes of suit-wearers crossing London Bridge in the morning rush hour can be “a thing of beauty” and is in favour of more creative suit trends making their way into the boardroom.Thomas Henry, a 34-year-old strategy director at the creative agency Mother in New York, has worn a suit all his professional life, to give him a certain edge and add an authoritative balance to his youthful appearance. He remembers the Mad Men-inspired tailoring revival of a decade ago, but is the only member of his office to embrace the suit today, and doesn’t think that will change – because of the impact it makes. “A deep irony about the creative industry is that you spend all this time telling your clients to stand out, yet the people who work in the field have a deep insecurity about looking different.” Henry has no such qualms.Brendon Babenzien, founder of New York-based brand Noah, which brings together surf, skate and music references with classic American menswear, is aware of this new suit wearer. He usually includes some sort of tailoring among his casual-leaning collections. “I don’t know anyone who dresses up or down all the time,” he says. His current version is a patchworked two-piece featuring tattersall, windowpane and micro-check plaids. “Our customer seems to really appreciate the way we do suiting and jackets,” he says. “We’ve removed some of the formality from it.”London brand Casely-Hayford is built around the suit, but designer Charlie Casely-Hayford – himself a member of the new suit tribe – has noticed his customer is embracing it in a more relaxed way, too. “Our biggest market is guys who don’t need to wear a suit for their job, but they choose to,” he says. “We work with a lot of creatives and they wear suits in a totally different way from our more strait-laced clients.” Wearing a suit with a T-shirt and trainers is increasingly common, he says. “The overarching theme I hear from our clients is comfort and ease, and the idea of getting that from a suit.”So are younger men finally ready to trade their sweatshirt uniform for suits? All signs point toward yes. But perhaps it’s not a comeback per se. “I teach at a couple of universities,” says analyst Cohen. “Some of my students come to class wearing suits. I say, ‘What are you all dressed up for?’ And they say: ‘This is me, this is my style. I discovered the suit.’”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/330b55a2d0fda05c7f45636581614115f1ce5898/0_958_6548_3929/master/6548.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fca10153121c94aa338e8d102ba85ab","title":"look lively fashions take on survivalist style in pictures","story":"Want to be prepared this season?

It’s fascinating and infuriating. But the Academy Awards don’t always get it right. In fact, on many now infamous occasions, they got it totally wrong.Giving How Green Was My Valley best picture over Citizen Kane, for example. But while there is always going to be debate over whether the best picture actually won best picture – merit is a difficult thing to quantify, after all – each year’s top prize winner and, perhaps more importantly, the reaction to it, tells us something about the cultural zeitgeist.The Academy Awards represent, indeed, a snapshot of a section of America’s prevailing concerns, the issues and themes that are deemed important by the Academy voters and by the audiences who voted with their feet and put the film on the awards circuit in the first place.Of course, prevailing concerns can be swayed, as they were in the era of Harvey Weinstein’s notoriously forceful awards campaigns. And the issues that concern the average Academy voter are unlikely to overlap much with those of the average punter. But the best of the best pictures over the past nine decades are not just the most elegantly crafted pieces of film-making – they are the films with themes that resonate still with a present-day audience. Wendy IdeUnlike many of the earlier best picture winners that have aged rather inelegantly, Casablanca, if anything, has matured, its textures deepened. A peerless cast – Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are matched by an impressive array of supporting character actors – work with a precisely crafted masterpiece of a screenplay. Directed by Michael Curtiz, this story of rootless refugees from the second world war, washed up in a city, which stamps its personality on every frame, feels both timely and timeless.1951 was notable as the year in which two far from flattering portraits of the acting profession went head to head. Joseph L Mankiewicz’s All About Eve, a crisply malicious portrait of the rivalry and ruthlessness of actresses, won the prize for best picture. But perhaps equally deserving was Billy Wilder’s Sunset Boulevard, a film that turned a mirror on the industry itself. It clearly wasn’t keen on what it saw there. Despite the fact that All About Eve was carried by two remarkable performances, from Bette Davis and Anne Baxter, neither won best actress. The prize went to Judy Holliday, for George Cukor’s Born Yesterday.A biting tragicomic romance, Billy Wilder’s The Apartment seems darker with each passing year. The story of a low-level employee (Jack Lemmon) who tries to curry favour with his boss by lending his apartment as a venue for the other man’s affair, the film was based partly on a real-life Hollywood scandal. A high-powered agent was shot by a producer for having an affair with his wife that had played out in the apartment of a hapless employee.OK, so it’s no masterpiece and possibly not even the most deserving of the nominees that year (my pick would have been John Schlesinger’s Darling others might argue for David Lean’s Doctor Zhivago). But few best picture winners have achieved such an enduring cultural impact as this Robert Wise film. A big-hearted crowd-pleaser of a movie, it was credited with saving 20th Century Fox, after the costly failure of Cleopatra. That said, Christopher Plummer hated working on the picture it and renamed it The Sound of Mucus.The first R-rated film to win best picture, it heralded US cinema’s most vital and visceral period. Gritty, breathlessly thrilling and pulsing with tension, William Friedkin’s grungily authentic crime movie was shot on a shoestring budget. The car chase, now regarded as one of the greatest of all time, was filmed without permits the near collisions, and in one case an actual collision, were unplanned. If the 1970s was the decade of the outlaw film-maker, The French Connection was the most daring coup.Francis Ford Coppola had an eventful few years that kicked off with the best picture award for a film widely considered to be a landmark in US cinema. He scored another nomination for best picture the following year, as the producer of George Lucas’s American Graffiti. Then, in 1975, he pulled off the unprecedented achievement of having directed two best picture nominees: The Godfather Part II and The Conversation. The Godfather Part II won, one of only two sequels ever to do so (the other was The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King).This adaptation of Ken Kesey’s novel was a troubled production from the outset. Its star, Jack Nicholson, and director, Miloš Forman, fell out spectacularly over the approach Nicholson organised a cast rebellion and hijacked the rehearsals director and actor refused to speak to each other throughout. But One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest went on to win the grand slam of Academy Awards: best picture, best director, best adapted screenplay, best actor and best actress. It was the second film ever to do so.A landmark film for its visceral and starkly truthful portrayal of modern warfare and for the fact that it was the first and, to date, only best picture winner to be directed by a woman. Kathryn Bigelow also won best director. Jeremy Renner stars as a maverick bomb disposal expert who finds himself at odds both with his fellow soldiers and with the family at home in a civilian world that seems crushingly mundane to someone hooked on the adrenaline hit of daily near-death experiences.The results mix-up at the Oscars ceremony, in which La La Land was briefly and erroneously declared best picture winner by co-presenter Faye Dunaway, overshadowed the fact that Barry Jenkins’s swooningly lovely piece of cinematic poetry was one of the most deserving winners in years. Jenkins took the bones of Tarell Alvin McCraney’s theatre piece and crafted a work of pure cinema, every frame saturated with colour and emotion. And he did it on a tiny budget: at $1.5m (£1.2m), Moonlight had the second lowest budget of a best picture winner (Rocky, made in 1976, had a budget of $1.1m). Adjusted for inflation, Moonlight is the lowest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

The manager of Wales since January 2018, Giggs has had nine games to get used to the isolation.“I’m lucky to have great staff around me and, during the week, you’re constantly in meetings and on the training ground. But it’s that hour before the game, when the coaches take the lads out to warm up, that you feel it. You’re alone in the dressing room and you’ve done everything you can. That’s a lonely time. There’s nothing left to do. You’re on your own.”We sit in a hotel room overlooking Old Trafford. Giggs won 13 Premier League titles and two Champions League finals as a player for Manchester United, the club with whom he was associated for 29 years from a boy to an icon who took charge as a caretaker manager for four matches in 2014. Giggs, who then became Louis van Gaal’s assistant for two seasons, finally left United in July 2016. Eighteen months later, bruised by the even more intense loneliness of looking for work in football, Giggs was appointed as manager of Wales.The 45-year-old, who still lives in Manchester, soon reflects on the rise of Ole Gunnar Solskjær, his former teammate, who has had such success in the Premier League since replacing José Mourinho and becoming interim manager at United. But Giggs concentrates first on Wales.Last September, in his first home game, Wales produced a vibrant display of the attacking football Giggs epitomised as a player. They swaggered past the Republic of Ireland, winning 4-1 in an exhilarating and clinical performance. Yet, in their most recent match, Wales lost to Albania, 42 places below them in the world rankings. Unlike a club manager Giggs has had to reflect on that loss for nearly three months.Statistics can be misleading but, under Giggs, Wales have lost five of nine games. “If we’d have beaten Albania, I would have called it a successful year,” Giggs says. “But we played Spain, Uruguay, Mexico. Denmark twice. Almost all in the world’s top 10. We used experimental squads, experimental systems. So we’ve used this first year to see what we’ve got while looking forward to the Euros. Against Albania we actually played really well first half. We should have won 3-0 but missed easy chances. Then they get a penalty which may not have been one. But sometimes you learn a lot more from defeats.”A crunch period is looming. On 24 March Wales face Slovakia in Cardiff. It is their opening match in a qualifying group that includes the World Cup finalists Croatia as well as Hungary, Belarus and Azerbaijan. “We need a good start against our main rivals because, after Croatia, I would say it could be between us and Slovakia. They have a new manager but they’ve got talented players. Marek Hamsik stands out. He just broke the goalscoring record for Napoli, overtaking Diego Maradona. So this first game against Slovakia is a big one.”Old Trafford does not cast any shadows on a rainy day. But it’s hard to escape the club that has dominated Giggs’s life. He joined United on his 14th birthday and played his last game aged 40. Giggs admits he shed tears in his car after his retirement was confirmed following the final match he was in charge of United as caretaker manager – against Southampton in May 2014. “I’d had three weeks in the job and I put myself under so much pressure. I felt the players had given a lot and my own playing career was over. It was also not knowing what was next. So when I got in the car all my emotion came out.”He is much more relaxed now. During a morning in which he runs a session with young men from the Laureus-supported Street League programme, which uses football to help people get back into employment and education, Giggs is impressive. As a Laureus academy member he is an engaging communicator – whether encouraging the men to stay true to themselves or answering their questions. When asked to name the best player he faced he helps the group feel as if they are in the tunnel next to an imposing Zinedine Zidane – and out on the pitch as he describes the Frenchman’s strength and balletic skills. But he always comes back to them and tries to boost their self-belief.Giggs explains that, after leaving United, he needed the help of a psychologist to restructure his life. “It helped fill the gaps of what I was going to do day-to-day. From leaving school, until 42, I’d done the same thing every day. So it was more the structure and preparing myself for life away from United – rather than any mental issues. It was trying to find something to help me get through the day, the week, the month, the year. If you’re finishing the same thing you’ve done for 25 years, it’s quite scary. But I soon realised there’s a life outside football, I had a good 18 months travelling, doing TV work, spending more time with the kids.”Until United were, in Solskjær’s words, given a “reality check” with their 2-0 home defeat by PSG in the Champions League this past week, there had been a resurgence at Old Trafford. After the moribund rule of Mourinho, surely part of Giggs must wish he could have been the former player to galvanise his old club? “No, not really. It might have been different if I wasn’t the Welsh coach. Ole’s done a fantastic job. I’ve obviously been in touch with him and he’s given players freedom and also done well tactically. The confidence is huge. He’s got smiles back on their faces.”This interview takes place before the game against PSG and Giggs does warn of “bumps in the road”. But when they played together, did Solskjær appear to have managerial potential? “Yeah, he did. He’s got that steely determination, because he’s been through a lot. When he was young he went to a different country. He had huge success but he was not always picked. He studied the game while he had a bad injury and then he coached at the club. So I always thought he had that potential because he knows the game and has that inner steel.”Does Giggs believe Solskjær should become United’s permanent manager? “I do. We’ve messed around far too long. When you’ve got someone who knows the club, who is tactically astute, clearly has the players and fans on board, that gives you lots of momentum. There will be bumps in the road but most fans imagine what he could do with the money that’s been spent the last few years.”It sounds as if Giggs would like Solskjær’s appointment to be made immediately? “I wouldn’t be in any rush because you don’t want to derail the current situation. Planning is more important than the announcement. Look at Guardiola. He got in Man City players he wanted the year before he took over. So, if it is Ole, keep it amongst the club and start planning. Our problem the past few years is that we were always playing catch-up. We should identify the two or three players we need if we’re going to win the Premier League and Champions League.”Giggs struggled, understandably, after being out of work so long. “I don’t think young coaches in the UK get enough chances. You’ve seen Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard do well but there was a cycle of the same people getting the same jobs. There is also the culture where, three months into the season, a manager is fired. How do you appoint a young coach, who’s not got any experience, to a struggling side? I understand but it’s like young players – you never know what they’re capable of until you give them the chance. I believe ex-players who have prepared themselves well should be given a chance.“When I went for the Swansea job it was difficult. I felt that everything went well but it was the manner of finding out – on Sky Sports – I hadn’t got the job. That’s not the way to treat people.“I did get disheartened because I was out for 18 months and the longer it goes on, the more you think you’re never going to get back in.The loneliness of management seems a distant problem now, particularly after a morning when Giggs was besieged with requests for selfies. “It’s still the same,” he says with a smile. “The only difference is, rather than the kids, it’s mums and dads asking for a selfie. The kids look at the photo and say: ‘Who’s this?’ or: ‘You used to play for United, right?’ I also get: ‘Did you play with Ronaldo? Do you know Rashford?’ I don’t mind. I’m a manager now.”In 2018 nearly 300,000 young people around the world benefited from 160 Laureus Sport for Good-supported programmes in 40 countries, working to end violence, discrimination and disadvantage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af304e4fda61da5224d722a389d80a1fc66ec601/322_33_3877_2326/master/3877.jpg?width=1900\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=424bde35087350cf6fabe1a98f81a384 1900w","title":"high rents alternative living arrangements","story":"With spiralling rents leaving many people with barely any disposable income, let alone the means to save towards a deposit, some are now choosing alternatives.Office administrator Tina Gotla-Aluri, 42, was struggling to cope with the £950 a month she was paying for her house share in Putney, south-west London, when a friend suggested Share and Care Homeshare, which matches older homeowners who have a spare room with people who can offer practical help in exchange. She now lives in Putney with a man in his 90s and pays £180 a month to the scheme.In return, Gotla-Aluri provides companionship, goes food shopping, and cooks meals. “He is quite well travelled and food is one of the things we have bonded over,” she says. “I cook British food like Sunday dinners and sometimes Indian or Moroccan food. It’s mutually beneficial.”She says the lower rent has made her less anxious about money. “It has given me breathing space. It was very stressful. I was only working to pay rent, and as an administrator I don’t make much. I hardly had anything left for food and travel. It was very depressing, but now I can go to the cinema and out with friends.”When Michael Hayne, 41, a delivery driver from Mansfield, split up with his wife after 10 years of marriage with two daughters, he sofa-surfed at various family members’ homes for about six months because he couldn’t afford to rent.“I worked out it was about £1,100 to get a house to rent plus bills,” he says. “I needed somewhere for the kids to stay and didn’t want a bedsit. I realised I wouldn’t have much money left after paying child maintenance and childcare costs.”He was inspired by reading about a couple who sold up and toured the world in a van. “I took out a loan and bought a Mercedes Sprinter van for £2,500 and spent weeks stripping it out and turning it into a home.” His van includes beds for when his daughters stay, a four-burner cooker and storage at the back for his bike.“I wanted a van because it’s cheaper than a camper van, which can cost upwards of £10,000, plus I like the style of a van. It’s a blank canvas that I can build myself. For example, I made a sleeping area for my girls, and I can change it around.”The cost of running the van, including vehicle tax and breakdown insurance but not petrol, sets him back about £70 a month.Hayne has lived in the van for a year and parks for free in country lanes and near industrial estates. He showers at a local gym. “The girls love it. They’ve been to Scotland, Whitby, Scarborough and the Norfolk coast. Not paying rent frees up the funds to do those things.”While some people house-sit for free to get a taste of luxury or a different life for a few weeks, designer Jennifer Hamley, 39, and her husband, Ben, 37, have turned it into a way to live rent-free.“We decided to try house-sitting after we came back from a year living in Bali,” says Hamley. “Rental prices had escalated and a friend suggested it. We run a business together from our laptops, and are used to being a little nomadic, so the idea suited us well.”The couple tend to stay in a property for at least three weeks, depending on what’s available. “Since we do this full time we tend to only apply for house-sits of three weeks or more. Running a business and moving around too much is way too stressful.”“It is a peace of mind for many homeowners. A homeowner doesn’t need to get anyone to check in on the house, and pet owners don’t have to pay kennels, catteries or dog walkers.”Sometimes there’s a signed agreement but mostly the exchange is done on trust. The duo try to line up consecutive house-sits but sometimes there are a few days’ gap, when they stay in a hotel, B\u0026ampB, Airbnb, or with friends.If Carl Francis, 27, was renting his one-bedroom flat in Barnet, north London, at market rates, he simply wouldn’t be able to afford it. But as a property  – a person who temporarily looks after an empty property that’s between uses in return for cheap rent – his rent comes to just £425 a month.“I didn’t want a cramped studio flat for £600,” he says. He found Dot Dot Dot, which provides affordable housing in buildings that range from flats and houses to churches and even disused fire stations. In return it asks s to volunteer for 16 hours a month with a charity of their choice.“I’m saving a hell of a lot more than if I was living on my own,” he says. The drawback is the property is set to be demolished. “Then I’ll be given 28 days’ notice. But I’ve been here for a year and it’s a really good way to live.”Patrick Smith, 62, the director of a vegan catering co-operative, lives with nine other people in a housing co-op in Nottingham, where he pays a fraction of the typical rent. Housing co-ops tend to be democratic organisations controlled by members, who set their own policies and decisions. In Smith’s co-op, the housemates have two meetings a month, discussing topics such as household issues, cleaning and checking in with others’ wellbeing.The household vies up chores, with each member spending 30 minutes a week cleaning a designated area. The tenants are the landlords and they set their own rent and take responsibility for the needs of the household.Each person has their own bedroom but shares communal areas such as lounge, bathrooms and kitchen, where every night a member cooks a group meal.“Rather than it just being about finances, everyone wants to engage in a sustainable cooperatively managed household.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

But any watering down or deregulation of existing standards could make the UK a magnet for cheap, substandard or counterfeit products, the ESF warns.Research by the charity last year found that one in three UK consumers – about 18 million people – had mistakenly bought a counterfeit electrical item online. Products with safety flaws ranged from large household appliances such as tumble dryers, to kettles, phones and chargers, travel adaptors, hair straighteners and Kodi boxes, which allow users to stream content from apps and on-demand services.Phil Buckle, the chief executive of the ESF, said: “No outcome from the ongoing EU-UK negotiations should be to the detriment of safety standards or consumer protection rights.“The risks posed by substandard and counterfeit electrical products are a very real threat to consumers’ safety. Electricity is responsible for more than half of accidental domestic fires in England and any weakening of such standards could see this figure rise in the future.“It is essential that enforcement bodies, which serve on the frontline in the fight against substandard and counterfeit electrical items, are adequately resourced to be as effective as possible as we depart from the European Union.”After Brexit, the UK will need to assume greater responsibility surrounding enforcement and checks of imports to assess compliance with new customs controls, the ESF says. To do so effectively, enforcement bodies, such as trading standards, must be adequately funded to take on this increase in responsibility.The most recent National Trading Standards Safety at Ports and Borders report identified 1.2m unsafe or non-compliant goods, which could have caused 500 fires, 1,000 major injuries and 2,000 minor injuries.

Now Brexit is threatening to split his party, and many of his MPs and party members feel frustrated by his lack of clarity over the party’s position on Europe. ’s political editor, Heather Stewart, talks to Anushka Asthana about Corbyn’s changing relationship with the EU, while Steve Howell, a former Corbyn adviser and author of Game Changer: Eight Weeks That Transformed British Politics, discusses how Corbyn arrived at his remain and reform position. Plus Alena Ivanova, a Momentum activist, argues that Corbyn’s only option is to listen to party members who want a second referendum.  And: In the year since the mass-shooting in Parkland, Florida, the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, have been steadily working to build a political movement. Lois Beckett has been following them.

This country is limping towards a chaotic exit. The strident voices of the far right shouting down any rational discussion. We have a PM who is incompetent and who has become an international embarrassment, an ineffectual leader of the opposition at odds with his membership and half his party and a media largely hell bent on driving us over the cliff. How has our once revered democracy morphed into this mess? DaivedoverEvery time that May makes a concession to the ERG they take a step back to reveal yet another demand and uncover more of the trap that has been there all along. She is like a weak, second-rate school teacher who is letting the louts in the back row of her class dominate and control all lessons. The ERG has a clear agenda of their own and that has nothing to do with what is best for the country or for the majority of people in the country. These are the arrogant and self-serving men who conned and coerced voters into taking back control and now expect that power to be given to them. Theresa May is incapable of spotting a wolf in wolf’s clothing. Why? John HewardYou get what you deserve. May has been trying to play to all sides of the argument. It cannot work. The hard right Tories will only accept a no strings deal. The more centrist Tories want to either remain or have a deal that to a certain extent, ties us to Europe. This is where Tories have existed for decades. Surely May didn’t really think that the two groups would unite over policies that either side could not agree to? She did not think to plan an exit before even triggering article 50. She should have spent a year in trying to find consensus instead of just applying her “my way or the byway” approach. Cameron is to blame for this fiasco, but May is guilty of completely mishandling the whole thing. morbileBrexit is bad enough, but the constitutional disaster that May and co are overseeing is worse. In the space of just over two months, her government has been found in contempt of parliament, and heavily lost votes on key items of government policy. Yet she maintains that nothing has changed, continues on her path unaltered with little or no admonition from the populist press or the public. Given the precedents she is setting - if a really competent leader ever got into power, imagine what havoc could be wreaked - as parliamentary scrutiny has effectively been shown to be, well, ineffective. dougmeyberryBetween the Malthouse fiasco and now the ERG abstaining on this vote (and handing May another authority sapping defeat) the PM needs to stop pretending that Rees-Mogg and his merry men will accept anything except a no-deal exit. The days are long gone where there was any point in pretending that she can somehow come to terms with them, except by a complete surrender to their position. If there are any solutions to this mess, it will be in found spite of the ERG, and pretending it can be part of any solution is delusional. CaligulaMcNuttMay’s premiership has delivered the very worst of all worlds. It has allowed the ERG to undermine her from the sidelines, given disproportionate levels of influence to the DUP, and allowed no-deal advocates like Davis and Raab to fritter away two years’ worth of negotiating time while supposedly acting as Brexit Secretary. On the evidence since 2017, May must now outstrip Cameron as our worst PM ever. Her almost unique combination of total inflexibility, weakness and insecurity leads to her appeasing the ERG and the hard Brexiteers in her own party while failing to realise that the ERG aren’t remotely interested in anything other than “no deal” WestonTigerSurely it’s time that even Theresa May acknowledges that the ERG are not acting in good faith? They’re advocating no deal because they know parliament will finally have too much sense to go down that route, leaving them free to proclaim their ideological purity and completely disassociate themselves from any problems that arise from Brexit. davidabsalomThe Tories have completely failed at every stage of this process, from calling a referendum on the issue in the first place to everything that has ensued as a result. Any PM with even a crumb of authority would have disciplined or expelled members of herhis party who vote against the interests of the nation. May clearly has no authority and, it is becoming clear, no respect for the good of the nation. Brexit must be paused of stopped altogether so we can bring in a government worthy of the name.

We need other videos saying here’s why those reasons aren’t real and here’s a bunch of ways you can research it for yourself.”But she conceded that some Flat Earthers may not be swayed by a scientists’ words. When the US astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson explained how small sections of large curved surfaces will always appear flat to the little creatures that crawl upon it, his message was seen by some Flat Earthers as patronising and dismissive, Landrum said.“There’s always going to be a small percentage of people who will reject anything that scientists put out there but maybe there’s a group in the middle that won’t,” she added. “The only tool we have to battle misinformation is to try and overwhelm it with better information.”Google did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afff07fa581b38e50919af7147a06094214b9e87/0_347_3744_2247/master/3744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b46389d34d882e5ddd46d6d1b319ab1","title":"radical beauty stunning portraits of people with downs syndrome","story":"A project by fine art and fashion photographers and models with Down’s syndrome is challenging concepts of beautyActor Sarah Gordy MBE stands on a pedestal, half-turned to face the camera. Her dress – red, sequinned, elaborate – spills and pools around her feet. Gordy’s expression, captured by fashion photographer Zuzia Zawada, is serene. The image is taken from forthcoming photography book Radical Beauty Project. Shot by leading fashion and art photographers, it’s a unique proposition: all of the models, Gordy included, have Down’s syndrome. But this isn’t some uplifting charity coffee-table tome: creative director Daniel Vais wants to make high art. Which means the images are provocative, unsettling and, at times, difficult. “I didn’t necessarily want crowd-pleasing images,” Vais explains. “Some people find that disturbing. They don’t want to empower people with Down’s syndrome. They don’t see them as powerful people. So they resist it.”Vais, an Israeli-born choreographer, didn’t mean for his collaborations with the Down’s syndrome community to become his life’s work: it just happened that way. In addition to Radical Beauty Project, Vais’s company of Down’s syndrome dancers, Culture Device, will be taking up a residency at the Royal Opera House next month, and Drag Syndrome, a spin-off featuring drag kings and queens, has plans for a world tour. The idea for Radical Beauty Project came to Vais as he was walking down the street one day. “I started to see images of people with Down’s syndrome modelling extraordinary clothes with extraordinary photographers. I saw the title of the book, and I went home and wrote it down.”It’s been a labour of love. Without a publishing deal, Vais has entirely self-funded the project. All the photographers worked for free. But with independence, comes freedom. “This is hardcore art,” he says. “It’s not charitable or cute. We don’t want to play that card. This is avante-garde art and fashion.” And Vais hopes to represent models from all over the world, including countries like Iran, where “the situation for people with Down’s syndrome is dire”. (He’s arranging for someone else to oversee the Iran shoot. Given his nationality, Vais can’t travel there safely.)As safer tests are introduced, the logic is inevitable: fewer children with Down’s syndrome will be born. Countries like Iceland have almost eradicated Down’s syndrome from its population, with only one or two children born with the condition each year. Vais fears for the future. “They’re endangered people,” he says. “We talk about them as if they shouldn’t exist in this world. It’s not right.”But it’s not all negative. “The new generation of people with Down’s syndrome has a lot going for it,” Vais says. He’s right: flick through the pages of Radical Beauty Project, and you’ll see writers and dancers, business owners and performers. It’s an uplifting testament to the energy and drive of people with Down’s syndrome and their determination to lead productive lives as full members of society."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1689ec1b281ecf96e54040858e588a02e6aeb24/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98e6819a9832a133c81f957a41c5c908","title":"uk athletics sprinters european indoor championships","story":"• Ojie Edoburun is sole pick for men’s 60m in a 48-strong team• Reigning champion Richard Kilty thought to be lodging appealThe UK Athletics performance director, Neil Black, has defended the bizarre policy that has led to only one British male sprinter being selected for the European Indoor Championships in Glasgow.On Sunday Black named a record-equalling 48-strong team for the event and backed Laura Muir to “do something special” when she goes for the 1500m and 3,000m double in front of her home fans. However, in the men’s 60m only Ojie Edoburun – who finished last in the British Indoor Championships final – has been picked, with several big names, including Reece Prescod and CJ Ujah, deciding not to run.That could have opened the door for Richard Kilty, the reigning European and former world 60m champion, who is recovering from serious injury and desperate to go for another title. But while European Athletics allows anyone who has run 6.78sec to compete, British Athletics decided to implement a far stricter selection requirement of 6.60sec – a time Kilty, who has run 6.63sec, is just outside.Strangely the 60m standard for men is far tougher than that for any other event – and would have won a medal during the last European Indoors – while the British Athletics women’s standard of 7.25sec would not even have made the final. Black, however, insisted there was nothing wrong with it. “We had a very clear policy which says the qualification mark is 6.60sec,” he said. “That’s been the men’s mark since 2013 for the European Indoors. It’s never been questioned in the past and it’s a standard that we’ve all been comfortable with.”When asked about Kilty’s frustrations at missing out, Black said they had to follow their own selection policy. “We can’t let emotions get involved in that process,” he added. It is understood that Kilty, who is ranked 11th in Europe, is appealing against the decision.Black also denied feeling any unease at filling only one slot in an event where Britain has farmed medals at previous European championships. “It’s certainly not embarrassment,” he said. “The whole policy is based around selecting everyone who is selectable, selecting a large team, giving as many people as possible the experience of a championships. It’s a large and competitive team, it includes five previous gold medallists and other previous medallists. It’s a great team. There’s just one thing that looks unusual.”Black also predicted that Laura Muir, who will be looking to retain her 1500m and 3,000m titles, would be one of the stars of the championships when they begin on 1 March. “We’ve all seen Laura evolve as an athlete and as a performer and as a person,” he said. “I am incredibly impressed with how she deals with the different circumstances she finds herself in. She has a brilliant team around her with her coach Andy Young sharing the responsibilities. I’m very confident she knows what she’s doing. She’s preparing seriously for this double-double and I think we’re really going to see something special. There’s the capacity for the whole country to stand still on that Sunday evening for the 1500m.”He added: “I see an athlete who has complete confidence that she has the ability to win global medals.”Elsewhere Adelle Tracey was handed the final 800m spot ahead of the Olympic finalist Lynsey Sharp, who has been out of form indoors this winter, while Andrew Pozzi will unexpectedly defend his 60m hurdles title despite picking up an injury over Christmas. “It’s brilliant that Andy is back,” said Black. “We didn’t think he would not be available because he asked whether he could be selected providing he demonstrated his fitness. If he does so, it will be fantastic for him to be there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bf724364c76d7845cb2aaa6b60b722c60ea40c9/0_802_2354_1412/master/2354.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40617fc3abf6799756e759d4f70fec36","title":"9 to 5 the musical review dolly parton savoy theatre london","story":"Savoy theatre, LondonThis beloved revenge fantasy is as subtle as a sledgehammer but its advocacy of workplace equality makes it hard to dislikeYou can’t escape the presence of Dolly Parton in this musical version of the 1980 movie in which she co-starred. Not only has she written all the songs but her name dominates the publicity and her prerecorded image tops and tails the production and even launches the final chorus. If the title hadn’t been bagged already, the musical might well be called Hello, Dolly!The show itself is unashamedly a period piece and about as subtle as a sledgehammer. The book by Patricia Resnick, who scripted the movie, retains the idea of three female office workers uniting to get their revenge on a monster boss. Many of the gags are of Carry On vintage. Judy, the newcomer pining for the husband who has deserted her, loudly declares: “I still miss Dick.” In a piece of dated shtick, the boss’s most loyal ally takes off her specs, lets down her hair and shows herself to be a lavishly corseted raver. The boss himself is a pantomime villain who, when strung up in his S\u0026ampM bedroom, announces: “I’m going nuts with my nuts in a truss.”Even the songs are full of contradiction. Doralee, the character originally played by Parton, complains in Backwoods Barbie that she is seen as a glamour puss while hardly dressing like Julie Andrews in The Sound of Music. The show is a piece of slick commercial packaging, but it still argues that equal pay, flexible hours and in-house daycare are not only vital targets but also make for better business.While the musical is a simplistic revenge fantasy, it is stylishly put across in Jeff Calhoun’s production. Caroline Sheen, as the office supervisor, sings and dances with great verve and she is well supported by Natalie McQueen as Doralee, Amber Davies as Judy and Bonnie Langford as the closeted sex queen. Given the unenviable task of playing the lecherous chief exec, Brian Conley invests the character with the right tongue-in-cheek excess.This may be mass-market feminism but, with its advocacy of workplace equality, I could not bring myself to dislike it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e21536fcf345b03029901709cee3a7fe690e8054/1312_0_3882_2330/master/3882.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb5f8c3340bfbd306cc226834bd221be","title":"vespertilio britain loneliest bat stage","story":"It has spent 16 winters on its own. Now a playwright has turned one bat’s sad story into a gay parable full of deceit and longingInspiration is often found in unexpected places and, last summer, Irish playwright Barry McStay discovered it while flicking through a  Long Read I wrote about a lonely bat. The true tale of Britain’s only greater mouse-eared bat, which spent 16 winters hibernating alone in a disused railway tunnel in Sussex, inspired McStay to write Vespertilio, a new play that opens this week in another disused railway tunnel, this one beneath Waterloo station in London.Vespertilio begins with a devoted conservationist guarding this rare bat. But what follows is fiction: a young homeless runaway, Josh, seeks shelter in the tunnel, and meets Alan, the middle-aged bat-lover. So begins a fraught relationship between two very different men. Through the poignant symbol of the lone bat, McStay’s two-hander explores loneliness within the gay community, as a story of love, deceit and possibly redemption unfolds in the tunnel.The bat’s story, says McStay, “just made me really interested in something I didn’t think I’d be interested in. Why do we keep watching stories about two people falling in love? There has to be a new way of telling the story. This seemed like just another brilliant way of telling a very old story.”He thought it would be ideal for the Vault festival, which is held each year in arches and tunnels beneath Waterloo station, and found director Lucy Jane Atkinson particularly enthusiastic. “I’ve always been a bat nerd,” she says, “and it just sung to me.” When Atkinson was six, rangers on a camping holiday taught her a pro-bat song: “Bats eat bugs  They don’t eat people.” Her song has flitted into the show.Atkinson and McStay cast Benedict Salter as bat-obsessed Alan, who lives alone and devotes his life to protecting the creature. Salter cried when he first read Alan’s lecture about the lonely bat. “There’s a line – ‘Chances are he will spend the rest of his life alone’ – and that’s upsetting.”His character Alan “believes he’s one of a kind, meant to be alone and doesn’t deserve love. To go on a journey with him, where he discovers he might have something to offer – as an actor, you want to repeat that night after night. I’m gay myself and seeing him struggle with his identity made me quite protective of him.”Joshua Oakes-Rogers was so keen to get the part of 20-year-old charming, mercurial runaway Josh that he learned the whole of McStay’s play before his first audition. “I had a thing for bats,” he says. “If we ever went to a zoo, my mum would find me just standing in the dark room watching them all hung above.” Oakes-Rogers is particularly taken with Vespertilio’s torchlit tunnel stage, with seats arranged along both sides. “It’s so dank, I love it!” he says. Cast and audience can hear trains rumbling overhead.McStay and producer Jess Duxbury have consulted regularly with Joe Nunez-Mino of the Bat Conservation Trust. “He’s seen all drafts,” says Duxbury. “He’s sent us information and everyone at BCT has been so generous. One of my favourite facts that came up when I first chatted to Joe is that he read the play and went, ‘You know the weird thing is that bats have one of the highest rates of homosexuality in any mammal.’”“Yes!” exclaim Salter and Oakes-Rogers together. “Of course they do, they have capes!” adds Oakes-Rogers. “They’ve got drama, they’ve got height, they’ve got momentum, they are the gayest thing in the world,” laughs Salter.While interviewing the cast, I realise I don’t actually know if the greater mouse-eared bat has been spotted again this winter. The Vespertilio cast don’t know, either. “Don’t tell me until after the show,” says Joshua. “If he hasn’t, I’ll be too busy mourning.”“He’s alive,” says Ben. “I can feel it.”I email to check. Good news: Britain’s most solitary animal has once again taken up residence in his Sussex tunnel for his 17th winter. The audiences for Vespertilio can rest assured.

I washed up there, a university dropout, to be assistant cook in the bird observatory. It’s the island I know and love best, and it’s where the character DI Jimmy Perez in my Shetland series of murder mysteries was born. It’s also where the BBC filmed part of the adaptation of my book Blue Lightning for the series, and on this walk, you’ll glimpse many of the background scenes.Most visitors stay at the Bird Observatory \u0026amp Guesthouse near the north end of the island. The accommodation is quite grand now: all the rooms are en suite and there’s a bar. The staff census the birds on the island and although everyone is welcome, this is a working place and many of the guests are amateur ornithologists.The island is about three miles long and a mile-and-a-half wide, but it’s hilly and there are inlets, known as geos, in the cliffs, so it would be a stretch to walk all the way round in one go. A stroll from the observatory takes you across the track to the promontory of Buness. From here, watch the arrival of the mail boat, the Good Shepherd, and meet the islanders who turn out to unload it. In late spring and summer, it’s a great place to spot the puffins that nest close to the cliff edge. Retrace your steps and follow the road south until you come to the drystone wall, the dyke, which cuts across the low land to the east. This marshy area is called Gilsetter, and in the summer it’s covered in wildflowers. Either continue south along the footpath, or head further east towards the sea and Sheep Rock, which provides the distinctive profile of the Isle.If you rejoin the track further south, you’ll come to the more densely inhabited part of the island. The crofts, where most islanders live, are here, with the shop, the kirk and the small museum.The road splits close to the school so it’s possible to do a circular walk, either by going all the way to the south harbour or by cutting across the footpath past the museum. If you go south, take a look at the small graveyard, next to the shore. It’s a fascinating record of island history.Heading back to the observatory, you’ll see Malcolm’s Head to the west. From the top, the south of the island is spread beneath you and there’s a view north towards Ward Hill and the stunning cliffs that are home to Fair Isle’s gannets. If you venture on to the hill in the breeding season, beware of the “bonxies” (the great skuas) that protect their young by e- bombing intruders.Fair Isle is a magical place for the photographer and natural historian. But it’s the people who make it so special. So, if you visit, do make an effort to get to know them – go along to island events, use the shop, visit the museum. You might meet the original Jimmy Perez. AC• Wild Fire, by Ann Cleeves, the last in the Shetland series, is published by Pan. Series five of Shetland is on BBC One at 9pm on Tuesdays“Please don’t say it like that,” I implored my walking companion, Rob, as we headed into the small market town of Dolgellau in Gwynedd.We were stocking up on snacks before a hike, and he insisted on calling it “Dolly-gelloo” (it should be Dol-geth-lie).“You’ll get us into all kinds of trouble,” I sighed, as I ushered him out of the grocery store to the start of our trail.Trouble, of the fictional kind anyway, is something that has become synonymous with this place of late, since it appeared as the fictional Welsh village of Penllynith in the BBC thriller Requiem, about a missing girl and a woman called Matilda trying to find the truth about what happened to her.The producers are said to have selected this location because of the mysticism of the rugged Welsh landscape, and you don’t get more mystical than the full day’s stroll up to the peak of Cadair Idris that looms above it. This is where we were headed, a place full of tales of ghouls and spectres: it’s said to be the “Chair of Idris”, the giant who sits in the cwm (hollow) below the summit, watching the stars, as well as the hunting ground for Gwyn ap Nudd (the Lord of the Underworld), and home to a monster in the “bottomless” lake of Llyn y Gadair.We followed a network of connecting footpaths to the base of the summit trail at the Gwernan Lake Hotel. From here we headed uphill, first through woodland where the trees bent over the path in perfect fairytale formation. Then out onto the hillside, following the contours up to the famed lake.We spent the next couple of hours climbing further still, gawping at otherworldly views as we wove through jagged rocks on a boot-beaten path. On reaching the top I turned to Rob and said: “You know, if you spend a night on the summit you are supposed to either become a poet or go mad …”“No need,” replied Rob, smiling. “There was a young woman from Venus…”Where was Gwyn ap Nudd when you needed him?On the way back to town, we stopped on the cliff edges that surrounded the water. Rocks lined the slopes, where they had stopped mid-tumble while spilling into it like granulated sugar. It reminded me of a dramatic scene in the TV show, where the voiceover tells us that this area is “not like anywhere else”. Peering down at this massive amphitheatre of rock, we were inclined to finally agree. The names of the places may sound make-believe, and Requiem is a work of fiction, but the walk from Dolgellau to Cadair Idris is, in real life, better than anything you could ever imagine. PSStartend The Hedges Hotel, near BallymoneyDistance ½ mileTime As long as you likeThere was a time when the Giant’s Causeway was the most famous site in Northern Ireland, but thanks to George RR Martin’s Game of Thrones the whole country is now a TV lover’s playground, from the coast at Ballycastle to the quarry at Magheramorne, which appears as The Wall in earlier seasons, but is said to be Winterfell in the forthcoming finale. The easiest and most atmospheric walk runs under the Dark Hedges – the King’s Road in the books, where trees almost 250 years old form a tunnel over the narrow lane, creating a passageway – particularly from the south. There’s parking (for a charge) in the hotel. Avoid the crowds by going at first light, or late thing in the day, when you may spot the apparition of the grey lady. Now there’s another series just waiting to be made … PSIt may have provided the setting for the film in which Daniel Day Lewis made his final scenes before retiring from the film business, but the village of Robin Hood’s Bay – and the North Yorkshire coast beyond – are by no means approaching a curtain call. Head first for the Victoria Hotel, whose restaurant is the location in which fashion designer Reynolds Woodcock first meets waitress Alma in Phantom Thread.Then head out, like they do, to stroll south, first along the wild stretch of sand below the cliffs (keep an eye out for ammonite fossils amid the “scars”, or cliffs). At the seaside village of Ravenscar, climb up to the Cleveland Way to walk back, while gazing down on the coast, following in the footsteps of both dinosaurs and cinematic legends. PSIf you’d passed through this Wye Valley enclave last year, you probably wouldn’t have stopped even for a five-minute stroll. Now, however, after the village provided the backdrop to the Netflix hit Sex Education, set in a secondary school and starring Gillian Anderson, fans often linger at the start of this walk to see the shop that features in it.Do the same – taking time to say hello to Roger and Ruth who own the store – but then follow the circular Wordsworth Walk to dig deeper into this borderland village, which served as muse for a more romantic type of script penned by the poet more usually linked with the Lake District. It takes in churches, an old railway line, a meander by the River Wye and a seat on the Bread and Cheese Stones, where it’s thought Wordsworth sat and was inspired to put pen to paper. PSFinding hidden treasure formed the basis for this comedy starring, written and directed by Mackenzie Crook, but the countryside in which the Detectorists follow their passion is easily discovered without a metal detector in sight.Framlingham, eastern Suffolk, doubles for the fictional Essex town of Danebury. Start at the church meeting rooms opposite the town’s Norman castle, where Andy (Crook’s character) heads for meetings of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club. Then follow the waymarked Brownsord Way trail on your own hunt through time, via wildflower meadows, a mere dug in the 12th-century that’s home to otters, and Pepper’s Wash, a ford known to be home to Roman remains.End with a well-earned drink at Framlingham’s Castle Inn, whose exterior fans may recognise as the programme’s Two Brewers pub.

Warren and Klobuchar join senators Kirsten Gillibrand (New York), Kamala Harris (California) and Cory Booker (New Jersey), as well as Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg, former San Antonio mayor Julián Castro and former Maryland congressman John Delaney.Nearly all have touted their progressive bona fides in the hopes of appealing to an energized base. That, some operatives say, has left the “centrist” lane open, at a time when the party must win back working-class and independent voters who chose Trump in 2016.At the same time, some argue that debate over the Democrats’ supposed “lurch to the left”, as relentlessly highlighted by the president, is an oversimplification that overlooks the Democratic electorate’s desire to limit Trump to one term.“The challenge for Democrats will be to have a substantive, even heated debate over progressive policy while still reminding voters that re-electing Trump would be a catastrophe,” said Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for Barack Obama whose podcast, The Wilderness, examined the rebuilding of the party after 2016.“Democratic candidates should debate each other but they shouldn’t disqualify each other,” he said.It’s all a far cry from the 2016 primary, when the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders mounted an unexpectedly tough challenge to Hillary Clinton, from the left and with lasting consequences.Sanders pushed Clinton on issues including climate change, trade, Wall Street reform and college affordability. As he did so, he strengthened the progressive wing of the party.Most 2020 candidates have offered progressive platforms. Warren, Gillibrand, Harris and Booker have signed on to Medicare for All, the single-payer healthcare proposal drafted by Sanders. Warren and Gillibrand have called for abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the agency at the heart of Trump’s hardline agenda. Harris has said its role must be reformed.Many of the contenders have pushed a variation of debt-free college tuition and Warren, Gillibrand, Booker and Harris have embraced the Green New Deal championed by rising star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.In a sign of the potential rifts to come, Klobuchar said proposals such as the Green New Deal and Medicare for All were “aspirational”.Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who was chief economics adviser to vice-president Joe Biden, said Democrats were broadly aligned on principles but differed on how to pursue them.“There’s going to be a lot of Democrats on the stage when the primaries begin,” he said, “but I don’t think there’ll be nearly as much distance between them as people think.”Differences, he said, would likely amount to one candidate campaigning on a subsidized jobs program tailored to a marginal group versus another advocating for a guaranteed jobs program affecting millions of people.“They’re all trying to solve the same problems,” he said. “Excessive levels of wealth concentration, money in politics, climate, affordable access to higher education. The question is how far does each of them want to push in terms of solutions to those problems.”Biden has been mulling a third run for president and would be the most establishment-friendly figure if he did jump in. He leads several early polls, bolstered in part by name recognition and Obama’s legacy.Other potential contenders include Sanders, who would seek to recapture the grassroots energy of 2016, and Beto O’Rourke, the former congressman whose unsuccessful Senate bid in Texas earned national attention. The Ohio senator Sherrod Brown, another favorite of progressives, staged a listening tour in key states and is expected to mount a bid.Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, expressed frustration that debate in the party was “frozen in time”, in 2016, and thereby ignoring victories in the 2018 midterms.“The electorate is liberal but more practical than the discussion seems to belie,” she said. “I think subconsciously they will think about electability and who can assemble the biggest coalition to take on Trump.”Tanden also warned of potential blowback from pressure to adopt striking positions, stating: “In 2018, there was not a single candidate in a swing district who embraced abolishing Ice. People talked about reforming Ice.”Republicans have sought to cast the Democrats’ agenda as “socialist”, zeroing in on healthcare and tax proposals that poll better than the GOP seems to think.Trump previewed a likely 2020 attack line in his state of the union address, declaring: “Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country.”“Tonight,” he said, “we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.”But even as roughly half of voters appear to be skeptical of a “socialist” candidate, the country’s definition of socialism has evolved towards a concept of equality, calling into question whether it is still an effective scare word.Favreau said he did not believe most voters would impose a “litmus test” on most issues. But he cautioned any candidates who might be inclined to play it safe.“I do think Democrats are looking for candidates who are willing to propose solutions that are commensurate with the magnitude of the challenges we’re facing,” he said. “Saving the planet and guaranteeing universal healthcare will require more than a few new tax credits and regulations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1771fd8c46a26a4b3bf9b300cc32aa27c8ff5fd4/0_220_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5ef055d39aed79a2e45b2e223fc4554","title":"arab world first female interior minister hails point of pride for women raya al hassan","story":"Raya al-Hassan is one of four women taking cabinet jobs in new Lebanese governmentThe Arab world’s first female interior minister has hailed her appointment as a “point of pride for all women”.Raya al-Hassan is one of four women to take cabinet jobs in the new Lebanese government, a record for the country and three more than in the last government, in which even the minister for women was a man.“There are a lot of female interior and defence ministers in the world and they have proved their efficiency,” Hassan said. “It might be a new phenomenon for Lebanon and Arab countries, but hopefully it will be repeated and not be unique.”The three other women in the 30-strong cabinet are in charge of energy, administrative development and the economic empowerment of women and young people.Though Lebanon is widely held to be liberal by regional standards, with women playing a prominent role in public life, some of its laws continue to uphold a patriarchal social code.Much Lebanese civil law, including personal matters such as marriage, orce and inheritance, is applied according to religious sect and in some cases treats women differently to men.“You can’t keep up with the international community and say you have a civilised state when all the world is working on gender equality and Lebanon is still living with the old male patriarchal mind,” said May Chidiac, the new administrative development minister.Lebanese politics continues to revolve around men. The complex sectarian power-sharing system has helped entrench former warlords and the scions of political dynasties – all male – who dominate the government and the parliament.“Lebanon is a male-dominated society and though women reached very important positions, when we talk about politics, especially parliament and government, their presence was modest,” said the women and youth minister, Violette Safadi.“I think we broke this barrier.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ee290be57b30b975bbe42451704985ef0badd87/1_283_957_574/master/957.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c466ee6fcf3906e3194505771d691f04","title":"flybmi tells customers to seek refunds from credit card companies","story":"Sister group Loganair to take over some routes as thousands remain out-of-pocketFlybmi is advising customers to seek refunds from credit and debit card companies or rebook with other airlines after the company collapsed late on Saturday, leading to the cancellation of thousands of journeys.On Sunday night, it emerged that Flybmi’s Glasgow-based sister company Loganair, which flies to the Scottish Highlands and Islands as well as to a small number of destinations in England, Ireland and Scandinavia, was poised to step in and take over five of Flybmi’s routes from next month.Loganair said it was in a “strong financial position” and would be flying from Aberdeen to Bristol, Oslo and Esbjerg, as well as from Newcastle to Brussels and to Stavanger in Norway. It was also “evaluating Flybmi’s wider network”.Jonathan Hinkles, Loganair’s managing director, said: “It’s always really sad to see an airline go out of business, and our thoughts are with all those affected – particularly staff members. We are evaluating Flybmi’s wider network and assessing routes which align with Loganair’s distinct geographical area and overall strategic plans. We are also working on employment opportunities for pilots, cabin crew and engineering support staff to strengthen the Loganair team.”Thousands of passengers have been left out-of-pocket after Flybmi, which operated more than 600 flights a week from regional airports including Bristol, Newcastle, Aberdeen and East Midlands, said it was calling in administrators.Some passengers are able to rebook via partner airlines Lufthansa, Brussels Airlines, Turkish Airlines, Loganair, Air France and Air Dolomiti, who have “shared ticket” flights with Flybmi.Ryanair said it was offering special cheap “rescue fares” between Belfast and London Stansted and to Milan Bergamo and Nuremberg to help stranded travellers. EasyJet said it was offering a special £80 deal for stranded passengers wanting to fly between Bristol and Paris Charles de Gaulle airport. Flybmi said its trading and future prospects had been “seriously affected by the uncertainty created by the Brexit process”. Spikes in fuel prices and a rise in carbon costs resulting from the EU’s recent decision to exclude UK airlines from full participation in the Emissions Trading Scheme had also contributed to its demise.Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, the industry association that represents 13 UK carriers, said: “Today’s announcement demonstrates once again the ferociously competitive environment airlines currently operate in. It should give government – and other parts of the industry who relentlessly champion passenger growth but too frequently neglect the challenges carriers face – pause for thought.”Regional carriers have been particularly vulnerable to increased costs because their small planes and less popular destinations mean costs per seat are already higher than bigger rivals.Exeter-based Flybe put itself up for sale in November and has warned shareholders it will have to be wound up if they do not back a sale to a Virgin Atlantic-led consortium.John Strickland at JLS Consulting said Brexit had piled on the pressure for UK operators partly because such airlines were less able to fund the cost of securing separate licences to operate in both the UK and Europe – rather than one for both.He said Flybmi was also likely to have suffered as it had a large number of business travellers and struck special deals with business customers such as Airbus, for which it was shuttling staff between Toulouse and Bristol.“Maybe some clients, with all the uncertainty around about Brexit will have been unwilling to extend or renew contracts,” Strickland said.Flybmi, which employs 376 staff and has a fleet of 17 aircraft covering 25 European cities, told aircrew not to turn up for work. Affected passengers were told not to go to the airport unless they had rebooked flights with alternative providers. Flybmi said it was not able to buy or rearrange journeys for its customers.Hundreds of passengers expressed dismay on social media at the sudden demise of an airline that was urging people to book flights via Twitter up until the day before its collapse.Hannah Price, 23, was concerned she would not be able to recoup £550 spent on five flights to Brussels where she travels frequently on business.Her flight was a shared ticket with Brussels Airline and that company has arranged for her to fly back to Bristol via Amsterdam on Monday, but her journey time will now be seven hours rather than two. “It’s good news that I am getting back to Bristol but it’s still frustrating,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d90d52f05c7dd7f85d7bcb932ece90cc9460f50f/0_0_4236_2542/master/4236.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f2b6a251c30d5ba8c150c03dfa9de84","title":"india reprisals against pakistan kashmir bombing","story":"Government places tariff on imports while revenge attacks against Kashmiris have been reportedIndia has announced reprisals against Pakistan for a suicide bombing that killed at least 40 paramilitaries in the disputed region of Kashmir.A car laden with explosives driven by a member of the Pakistan-based militant group, Jaish-e-Mohammed, is believed to have been responsible for the deadliest attack in the history of Kashmir’s 30-year insurgency on Thursday.Ceremonies have been held in the capital, Delhi, and across the country to farewell the dead as public anger continues to boil. “The fire that is raging in your hearts, is in my heart too,” the prime minister, Narendra Modi, told an audience in Bihar state on Sunday.India’s home ministry has also directed police to protect Kashmiris studying or working in states across India following reports of revenge attacks including attempts to storm a female students’ hostel in the northern city of Dehradun.Authorities cut mobile internet in Kashmir and roads and markets were deserted on Sunday as residents observed a general strike to protest the vigilante violence.Soldiers and paramilitaries stationed in the region were on high alert and a new protocol was in force banning civilian cars from driving near convoys of security personnel.In Jammu, the region adjacent to Kashmir, several thousand people have been stranded for the past four days and been placed in a relief camp. A curfew has been established in the area after arson attacks on Kashmiri homes. Mohammad Akram, a volunteer at a relief camp in Jammu, said more than 3,000 Kashmiri Muslims were being provided shelter and food.“More people who were stranded at hotels are coming and some are leaving for Kashmir during the night,” he told the .At a cricket club in Mumbai, a portrait of Pakistan’s prime minister Imran Khan – one of several pictures of cricketers hanging in the premises – was covered “as a mark of protest”, the club president told India’s Press Trust International.Thursday’s bombing has raised tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours to their highest point since the September 2016 attack by Jaish-e-Mohammed on an army camp in Uri, a town near Kashmir’s ceasefire border.That incident killed 19 people and led India to announce it had sent army teams into Pakistani-held territory to destroy militant camps, an operation labelled the “surgical strikes” and celebrated in a blockbuster film released this year.Modi has promised to avenge the suicide attack and says his security forces have been given full freedom to respond. But despite the strong rhetoric, India’s options are limited, said Paul Staniland, an associate professor in political science at the University of Chicago.Sending troops deep into Pakistani-held territory would risk escalating a conflict where nuclear weapons have been in play on both sides since 1998, as well exposing Indian soldiers to capture or warplanes to being shot down.More likely, he said, was a similar small-scale attack along the lines of the 2016 surgical strikes, but this time accompanied something like a precision-guided munition attack.“It moves slightly beyond the response to Uri and lets Modi say he’s not just doing the exact same thing again, but doesn’t open the door to hard-to-predict escalation dynamics,” Staniland said.But such an attack would be unlikely dissuade Pakistan from continuing to allow armed groups to operate on its territory, he added. “India might need to really move up the escalation ladder to impose costs, but that in turn creates bigger risks that Indian governments thus far have decided were ultimately not worth it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53172c65804a01e8cc8d33f2a7cb332c00697ecc/0_127_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d49b5551d1534885f8414f33501dde1e","title":"iran foreign minister says public losing faith in nuclear deal","story":"Javad Zarif urges EU to defend agreement and accuses Israel of seeking war with IranThe Iranian public are on the brink of abandoning faith in the nuclear deal signed with Europe and other world powers in 2015, putting pressure on the regime to pull out of the deal, Iran’s foreign minister has said.Speaking at the Munich security conference, Javad Zarif also accused Israel of seeking war with Iran and said Europe needed to be prepared to “get wet if it wants to swim against the dangerous tide of US unilateralism”.He said Europe had made all the right statements on the nuclear deal “but it has not been prepared to make the investments, pay the price”.Zarif said Iran had “long been the target of an unhealthy fixation, let’s say obsession” from the US. The US vice-president, Mike Pence, had “arrogantly demanded that Europe must join the United States in undermining its own security and breaking its obligations” over the nuclear deal.He also warned of increased tensions with Israel, which carried out a series of airstrikes last month against what it said were facilities belonging to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards’ al-Quds force in Syria.“Certainly, some people are looking for war ... Israel,” Zarif said. “The risk is great and the risk will be even greater if you continue to turn a blind eye to severe violations of international law.” Zarif defended Iran’s role in Syria, which he said was at the request of the Syrian government, and said it intended to stay in the country as long as it was asked to do so.Zarif also addressed claims by the Netherlands, France and Denmark that Tehran has been mounting attacks in Europe over the past year.The Dutch government alleges that Iran organised two assassinations of Dutch-Iranian activists in 2015 and 2017. Denmark has said it stopped a Tehran-led plot to kill an Arab-Iranian opposition figure on its soil last year. France charged Iran with an attack on a rally of an exiled Iranian dissident group near Paris in 2018. Iran denies any involvement in the plots.“It could be a false flag operation, entrapment, rogue operation, but it is not the work of a government that you should call crazy if we did it.”Zarif’s underlying message was that Europe needed to do more to protect the Iranian reformers in Tehran from public pressure to abandon the deal as a mirage bringing no benefit.The EU has announced a mechanism designed to encourage trade in humanitarian goods such as food and medicines but it is unlikely to boost European-Iranian trade, which is often seen by Iran as the quid pro quo for cooperating over its nuclear programme.Zarif also rejected claims that Iran was in breach of UN resolutions by developing a missile programme for defensive purposes. France has led the calls that Europe may feel forced to impose sanctions if the programme is not halted.Zarif said: “We do not design any of our missiles to carry nuclear weapons. We do not have any nuclear weapons. Inside Iran some were still recovering from the use of chemical weapons by Saddam Hussein supplied by Europe.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbb9e34fb343adf4b0153176ecc951ed3faf913e/0_117_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e415c131b167cbf3ecca3e8a4168d5c9","title":"how do trees survive in winter","story":"Some shed their leaves others rely on antifreeze in their veins (or pine needles) to survive the colder months. But trees couldn’t survive winter without the special relationship they have with birdsAside from the music of the westerlies playing through those skeletal canopies, British woods, when stripped of their leaves, tend to have an atmosphere of expectant quietude. Winter is a time of frugality, and the two major tree types, deciduous and evergreen, adopt very different strategies to cope with the double challenge of little sunlight and low temperatures.A deciduous tree operates by shedding all its leaves. This means that it lacks the means to photosynthesise and, thus, to generate fresh energy for five to six months of the year. However, there’s an upside to losing foliage, because it has ended the loss of moisture that occurs through leaves.This endless recycling of water from the trees to the atmosphere, known as transpiration, is costly. A single large mature oak may possess up to 200,000 leaves, and lose as much as 150,000 litres of water over the course of a year. A summer wood in full foliage conceals thousands of rising columns of tree-borne moisture, which is why it often feels so warm and humid within woods, when the surrounding countryside can be cool and breezy.Conifer trees reduce the stress of water loss by possessing fine needle-like leaves with minimum surface area and thick, waxy water-retaining cuticles. The adaptations slow down the process of transpiration. While the structure of evergreen foliage doesn’t have the energy-producing efficiency of a flat plate-like deciduous leaf, the fact that conifers can continue to photosynthesise year-round compensates for this. Some pines even have antifreeze in their needles, to enable them to work in icy conditions.The dormancy of winter trees means that this is the best time for planting or transferring them around our gardens. Choose a warm winter’s day so the earth is soft, dig a hole deep enough so the soil fully protects the roots from frost, then water well once planted. Observing how that new tree slowly grows and flourishes is one of the most satisfying processes in gardening.Trees also make use of the winter to do some self-propagation of their own. Much of the work for this process begins in the autumn, with the production of seeds and fruit. British oaks are a perfect example. From September onwards they leave a great larder of sugar- and protein-rich food for hungry birds or mammals, in the form of acorns. Squirrels, rodents and several species of crow store these nuts away to consume during the colder months. Yet, no species has more of a capacity to plan ahead than the creature that William Henry Hudson called the “British bird of paradise”: the European jay.In late autumn, this glorious pink-and-blue bird can be seen making repeat journeys to and from acorn-producing oak trees. The jay then buries them, sometimes flying several miles from the original source tree. Over the course of autumn, the average bird hides about 5,000 acorns. Across Britain and Ireland, the entire jay population stores somewhere in the region of 1.7bn acorns.The birds possess extraordinary memories for where they have hidden their stores, and yet – here is the clever part – they can’t remember them all. Not only do those forgotten acorns stand a strong chance of growing into oak saplings the following spring, but jays show a preference for open ground between tree cover in their choice of burial sites. In other words, they plant their acorns precisely where they might grow best.This acorn storage system thus benefits the jay twice over. Not only does it provide itself with food for the winter, but by forgetting some of its larder it also creates fresh habitat for future generations of jays. These birds are truly s of our oak woods. But it works both ways: by taking care of the birds, the trees ensure they prosper themselves.The dispersal of seed is, in fact, a major part of the woodland scene in winter. Hawthorn, holly, yew, mountain ash, crab apple, blackthorn and sea buckthorn – not to forget woodland shrubs, such as mistletoe and ivy, or garden favourites including cotoneaster and pyracantha – all produce fruit that birds love.Thrushes are especially drawn to these trees and consume vast quantities of their fruits. In return for this generosity, the thrushes then fly to their roosts in some hedge or tall tree at dusk and do what comes naturally. They poop out seeds during the night and leave each one in its own little store of fertiliser.So woods and birds are truly partners in reproduction. You can see how they interact on any winter’s day and in any wood, from John O’Groats to Land’s End, and from the mountain tops to the seashore. Because we legally “own” it, people like to imagine that they control the land, but the British woodlands have ways of shaping their own destinies.Yorkshire Tea and treesYorkshire Tea is planting a million trees over five years – with a bit of help from the Woodland Trust, UK schoolchildren and Kenyan tea farmers.

There’s an unseen network to forests in which trees send signals to each other and form part of a ‘wood wide web’Despite appearances, trees are social beings. For a start, they talk to each other. They’re also sensing, co-operating and collaborating, even across species boundaries. Peter Wohlleben, the German forester-turned-tree-whisperer and author of The Hidden Life of Trees, also says they are suckling their young, that juveniles are learning, and that some elders are sacrificing themselves for the sake of the next generation.While Wohlleben’s view is a step too far towards anthropomorphism for some scientists, the traditional view of trees as isolated, non-sensory beings has been shifting for some time. For example, the phenomenon known as “crown shyness”, in which similarly-sized trees of the same species appear to be respecting each other’s space was recognised almost a century ago. Sometimes, instead of interlacing and jostling for light, the branches of immediate neighbours stop short of one another, leaving a polite gap. There’s still no consensus on how this is managed – abrasion of growing branch tips is one possibility, another is that growth is inhibited when leaves sense infrared light scattered by other leaves close by.Much of the current research on this so called “wood wide web” stems from the work of the Canadian biologist Suzanne Simard. Simard describes the largest inidual trees in a forest as hubs or “mother trees”. Mothers have the deepest, most extensive roots, and are able to supplement smaller trees with water and nutrients, allowing saplings to thrive even in heavy shade. Further experiments suggest that iniduals are able to recognise close relatives and favour them when it comes to transferring the good stuff. Thus healthy iniduals can support damaged neighbours, even leafless stumps, keeping them alive for years, decades, even centuries. This connectivity and collaboration makes much more sense when you realise that the dependent trees may not be random strangers, but old friends, or more persuasive still, close relatives.The discernment shown by trees extends to their enemies as well as allies. Scientists have known for more than 40 years that if a tree is attacked by a leaf-eating animal, it releases ethylene gas. On detecting the ethylene, nearby trees prepare to repel boarders – boosting production of chemicals that make their leaves unpalatable, even toxic. The strategy was first discovered in a study of acacias, and it seems giraffes understood it long before humans: having finished browsing one tree, they habitually move more than 50 metres in an upwind direction before starting on another that is less likely to have sensed the emergency.More recently, however, it’s become clear that not all enemies trigger the same response. When elm and pine trees (and probably others) are first attacked by caterpillars, they respond within seconds to distinctive chemicals in caterpillar saliva, releasing an additional scent that attracts specific varieties of parasitic wasp. The wasps lay eggs in or on the bodies of the caterpillars, and then the emerging wasp grubs devour their host from the inside. If the damage to leaves and branches is caused by something for which the tree has no means of counterattack – such as the wind or cutting with an axe – the chemical response is focused on healing rather than defence.A sobering aspect of recent revelations is that many of these newly recognised “behaviours” are limited to natural growth. In plantations, there are no mother trees, and there is very little connectivity. This is partly because of the way young trees are transplanted and partly because when they are thinned to prevent competition, what little underground connectivity neighbours have established is severed. Seen in this light, modern forestry practices begin to seem almost monstrous: plantations are not communities but crowds of mute, factory-farmed iniduals, felled before they have ever really lived. None of the scientists involved are seriously suggesting trees have feelings, or that the newly discovered sociability of trees is driven by anything other than natural selection. The transactions being observed may be utilitarian rather than altruistic, they might be accidental. Nevertheless, the result is that in supporting each other, trees build sheltered, humid microcosms in which they and their future offspring will stand the best chance of surviving and reproducing. We know these places as forests. The trees, if they “know” anything, know them as home."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3797239.1550438325!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"arts graduates earn least while teachers earn most survey finds","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNine months after graduating,  those whose studied education and teaching have the highest reported average salaries, at €38,701.

The lowest reported average salaries were in the arts and humanities field at €24,728.Employment outcomes are also best for education graduates, with 93 per cent working or about to start a job. This is followed by health and welfare (87 per cent), ICT (82 per cent ) and engineering (82 per cent). Arts and humanities graduates (63 per cent) were the least likely to be working or about to start a job.However, these graduates had among the highest percentages going on to do further study (24 per cent).Further educationOverall, the Higher Education Authority report shows that nine months after graduating the vast majority of graduates (78 per cent) were working.The remainder were in further education or training (14 per cent), seeking work (5 per cent) or engaged in other activities, such as travel (4 per cent).The strength of the growing economy is reflected in the fact that 90 per cent of those who graduated found employment within Ireland.Paul O’Toole, chief executive of the Higher Education Authority, said it is clear there is a demand in Ireland for high-quality graduates coming out from our higher education institutions.Mean starting salary for graduates working full time was €33,574, with most honours-degree graduates on a salary somewhere between €20,000 and €35,000.Those with master’s degrees had average starting salaries of €40,849, while those with doctoral degrees had salaries of €45,325.An index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3797067.1550426872!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"economic recovery boosting prospects for college graduates","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA total of 78 per cent of graduates are in employment or due to start a job nine months after leaving college, the latest figures show.Is it really worth your while going to college?After the soaring cost of accommodation, the hefty fees and hard academic slog, you might be forgiven for wondering whether it really pays off to have a higher standard of education?The latest figures from the Higher Education Authority (HEA) on the destinations of graduates are unambiguous. Those who complete third level have a better chance of getting a job and of being paid well for it.The figures indicate there is also a strong argument for graduates in certain fields to continue their educational journey to postgraduate level and beyond.It is clear from this report that the ongoing economic recovery is leading to much improving employment prospects for graduates.Overall, a total of 78 per cent of graduates are in employment or due to start a job nine months after leaving college.The remainder are mostly in either further education or travelling just 5 per cent are seeking employment. Of those at work, some 90 per cent are finding work at home.While the data in this year’s report isn’t strictly comparable to last year due to a change in methodology, one thing is clear: these are the kind of indicators we last saw during the the heady days of the economic boom.For those who stay on in education to master’s or doctoral degree level, there is a significant earnings premium.Postgraduate qualificationsEarning data shows students who stay on in college to study for postgraduate qualifications such as PhDs stand to earn about €8,000 more than than average graduates.Jim Miley, director general of the Irish Universities Association, says the outcomes confirms the “clear added value” of higher education for society and for iniduals, in terms of both employment opportunities and graduate salaries.Given the earnings boost of which third level affords, some might argue that it also vindicates our policy of sending ever more school-leavers into higher education.However, as last week’s study by the HEA shows, this doesn’t always hold true.There are alarming dropout rates in some colleges and courses, especially those with low CAO points in computing and engineering.There is a strong argument that some may fare better in more hands-on options such as further education or apprenticeships, which also offer starting salaries on a par with college graduates.If there are any alarm bells in this report, they seem to be ringing for arts and humanities graduates.They have consistently recorded lower earnings and employment levels – at all levels of qualification – although many are progressing on to further studies or training.Many also argue that due to the nature of arts and humanities degrees it just takes a bit longer to find work linked to your qualification.There is also a question mark over the quality of work in some areas. For example, despite high levels of employment, many education graduates say they are engaged in temporary, substitute or part-time teaching in Ireland.Notwithstanding this, the picture painted in this latest report is overwhelmingly positive: starting salaries are rising, employment rates are climbing and emigration is going down.An index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription "},{"url":null,"title":"employment rates for college graduates at boom time levels","story":"The vast majority of college graduates are opting to stay and find work at home, new figures show. Overall, some 78 per cent of graduates from the class of 2017 were working nine months after graduating, figures not seen since the height of the economic boom.The remainder were in further education or training (14 per cent), seeking work (5 per cent) or engaged in other activities, such as travel (4 per cent).Of those at work, some 90 per cent found employment within Ireland on average starting salaries of €33,574.In a boost for the economy, the bulk of international students (62 per cent) are also choosing to stay and find work here.Earning data shows that students who stay on in college to study for postgraduate qualifications such as PhDs stand to earn about €8,000 more than than average graduates.Overall, the mean salary for an honours degree graduate is about €29,600.This rose to €40,849 for graduates with master’s degrees and €45,325 for those with doctoral degrees.Interestingly, graduates with lower levels of qualifications – such as higher certificates or ordinary degrees – earned slightly more than honours degree graduates.For example, the average starting salary for a graduate with a higher certificate was €32,845, while it rose to €34,348 for an ordinary degree holder.When broken down by geography, the highest average salaries were reported by those employed in the Dublin area.Average starting salaries in the capital were €34,153, while the lowest average salaries were in the Border area at €28,846, a gap of more than €5,000There is also evidence of a gender gap in salaries, with men earning more than women.This is despite the fact that women are more likely to secure higher grades at the end of college.Men reported earning €35,650, on average, while women reported earning €31,670, about €4,000 less.While this corresponds to a gender pay gap of 11 per cent, this reduces to about 4 per cent when the field of study and age is controlled for.The figures also indicate there is a premium attached to graduating from a university compared with an institute of technology.University graduates earn €2,676 more a year on average compared with institute of technology graduates, when controlling for the field of study.However, there was little difference in employment outcomes based on the institution attended.University graduates and institute of technology graduates were just as likely to be employed (78 per cent).Also, male and female employment prospects were similar with 78 per cent of graduates of each gender employed nine months after graduating.The survey also contains a detailed analysis of education graduates for the first time, broken down into early years, primary and post-primary.Of these groups, those in early years earned the least, typically €20-25,000. Primary and post-primary teaching graduates earned more, typically €30-35,000.Employment rates were particularly good for all education graduates. Primary teaching graduates were the most likely to be working (96 per cent), followed by post-primary (89 per cent) and early years (84 per cent).An index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Councillor alleges details of candidate\u0026rsquos claim \u0026lsquounfairly used\u0026rsquoFinley Gannon (18) disappears after attending nightclub in Co Dublin townTributes paid to one of the capital\u0026rsquos best-known and most respected barbersMore than half the \u0026euro9.5m in cash confiscated in the past decade subject to appealMinister stresses importance of continuing co-operation between Garda and PSNIParty frustrated at being associated with Government\u0026rsquos difficulties, says former minister of stateTensions at No to Racism event in Co Roscommon as garda\u0026iacute investigate recent fires\u0026lsquoConfidential discussion\u0026rsquo seen as way to engage with Palestinians ahead of new US initiativeMembers of Fingal Battalion say they are protesting over proposed carbon tax changesMan sustains fractured skull and bleed in the brain after hitting his head on the pavementPolice criticise reckless attack on house in Craigavon, Co Armagh on Saturday nightCivil Engineer living along Border relied on Derry to London route for jobVehicle being pursued is stopped by eight Garda vehicles at the Harold\u0026rsquos Cross BridgeState to invest \u0026euro13.6m to make sport an \u0026lsquointernational proposition\u0026rsquo in IrelandTom Honan named Press Photographer of the Year"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3797126.1550437396!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"barry andrews to contest dublin for ff in european election","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer minister of state Barry Andrews (front, right) has been selected to contest the European Parliament election in Dublin for Fianna Fáil. Photograph Nick BradshawThe Mr Andrews last night beat former ministers Mary Hanafin and Conor Lenihan and marriage equality campaigner Tiernan Brady to the Fianna Fáil nomination.He will serve “at least” one full term in the European Parliament and said the party will run only one candidate in Dublin, which is growing from a three to a four-seat constituency as a result of the UK leaving the EU.At the selection convention in Lansdowne Rugby Club on Sunday evening, some 838 votes were cast out of an eligible electorate of 1,600.Mr Andrews polled 340 first preferences, followed by Ms Hanafin on 199, Mr Brady on 191 and Mr Lenihan with 108. Mr Lenihan and then Mr Brady were eliminated, leaving Mr Andrews the winner and Ms Hanafin the runner up.Mr Andrews said he believed the confidence and supply agreement cannot last until its intended end date of spring 2020.“There is frustration as we go on the doors we are associated with some of the problems that the Government are having at the moment,” he said. “There is not a single member of Fianna Fáil that doesn’t acknowledge that throughout Brexit we are going to have to maintain confidence and supply.Country first“There is absolutely no question of collapsing the Government while the fog of Brexit is still obscuring Irish politics. As soon as that is clarified, there has to be a question about confidence and supply.”Party leader Micheál Martin last week said his commitment to facilitate one more budget in the autumn still stands, but Mr Andrews says there “would have to be a serious question about that”.However, his remarks were tempered by Kildare South TD Fiona O’Loughlin, who chaired the convention.“Micheál is wearing the green jersey and it is not an easy place to be for him or for any of the parliamentary party. We have to have patience. We have to put country first and then, I do believe, that that will come back to us.”Deputy leader Dara Calleary told the convention it is important Fianna Fáil’s “republican values” are heard in the next European Parliament.Mr Brady urged delegates to canvass for Mr Andrews and said Fianna Fáil’s recovery requires it to be the “voice of Dublin city and county”.Ms Hanafin said she will stand for the party again in the Blackrock ward of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in May’s’ local elections and will seek a return to the Dáil thereafter.Mr Lenihan said it is time for Fianna Fáil to “put these posh boys out”, in a reference to the Fine Gael."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3797164.1550432826!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"flanagan urges uk to maintain extradition arrangements post brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Justice  Charlie Flanagan: ‘I believe that it is important a strong bond of working together between the PSNI in Northern Ireland, outside of the EU, and the Garda Síochána here continues.’ File photograph: Garrett WhiteCollinsMinister for Justice Charlie Flanagan has expressed hope that Britain will maintain extradition arrangements with the European Union in the wake of Brexit next month in order to facilitate close co-operation in combating international crime.“I was in Belfast on Monday. I believe that it is important a strong bond of working together between the PSNI in Northern Ireland, outside of the EU, and the Garda Síochána here continues. I would be concerned to ensure, for example, that we would continue to have a robust extradition process.”Talking to Cork’s 96FM during a visit to west Cork at the weekend, Mr Flanagan said he was pleased that the Common Travel Area which has operated between the Republic and the UK since the foundation of the Irish Free State in 1922 would continue.“Of course, there are security concerns – I meet on a monthly basis with my colleagues at an EU level. I would be very keen after Brexit that there would be the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK – particularly in the areas of criminal law, justice and security.”“I met with my colleague the home secretary, Sajid Javid, earlier this week and I believe the urgency now is for the British government and the British parliament to finalise their ask on the Withdrawal Agreement.“We had an agreement between the UK and the EU. My concern is that does appear to be unravelling. I would urge finality and certainty in that regard so that we can set about building the blocks for the future relationship. “That is where I would hope ultimately there would be as close as possible a security relationship. We have had over the last number of years experienced a new dispensation in terms of the relationship between An Garda Síochána and the PSNI. I very much welcome that.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

An article, published in yesterday’s Sunday Times, alleged that Ms Kisyombe, who is seeking a place on Dublin City Council in the May election, had arrived in Ireland later than she had stated in media interviews. Ms Kisyombe, who yesterday refused to comment on the article, is originally from Malawi and has spoken of her experience of living in the direct provision system for much of the last decade. In a recent interview with The , Ms Kisyombe said direct provision “is a system that controls you in every sense of human life. “Your life is being run basically with a remote control. You’re being told what to do. You wake up in the bed you’ve been given. You don’t own the space you’re in. Your life is managed by the centre administration.“Even after almost a decade here, I’m a nobody. I’m still somebody that cannot have a say about my life. I’m on €21.60 a week, hoping that, by March, we’ll be getting €38. I’m in the old system, so I’m not allowed to work, I’m not allowed to go to the school.” A spokeswoman for the Social Democrats said that Ms Kisyombe was “living legally in Ireland while her claim is being processed” and that it would “not be fair or appropriate for the Social Democrats to comment on her case”. “Ellie has been active in highlighting the difficulties faced by people living in direct provision over the last number of years,” the spokeswoman said. ‘Misappropriated details’Gary Gannon, a Social Democrat member of Dublin City Council, alleged that details of Ms Kisyombe’s asylum claim had been “misappropriated and unfairly used” and called on Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan to investigate how the information became available. “I think the Minister for Justice has an obligation to protect asylum seekers clearly something has broken down there,” said Mr Gannon, who has supported Ms Kisyombe in her local election campaign. “This is potentially the first time a local election candidate has made a front page of a national Sunday newspaper.”A Department of Justice spokesman said the department took its responsibilities under the Data Protection Act, 2018, and the International Protection Act, 2015, “extremely seriously”. “For reasons of confidentiality, the department cannot comment in relation to inidual immigration or international-protection-related cases,” he said.

Photograph: Steve ParsonsPA WireTheresa May’s government will next week seek to step up negotiations with the European Union over the Northern Ireland backstop, after MPs\u0026nbsprejected the prime minister’s approach to Brexit.The backstop, a provision in the EU-UK Brexit deal aimed at avoiding a hard Border in Ireland after the UK leaves the bloc, has emerged as a key obstacle to UK MPs backing the withdrawal agreement.British Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay will meet EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier on Monday ahead of Mrs May’s expected trip to Brussels\u0026nbspnext week for talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker.Attorney general Geoffrey Cox will on Tuesday set out the legally binding changes to the backstop his government believes are needed to secure a House of Commons majority for the Brexit deal. Culture secretary Jeremy Wright, Mr Cox’s predecessor as attorney general, said on Sunday that it might not be necessary to reopen the text of the withdrawal agreement to achieve a breakthrough.“I think what’s obvious is that parliament, and I think probably people well beyond parliament, are concerned about the potential indefinite nature of the backstop – that’s what we’ve got to do something about. If this is the only way of doing it then that’s the way we will pursue. If there are other ways of doing it that are just as effective that perhaps we haven’t yet explored then we will do that too,” he told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show.“I don’t think it’s the mechanism that matters, it’s the objective: if you can get to a place where the potential longevity of the backstop, the potential that the backstop lasts forever, can be adequately dealt with, that’s what we’re all seeking to do. That’s what parliament has been very clear that it wants it will back this deal if we can do something about the backstop.”Mrs May has insisted until now that she needs changes to the text of the legally binding withdrawal agreement, something the EU has ruled out, to break the current impasse. The prime minister appealed at the weekend for unity among her Conservative party after 57 hardline Brexiteers abstained last Thursday on a motion endorsing her approach to Brexit.Alternative measuresSome Conservative Brexiteers in the European Research Group (ERG) have ruled out voting for the Brexit deal unless the backstop is removed from the withdrawal agreement and replaced with alternative measures to ensure that the Border remains open. Others have made clear that a codicil or changes to the political declaration attached to the withdrawal agreement will not be enough to secure their support.Defence minister Tobias Ellwood said on Sunday that he and a number of other ministers would take whatever action was necessary to avoid leaving the EU without a deal, implying that they would resign if they were not allowed to vote for a motion to take no-deal off the table..“In the event that the ERG cannot be relied upon with their votes, then we do need to pursue the possibility of having that free vote to take no-deal off the table,” he told the BBC.“There are many ministers, me being one of them, that need to see no-deal removed from the table in due course, and that date is very much approaching, very soon indeed.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

mocking the serious events sadly experienced in Salisbury last year.March 4 will mark the one year anniversary of the nerve agent attack on Mr Skripal, 67, when he and his daughter Yulia, 33, were discovered collapsed on a park bench in the city centre.Salisbury police officer DS Nick Bailey was also left seriously ill after coming into contact with it at the Skripal\u0027s house.Four months after that, in July 2018, Dawn Sturgess died after spraying the substance onto her skin, believing it to be perfume.Her partner, Charlie Rowley, had found a bottle containing novichok in a bin and given it to Dawn. He was also hospitalised after the exposure, but has since recovered.Two men identified as suspects for carrying out the attack, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, went on Russian state-funded TV in September last year to claim they had only travelled to Salisbury as tourists, to visit its famous cathedral.Wiltshire Police are aware of the situation.Salisbury Cathedral was completed in 1258 and has the tallest spire in England - which measures 404 feet.Please review our commenting policy\u0026#39Fragrant February\u0026#39 declared by RHS as they say hot summer and mild winter have led to more early bloomsChildren as young as 13 joining Satanic Nazi groups, report warns \u0026#39We could see this coming\u0026#39, Grenfell firefighter says as he criticises bosses\u0026#39Stealth tax\u0026#39 fear as Treasury admits money raised from new plastic charge could fund public servicesFacebook has behaved like a \u0026#34digital gangster,\u0026#34 say MPs, as they accuse firm\u0026#39s founder Mark Zuckerberg of lyingBritain\u0026#39s electoral laws are not \u0026#34fit for purpose\u0026#34 to combat disinformation and fake news, say MPsCheaper travel for rail passengers signalled as train firms plan end of the line for split rail tickets MPs demand new law to protect children from failure of social media giants\u0026#39 duty of careSpanish warship orders Gibraltar boats to leave British watersBritish forces to step up Arctic deployment to protect Nato\u0026#39s northern flank from RussiaJihadi bride Shamima Begum gives birth and says \u0026#39people should have sympathy for me\u0026#39Baptiste, episode one review: Like The Missing but with the air of a graphic novelTraitors, episode one review: Wobbly, claustrophobic and not that thrilling... yetBaptiste, episode 1 recap: the twists have already begun in this spin-off of The MissingTwo more senior Tory MPs facing deselection votes as \u0026#39purple momentum\u0026#39 purge gathers paceMatt Hancock demands overhaul of Food Standards Agency over its \u0026#39best before zealotry\u0026#39 in mouldy jam rowComment: The era of self-regulation for technology companies is coming to an endComment: What could be more British than saving Saba the cheetah from the ravages of man?Top Gear, episode one, review: the BBC has finally got the formula right - but is it too late?Yazidis lose hope for captured loved ones as end of Islamic State\u0026#39s caliphate nears without answers We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/02/14/18/insulation.jpg","title":"aerogel insulation weightless space industrial","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Used for conditions such as myopia and cataracts.Aerogels are a material made up of air that is stuck within a network made of a solid medium, such as ceramic, metal or carbon.Ceramic aerogels can be incredibly lightweight, but still able to endure demanding environments. However, they are usually very brittle and easily degrade, making them hard to use as insulation and limiting their adoption.However, the new ceramic aerogel has been created using atomically thin sheets of a substance known as\u0026nbsphexagonal boron nitride. That was carefully engineered into a new material that does not expand outwards when it is compressed or heated up, unlike other similar materials.It then succeeded in a whole host of tests, including experiments that heated and cooled it rapidly. The aerogel hardly changed at all, the authors right, and did not lose any strength.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some pastors take worshippers for full immersion baptisms in the cold of the Thames Estuary. Others believe that when congregants suddenly start speaking in unknown languages it marks the presence of the Holy Spirit.But the researchers from the University of Roehampton found things that many churches have in common, including a drive for professional advancement, a commitment to spend three hours or more at Sunday service and typically very loud worship.“That is how we express our joy and gratitude to God,” says Andrew Adeleke, a senior pastor at the House of Praise, one of the biggest African churches in Southwark, in a former theatre.“The church is not supposed to be a graveyard,“ Adeleke says. “It is supposed to be a temple of celebration and worship and the beauty is to be able to express our love to God, even when things are not perfect in our lives.”For some, the noise from amplified services is a problem, leading to complaints to local authorities from residents.But many churches face bigger challenges than unhappy neighbours: some provide food for people struggling to make ends meet, or work with young people at risk of recruitment by gangs.With clubs, churches and motorcycles, Berlin becomes home for migrantsAndrew Rogers, who led the University of Roehampton researchers, says pastors have to juggle retaining the churches’ African identity while appealing to children of first-generation immigrants, many of whom have never lived outside Britain.They typically have a more liberal world view which can be hard to reconcile with conservative Pentecostal teachings.Rogers recalls speaking to one pastor who lamented he was unable to talk about religious miracles to his children.“If the church doesn’t adapt, then they are going to leave and look elsewhere,” Rogers says.Reporting by William Schomberg, ReutersWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Like many other entrepreneurs, she is spending a lot of time in London, masterminding the expansion of Karma in the UK.\u0026nbspSince it launched in London in February 2018, 80,000 users have signed up to click and collect surplus food from delis and restaurants for half price. On any day, users can browse nearby restaurants and cafes for surplus salads, pastries and full meals to buy and collect before closing.\u0026nbspAll that waste has been good for business: Karma is working with 600 independent retailers in London and makes money by taking a cut of sales. Food waste costs businesses in the UK around\u0026nbsp£20bn annually, according to Wrap, the food waste charity –\u0026nbspthe equivalent of more than £300 per citizen.In September, 90 organisations signed a commitment to reduce food waste through the food chain, from field to fork, by working with suppliers and engaging with customers alike. Supermarkets are increasingly seeing apps as part of the solution.\u0026nbspIn November last year, Karma teamed up with appliance manufacturer Electrolux to test out a smart refrigerator for grocery stores. In a trial in Stockholm, users signed up to buy reduced-price chilled goods that would have otherwise gone to waste, unlocking a connected fridge at the entrance to a supermarket with a QR code.Karma has raised €18m\u0026nbsp(£16m) from investors to expand the number of retailers it works with in London and is planning a test launch in Paris in 2019. But Bernadotte says the app works just as well in small towns with just one or two retailers as it does in big cities. She says: “It’s about matching supply and demand.”It’s also about beating the competition. The number of food waste apps on the market has multiplied in the last decade, fuelled by environmental pressure from consumers and industry bodies. Winnow, which launched in London is 2013, provides chefs in commercial kitchens a set of scales to weigh food and measure how much is thrown away. The app can then assess the value of what is being lost, with the idea that restaurants adapt their menus.\u0026nbspOther apps are based on Bernadotte’s notion of matching supply and demand. Tessa Cook co-founded Olio\u0026nbspin the UK in 2015. The app now connects supply and demand for surplus food within communities in 32 countries, with 75 per cent of food listed picked up within 24 hours.\u0026nbspOlio\u0026nbspcurrently makes money by charging business for its Food Waste Heroes Programme, in which a group of volunteers rescue unsold food from businesses and add it to the app. But its core business is connecting people within communities who may only need one red onion, for example, and have another two to give away. Olio\u0026nbspattracted $6m\u0026nbsp(£4.7m) in Series A funding in July led by Octopus Ventures, which was attracted by the value of connecting people through the app.\u0026nbspKarma’s major competition comes Too Good To Go, an app founded in Copenhagen in 2016. It\u0026nbsphas raised a total of €16m\u0026nbspto expand\u0026nbspin Europe. Too Good To Go founder Mette Lykke knows a thing or two about seeing a gap in the market and scaling a business. She previously co-founded Endomondo, an app for tracking and sharing workouts. It sold to Under Armour for $85m\u0026nbspin 2015.\u0026nbsp“The reality is that it’s standard practice for food businesses to throw away perfectly edible food,” she says. “We give them the flexibility to offer up anything that’s still good to eat and sell it to consumers through the app at a discounted price. It’s a win for retailers, because they reduce waste, acquire customers and increase revenue\u0026nbspit’s a win for consumers who get great food for a reduced price –\u0026nbspand it’s obviously a win for the environment.”In France, Too Good To Go is campaigning for Carrefour, the French retail company, to change its food labels from “best before” to “best before, not bad after”. The campaign comes after Tesco scrapped “best before” labels in the UK in October 2018\u0026nbspon more than 100 products. In its native Denmark, Too Good To Go is also working with the country’s minister for education to create webinars to educate children about how to reduce waste at home.\u0026nbspBut its main business is comes from taking a cut of surplus food sales from restaurants and cafes – with a plan to save 20 million\u0026nbspmeals by the end of 2019. Bernadotte says the main difference between the apps is that Karma users know exactly what food they are picking up, which can help with allergies and dietary requirements. Many of the meals on Too Good To Go are listed as “the magic bag”, a mixed bag of any surplus food that a restaurant might otherwise throw away.\u0026nbspHarriet Jenkins is chief operating officer for Detox Kitchen, a health-food home delivery service that has two delis in London. Detox Kitchen switched from using Too Good To Go to Karma after it was contacted by the latter app when it entered the London market in 2018. “Karma was working with a good number of stores and slightly bigger numbers, so we thought we’d experiment with them,” Jenkins says.6 easy ways to prevent food waste at homeDetox Kitchen had long been interested in reducing food waste in its kitchens, but had found it difficult to strike deals with charities because the delis couldn’t guarantee a set amount of waste to make a worthwhile pickup at the end of the day. Through Karma, they could list as much or as little food for half price to be picked up by customers. In the first week of December last year, Detox Kitchen sold 100 units through Karma, raising £230.\u0026nbsp“It’s not a huge boost to revenue, but it’s not about making money – it’s about not losing money by throwing this stuff away,” Jenkins says. “Anything that is raising the profile of our brand is good for us.”With 700 retailers in London, Karma hasn’t even begun to test the potential of the model, according to Bernadotte. “We started off with restaurants and big hotel chains, and now we’re ramping up with grocery stores, supermarkets and school kitchens,” she says. “I haven’t found anyone who doesn’t have any food waste.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

This beautiful axehead was found in the Scottish Borders\u0026nbspbut it’s not from Scotland, it’s from central Europe – and it’s been here for 6,000 years.Several floors above, in the museum’s revamped East Asia galleries, curators from a range of countries are celebrating a landmark in the museum’s history. After 15 years, the £80m\u0026nbspoverhaul of this historic institution is finally complete. The project was completed on time\u0026nbspand on budget. The museum’s 29 galleries look magnificent. By any measure, it’s been a spectacular success. More than two million people visit the\u0026nbspmuseum every year, making it Britain’s most popular visitor attraction outside London – not bad for a venue in a city with a population of half a million, and in a country with a population of just five million. However, this relaunch comes at a critical time in Scotland’s national history. When this redevelopment began, in 2004, who would have thought it would be completed just as Scotland braces itself to leave the EU?In case anyone needs reminding (and it seems quite a lot of English voters do), Scots voted to remain in the European Union in 2016, by a considerably larger margin than they voted to remain in the United Kingdom in 2014. According to English Brexiteers, this “will of the people”\u0026nbspdoesn’t count because Scotland is merely part of the UK, rather than a distinct and separate country – and in a narrow\u0026nbsplegalistic sense they’re right. But as you wander around this museum, which charts the history of the Scottish nation and its relationship with the wider world beyond the British Isles, you realise there’s nothing eternal or automatic about Scotland’s place within the UK.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBrexit putting the union at risk, new poll revealsThe history of the National Museum of Scotland\u0026nbspmirrors Scotland’s shifting relationship with Great Britain over the past few hundred years. The museum’s roots stretch back to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, founded in 1780, at the height of the Scottish Enlightenment, when Edinburgh, then as now, was a European cultural and intellectual hub.In 1861\u0026nbspthe current building was erected here in Chambers Street. Prince Albert laid the foundation stone. Originally called the Industrial Museum of Scotland, it was the UK’s first national museum outside London. The central atrium, flooded with natural light, was inspired by London’s Crystal Palace, where Albert staged his Great Exhibition in 1851. The museum’s mission was “to bring Scotland to the world, and the world to Scotland”.\u0026nbspThat mission statement held true in 1861 – it still holds true today.Over the next century, this museum was renamed several times. It was the Edinburgh Museum of Science and\u0026nbspArt, and then the Royal Scottish Museum, before finally becoming the National Museum of Scotland in 1985. In 1998\u0026nbspa modern wing was added to the original Victorian building, and since 2004 the Victorian building has been undergoing an enormous renovation programme. Now finally, after 15 years, that renovation is complete.So is this the\u0026nbspend of the story, the conclusion of a process which began back in 1780? Hardly. A stroll around this museum confirms that history is always unfinished business – particularly here in Scotland, in a national museum in a country which hasn’t been an independent nation for more than 300 years. For visitors, from Britain and abroad, this ambiguous status begs the question: what is the purpose of a national museum in a land that is not (yet) a nation? Is it a sop to rebellious Scots, to appease their nationalist ambitions? Or is it a cultural harbinger of full independence – a sign of things to come?As these displays remind us, England and Scotland have shared a monarch since 1603, when James VI of Scotland inherited the English crown from the childless Queen Elizabeth I. What’s less widely known – outside Scotland, at least – is that the Scottish parliament stumbled on for another century, until the Act of Union in 1707. Since the foundation of the Scottish parliament, just down the road from here, in 1999, Scotland is back where it was in the 17th century –\u0026nbspa country with its own parliament\u0026nbspbut subservient to Westminster.

But the EU again refused to reopen the withdrawal agreement and its controversial backstop – with any negotiations expected to focus on the future relationship between the UK and EU insteadScotland isn’t the only European nation within a nation, and several of these quasi-nations have their own national museums. Their respective histories reveal a good deal about these statelets’ differing attitudes to independence. The Bayerisches Nationalmuseum in Munich was founded in 1855\u0026nbspby King Maximilian II of Bavaria, when the region was still an independent nation. Bavaria voted for union with the Deutsches Reich in 1871, and has remained part of Germany ever since, yet it retains many of the cultural trappings of a nation state, including this national museum. A significant minority of Bavarians still pine for a return to statehood (a YouGov poll in 2017, at the height of the refugee crisis, put the number as high as 32 per cent), but as immigration falls it looks as if these separatist ambitions have peaked.Conversely, the Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya, in Barcelona, reflects far stronger independence aspirations. Despite its long history as an independent country, Catalonia has been part of Spain since 1715, and until 2004 the Palau Nacional in Barcelona merely housed the Museu d’Art de Catalunya. In 2004 it was renamed the Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya, and in 2017, when Catalonia held an (illegal) independence referendum, the Palau Nacional was a popular focal point for pro-independence demonstrations.At present, Scottish independence seems to sit somewhere between these two positions. In 2014 Scots voted to remain in the UK, by 55.3 per cent\u0026nbspto 44.7\u0026nbspper cent, but Scotland’s subsequent vote to remain in the EU, by 62 per cent\u0026nbspto 38 per cent, puts the Scottish parliament on a collision course with Westminster. The National Museum of Scotland is careful not to take sides in these isive debates. They don’t need to. The exhibits speak for themselves. Scotland may leave the EU\u0026nbspand may remain in the UK, but the contents of this museum show Scotland has always been a European country, as much as a British one.Entering the wing of the museum\u0026nbspdevoted to Scottish history, you’re confronted by a cri de coeur from Robert the Bruce: “As long as one hundred of us remain alive, we will never on any conditions be brought under English rule.”\u0026nbspOn the opposite wall is a similarly stirring pronouncement from the Declaration of Arbroath (the letter the barons of Scotland sent to Pope John XXII in 1320, confirming Scotland’s independence, and its right to resist the English by force): “For we fight not for glory nor riches nor honours, but for freedom alone, which no good man gives up except with his life.”For an English visitor in particular, what is unfamiliar (and instructive) about this display is the pan-European focus, and the refreshing absence of Anglo-centric emphasis. You realise that, for long periods of its history, Scotland’s relationship with England was nothing special. The Romans occupied all of England for several centuries and left a lasting mark upon it. Their partial incursions into Scotland were short and insubstantial. During the dark ages, Scotland enjoyed closer links with Ireland than England. As the old Roman roads crumbled away, it became far easier for Scots to sail to Ireland than to trek to England. The Irish Sea wasn’t a barrier\u0026nbspbut a busy highway.There was nothing inevitable or preordained about the Act of Union in 1707. Like a lot of historical turning points, it owed a good deal to happenstance. At the end of the 17th century, despite having shared the same monarch for almost 100 years, the Kingdom of Scotland was still independent. And with better luck and better judgement it might well have remained so. If only the Scottish government hadn’t invested a quarter of Scotland’s wealth in a new colony in Panama, it might still be independent today.Like a lot of heroic failures, the idea was inspired. By establishing a base in Panama, on the isthmus between North and South America, Scotland would control the growing trade between the Pacific and the Atlantic, anticipating the Panama canal by 200 years. Mindful of the Romans, and the new empire they hoped to build, they called this new colony Caledonia.If Caledonia had been successful, Scotland might have become a world power, with no need of England. However, the English government did its best to scupper the venture, colluding with the East India Company in a trade blockade. The colony collapsed, sparking a financial crisis\u0026nbspin Edinburgh. If anything, the collapse in national confidence was even more severe. Seven years later the Scottish parliament voted narrowly for union with England – and that was the end of the Scottish parliament\u0026nbspuntil 1999.Of course this isn’t new information, but it’s a shock to English eyes to see it presented here so prominently, and so starkly, rather than buried in the footnotes of a dry and dusty history book. I studied this stuff when I did my history degree, but I never knew about the £20,000 in bribes the English paid to Scottish politicians to push the Act of Union through the Scottish parliament, and vote for their own extinction. In the light of this betrayal, the Jacobite rebellions of 1715 and 1745 make a lot more sense.Hunting with dogs to be ‘effectively halted’ in Scotland Women win equal pay dispute after 12-year battle with Glasgow councilCross-party rally calls for second referendum in ScotlandThe top floor of the museum is devoted to Scotland in the 20th century. The exhibition Scotland:\u0026nbspA Changing Nation is a vivid picture of where Scotland stands today. Here you’ll find Jimmy Reid, the Scottish trade unionist, and Winifred Ewing, the pioneering SNP politician. Here you’ll find Margaret Thatcher, opining that:\u0026nbsp“We English, who are a marvellous people, are really very generous to Scotland.”\u0026nbspThe display lets you draw your own conclusions. The exhibition concludes with the opening of the Scottish parliament, designed by the Catalan architect Enric Miralles. “We have a building which is more than a building,”\u0026nbspsaid the Scots poet Edwin Morgan, and he’s right.So what does the rebirth of this museum tell us about the rebirth of Scottish nationalism? This museum isn’t a nationalistic project, as its curators are at pains to point out. The National Museum of Scotland is devoutly, resolutely apolitical. It flies no flag for any party. Yet Scottish politics has flowed in a very different direction since 1998\u0026nbspwhen this museum was last expanded: an independence referendum (defeated) an EU membership referendum (won in Scotland\u0026nbspbut lost across the UK, thanks to Brexit votes in England)\u0026nbspand a resurrected Scottish parliament, reconvened after 200 years.In party politics, the biggest story by far has been the rise of the Scottish National Party, now the governing party here in Scotland. These have been seismic changes, and though this museum’s impartiality is admirable, it wouldn’t be doing its job if it didn’t reflect this tectonic shift.The internationalism of this museum, and the growing internationalism of Scotland, is reflected in this museum’s perspective, and the nationalities of its staff. The three curators I spoke to, entirely at random, were Chinese, French and German. Time was, talent tended to drift south from Scotland. Now, increasingly, it’s the other way around. The museum’s director, Dr Gordon Rintoul,\u0026nbspis a Scot who returned to Scotland from England.“We’ve certainly attracted a substantial number of people from outside Scotland, and I think people have come here because they sense an opportunity to do something different, an opportunity to make a difference,”\u0026nbspsays Rintoul. His curator of Chinese collections, Dr Qin Cao, is a case in point. Originally from China, she worked in London and Oxford before she relocated to Edinburgh. “It is a very vibrant place,”\u0026nbspshe says.“We have so many visitors coming from all over the world,”\u0026nbspsays Friederike Voigt, a senior curator\u0026nbspwho was born and raised in Germany. “In a way what makes Scotland great is the same thing that makes this museum great,”\u0026nbspsays Dr Xavier Dectot, keeper of art and\u0026nbspdesign at the musuem, who comes from France. I know what he means. It’s big enough, but it’s small enough. People feel connected here.“There’s a greater awareness that we’re actually dependent on other people, so we want to interact,”\u0026nbspadds Voigt. “It’s very outward looking,”\u0026nbspconcurs Dectot. “Not only do we feel Scottish, but the other Scots don’t perceive us as anything but Scots.”\u0026nbspIf only this were true in England.“A large part of what defines the architecture of this city is late 18th century – neoclassical – that’s something that is very European,”\u0026nbspsays Dectot, who personifies Scotland’s Auld Alliance\u0026nbspwith France, and its cultural affinity with the continent. And now the street life is catching up. The city always used to feel cosmopolitan in August\u0026nbspduring Edinburgh\u0026nbspFestival Fringe. Now it feels cosmopolitan all year round. “Everyone in the city has responded to that,”\u0026nbspsays Rintoul. “That does actually give the city a more international feel.”Scottish devolution has had a direct effect on the evolution of this museum. “A key point for this project was the strong support from Scottish government,”\u0026nbspRintoul tells me. It doesn’t hurt that the Scottish parliament, in Holyrood, is just a short walk\u0026nbspfrom the museum. “It’s clearly easier to argue your case.”\u0026nbspIt’s also clearly easier to secure public funding when the public keep coming in such numbers. The museum’s recent Mary Queen of Scots and Bonnie Prince Charlie exhibitions were both hugely popular. Their popularity reveals a growing appetite for Scottish heritage, particularly for shows like these, which re-evaluate the mythic elements of Scotland’s past.There’s definitely been a resurgence in Scottish history as an academic discipline. As a consequence we know a lot more about whole areas of Scotland’s history than was the case 20 or 30 years ago“Since the time of devolution there’s been\u0026nbspmuch increased interest in Scotland’s history. There’s definitely been a resurgence in Scottish history as an academic discipline. As a consequence we know a lot more about whole areas of Scotland’s history than was the case 20 or 30 years ago.”Although Edinburgh feels more international now, Scots internationalism is nothing new. “Scots have always engaged with the rest of the world. These galleries, throughout the whole museum, are replete with items that were acquired by Scots who were abroad, as missionaries\u0026nbspor to seek their fortune\u0026nbspor in military service, and bringing things back to Scotland.”Speaking personally, as a Londoner who’s spent more time in Edinburgh than in any city outside London, I grow to love Scotland more with every visit, but I also become more and more aware of how different it is from England. Without Brexit, the National Museum of Scotland might have remained what it has been for more than a century – an expression of national identity for a nation within a nation – a Bavarian model, if you like. After Brexit, it looks destined to become the focal point for a more Catalan model, whether these curators like it or not. What an exquisite irony that the Conservative and\u0026nbspUnionist Party, of all parties, has brought the Act of Union to its current crisis point! What a fascinating exhibition that will make, in 20 or 30 years to come.We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

No prizes for guessing where this is…From one mighty ocean to another – ships passing through the Panama canalAstronaut Tim Peake previously revealed the damage that orbital junk can cause spacecraft, when he shared an image of a chipped window panel on board the International Space Station in 2016.It is believed that something as small as a paint chip could have caused the damage, as it hurtled towards the International Space Station.When in full operation, scientists aim to make the harpoon fire at debris up to 30 metres away.Engineers back on Earth are still trying to work out how the system can be used to target moving objects.A previous RemoveDEBRIS\u0026nbspexperiment demonstrated how a net could be used to catch potentially dangerous pieces of rubbish orbiting the Earth. Next, the group are expected to test the drag sail part of the test on 12 March.\u0026nbsp“Successful in-space demonstration of the harpoon technology is a significant step towards solving the growing issue of space debris, said Chris Burgess, Harpoon Lead Engineer at Airbus Defence and Space.Professor Guglielmo Aglietti, director of the Surrey Space Centre at the University of Surrey, added: “This is RemoveDEBRIS’ most demanding experiment and the fact that it was a success is testament to all involved.\u0026nbspThe RemoveDEBRIS project provides strong evidence of what can be achieved with the power of collaboration – pooling together the experience across industry and the research field to achieve something truly remarkable.”Additional reporting from agencies.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Several celebrities have pleaded directly with Mr Dorsey for an edit button feature that would allow them to change the text of the original tweet.In June 2018, reality TV star Kim Kardashian West claimed to have almost persuaded the Twitter boss, prompting an angry reaction from many Twitter users.What Twitter\u0027s Jack Dorsey said about Elon Musk is the last strawJack Dorsey: Mark Zuckerberg tried to feed me goat he shot with laserTwitter CEO won\u0027t say if Trump would be banned for ordering murderI had a very good convo with @jack this weekend at Kanye\u0027s bday and I think he really heard me out on the edit button, she tweeted.\u0026nbspOne of the most liked responses to her tweet came from Twitter user Beau Sloane,\u0026nbspwho pointed out the flaws of such a feature.Guys if we get an edit button on Twitter, it would defeat the entire purpose of the app, he tweeted. Think about how corrupt it would become! People could change conversations from the past and twist words!Mr Dorsey told the Goldman Sachs audience clarifications added to a tweet would appear alongside any further interactions with the original tweet, such as a retweet.You wouldn\u0027t be able to retweet the original tweet, for instance, he said.\u0026nbspYou would just show the clarification, so it always carries around with it that context. That\u0027s one approach.

Therefore any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the six months that should be remaining for travel to most countries in Europe.The \u0027blue\u0027 passport, like Brexit, is an international embarrassmentCombining these two rule changes means that\u0026nbspthere are some passports out there which could be rejected even though they expire 14 months and 29 days after the date of travel.\u0026nbspHowever, these rules do not apply when travelling to Ireland. To try to eliminate any confusion, the government website has a new passport checker service to see whether\u0026nbspyou should renew your documents or not.If the UK leaves with a deal, travel to the EU should\u0026nbspremain the same as now until at least 31 December 2020.That would mean\u0026nbspUK passports would\u0026nbspbe valid for travel anywhere in the Schengen area (the vast majority of EU countries as well as Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) up to and including the expiry date.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

So too will unarmed combat, self-defence and urban foraging – just in case law and order breaks down.“Some people have said this stuff won’t happen – and perhaps they’re right,” Tom Linden, the survival expert behind the course, tells The Independent. “But I would say supermarkets are stockpiling food, the NHS has created contingency plans for medicine shortages and the army has been put on standby. So, if these institutions are preparing for the worst, what do they know the rest of us don’t? Maybe we should be preparing too.”Created with Sketch.Britain before Brexit: Yorkshire and the Humber Show all 16Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Independent’s photographer Richard Morgan is examining his own country in the midst of Brexit’s chaos, scrutinising the contrasts of contemporary Britain and the ambivalence of modern Britishness.

Caused by Brexit?“We’re being told a no-deal would reduce the UK’s security so, of course, this is something that needs to be considered,” reckons Tom.Government must \u0027get its act together\u0027 to prevent Brexit panic-buying Is Mark Carney now supporting Brexit?Labour Brexit splits emerge after Corbyn and Starmer ergeBrexit brings more grim business news, but let\u0027s take some happy pillsGovernment admits it has ‘run out of time’ for no-deal Brexit suppliesThe 62-year-old is, for the avoidance of doubt, a self-confessed “prepper”.At the height of the Cold War, he spent 12 years as an NCO with the Royal Observer Corps, a TA-style branch of the RAF responsible for helping coordinate contingency plans in the case of nuclear attack. For another four years, he worked with North Yorkshire County Council as a community defence adviser. Then, in the 90s, he wrote and published the widely praised manual, The Complete Nuclear Survival Guide.As we speak in a Sheffield café today, there sits, outside, in the boot of his car an emergency food box, wind-up torch and water purifier. He’s not brought these along to demonstrate lessons the upcoming course will offer. Rather, he just carries them everywhere.“You never know when disaster will happen,” he says. “Or, in this case, those are all quite useful to have in a breakdown too.”The Brexit survival weekend was actually born out of a quarterly course the retired delivery driver runs on nuclear survival. During those sessions, attendees are taught how to build shelters, deal with extreme weather, light fires and generally survive during the predicted mass breakdown of civil society that would follow a nuclear attack.But, sensing public unease about Brexit, the grandfather-of-five tweaked the main lessons and created the new course to deal with issues that might occur post-29 March. And that, he absolutely insists, is neither opportunistic nor scaremongering.“Not at all,” he says. “The fear’s already there because of people – Remainers and experts, mainly – constantly telling us how bad things might be. I’m offering people a way to ease those worries because I’m an expert in planning for worst-case scenarios. If there are food shortages – and we’re being told there will be – I’m saying you don’t need to worry as long as you take time to prepare beforehand.”After just a few days on sale, half the available places – costing a not inconsiderable £250 for the two days – have already sold. Although, it should be said, that’s only 25 people.Perhaps it would have been more, admits Tom, but some may have been put off by the course’s dates: 13-14\u0026nbspApril. Which is to say, a fortnight after Brexit day.“Well, two reasons for that,” he says. “Firstly, I don’t believe there’s any chance – deal or no deal – we will leave the EU on 29 March. And secondly, that was the earliest I could book the facilities at the EPC for anyway.”He reflects on this a second: “Perhaps that’s one occasion where I wasn’t quite prepared enough.”As for Tom himself, ironically enough, he voted Leave.“I love Europe and its people – I’ve been all across it as a driver,” he says. “But I don’t believe the EU is a democratic institution. It’s unaccountable. I want decisions about Britain to be made in Britain by people who have been voted for. If getting that power back means some disruption, that’s a price worth paying.”For more information, visit ukpreppersradionetworkWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Further votes may take place the following day.However many, including Sir Keir Starmer, Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, believe Ms May\u0026nbspis planning to delay the meaningul vote until after the European Council meeting on 21 and 22 March, even if an extension to the Article 50 deadline of 29 March\u0026nbspis offered.Labour MP David Lammy said: “It is in those final days that we have the biggest chance to convince MPs to give this decision back to the public.”What will the march be demanding?The key demand is that\u0026nbspany Brexit deal should be put to a public vote for final approval.“Instead of letting Theresa May kick the can down the road until the March 29 deadline, hundreds of thousands of people will march on parliament offering a solution to a crisis that threatens our rights, our living standards and our environment,” said former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas.One proposal for avoiding a no-deal Brexit and securing a second referendum involves tabling\u0026nbspan amendment\u0026nbspin the last week before 29 March.MPs would then approve her deal only if it was subject to a public vote.Where\u0026nbspwill the march take place?The march is set to begin at 12pm, or “high noon”, on Saturday 23 March, on London’s Park Lane.Organisers from the People’s Vote campaign\u0026nbsphave not yet released full details of the route but the march is due to end at Parliament Square with a “mass rally and keynote speeches”.Who will be joining the march?Several leading politicians\u0026nbspincluding Caroline Lucas,\u0026nbspDavid Lammy, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, Conservative MP Anna Soubry, and the leaders of the SNP and Plaid Cymru in Westminster, Ian Blackford and Liz Saville Roberts, have already confirmed their support.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspis supporting the march and encouraging readers to attend.The organisers are hoping to widen their appeal beyond those who have previously supported the People’s Vote and Final Say campaigns.\u0026nbspThe Independent‘s petition calling on the prime minister to give the people a final say on Brexit has attracted well over 1.1 million sigantures.“The only way forward out of this Brexit mess is through a People’s Vote,” said Sir Vince.For more details about the Put It To The People march\u0026nbsp– and to sign up – please visit\u0026nbsppeoples-vote.ukmarchFor updates on what’s going on with Brexit, you can register here to receive our new Brexit in Brief newsletter and other benefits.

But the decision set off a nightmare that saw him lose his job, detained twice and almost deported to Jamaica. Jamaica-born Anthony Bryan poses outside his home in Edmonton, north London. Now 60 and a grandfather, Bryan thought the issue could be resolved swiftly, as he legally moved to Britain with his family as part of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants after World War II.

He was released, but fears being detained again at any time andMr Timms’s constituent, arrested by police just days ago and due to be taken to a detention centre the next day, before the MP’s interventionWhen Mr Timms asked for up-to-date information on visa refusals and deportations, the Home Office told him: “The data was last published in February 2017 and only contains data to December 2016.”Among the MPs who have signed a parliamentary motion tabled by the MP are Conservative Peter Bottomley, Jim Shannon, of the Democratic Unionist Party, and Green MP Caroline Lucas, as well as 11 Scottish Nationalists and 17 Labour MPs.But the Home Office said hundreds of colleges which had sponsored students linked to ETS had had their licences revoked.\u0026nbsp“The investigations in 2014 into the abuse of English language testing revealed systemic cheating which was indicative of significant organised fraud,” a spokesperson said.“The scale of this is shown by the fact that over 20 people who facilitated this fraud have received criminal convictions, with prison sentences totalling 68 years.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Glad to see this expansion into Africa because for a rising continent, this can be about a lot more than what happens on the court,” he tweeted.The initial plan is for the 12-team league to begin playing in January 2020, but it yet to be determined which existing club teams will be part of the league.Qualification tournaments will be held later this year to decicde\u0026nbspthose clubs, with teams from Angola, Egypt, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa and Tunisia expected to be among those taking part.No nation will be allowed to have more than two teams in the league.NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said he was excited that Mr Obama wanted to have a role in the initiative, and said talks between the NBA and the former president are ongoing.\u0026nbsp“As we’ve been talking about this concept over the last several months, there’s been a tremendous reception from many of our NBA team owners... and in addition, several of the partners of the NBA have expressed a strong desire to work with us in Africa,” Mr Silver said.The commissioner said Pepsi and Nike’s Jordan Brand – Michael Jordan was present for the announcement – are among the partners who have\u0026nbspsaid they want to be part of the\u0026nbspleague.Mr Obama spoke on a video\u0026nbspshown during the launch event in Charlotte, North Carolina.“I hope you know through sport, that if you put in effort, you will be rewarded,” he\u0026nbspsaid. “I hope you learn through sport what it means to play as a team, and even if you are the best player, your job is not just to show off but your job is to make your teammates better.”A huge fan of the sport, Mr Obama had a court installed on White House grounds during his time in office\u0026nbspand often played pick-up games with staff.The NBA and FIBA’s involvement will include financial support and resources toward continued growing of the game on the continent, as well as providing training for players, coaches and referees and some infrastructure for the new league.Three NBA games have been held in Africa since 2015, including two games in Johannesburg, the other in Pretoria.The league already has an office in South Africa, has helped create 87 training facilities in seven African nations. The league also built an academy in Senegal that opened nearly two years ago.“We’re excited to work closely with the NBA to develop and put in a place a professional league like none that we have ever seen in our region before,” said FIBA Africa’s executive director Alphonse Bile.“Through the Basketball Africa League, we can provide the many great clubs and players with the best possible environment to compete for the highest stakes.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Spokespersons for the jail and ICE did not\u0026nbspimmediately respond to emails seeking comment on Sunday.The hunger strike arrives shortly after the government suddenly stopped force-feeding a group of men on a hunger strike inside an El Paso, Texas, immigration detention centre, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement said.The dramatic reversal came Thursday as public pressure was mounting on ICE to halt the practice, which involves feeding detainees through nasal tubes against their will.

On Thursday, all force-feeding at the detention centre\u0026nbspnear the El Paso airport had stopped, according to ICE spokeswoman Leticia Zamarripa.“This is a win for us,” said Louis Lopez, who is representing Malkeet Singh and Jasvir Singh, two detainees who are Punjabi Sikhs in their early 20s. “They have a First Amendment right to protest.”In a federal courtroom Wednesday in El Paso, US\u0026nbspDistrict Judge David Guaderrama heard from Dr\u0026nbspMichelle Iglesias about how men detained in the El Paso facility are restrained and have feeding tubes pushed through their noses. The judge asked whether they had some other way they could protest, and sought details about the Singhs’ physical condition.Four immigrants force-fed at Texas detention centre“What are the physiological and psychological effects of allowing a hunger strike to continue unabated by force-feeding?” he asked.In addition to Guaderrama, U.S. District Judges David Briones, Philip R. Martinez and Frank Montalvo at the El Paso courthouse have issued orders for force-feeding in recent weeks.Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said last week the office views force-feeding as potential “ill treatment” that would go against the convention, ratified by the United States in 1994.The statement by the Geneva-based office echoed concerns raised by 14 Democratic lawmakers who have asked ICE for more information.Additional reporting by AP.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

The truth is that Meghan is not remotely being hunted by photographers and enjoys extraordinary freedoms.The paparazzi do not stalk her like they did the Princess of Wales — although they were often tipped off about where Diana would be.Snappers were told  when she was going for lunch  with a friend, dressed up to the nines, or out for a night on the town in a sizzling frock. She had her favourite writers and her favoured photographers.But the only paparazzi pictures ever to have been published of Meghan were taken when the story first broke that she was romantically linked with Harry.This was a genuine news story. But because their media minders at Kensington Palace refused to issue an official photo of the couple together, they had created a market for one, and every paparazzo was desperate to get the first photo of them together.Since then, in all her public engagements, she has been closely monitored by the Palace Press team. Even her wedding pictures were so tightly controlled that just one Press agency was allowed to photograph the marriage service inside St George’s Chapel in Windsor last May.As a result, Meghan can quite happily live as a semi-private citizen in her palace.She comes and goes when and where she wants, with no photographers following her.We know precious little about the le she and Harry lead in London or at their luxury bolthole in Oxfordshire.Yes, she likes Soho Farmhouse and she writes on bananas — but that’s about it.Like everyone in the public eye, she is trolled on social media. Palace aides supposedly “spend hours” deleting hateful comments — but why bother  Why not simply ignore it  Their PR advisers hope to bypass the traditional media by controlling the photographs and stories they release.Meghan deleted her own social media accounts when she and Harry became engaged.  Perhaps the Royal Family should do the same. Instagram does not equal real le.When The Sun accurately reports about Meghan in fairly harmless stories, their frankly second-rate PR people set lawyers on us.Yet the biggest invasion of her privacy was triggered by Meghan herself, after she gave consent to friends to talk to People magazine in America last week about the awful relationship she has with  her dad.Although there have been stories about the “dficult Duchess” and the fall-out with Kate, most of her problems stem from back home in the USA.Meghan’s father Thomas Markle, her half-sister Samantha — who Meghan says she barely knows — and her cannabis-grower half-brother Thomas Jr, have only ever said disparaging things about the Duchess.I suspect that Meghan knew the letter she sent to her dad last August would be published and she used it to make sure the world knew she was disgusted with the lies being told by her family.Meanwhile, in his bid to “protect” his we, Prince Harry — once the Press photographers’ favourite among the royals —  has gone from hero to zero in his relationship with the media.I have asked twice for Meghan to meet Britain’s royal correspondents but so far it has not happened. If she did, I am sure her profile would improve.Despite being surrounded by great wealth and privilege, the young royals seem to have been seduced by the cult of victimhood.Harry talked about his anxiety and stress and Meghan is a victim of “global bullying” — whatever that means.Meghan really needs to lighten up. So does Harry.The pair of them should look across the road at Harry’s father, the Prince of Wales, and his lovely we Camilla, who has had more hostile Press coverage than any other member of  the Royal Family, including Diana.But they just worked harder and harder to win people over, and Camilla’s approval rating is now sky high and she will certainly be our Queen.Every job I have been on with Meghan she has been the star of the show. She engages brilliantly with people and is a true royal star.My main hope is that this phoney war with the media — that they started and which has now been  intensied by their friend Clooney — comes to an end before the Press loses interest.Newspapers and websites could, after all, simply stop covering Harry and Megan’s engagements, which I’m not sure would please either of them.So stick to acting, George, because there is no part for you in this royal soap opera.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So British workers, who earn an average of £, a year, are each getting richer by £ a week, every week.Not that you may have heard the good news on inflation and real wages.As ever, it was drowned out by the relentless drone of bad news stories, all trying to convince us that Britain is in an economic crash, caused by Brexit.In this fictional version of Britain’s economic health we are all getting poorer. Factories are closing like never before and jobs are drting away to the rest of the EU.Yesterday, for example, thegave prominence to a claim by a member of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee, Gertjan Vlieghe, that Brexit is already costing us £million a week.It was fantasy, based on Mr Vlieghe’s guess that the economy would have been two per cent larger had we not voted to leave the EU.Why should anyone believe him when the Bank of England’s economic forecasters have such a terrible record A month before the  referendum, the bank’s governor, Mark Carney, predicted Britain could fall into a “technical recession”we voted to leave.It didn’t happen — or even come close to happening.Then on Wednesday, Carney stunned many with a speech saying Brexit could usher in a golden era of “international co-operation and crossborder commerce” and even that it could be a springboard to a “new global order” of free trade.It is true that economic growth in Britain is sluggish by historical standards, but then it has been ever since the economic crash of  .But at . per cent growth in the past three months, it is outpacing Germany, where the economy was static over the same period. Italy is in recession.It is more than six years since Britain saw the economy shrink over the course of three months, and more than nine years since the economy shrank by more than two quarters in a row — the official definition of a recession.We might not be booming, in other words, but we have gone a remarkably long period without a bust.As for jobs, the unemployment rate has fallen to four per cent — the lowest since the first three months of .Employment, however, is far higher than it was then.We are in the middle of a jobs miracle, yet you would never guess this from listening to many news bulletins.Last week, we never heard the end of it when Nissan announced that it would not, after all, be building its new X-Trail model in Sunderland. You had to read a little more deeply to realise that not a single job is being lost at Britain’s Nissan plants and that the X-Trail is only being dropped because European consumers have turned against diesel.In France, by the way, the unemployment rate is . per cent and in Italy it is . per cent. So much for the notion that the Eurozone economy is powering ahead while Brexit Britain lags behind.Ever since the referendum, the economy has defied the doom-mongers. The past month has been no exception.The High Street was predicted to be a bloodbath. Yet several large chains, including Next, Dunelm and Pets At Home, reported strongly rising sales in the weeks up to Christmas.We have continued shopping after Christmas, too. Consumer spending in January was . per cent higher than a year earlier, according to Barclaycard.The stock market and housing market have both failed to crash, as many predicted they would. In fact, the FTSE  is up seven per cent this year.House prices, according to the Government’s index, are up . per cent over the past  months. That’s no rampant boom, but it is certainly nowhere near a crash.The one thing on which economists were right was that the Pound would fall after a Brexit vote.It is  per cent lower than in early .That is bad newsyou are going on a foreign holiday. Butyou have a job in a company which exports goods or services, it is a pretty good thing.By increasing exports and decreasing imports, the lower Pound is helping to reduce Britain’s trade deficit.In  we imported £billion more in goods and services than we exported. In  the deficit grew to £billion. But by , once the lower Pound had taken effect, it was £billion. However former Brexit Secretary David Davis was wrong when he pinned hopes this week of a sizeable, long-term export boost on a devaluation of the Pound.Brexit success depends on cutting taxes, trade barriers and regulatory burdens, just as Singapore has done.No matter how positive the economic data, however, there are many Remainers who simply will not accept that the economy is not crashing.They want that to happen because they want to be proved right. It is surprising the relentless tales of doom have not caused a recession by destroying consumers’ confidence.If we had taken notice of what the Eeyores were trying to tell us about economic collapse and stopped spending, recession would have become a self-fulfilling prophecy.Evidently, British consumers have the good sense to see the forecasts of doom as the anti-Brexit propaganda that they are.The economy is not roaring ahead, but strip away the gloomy headlines and there is more good news than bad.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It repeats endlessly that the withdrawal agreement is closed and that it isn’t going to reopen it.When the Brady amendment passed the House of Commons, saying Parliament would accept the dealthe backstop was replaced, the EU responded by saying they didn’t think this Parliament majority was “stable”.Thursday night’s vote helps them make that argument.As one No source laments: “We don’t want to give the Europeans a chance not to engage with us.”I understand that when the Brexit Secretary, Steve Barclay, dined in Brussels this week Sabine Weyand — the EU’s deputy negotiator — spent her time telling him that a customs union was the only major change available to the backstop.The EU think that Corbyn’s support for it means that a customs union could pass Parliament. I am told Barclay attempted to disabuse them of this idea.Mrs May can’t entirely escape blame for this week’s fiasco.No should have made sure that its own MPs were happy with the wording before publishing the motion.“She’s like a football team that can’t string two wins together,” complains one minister.But the Tory Brexit ultras should have paid more heed to the real-world consequences of their actions.Another effect of Thursday night’s defeat for the Government is that it increases the chances of the Cooper amendment passing on February .This would compel the Government to seek an extension to Article Mrs May hasn’t won Parliament’s support for an exit deal by March .One Cabinet minister, with close links to several of the ministers who might quit to ensure this amendment goes through, tells me it is now “much more likely” to pass.This Secretary of State complains that the Government’s defeat “makes it harder to make the argument that we should hold our nerve” as “the best evidence for holding your nerve was that the outcome would be the same as when the Brady amendment went through”.Another minister warns: “If she doesn’t come back with something cooking by the th, there’ll be trouble.”I understand those around Mrs May know they need to have shown progress by the th.One insider tells me: “If the Government doesn’t want Parliament to take control, they need to have a plan.They can’t just sit there for two weeks.”Other Cabinet ministers aren’t so sure Cooper will pass.One tells me: “I don’t think the ministers will resign, andthey don’t resign, then it doesn’t pass.”If Cooper does go through, politics will enter into an even more unpredictable phase. One May Cabinet ally is predicting a general electionthis happens.But it is hard to see how a general election could end in anything other than disaster for the Tories in these circumstances.If Mrs May is forced to ask the EU for an extension but with no Parliamentary agreement in sight, the EU is more likely to offer a long extension than a short one.I understand the view in several EU capitals is that the longer the extension, the more likely it is that the political dynamics in the UK will change.But a long extension would prolong this damaging, political uncertainty.This Government, and this Parliament’s, job is to get Brexit done. Time is running short. Both Parliament and the Government need to get their act together.But it may well be because the NHS – traditionally Labour’s strongest suit – is not the most important issue in politics right now.But that number is down to  per cent this winter, according to the pollster Ipsos Mori.The question now is whether the Tory decision to spend an extra £billion a year on the health service by  leads to a decline in public concern.But in January AE departments recorded their worst waiting times since the figures started being collected in .Matt Hancock, the new Health Secretary, is setting up a new NHS-X unit to try to bring the health service into the digital era, which would help the NHS to better use its resources.There are many things the Tories have to do to win the next election – not least, deliver Brexit – but they must also reassure voters on the NHS.Butthey can be ed they should be subject to the full force of the law.Justice must be done and must be seen to be done.Churchill wouldn’t have been Prime Minister but for the Labour Party’s willingness to serve in a government led by him.When it came to the crucial decision to fight on in , Clement Attlee and Arthur Greenwood, two Labour members of the War Cabinet, were more solid than some of Churchill’s Tory colleagues.But Attlee and Greenwood came from a very dferent Labour tradition to McDonnell: They weren’t Marxists or Trotskyists.There are some Labour MPs who are just not prepared to try to put into power people who are so outside the traditional bounds of the party.One minister likens the coming Tory leadership race to the  Grand National, when a crowded field led to a pile-up at the rd fence and the victory of the - outsider Foinavon.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We don’t believe they’ll get a No Deal exit either, and eventhey did the short-term chaos would kill their party.Instead Parliament would postpone Brexit, possibly finishing the Tories for a generation. This current purgatory would go on for months longer — maybe long enough for Remainers to reverse the referendum result.The Government would have failed in its only mission. It would instead have undermined our democracy and ensured bitter isions that would never heal.The one person unable to compromise, oddly, is the Prime Minister. Because what Brussels, Labour and Tory Remainers glibly ask of her, a permanent customs union, ALSO wrecks her party and destroys Brexit’s economic case.It was folly to expect the Tory ERG group to vote to “take No Deal off the table” on Thursday night. Logic was on their side, at least.But they need to think hard now how they will feel on March Brexit is put off and they are blamed. If they have opened the door to a toxic, anti-Semitic, anti-Western Labour rabble so crazed by ideology they cannot even allow Winston Churchill’s historic defeat of Nazism to trump his other failings.A party committed to massive tax rises, maybe even a  per cent windfall levy on anyone’s “wealth”. A party led by pension-age Marxist revolutionaries friendly to Putin, Hamas, the IRA and hard-left dictators but hard on private enterprise, job-creation and free speech.We sincerely hope Labour moderates stop dithering and resign to undermine Corbyn and McDonnell. We marvel that so many can still stomach these sinister men poised to do unimaginable harm.But eventhey can’t grasp that, Tory Brexiteers can. And we say this to them:Wake up. Look how close you now are to bringing this calamity about.WILL the Government squander the biggest potential shale gas discovery in our history It is believed there is enough under the East Midlands alone to power Britain cheaply for  years.Yet the Tories are suffocating this new industry at birth by persisting with an absurdly low limit on the level of tremor allowable when drilling.

And it was an old-school print journalist, the brilliant Anthony Loyd of The Times, who found Begum in a Syrian refugee camp containing almost , people.Loyd’s interview with her is a gripping insight into the twisted mind of a British youngster who ran off to join IS’s murderous caliphate. And the BBC had bugger all to do with it.While BBC staffers were sipping their skinny lattes and nibbling almond croissants in Broadcasting House, a journalist from The Times got his scoop the hard way, tramping into a chaotic refugee camp in one of the most dangerous parts of the world.Why does this matter  Because this country has one of the most vibrant newspaper industries on the planet.And the bloated, over-funded BBC is KILLING it.The Cairncross Review, a Government report into the future of UK journalism, revealed this week how tax-dodging tech giants Facebook and Google, together with the publicly-funded BBC are annihilating our free Press.They have already destroyed what was once affectionately known as “the local rag”.Over the past seven years, hundreds of local papers have shut down and thousands of regional journalists have lost their jobs. , journalists worked on local newspapers in  — now it is just ,. And it is your money that bankrolls the BBC.At a time when the BBC is contem­plating ditching free TV licences for the over-s, the debate we should REALLY be having is about how much of your money we should be chucking at Auntie.We have a great newspaper industry and it is worth preserving.Because it wasn’t the BBC that broke the story of MPs fiddling their expenses — it was a newspaper . And it wasn’t the BBC that broke the story about charity Age UK receiving £million from an energy company to flog gas and electricity to pensioners — it was a newspaper .It wasn’t the BBC that dared to publish the names of the killers of Stephen Lawrence — it was a newspaper .And what was the most-read story on the BBC last year  Strictly minx Katya Jones snogging Seann Walsh  — a Sun on Sunday exclusive.The BBC, like Facebook and Google, is a parasite that lives off the flesh of real news-gatherers.What makes the BBC dferent from the tax-dodging tech giants is that we love it. And you can’t grow up in this country and not have a deep and abiding affection for the BBC.I have endless happy memories of the BBC — from Match Of The Day to Top Of The Pops, from David Attenborough documentaries to The Likely Lads, from Fawlty Towers to the Hairy Cornflake.But the BBC has got far too big, far too bloated and far too wealthy.Lord Reith, the visionary behind it, wanted our state broadcaster to “inform, educate and entertain”. Lord Reith never dreamed of a state broadcaster that was all-powerful.The BBC gets far too much of your money and spends it far too easily. Why does the BBC need to be over every nook and cranny of the internet To the generation growing up on Netflix and YouTube with an entire universe on their smartphones, the BBC pocketing more than £ a year from everyone with a TV set is absurd.The BBC has got too big for its publicly-funded boots.That’s what we should be talking about — not the merits of free TV licences for granny and grandad!The Cairncross Review told how the BBC’s expansionist online empire has come very close to destroying the local newspaper industry.Are we really going to keep giving the BBC £billion every year so it can do the same to the national newspaper industry In the same week as the Cairncross Review came out, Bruce Sharma, , fought off thieves armed with a hammer and a machete with just his rolled-up copy of The Sun.Bruce was reading The Sun in Ram Stores in Long Eaton, Derbys, when the hooded pair burst in demanding money. “Instinct took over and I tried to whack them with the paper,” says Bruce.You can’t do that with a TV licence.GORDON Banks lit up my childhood.For my generation – a wide-eyed kid on that magical summer’s day in  – those World Cup winners will always feel like family.Gordon never got a knighthood.

Whatever that time period is, thats the period of time I believe he went unconscious.The oxygen available for the passengers was about  minutes, so the passengers were all dead, theres no chance they were resuscitated, they were dead long before that plane hit the water.Last week, an air crash investigator has said the Malaysian Airline fligh was crashed deliberately in a “murder-suicide” and he could prove it.Canadian aviation expert Larry Vance said he was “certain” either captain Shah or his co-pilot took over the plane in what he said was “criminal event” and “made it disappear forever”.Mystery has surrounded the disappearance of the Malaysia Airlines flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March ,  when the plane simply vanished with  passengers and crew on board and has not been found.Vance, who previously worked for the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, told CBC News: “It’s not an accident. This was planned and conducted, carried out by one inidual who had control of the aeroplane via his job to have control of the plane.”He claimed that the pilot or co-pilot made the decision “to take it to a remote part of the ocean and make it disappear forever”.Passengers included Chinese calligraphers, a couple on their way home to their young sons after a long-delayed honeymoon and a construction worker who hadnt been home in a year.But at .am on March , , Malaysia Airlines lost contact with MH close to Phuket island in the Strait of Malacca.Before that, Malaysian authorities believe the last words heard from the plane, from either the pilot or co-pilot, was Good night Malaysian three seven zero.Satellite pings from the aircraft suggest it continued flying for around seven hours when the fuel would have run out.Experts have calculated the most likely crash site around , miles west of Perth, Australia.But a huge search of the seabed failed to find any wreckage - and there are a number of alternative theories as to its fate.Vance spent  months doing research for his book MH Mystery Solved, but he was not part of the official investigation by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau.Vance’s theory has not been accepted by everyone.Former head of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau Martin Dolan said on  Minutes: “The evidence is not yet sufficient to draw as firm a conclusion as you appear to have done.”He said there were two possible theories - that someone was in control of the plane or not - and that “there’s evidence that supports both of those theories”.Dolan added: The evidence is not yet sufficient to draw as firm a conclusion as you appear to have done.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000469847046.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"worlds worst tramp stamp tattoos","story":"A cringe-inducing gallery of the worlds worst tramp stamp tattoos will make you think twice about getting your lower-back inked."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000450450690.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"eu lorries security checks no deal brexit avoid jams hmrc customs","story":"HMRC will this week declare a six month “standstill” in an admission that Border Force is nowhere near ready to cope with the extra administration.They have already waived the need for goods declarations at U.K. ports because of fears of massive jams.The Sun last week revealed the Home Office wanted hauliers to fill out -point safety and security forms in the event of No Deal.

Billionaire Brexiteer Sir Jim Ratclfe, who built up the chemicals giant Ineos, is understood to have been working with the accountant PwC on the tax avoidance plan. Labour’s John McDonnell said: “This is a super-rich person. We’re not talking about someone who’s on his uppers. “For every penny that’s avoided in this way in taxation, what does that mean  It means the NHS doesn’t treat patients, it means our children don’t get the full investment in their education and it means less safety on our streets.“I appeal to people like this - this is a great country to live in, just make your contribution like the rest of us.” Sir Jim was knighted less than a year ago for “services to business and investment.” It comes after Sir James Dyson, another vocal Brexit supporter, announced he was moving the HQ of his vacuum cleaner company to Singapore. The Sunday Times reports that Sir Jims plan would see him and senior executives Andy Currie and John Reece legally share between poundbn and poundbn tax-free, depriving the Treasury of between poundm and poundbn. Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, described Ratclfes planning as deeply cynical. He said: There are thousands of our constituents who are being bankrupted by HM Revenue  Customs action over small-scale tax avoidance while big fish like Ratclfe are just treating taxation as purely voluntary.   The idea that we should be dishing out knighthoods to people who have no commitment to this country is rather shameful. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: The greed of these super-rich tax avoiders seems to have no bounds. Dont they realise that every penny they hide away in their tax havens is a penny not spent on our NHS treating the sick, or social care looking after our lonely, isolated elderly, or the education of our children  Meg Hillier, the Labour chairwoman of the public accounts committee, said Ratclfe was in effect sticking two fingers up at the country that had honoured him.  The -year old businessman was named the UK’s richest person in May , after amassing a fortune of pound. billion. He was born in Failsworth, near Manchester, and lived in a council house until he was . He attended Beverley Grammar School in Hull, before graduating from Birmingham University with a degree in chemical engineering in . After working for Esso, he moved into finance, joining private equity firm Advent International in . He ed to the chemicals industry in , when he founded Ineos, now valued at pound billion. A keen outdoorsman, who has made expeditions to the North and South Poles, Sir Jim also founded the charity Go Run for Fun, which encourages children between five and  to get more active by arranging celebrity events. In  he made a pound million donation to the London Business School. And he made waves in  for the tough line he took with workers at Grangemouth in Falkirk, Scotland’s biggest industrial site. After a dispute over the suspension of a shop steward, he closed the plant and vowed to walk away for good unless workers accepted major cuts to their pensions and conditions. And he faced a furious reaction after it emerged he had conducted the operation while holidaying on his superyacht in the French port of La Ciotat. The year after, Ineos benefited from a poundm government-backed loan guarantee to help it build a gas storage tank at Grangemouth. Ineos told the Sunday Times it had  companies in  jurisdictions that regularly paid idends within the group.

Jeremy Wright said he would look at all possible options for penalties in the Governments forthcoming White Paper on online harms, as pressure mounted on internet companies to take action to safeguard vulnerable people. It comes as a new report called for an independent watchdog to regulate social media companies, and hefty fines for those who fail to act on harmful content. The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee delivered its final report on disinformation and fake news today , concluding: “Social media companies cannot hide behind the claim of being merely a ‘’ and maintain that they have no responsibility themselves in regulating the content of their sites.” They said this should apply both to harmful material such as self harm images as well as disinformation intended to subvert Britain’s political process.  Tom Watson, Labour ’s Deputy leader and Shadow Culture Secretary agreed, saying: “The era of self-regulation for tech companies must end immediately.“We need new independent regulation with a tough powers and sanctions regime to curb the worst excesses of surveillance capitalism and the forces trying to use technology to subvert our democracy. “Few iniduals have shown contempt for our Parliamentary democracy in the way Mark Zuckerberg has. If one thing is uniting politicians of all colours during this dficult time for our country, it is our determination to bring him and his company into line.”  Mr Wright expects to meet Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg during a visit to the United States this week.He said there was no doubt internet companies cannot be relied upon to take action themselves. He told the BBC: I think whats important is that we have a system in place that sets out clearly what the responsibilities of online companies are, sets out how we expect them to meet those responsibilities and sets out what will happenthey fail to do so, and the White Paper will do that. Askedthat included criminal sanctions, he said: We will consider all possible options for penalties and its important I think that those companies that we will be talking to and those companies from whom well expect a positive response to this understand that there are meaningful sanctions available to usthey dont do what they should. Thats what I think we owe the families of those teenagers. Mr Wright said the Government would be judged on how well the proposals succeed in making the internet a safer place. Thats what people expect of us, he added.   His comments follow intense pressure on social networks to take action in safeguarding vulnerable people, highlighted by the case of Molly Russell, who took her le aged .Her family found material relating to depression and suicide when they looked at her Instagram account after her death.A White Paper on online harms will be published by the Government by the end of winter setting out expectations for social media companies, followed by a consultation over the summer that will set out new laws that could enforce the removal of harmful content. The DCMS committee report went on to recommend electoral law be toughened up for the digital age to cope with increasing claims of overseas interference in British democracy. And it repeated the committee’s calls for the Government to make a statement about the number of investigations being carried out into Russian interference in UK politics.

With weeks of nothing but a few slices of bread stretching out in front of the engaged couple and their unborn baby, Jaedyn put out a desperate plea to their new community. The response from kind-hearted locals was astonishing. As soon as his request for advice about food banks began to circulate online residents rallied together to donate a huge hamper of food. Where before they had the bare essentials, the couple quickly found themselves with a fridge full of bacon, fruit, soup, pasta, crisps, bread and dozens of tins, as well as eggs, milk, butter and cheese. The pair said the food haul will last them up to two months and will help four-weeks pregnant Lizzie to enjoy a healthy pregnancy.   Jaedyn said: I was amazed by the response we got, we didnt expect it at all. We had food from about three people, picked up by one of the ladies and dropped to us all on the first night that we had put the post up. And then from there to yesterday we have had four more people drop food to us. While doctors have recommended that the teen should not work at the moment, he is still looking for a job to make ends meet.   Jaedyn continued: The universal rate for being signed off is awful to live on so Im still looking for part time work, even when advised by the doctors not to be in work for the time being. I struggle quite badly with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and I also have problems with my chest and breathing which makes physical tasks dficult, still waiting on x-ray and blood results to figure out why my breathing is so limited. I can barely make it up a set of stairs without gasping for air so any physically job wouldnt work. As well as the food the couple received plenty of advice as to which food banks to go to and how to get vouchers.   Jaedyns heartbreaking appeal on the Erdington community group on Sunday, February  read: Me and my misses are new to areaand we have been here for about four months now.

The first thing that struck me was how thin our atmosphere is.It’s not the sprawling, beautul blue sky we’re used to, it’s paper-thin. Then the blackness of space, darker than you can ever imagine. There isn’t one astronaut who doesn’t have their nose pressed against the window, awestruck. When I was six, on  May , the US launched the first American astronaut into space. My school had us all watching it on a small black and white TV. That moment changed my le forever – I was determined to one day go into space. Space exploration is one of the most competitive careers ever, and when the application process opens every couple of years, only a handful are selected.    A physics degree is the minimum to get in, so I got a masters and doctorate in engineering, but it still wasn’t enough. I was turned down three times. Only when I got my pilot’s licence, learnt to sky e and got a job at NASA did I finally get through. My fourth attempt, at  years old. I’ll never forget the moment I was told I’d been signed up for my first space mission. I was working in Mission Control, talking to the astronauts up in space, when I got the call – I would be in the next mission going up in two years. I hung up the phone and wanted to scream, but I still had another seven hours of work before I could get in my car and really let go! By the time my first flight came along, I’d been training for four years for one -day mission. NASA prepares us for everything, the idea being to have all the experiences on Earth, so there are no surprises in space. We fly in jet aircraft and special planes capable of creating -second periods of zero-gravity. We train underwater for space walks. We also undergo extensive, continual medical checks.   Everyone on the mission is trained to have a unique skill – I was responsible for the science experiments on board Then two astronauts on every mission are ex-military test pilots, responsible for flying and landing the shuttle.Two people are also intensively trained to be able to do everything, in case someone gets sick. But we all have basic knowledge – let’s just say I could land us home, just not all that well! One thing NASA doesn’t want is anyone getting sick. A week before launch we’re in quarantine. We have to eat carefully prepared food, so we don’t risk poisoning.Every person we come in contact with has had a full check – we can’t risk getting a cold.The space sickness is bad enough, which around a third of astronauts suffer from, puking their guts up from motion sickness. You can imagine what vomit does up there… Not pleasant.  Launch morning on my first mission was the most exciting day of my le. I was lying on my back, strapped in on top of a lumpy parachute, where I lay for three hours before take off.Then I heard the countdown, and three big engines started rumbling up to full power, causing the spacecraft and me to shake.At lt off I felt a push, assomeone had their hand on the small of my back, hoisting me up. I was screaming like I was on a roller-coaster because I knew nobody could hear me, not even the seven other astronauts I was going up with.Of course there was some fear, but it’s % nerves and % exhilaration. Not for my we, though, who told me she hated that launch morning more than anything. It takes eight and a half minutes to get into space,  miles above the Earth. It becomes eerily silent once you make it.Then you unstrap yourself and float out of your seat. We orbit the Earth every half an hour, and see  sunrises and sunsets every day. On my first ever day in space, I looked out of the window and a flash caught my eye. Every second it would go, getting closer and closer.I couldn’t believe on my first day in space I’d made contact with the unknown! But my alien turned out to be a chunk of ice that had come off the shuttle and was flashing every time it hit sunlight.Another amazing sight was a giant ball of light flashing past. A shooting star. Of course I made a wish – to get home safely. My first mission was to further explore the effects of zero gravity on liquids and fire. Liquids form perfectly round balls, and fire also becomes either droplets or big fire balls too.We take plants and small animals up to observe how they grow and behave. Since then we’ve done plenty of other experiments.  We work -hour days with - hours sleep , an hour for lunch and dinner, and a free hour for exercise.We have magnetic chess sets, and we love playing human catch – one of the crew tucks themselves into a ball and we throw him to each other.As for human contact, it’s important to have communication with home. Whenever we passed over America, I always felt a million miles away, like I was detached from my le.I could send and receive one short email from my we each day, and once during a two week mission she was allowed in Mission Control to speak with me on the phone. When the mission was finally over, getting back is the easy bit. You slow down, turn the shuttle around, fire up the engines and start falling so fast that you can see flames as the atmosphere hits around , degrees.We landed smoothly and were welcomed with a huge lunch at NASA – lasagne, salad and cookies – before they flew us home.After I’d hugged my we, the first thing I did was order a pepperoni pizza. The space food is bland – by the end of a mission I couldn’t wait to eat good food. There are many amazing things about being an astronaut, but you have to savour every second of space time – during my  years, I only spent  days in space.One downside of being home is flying on a plane is now extremely slow and boring. I resent how it takes me nine hours to get to England from America – it could be done in  minutes! It also ruins space movies. Gravity drove me crazy. Even in the opening scene I was saying, ‘They’ve got that wrong!’ Now I’m too old for space travel and have retired, but I teach children of the wonders of space every day. When you’ve had an adrenaline rush like space travel, it’s hard to know what’s next. My dream is to receive a call from someone who I’ve inspired to follow in my footsteps.

While many types of the vile disease come with few symptoms, others have signs which can help identy it as quickly as possible. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK. The causes are unknown, but the chances of developing it increase as you get older. It develops slowly, and many men dont see any symptoms for years. It isnt until the prostate becomes large enough to affect the tube which carries urine out of the bladder and out of the penis that some of the tell-tell signs start to appear.  According to the NHS , there are seven things all men should be checking for in their wee which could be a tell-tell sign of the disease.They are:Needing to pee more frequently, often during the night Needing to rush to the toilet Dficulty in starting to peeStraining or taking a long time while peeing Weak flow Feeling that your bladder has not emptied fully Blood in urine or semenThere are a number of tests which can help diagnose prostate cancer, all of which your doctor should be able to arrange. They are a blood test, a physical prostate examination, and MRI or a biopsy. If the disease is caught early it can be treated through radiotherapy or surgery to remove it. Howeverit isnt caught until later it can spread to other parts of the body. Experts dont know why, but prostate cancer is more common in men of African-Caribbean or African descent and Asian men are less likely to be affected.

Members of the public tried to treat Mr Edwardes as he lost pints of blood while they waited for emergency services to arrive.   His flatmate described his horror in graphic detail, explaining how the pair had just entered the water and were paddling out close to shore when the shark struck. He said: “Keen for a wave this morning, went for a surf and had literally only just paddled out of the water. “I was about  metres behind him , he sat up on his board and instantly a shark smashed up from underneath and knocked him clean off his board.   “There was a lot of thrashing and splashing.

The joint letter states: “The BBC leadership must be brave. “It must say ending free licences for the over-s is wrong-headed and isive, acknowledge funding this welfare benefit would trigger an end to our public service broadcaster as we know it, and say it must now be down to Government to take back responsibility for this benefit.” The letter says a third of over-s are living in poverty or just above the poverty line and the TV is “vital companionship and entertainment”.

They found fumes from the meal were  times more polluting than a London roadside and  times over World Health Organisation safe outdoor limits. The shock levels were far higher than expected by scientists. Tests detected tiny particles, PM.s, that are inhaled and linked to heart disease, stroke and lung cancer, which contribute to , early deaths in Britain each year. Over a day, in a purpose-built home in Austin, Texas, the HOMEChem project produced and tested meals such as a full English breakfast, a vegetable stir fry for lunch, roast turkey for dinner and pies for dessert.  WHO safe limits of  micrograms of PM. per cubic metre were exceeded for eight-and-a-half hours out of the . Heating and burning during cooking produces particles, with some food producing more than others. A roast turkey dinner saw pollution levels hit  micrograms per cubic metre. The most PM.s appeared to be produced when Brussels sprouts were charred.  A similar cooking style for vegetables in stir fries was just as polluting as cooked meats. Burning fats in meat or adding them to frying and roast pans also gave high levels. Other sources of PM.s were oils left on electric hobs, heated saucepans and open flames on gas stoves. High levels generally lingered for about an hour after the cooker was used. Even putting two pieces of bread in a toaster produced  micrograms which stayed in the air for about  minutes afterwards. Lead researcher Prof Marina Vance, of the University of Colorado, said: “We were all a bit shocked when we saw our first measurement.  This is the most comprehensive ever assessment of chemistry in a home. These high-end instruments have never really been used to detect pollution levels indoors.” Levels detected dwarfed our Government’s Air Quality Index highest warning rating for outdoors. When there are - micrograms per cubic metre the public is warned to avoid strenuous exercise outdoors. The results were unveiled at the shyAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington, D.C.  Prof Vance said studies are linking long-term exposure to particles with brain ageing and increased stress levels. Leading British pollution expert Prof Ian Colbeck, of Essex University, said: “A roast is one of the worst ways of cooking as regards indoor air pollution. “However once you stop cooking, concentrations shygradshyshyuallyto background levels.” The AAAS also heard that children in homes with vinyl floors had far higher levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers — toxic, fire retardant compounds — in their blood.   Always cook using the extractor fan The shock findings of the HOMEChem study has sparked an urgent call to families to ventilate their kitchens. Prof Marina Vance said: “We’ve been telling ourselves ‘boil everything, don’t roast’ but roasts are just too delicious.”   The researchers advise while cooking to: open windows always use extractor fans and hobs at the back of the cooker keep your cooker and pans clean of oils heat on as low a temperature as possible and boiling food on electric hobs is best. Prof Vance said: “Use an exhaust hood, try to ventilate your home while you’re cooking. That’s really my prime piece of advice. “Before, I only used the oven hood ventilatorI was cooking something smelly.

Alex Skeel had boiling water poured over him, was physically attacked, denied food and kept isolated from loved ones by partner Jordan Worth, who was later jailed. The -year-old was just  days from death when help finally reached him, reports the Sunday Express . Worth, , admitted grievous bodily harm and coercive controlling behaviour and was jailed for seven-and-a-half years at Luton Crown Court in April . Worth and Alex met at college in  when they were both  and the court was told from the abuse started early in the relationship.  My toddler son stopped eating and speaking because he watched his dad abuse me  A film about Alexs ordeal, Abused By My Girlfriend, narrated by Alex himself, is on BBC Three tomorrow. The case is said to be one of the most extreme cases of domestic violence witnessed by Bedfordshire Police. The film examines why Alex felt he couldnt escape and why he was reluctant to tell friends and family. His own family contribute to the film, including his twin brother, close friends and police. There is also footage of police interviews with Skeel and Worth. Worth is a picture of calmness as she is accused of cutting her boyfriend across the elbow, together with hitting him with a hammer. The kne wound was caused by Alex attempting to protect his head from her attack and required dozens of stitches.   In the film Alex catalogued countless days of injuries and coercive behaviour, some involving social media in which Worth would tell his family to stop communicating on Facebook . He was also told what to wear, periodically starved and hit with a beer bottle. The film begins with Alex explaining how he received his scars. He says: Thats where I got burned, my scars tell a story.   Thats stab wounds... they were caused by hammers hitting the skin. When police found me I was told I was  days away from death. I was in love in Jordan and it took me a long time to have the courage to say she was abusing me. People ask me why didnt you walk away, but its so complicated.

It boasts lots of impressive facilities including a new sports complex, a dedicated art block, a performing arts centre and climbing walls. American fashion designer Misha Nonoo, who is believed to have set Meghan and Harry up, attended ACS Eghams sister school, so the couple are likely to have heard all about its methods.

Brave Elizabeth Wagner was dealt the devastating blow just months after welcoming her second son, Elijah, into the world, the Liverpool Echo reports. Her family now fear that the terrible morning sickness that she suffered throughout her pregnancy was actually a symptom of the deadly disease.Her sister Hannah Wagner, , said: She was sick right through her pregnancy but thought it was morning sickness all the way through. We dont know nowthat was a symptom. Healthcare assistant Elizabeth, who also has a three-year-old boy, Ethan, with her partner Jairo, gave birth to little Elijah three months ago.   But days later, she was taken to hospital after developing excruciating pains in her sides. Doctors later told her she had  liver abscesses. And last week, she and her family were given the heartbreaking news that she actually had liver cancer, which was very rare and advanced. They have been told there is nothing medics can do.Now, Elizabeths loved ones are desperately appealing for help in funding a potentially le-saving proton beam therapy treatment that is not available on the NHS.If the treatment is identied as an option for the mum-of-two, she would need to travel to the USA for treatment - at a cost that her family cannot cover. Hannah told the Echo: She means so much to all of us.  None of us want to lose her. Shes the one whos crazy and funny and shes got two boys - she doesnt deserve to lose out on seeing them grow up. Elizabeth, from Walton, Liverpool, works at Fazakerley Hospital. Her family claim her cancer was initially missed by healthcare professionals. Hannah said: She started having pains in her side and it was after she had just given birth and she thought it was something to do with the pregnancy. That was pretty much straight [after having Elijah]. Elizabeth also suffered from sickness throughout her pregnancy. Her sister added: She didnt do anything about it after giving birth and then after a week or so her boyfriend took her to the AE because she was in that much pain.   It was during Elizabeths admission to hospital in December that doctors found  abscesses on her liver, which they opted to try and treat with a course of antibiotics. However, earlier this month, the new mother and her family say they were told that the abscesses were actually liver cancer - and doctors couldnt do anything. Elizabeth had only just moved into her new house with her young family. Devoted Jairo has now had to take on all the responsibilities of becoming a father again - while caring for his partner and making her healthy food. Hannah said: He has been amazing - hes looking after the kids, taking care of her, making her healthy food, he doesnt take his eyes off her. She added that the couple are planning to tie the knot in April.   Elizabeths family have set up a GoFundMe page in a bid to raise pound, to fund her travel and treatment in America. In a post on the page, Hannah writes: I am asking as many people as possible to please give us as much or as little as you can spare. This would enable us to be in a position to try and save my sisters le, we have no other options available to us. Elizabeth is a devoted partner to Jairo and an amazing mum to her two very young boys, she has so much to live for and is ready to fight this illness, we just need a bit of financial help.To visit the familys GoFundMe page or to donate, click here  "},{"url":null,"title":"prince george princess charlotte exciting","story":"NewsPrince George and Princess Charlotte may have exciting half term planned with Kate and WillsKate Middleton and Prince William dont appear to have any official engagements this week, and Prince George and Princess Charlotte are on half termShareCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience Editor:,  FEB NewsThe Cambridges love skiing \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailChildren up and down the country are looking forward to a week of fun next week as they get ready for half term.

The man, known only as Joe Donor, claims to have fathered more than  across the planet, with his latest conquest being Oz where he hopes to father  babies. And he has admitted he wants to father , kids. He told Aussie chat show  Minutes that it his program of impregnation was his les work - but critics say his methods are dangerous and he takes advantage of vulnerable women. Advertising his services on Facebook to women all over the world, Joe usually impregnates the women through natural sex - and says he has been with women aged from  to , but is not looking for anything more. He said: I’m basically only having sex to get women pregnant. I’m not chasing rainbows or fantasies. He went to Australia with no medical checks, background checks or legal contracts to protect himself or the women he impregnates.   He added: Some people they want to do a background check, or a drug test. And I’m like you know you’re not giving me the keys to the nuclear missiles, we’re just making a baby. Adding that his clients do not need to know his history or personal details, he believes fundamentally that they are after a pregnancy, “not an autobiography”. But his comments left legal and medical professionals outraged - with lawyer Stephen Page believing Joe Donor is dangerous. He said: I just think he’s mad, and dangerous, and these women shouldn’t be going anywhere near him. Page has urged any children born to Joe Donor to claim child support and inheritance from him should he die, adding: Mate, just give it a break. Stop doing it. You’re not God.   You’re screwing up these women’s lives, and you’re potentially screwing up the lives of all the kids that you’ve created. Joes first port call in Oz was Melbourne to visit same-sex couple Sharney and Liz - who say they were desperate to have a child, but could not afford the cost of IVF treatment. Sharney, who said her first thought when meeting him at the airport was that he was very short, said: It honestly was an opportunity that we couldn’t not take. Sharney requested a delivery of Joe’s semen rather than sex, which he did less than six hours after arriving in Australia - and says the encounter was uncomfortable. She added: It was very awkward, but I tried to make it so that it was as quick as possible, so that then my we and I could share in the moment of making a baby.   I wanted to make that private and create that special moment between us. But Sharney’s attempt to fall pregnant with Joe Donor’s sperm was not successful, which she said was extremely disappointing. She said: Especially because there is so much hype around Joe, we were definitely hopeful there would be an advantage, but maybe not. What’s he getting out of it  That’s the thing, I’m honestly not really sure, it’s really strange. Following the experience, Sharney and Liz began having second thoughts about Joe Donor and instead went to a fertility clinic. But on his Australian tour, he did manage to give another couple, Tracey and Bella, their eighth child - having already used another sperm donor for one of their previous seven.  In his interview, Joe Donor said he has delivered his semen to women in Queensland, southern Victoria, Adelaide and Sydney and believed he did not give anyone an STI by having sex with multiple women. He said: I’m helping women achieve their dreams. He showed the reporter, who labelled him arrogant and deluded, his hotel room where he keeps his tools - including a syringe to “aspirate the sperm” as well as a cup or zip lock bag to collect the semen.

Loris letter in full Its Valentine’s Day. A day full of love, chocolates and flowers. For me, it is more than that now. Last Valentine’s Day was the last time I saw you. You wore a black and white dress. Your long dark hair dangled. Your makeup looked just right. Of course, your white Converse sneakers protected your feet as you walked in to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.Valentine’s Day is now about memories. Today, like all days, I remember. I remember you weren’t looking forward to going to school that day. Like many  year old girls, you wanted a Valentine and were disappointed that you didn’t have one. High school love is magic. I was  once and those butterflies had whirled inside of me too. I wanted that for you. I remember the golden gt bag I gave you that morning. It held a pair of diamond earrings to make you feel pretty, a chocolate bar to make you smile, and hair ties so you wouldn’t ask for mine.   I touched your ears, putting the stems of the earrings through your lobes. You said you were ready to go to school after that. You opened the car door. “I love you,” I said. “I love you, too,” you said.Valentine’s Day. The last time I saw you alive. ****A year has been a long time without you. So much has happened I want to tell you about. I watch your brothers miss you terribly. They want you to know they miss fighting with you. They say thank you for convincing dad to get unlimited WiFi. Dad fights for you every day. He’s your voice.   Grammy has honored you and became a school safety activist. We got a dog! Her name is Roxy and she’s a soccer player, like you. She kicks the ball around the yard, but sometimes puts it in her mouth. And your soccer team...wow, what a group. They wear your number eight on their sleeves and have started using it sideways to honor you. Infinity. Oh, and I found out about the time you jumped off a bridge down by the beach !Alyssa, you jumped off a bridge ! **** There are things I do in your memory that I never thought I could or would ever do.See, a mother’s protective instincts don’t leave when we lose the ones we love. I talk to other moms who have lost children. We talk about you. We talk about their kids. But when we look into each other’s eyes, we see it. A fire. I ran for the school board. I won! I screamed on national TV—words of rage directed at the President! I started a non-profit called Make Our Schools Safe and there is a law named after you in New Jersey--Alyssa’s Law.  **** Mothers know. Intuition prevails. Mine came as soon as someone told me there’d been a shooting at school. I knew you were gone. Rabbi Gutnick said, “Have faith, Lori.” I said, “No, you must start planning now.” You were with me. I knew it.We lost  students and three teachers.  beautul people we, as a community, needed to bury. You were the first. The next day, Rabbi Gutnick presided and hundreds of people came from all over the country. If you remember from Bat Mitzvah classes, shivas last seven days when a loved one dies. In those seven days, I got so many hugs from people who loved you. From family. From people I’d never met. So many that I injured my neck. People, in a sense, loved me until it hurt. ****It’s Valentine’s Day.As I remember you, grief washes over me. But that grief emboldens me to fight for change.

The ships were anchored well within British territory when it made the order to leave Spanish waters. The Gibraltar Chronicle obtained radio traffic between the boats, which allegedly told the boats they were “violating the condition of innocent passage”.The Royal Navy’s Gibraltar Squadron despatched two vessels, HMS Scimitar and a inflatable boat to shadow the ship.The Tornado then kept close to the Gibraltar coast line as it sailed out through the straight out of British controlled waters.   A spokesman for the Gibraltar Government told the Gibraltar Chronicle that officials were aware of the incident. “Her Majesty’s Government of Gibraltar is verying every aspect of the incident in order to ensure that appropriate action is taking as soon as possible,” the spokesman told the Chronicle. “Gibraltar VTS ensured that the vessels in question did not act in consequence of the illegal Spanish instructions.” “There is only nuisance value to these foolish games being played by those who don’t accept unimpeachable British sovereignty over the waters around Gibraltar as recognised by the whole world under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.” “It seems there are still some in the Spanish Navy who think they can flout international law.” “This probably accounts for the state of extremism of some parts of the Spanish political spectrum these days.” "},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c6694ff345281.70409936.jpg ","title":"dundee move was easy decision for aberdeens scott wright to make","story":"Leaving a squad challenging at the top of the table for one struggling at the bottom may seem like a big decision for any young footballer to make.One that you might need a bit of time to think over.For Dundee’s on-loan winger Scott Wright, however, a phone call to Dens Park boss Jim McIntyre was all it took to convince him to head down from Aberdeen.And just two games into his temporary switch to dark blue, the Scotland U  international is already convinced his snap decision was the right one.“I’m loving it here and all the boys are making me feel really welcome. Now it’s a question of getting settled in as quick as I can and just playing football,” he said.“I had obviously spoken to Derek McInnes and he said to speak to Jim McIntyre before making any decision.“The gaffer at Aberdeen left it up to me.“He told me he’d love to have me still up there butI wanted to go and get games he understood.“So I spoke to the gaffer here on the phone and I loved everything he had to say. I jumped at the chance to come down here.”And the -year-old sees the draws against Hamilton and Kilmarnock since he arrived as proof this is a squad that can pull away from the relegation zone between now and the end of the season.“The only frustrating thing for me so far is that we’ve not taken six points out of six from the two games I’ve been involved in but I think all the fans and us as a team can feel from those performances that we are building momentum.“In the Hamilton game it was a case of everyone trying to get used to each other. A lot of us had only come in right before the deadline and we only really had one training session together.“It was about trying to get to know everyone’s games, their personalities. I think we are all starting to gel now and you can see that on the pitch.“Not having a game last weekend because we’re out of the cup has given us a bit more time to work on that. That gives us a better picture going into the game against Livingston this weekend.”Today’s trip to the Tony Macaroni Arena to face Livingston is a meeting with a team who have taken the Premiership by storm this term but have been struggling for a win of late.Since thumping Hearts - in mid-December, Gary Holt’s team have not won in eight outings. Wright does not see that as a sign this could be an easy  minutes for Dundee.“We have to treat it that every game from now on is going to be a big game for us and this will be.“We know how Livi will be and they will work hard but all we can do is just prepare the way we want to and work on how we can play. Hopefully, that will be enough.“They haven’t won in a few games but it’s a testimony to Livi how many points they have. They started the season so well.”Today, of course, will see Dundee asked to play on Livi’s much-criticised plastic pitch.The debate over their use has surfaced again this week via the PFA canvassing their members for views on them. While Wright is very much in the camp that prefers grass surfaces, the articial surface is not something he’s going to gripe about.“All we can do is get on with it and we are not going to use the pitch as an excuse,” he added.“Playing in Scotland, you get used to them.“However, I think having everyone playing on grass is something that would benefit the top league.“You prepare for a team each week but, for these games, you also have to prepare for the pitch as well.“All we can do as players is give our opinion about them.”"},{"url":null,"title":"gomis set to take over as dundee united target hat trick of wins down at queen of the south","story":"Veteran Morgaro Gomis is set to take over in midfield when Dundee United try to make it three wins on the bounce as they head for Queen of the South today.The -year-old is expected to replace Calum Butcher, who will serve the first game of a two-match ban after his red card in the Scottish Cup win at St Mirren last weekend.His second game on the sidelines will be the cup quarter-final against Ross County or Inverness Caley Thistle which has been confirmed for Sunday, March  at pm.The game is also being televised live on BBC Scotland.As well as continuing their recent winning run, the Tangerines will be looking for their third success of the campaign over Queens.To do that, though, manager Robbie Neilson is well aware they will have to keep in-form home striker Stephen Dobbie quiet.His spectacular strike in the cup at Aberdeen on Sunday was the -year-old’s th goal in just  appearances this term.“He has been on fire lately and someone we will have to get to grips with,” said Robbie.“He has a lot of quality, he knows how to score goals.“He’s just a very good player and I think he has the freedom of Dumfries these days.

They have some very good players,” he said.“The first thing we have to do is try to win our battles but don’t forget they have scored some quality goals, some good team goals.“We have to try to make sure inidually we get the better of them and try to go and create opportunities to win the game.”Dundee go into the clash with controversy over plastic pitches like Livi’s rekindled by a PFA survey showing top-flight players are unied in opposition to them.The manager is also in that camp but hasn’t forgotten that defeat at the Tony Macaroni in his first game in charge was down to what happened in the air and not the surface.That day back in October his team conceded four goals from set pieces.“We didn’t deal with set plays and that killed us. It was an eye-opener that day in terms of what we had to work with,” he said.“There’s no doubt, though, the surface is an advantage. I was the manager of a team, Queen of the South, who had an articial surface andyou train on it every day it’s a definite help.“At the same time I’m not trying to detract from how well Livingston have done because they’ve done exceptionally well.”Dundee are still nursing a few niggling injuries from that Killie draw, but it’s hoped everyone who was on duty then will be available. Midfielder Ethan Robson is expected to recover in time from the groin injury that forced him to miss that game."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c6693c1dcc3e1.49955226.jpg ","title":"party goers turning dundee street into bottle graveyard","story":"Locals fear streets around one of Dundee’s busiest nightle spots are turning into a “bottle graveyard”.Areas around South Ward Road have been left in a mess in recent months, with revellers knocking back booze on the streets and using electrical boxes as tables before moving on to city nightspots.Pictures taken earlier this week show beer cans and bottles of spirits dumped opposite the petrol station.One local said the area was particularly bad yesterday morning after party-goers had been out on the town.He said: “I came down Thursday morning just before am.“I was greeted with sick, urine, bottles of spirits and empty cans of beer.“It always seems to be worse on a Thursday morning after a Wednesday evening.“It’s a bottle graveyard on the way into work.“I would assume most of the revellers are partaking in student nights out and are trying to save themselves a few quid.“I feel sorry for the street sweepers who need to clean these areas up because it’s a total disgrace.“This isn’t a one-off either as it’s happening every week.“I came down today and it was totally clear, which leads me to believe it’s a problem related to Wednesday nights.”Despite the worries of residents, owners of nightclubs in the area have denied any knowledge of their customers drinking in the streets before entering their premises.The owner of Carbon and Kush nightclub on South Ward Road, Tahir Ramzan, said he was unaware of issues of alcohol being consumed on the surrounding streets.He said: “This is the first I’ve heard about this.“Anything that happens en route to the club is outwith our control.“The problem isn’t directly outside the clubs and might be impacting more on the petrol garage.“We certainly don’t have issues with our customers who come in during the week.

table will be hammer blow to their chances of overtaking second placed Rangers in the Premiership.The only positive, albeit minor, is that the Dons did not lose ground on Rangers who were held - by St Johnstone.A dismal day for the Reds was made even worse when on loan Watford defender Hoban was stretchered off with a knee injury late in the first half.Aberdeen fell behind to a penalty from Duckens Nazon before Lewis Ferguson headed an equalizer in the first half.However Buddies went ahead again through a strike from Kyle McAllister before a goal from prolic scorer Sam Cosgrove restored parity.Aberdeen made two changes to the side that defeated Championship Queen of the South - in the Scottish Cup fth round on Sunday.One was enforced with right-back Shaleum Logan ruled out with an ankle injury sustained in that cup victory.He was replaced by Mikey Devlin who made his first Aberdeen starts since a - defeat of Hibs on November .Devlin had been ruled out for three months with a foot tendon injury.Following his impressive sht as a half-time substitute in the cup tie Niall McGinn was handed a start with Stevie May dropping to the bench.Aberdeen should have netted the opener in the th minute when McGinn#s corner kick from the left found Lewis Ferguson racing in at the back post but he headed wide from eight yards out.Moments later McGinn raced onto a clever through ball from Mackay-Steven.Racing towards the by-line McGinn drilled a low, inviting cross along the face of goal but there were no takers.However it was relegation battling St Mirren who went ahead in the th minute when goal machine Sam Cosgrove, on  goals in the last  games, tugged down Paul McGinn.Referee Craig Thomson awarded a penalty that was converted by Duckens NAZON who fired the spot kick in off keeper Joe Lewis# right hand post.Aberdeen threatened in the th minute when Cosgrove played a superb through ball that split the defence to release Greg Stewart.Keeper Vaclav Hladky raced off his line to win the ball in a - but Stewart was left poleaxed inside the box as play raged on.Eventually Buddies kicked the ball out to allow Stewart to receive treatment.Aberdeen equalized in the nd minute when a corner from Mackay-Steven was flicked on by Mikey Devlin to the back post.Teenager FERGUSON had drted in unchecked and clinically headed home from eight yards.The Reds should have gone ahead moments later when Stewart squared a pass to McGinn but with the goal beckoning he scooped a shot over from  yards.Aberdeen suffered an injury set-back in the rd minute when on loan Watford defender Tommie Hoban was stretchered off with a knee injury.The defender went down when his studs looked to have caught in the surface going for the ball in front of the Main Stand.There was no contact with a St Mirren player as he appeared to twist awkwardly.Clearly in distress Hoban received treatment on the pitch before being stretchered off.It was the latest injury blow for the Watford defender who has only recently ed from five months out following shoulder surgery in August.Hoban also missed the whole of the previous season having suffered  a knee cruciate ligament injury that required surgery.St Mirren should have gone ahead soon after the break when Kyle McAllister#s cross from the right found Brad Lyons unmarked  yards out but his header flashed inches wide of the near post.Slack play when trying to move the ball out of defence was punished by St Mirren in the st minute when a loose pass was intercepted.Buddies raced up field and Lyons found McALLISTER who fired a magnicent,  unstoppable shot from just inside the penalty box into the far corner beyond Joe Lewis.The Reds drew level  in the th minute when COSGROVE met a cross from the left side with his  and clinically slotted home from  yards out for his th goal of the season.Aberdeen had a strong penalty claim when substitute Connor McLennan appeared to be brought down in the box in the th minute but

role with Holland America Line, the -year-old worked as assistant cruise director on Oprah’s Girls’ Getaway Cruise on board Nieuw Statendam.The budding TV presenter admitted he was star-struck – even more so when he was asked to be the US talk show host’s personal chaperone.Grant, who grew up in Garthdee, said: “I originally only started working on cruises because I wanted to take a gap year. Seven years later I am still here! I had been a massive fan of Oprah since I was very young so it was amazing to be part of her cruise.“I was doing a few dferent tasks on board and then I was asked to escort Oprah around the ship.“It was just incredible. My le paused for a moment because I just couldn’t believe what I was doing.“Even later on I didn’t think she would recognise me because there were about , people on the ship but she did.“She even took the time to give me a few pointers when I said I was hoping to be a presenter.“To finish my cruise ship career on the ultimate high is just the greatest feeling.”Grant has visited  countries in the past seven years but is now planning tohome to the north-east next month to pursue his career in TV.“Hopefully one day I can become a host myself,” he added.“I’ve already done work placements with STV and my own YouTube channel is growing as well which is really exciting.“I’m really looking forward to pursuing my dream job.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

First performed in , Within This Dust has gone on to be staged all over the UK and internationally, including at the   memorial and museum.Especially inspired by Richard Drew#s unforgettable photograph, The Falling Man, Within This Dust details the experience of witness, Lisa Hood, and victim, Vince Virr, of the   attacks.The witness finds herself surrounded in dust, made of crumpled paper, and begins a grieving process of hunting through the papers, finding meaning in the words, as someone tries to tidy around her. The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move. Chatter was in whispers, for respect to people who could not hear them.As the narrator of the show captured and pieced together from coverage of the attacks said, the dust has not settled, and never will. The losses of the people in the planes and buildings is still felt, and the wider western world is still wary, still learning, still recovering.Within This Dust manages to depict the horror of that day beautully, and more importantly, delicately. No easy task for a grieving world.PIC:Craignish Village Hall was full. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood amongst the #dust#. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Lisa Hood. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood collecting dust. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood and Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustVince Virr facing the smoke, or the window. _aWithinThisDust"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby fans form scotlands honour guard","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThree Mid Argyll-based girls were among those given the honour of forming the honour guard at Friday February #s Scotland v Italy women#s rugby game.Amber Russell, Drew Buckley and Anya Gritten travelled to Scotstoun stadium on Friday night with their Oban U teammates to form the honour guard for the Scotland women#s team as they took on Italy in the first game of this year’s six nations tournament.The girls formed a tunnel of Saltire flags for the teams to run through as they took to the field.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"hscp welcomes community commitment ahead of crunch meeting","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more #

The bunds will help reduce the risk of debris reaching the A in the event of a landslide.This project allows BEAR Scotland to maximise the benefit of recycling the material being excavated from the Rest and Be Thankful while minimising the overall cost of these works.To keep roadworkers and motorists safe throughout the works, temporary traffic lights will be in place on the A at each location. This next phase of the works is expected to last approximately  weeks.Commenting on the works, Eddie Ross, BEAR Scotland’s North West Representative said: #The installation of the next stages of the mitigation measures will provide more protection and resilience against any future landslips blocking this key route at both the Rest and Be Thankful and Glen Kinglas.#The temporary traffic lights are necessary to keep our teams as well as users of the route safe during the works, and the teams will do all they can to complete the project as quickly and safely as possible.#We encourage road users to plan their journeys in advance by checking the Traffic Scotland website for up to date travel information.#"},{"url":null,"title":"third sector interface launches new approach to service delivery","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Third Sector Interfaceis changing the way it supports all types of third sector organisations, including charities, social enterprises and community groups.Due to many people now finding information through digital means and the need for information and assistance to be accessible and consistent across the whole of Argyll and Bute, not just in the main towns, the organisation has launched a new website, argylltsi.org.The website, reflecting the TSI’s new corporate identity, contains a self-serve area allowing third sector organisations to find links to a whole iety of locally-based and more national resources that can support their development needs, as well as useful templates to use to run their organisations.The TSI will be growing and developing self-service over the coming months, with the site becoming a ‘one-stop shop’ for information that third sector organisations need to set up, govern and manage organisations – everything from how to start a social enterprise to raising funding from major donors.The TSI can also now be contacted through a central freephone number #   , available between the hours of am-pm, Monday-Friday.

Arthur Street Kitchen applied for permission to host live al fresco entertainment in the town centre. But councillors worried about noise want to carry out a site visit before making a decision. The venue’s manager Andy McPherson said: “We would like to have entertainment for customers in the garden this summer.” He said the music would not be too loud as the business is aware of residents living in the Arthur Street area of the town. Appearing before the South Ayrshire Council licensing board, he added: “We are hoping to reinvigorate Arthur Street. It is starting to come to le again.” Board chair Craig Mackay said: “Noise is the main issue here. “We would be looking for a noise report.” Mr McPherson said it would be background music featuring a musician playing acoustic guitar, for example. Ayr manager John Neil told the meeting no noise complaints were made last summer. The restaurant and pub also want to have a large screen to show sport and films. Arthur Street Kitchen is based in the former West of the Moon premises and beside the Vinyl night club. Councillor Mackay said: “The West of the Moon was a family space. What you are proposing is quite dferent.” Mr Neil said Arthur Street Kitchen still caters for children. He said: “We want to cater for as many dferent people as we can.” The decision will be made at a later meeting following a visit to the venue.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilGardens and flowersAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13471434.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080918AyrCurrie_09JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club near move","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club near move to new town centre base at Dam Park as they prepare to sell Millbrae homeThe Millbrae men, who top the Tennents Premiership, are in advanced talks to sell their Millbrae home and move to Dam Park in Ayr town centre.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsDam Park could play host to Ayr Rugby Club as soon as  \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBooming Ayr Rugby Club are nearing a deal to sell their Millbrae home and move to the town centre. Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie.

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback.

Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending.

His death revealed he had left his entire fortune in his will to his native town of Troon. His legacy would provide education awards and grants for the people of the town along with a new public school. As Marr’s train travelled north he decided to break his journey, to pay a visit to his sister in Girvan. He was close to his sister Helen and visited her often after her marriage to ColonelABGrant, owner of Killochan Castle estate at Girvan, who was also a senior partner in the firm of Grant Somerville  Co in London and was later ordained as Revd. Grant in the Church of Scotland. Marr had intended to spend part of his fortnight at Girvan but extended his stay to a month. Perhaps his change of heart was due to the widespread unrest taking place in Glasgow at that time. The January of  saw the so-called ‘Harbour Riots’, where racial confrontations were breaking out between black and white merchant seamen on the town’s quayside and spreading into the town. A four day General Strike was called for on January  and four days later George Square was crammed with tens of thousands of angry workmen. Crowds of unemployed men joined in the fracas for a  hour working week. As tempers flared the army was deployed, troops brought in tanks and armored vehicles to control the crowds. As tensions heightened it was not an environment travellers would want to find themselves caught up in. Eventually CK Marr left Girvan on Saturday February  for his onward journey north to his annual shooting and fishing break in Perthshire. As the train made its way towards the city he took ill with acute appendicitis. When taken off the train at the Central Station he was rushed to the Glasgow Nursing Home, but it was already too late as he tragically died in the operating theatre. There is little known of Charles Kerr Marr, despite having a successful career in the coal exporting business. Born on October , , at  Welbeck Crescent, Troon, he was the third son of Captain John Marr, master of the merchant ship ‘Reciprocity’, sailing between Troon and Canada. John Marr and his we Amelia had five children, sons William, John and Charles, along with two daughters, Helen and Amelia. Up to the age of ten, Charles attended the Parish School in Academy Street at Troon, going on to join his two brothers at Irvine Royal Academy to complete his education. On finishing his schooling, Marr was apprenticed at A  J Guthrie, Coal Agents at Troon Harbour. Unlike his brother John, who followed in his father’s footsteps to become a sea captain, Marr left home as soon as his apprenticeship ended, to work as a Commercial Clerk with Kitstons, Iron Merchants in Glasgow. Moving later to take up the position of cashier at Clyde Ironworks, only to leave a short time later to be manager of the firm of GrantSomerville  Co in London. The move may have been influenced by A B Grant, who was a senior partner in the company and married to his sister Helen. By the time he met his future we, some years later, there is no evidence as to when he moved back to Glasgow, or indeed any explanation found as to his change of occupation. Marr is recorded in the Scotland census of  as residing in Renfrew Street in Glasgow and again on his marriage certicate a year later, where he is also recorded as being employed as a Soft Goods Warehouseman.  Little is known as to why he left coal exporting to go into the Drapery business, or where he met and fell in love with his we Agnes Murray Kinghorn. However, Agnes’s father was a General Merchant, so it would seem likely he met her in his line of work. Charles and Agnes married on March ,  and set up home at Sutherland Terrace in Glasgow’s Hillhead. Unfortunately, after only  months of married le, Agnes tragically died of Phthisis Pulmonalis . She was just  years of age. Her death was a severe blow to Marr, leaving him brokenhearted and distraught, which had a profound effect on him. Shortly after he laid his we to rest, he had thought of going abroad to work, but instead accepted an appointment with Hull Blyth  Company of London. Within a year he was made a partner in the company when he developed the firm’s export trade. His work of establishing depots in numerous ports in the world gave him an opportunity to travel abroad, especially to China and Japan, where he found an interest in collecting oriental treasures. During his time with Hull Blyth the firm went on to become one of the largest shipping charterers in the UK. Charles Kerr Marr played a signicant part in the company’s worldwide success. Charles Marr moved to London after his we’s death, he never again owned a house. All his years in London, he alternated between two clubs, the Athenaeum and the Constitutional. The nearest he came to having a home was in his later years, when he rented two rooms in Camden House at Chislehurst in Kent, which was originally built for Napoleon the rd. Just being there helped him to relax and take up golf. He was reputed to be good company with a great sense of humour and well known to be very generous. Marr was a lover of the arts and music and in all that time he rarely spoke of his we, or of her death and he never remarried, even his closest friends assumed he was a bachelor. When he retired in  he spent a good part of each year fishing and shooting in Scotland. Two years before his untimely death, Charles Marr carefully drafted out his will in , leaving his entire fortune to the people of Troon and setting out the way it was to be carried out. Marr’s coal fortune legacy has given the town a magnicent architectural school building with playing fields the envy of the country. Marr College on its own is a fitting tribute to this man of extraordinary vision. By the time Marr College opened in  the school had attracted the most renowned academics to come and teach. It was the only grant aided school in Scotland that didn’t charge fees. A public school for every child of the town, had oak led class rooms, inlaid parquet flooring, Italian tiled corridorsa copper domed library, purple velvet drapes and teachers attired in flowing cloaks with mortar boards on their heads, this was seen by all to be a stunning,not magnicent, comprehensive school, deemed to be the best school in Scotland and envied by it. The CK Marr Educational Trust, the only one of its kind in Scotland, has provided awards or grants to hundreds of Troon students, of all ages each year. The addition of the MarrEducation Resource Centre in Troon Library, the only one then in Ayrshire, is a valuable educational resource for all who use it. Marr College and the CK Marr Educational Trust are a testimony to the wishes of Charles Kerr Marr and a fitting memorial to this great benefactor. He was buried beside his beloved we in CathcartCemetery in Glasgow. Over the past century the people of Troon owe a huge debt to custodians of Marr’s vision, the Marr Trustees, past and present. Over the decades the many Trustees, Boards of Governors and ious Clerks, Treasurers and Accountants, who have and still do today and for many decades to come, have successfully upheld the wishes of the town’s greatest ever benefactor and extraordinary visionary, Charles Kerr Marr.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnChurch of ScotlandUniversities and CollegesGlasgowEducationFishingArmed forcesLove and romanceSchoolsRenfrewTroonPerthshireGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"cinema set return prestwick after","story":"NewsCinema set forto Prestwick after  year gapReturn to the golden age of screen in PrestwickShareByStephen Houston:,  FEB NewsFriends of Broadway - they want cinema open again \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCinema made a boldto Prestwick for the first time in more than  years.

Licensing bosses at East Ayrshire Council knocked back the flurry of applications for early morning drinking before the January  showdown. Despite the historic nature of the sporting event, the department decided to maintain their stance on trying to clamp down on excess boozing during football. The East Ayrshire Licensing board depute clerk Stuart McCall told councillors it was important to maintain the standard policy and have consistency. He pointed to Celtic and Rangers matches as examples of tense clashes requiring robust licensing rules. Mr McCall said: “The standard practice is games start early and the reason for that is to limit the amount of alcohol supporters can have.” “We all know the outcome excess alcohol can have in certain circumstances.” Congragulating Talbot, he added: “We are all delighted to see the result. “The maintenance of the policy is important so we are not accused of favouritism.” Some venues wanted to offer breakfast to supporters. Auchinleck Talbot defeated Ayr by one goal to nil. Alcohol was not permitted inside the grounds and fans were told they would be refused entryintoxicated. However the licensing board made a slight concession for the Auchinleck Talbot versus Hearts game on Sunday, February . Venues were given permission to open from am onlysupporter buses were due to leave from their premises.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnFootball fansAuchinleck TalbotAyrAyr NewsEast Ayrshire CouncilWilliam Hill Scottish CupAlcohol"},{"url":null,"title":"meet veteran vet now towns","story":"NewsMeet the veteran vet now a towns Citizen of the YearHes now the Senior Citizen of the Year in CumnockShareByStephen Houston:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA veteran vet has been named Cumnock Citizen of the Year. John Senior has been an animal surgeon in the town for  years. He has also immersed himself in activities and volunteering for all sorts of causes. This week he was continuing his latest community activity as a hand bell ringer at Cumnock Old Church. John, , said: “All I want is the best for Cumnock and we are so fortunte to have so many things going on now. “I just want to make it better than it is.” The Keir McTurk Memorial Committee chose John after “much deliberation” from all the nominations. Chairman Colin Chisholm said: “John is someone who prefers to work behind the scenes rather than be at the forefront. “But his efforts for the community have proved invaluable.” John, originally from Edinburgh, has freshly retired from the Crossriggs veterinary practice in the town. When he arrived in  it was chiefly large livestock but treats mostly small animals. His we Heather, also a vet, remains involved in the management and their son Iain, the third member of the Senior family who is a vet, runs the practice. John is a very active member of the Cumnock Action Plan Committee, in which he has reformed the Cumnock Gardening Club assisted living in the arrangements for the Christmas festival and was actively involved in the poppy display marking the centenary of the end of the First World War. He is also an elder in the Trinity Church and a member of the fabric committee. John is an active member of Cumnock Business Association, a board member of the credit union and of Glaisnock Trust and Cumnock Tryst. Assistance he gives to both the Highland games committee and Camps is described as “invaluable.” But he said: “I don’t like standing on a pedestal. I prefer being in the background. “I somehow manage to find time for the things I want to do and I am not very good at sitting down doing nothing. “I enjoy being active and putting things back into a town that has supported me and given me a living for  years.” The presentation is likely to be at Dumfries House. The couple also have a son Alan, a chemical engineer in Cleethorpes, and daughter Kirsty, who works in Christian outreach in Hong Kong.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnCumnockAyrAyr NewsEdinburghChristmasChristmas gtsReligion"},{"url":null,"title":"volunteers bike tackle social isolation","story":"NewsVolunteers get on their bike to tackle social isolationCycling Without Age Prestwick is transforming lives of those with limited mobility in the area with their specially designed trishaw, a light three -wheeled vehcile with pedal used in Asian countries.ShareByLochlin Highet:,  FEB NewsVolunteers get on their bike to tackle social isolation \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCommunity volunteers are coming together to tackle social isolation and loneliness - and their project is wheely fun. Cycling Without Age Prestwick is transforming lives of those with limited mobility in the area with their specially designed trishaw, a light three -wheeled vehcile with pedal used in Asian countries . The three-wheeled rickshaw is a little more than a ‘sofa on wheels’ as it is engineered to accommodate two passengers in the front and driven by a pilot in the rear. Those with mobility restrictions - old and young- can take a trip to the seafront, enjoy the Prestwick promenade views and have a good old natter. Now the community project, who’s base has been kindly gted by St Ninian’s Episcopal Church, are eager to find more volunteer pilots and those keen to get out on the trishaw. Chris Cheales, of Cycling Without Age Prestwick, said: “We now have two trishaws and we are in the middle of a training programme to help - people become qualied before starting the operation in spring. We offer two-hour sessions to two passengers and there is the opportunity to go for a drink, stop to chat, pet a dog or just enjoy the views. “We are looking for people with limited mobility who may or may not also struggle with loneliness and isolation and who would benefit from the freedom of feeling ‘the wind in their hair’. “Time is a wonderful gt to give anyone. The group hope to expand as the project grows and take their trishaws on tour to visit care homes in the area. Chris added: “We envisage days allocated to ‘user groups’, to include care homes, those recommended by Dementia Friendly Prestwick, retirement housing and local churches. “Trishaws are not cheap so we need ongoing help to keep all this on the road. “We are looking forward to another sunny summer and sharing the project with others.” The Prestwick Peoples Project has also benefitted those involved, helping volunteers flourish and gain confidence. Zara Crumlish has been a Young Ambassador for Cycling Without Age for six months. Zara, , said: “I’ve always wanted to ride a bike when I was younger but I didn’t have the balance. “The trishaw has helped me get my confidence up. “It gets me out and about with the community. “And I’m excited because I really can’t wait to take elderly people out and show them the Prom.” •Would you like to be trained as a Trishaw Pilot  Or a willing volunteer to be a co-pilot to accompany trips  .

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge. But only those feint hinds of Dolphingstone Castle remain, most of it lost to time and mystery just like the details of this story.But all the more reason to preserve and value them, I think."},{"url":null,"title":"betting-businesses-told-to-monitor-gambling-habits-of-people-on-benefits","story":"East Lothian Councilrsquos licensing board has approved a new gambling policy which puts the responsibility for policing the risks of betting in the hands of new licensees.Among the issues that new applicants will have to prove they have addressed before being given a licence will be monitoring ldquogaming trends that may reflect benefit payments, ldquoidentying and reporting attempts to launder money on premises and ldquoprotecting vulnerable people and those with gambling dependencies.Approving the new draft policy, which will govern the boardrsquos licensing decisions for the next three years, board members raised concerns about a lack of legislation to stophigh streets in deprived communities becoming lined with betting shops.Councillor Lachlan Bruce, Preston Seton Gosford ward member, called for current laws which prevent local authorities from refusing a licence to betting businesses because of overprovision to be changed.He said that it was impossible to walk down some town centre streets without being confronted by gambling premises offering promotions and deals.Mr Bruce told the meeting: ldquoThere are high streets in East Lothian where [betting shops] seem to be every  yards.ldquoThere is an issue where it is impossible to avoid gambling premises.The board was told that the Gambling Act  precluded using overprovision as a reason to refuse a licence for a betting shop.The councilrsquos new policy will put the onus for local risk assessments on applicants who want to open licensed gambling premises ranging from bookies to casinos, bingo halls, tracks and travelling fairs.Board member Councillor Jane Henderson, North Berwick Coastal, spoke of the dangers of gambling addiction, saying: ldquoGambling is an extremely destructive situation and sometime it does not get the headlines other things do.ldquoBut it crosses all walks of le and we, as a board and as iniduals, have a moral duty to recognise it is as much an illness as anything  and anything we can do to help should be taken very seriously.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader and Preston Seton Gosford ward member, cautioned that only a minority of people who gambled were affected by addiction and for others it was simply an activity they enjoyed.He told board members: ldquoWhen I first joined the council, gambling was a backstreet activity with premises down back alleys and it took us a long time to persuade the industry to come onto the high street.Mr Innes said that the new policy, which set out additional risk assessment requirements for applicants, sent ldquoa clear message to both the industry and those concerned about it."},{"url":null,"title":"prominent-cockenzie-campaigner-larry-tomlins-remembered","story":"Larry Tomlins, who was chairman of Cockenzie West Tenants and Residents Association, was involved in campaigns to reduce speeding and upgrade local park facilities in his community.The grandfather-of-two was an active supporter of the recent fight to implement speeding restrictions outside new housing at The Chimneys, Cockenzie, and helped oversee the trial and subsequent introduction of  miles per hourspeed limits in the Whin Park area of the village.Mr Tomlins, , grew up in Ayrshire and moved to Cockenzie more than  years ago, where he raised his family with we Ann.A consultant engineer, he ran his own successful business and still found the time to be an active member of his local community.He was a founding member of the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association, which helped improve Whin Park for local families.Ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell said: ldquoLarry made a huge contribution to the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association and the wider community.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"county-team-conquer-kilimanjaro-in-memory-of-vera-cameron","story":"Dougie Cameron and daughter Laura-Jane were joined by seven other men and women in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last week.The trek was the latest fundraiser in memory of Vera Cameron and in aid of Cancer Research UK.Laura-Jane said that her mum would have thought the fundraisers were ldquooff our heads but would be ldquoreally proud of their achievement, which takes the fundraising total to about pound,.She said: ldquoIt was a really tough challenge but the fact we were doing it for charity kept us going.ldquoAt the end of the day, it was for such a good cause and we wanted to get to the top and keep the sponsorship going.ldquoThe whole experience was totally dferent to what I expected.ldquoBeing over seven days, we have never done anything like that before and it was tough mentally and physically.ldquoWe had one goal ndash to get to the summit ndash and we ended up making lots of new friends and spent a lot of time with other groups.ldquoIt was a really good experience overall.Vera, of Macmerry, worked for East Lothian Council as a senior administrator in transportation.Dougie, who is site attendant at Kinwegar Recycling Centre in Wallyford, was joined by seven colleagues from the council on the memorable trip.Laura-Jane, , and her dad set off from Scotland on January  alongside Ray Montgomery , Paul Ritchie , Lorraine Faulds , William Kelley , Stuart Baxter , Rachael Cormackand Vanessa Sanal .The group began the trip up the near-,-metre-high mountain on the Saturday and reached the summit last Thursday.Then it was back down before flying home on Sunday and back to work on Monday.Laura-Jane, who works as a PR officer, said it was ldquosurreal to think that just a few days earlier she had been standing at the top of Kilimanjaro.Already, more than pound, has been donated to the good cause, with that figure set to rise to pound, when all the money has been donated and counted.Previously, fundraisers have completed a number of other challenges ndash although nothing on the scale of the latest achievement ndash in memory of Vera, who was  when she passed away from cancer in .The West Highland Way, which stretches from Milngavie to Fort William , and the Three Peaks Challenge, which sees the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales ndash Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon respectively ndash climbed have been completed.Laura-Jane, who lives in Tranent, said: ldquoI think my mum would think we were off our heads for doing what we have done but really proud of us.

But consent is something that has more weight, more value, more meaning.\"To consent to something demonstrates an understanding, that its something youre thought about. To me, the two are not interchangeable.\"Britton said that existing case law also highlights that the next of kin have a human right to be consulted under an opt-out system, pointing to the case of a bereaved we from Latvia who took her case to the European Court of Human Rightsafter medics failed to get her permission to remove tissue from her husband after he had died in a car crash in .Dzintra Elberte only discovered that tissue had been taken from her husbands legs before his funeral when Latvian police launched a criminal inquiry two years later into the illegal removal of organs and tissue between  and .It turned out that forensic experts had removed and dispatched some of his body tissue to a pharmaceutical company in Germany to be modied into bio implants.The prosecution was eventually dropped in  when Latvian judges ruled that while the countrys presumed consent system gave next of kin a right to object, the law \"did not impose such an obligation\". However, Mrs Elberte subsequently took her case to the ECHR where she was awarded euro,damages after judges ruled unanimously that her human rights had been violated.They also criticised \"inadequate legal safeguards\", which meant that while a deceaseds next of kin were allowed to object to organ donation the law \"did not clearly define the corresponding obligation of experts to obtain consent\".\"There is this aspect of a human right to be consulted,\" said Britton. \"But the opt-out legislation thats been passed in Wales and proposed for Scotland hasnt really gone down the path of defining that. Now perhaps they feel that because that dialogue and that communication is going happen at the time with the families, but the reality is that very often time is of the essence.\"The law would look at a reasonable attempt - whatever that means in law - to get in touch with whoever is available.\"The vexed question of whether opt-out will actually increase the number of organs becoming available for transplant is something we \"cannot answer\", said Britton. Partly it is because very few people - around one per cent - die in circumstances, such as road accidents, where organs would be viable.In Wales, where an opt-out system came into effect in , there was little change in the number of organ donors: figures show there were  deceased donors in the  months before the law changed, and  in  months after.Britton stressed that a change of legislation alone on its own will not be enough - something she acknowledges that MSPs have taken on board.In Spain, where opt-out was introduced in , there was little discernible effect until a decade later when funds were poured into training more doctors and nurses for intensive care. The whole ethos of the country is also geared to organ donation as a norm, said Britton.

That research was joined by a decade-long study in the US published by the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine which suggested a direct link between nitrites and the onset of mental health problems.The scientic community is increasingly speaking with one voice when it comes to the case for nitrite-free meat. SNP Ministers are aware of the evidence. Thatrsquos why Deputy First Minister John Swinney, who doubles up as Cabinet Secretary for Education, has been pondering new regulations for school meals, including proposals to limit the amount of processed meat, since last year. There should be no hesitation over nitrites they must be removed from the school menu immediately.Herald on Sunday readers will rightly be asking why many of Scotlandrsquos councils are still serving meats containing these chemicals, despite a clear link to cancer. Where  are nitro-meats being served  Our hospitals  The Scottish Government must provide answers.The nutritional guidelines that councils base their school meals on are set by the Scottish Government. Our understanding of the dangers posed by the ingredients in our food is constantly increasing. Amid continued scientic development, the regulations that govern what our children eat in school cannot be frozen in time.Since the early years of devolution there has been a push by successive administrations to boost Scotlandrsquos health by improving nutrition in schools. Removing nitrites from school meals must be a public health priority for the Scottish Government. To earn a lsquoGood Food Nationrsquo reputation Scotland cannot remain complicit in this scandal.In the widest terms, Scottish Labour will work constructively with the government to improve nutrition in our schools, but without delay SNP Ministers must act following this investigation and take nitrites out of Scotlandrsquos school meals.It is only right that I disclose I have been vegetarian for  years. In speaking out my motivation isnrsquot to spoil anyonersquos enjoyment of their bacon sandwich. Nitrite-free options are available and should be the norm.

The Scottish Tories make valid points about the Governmentrsquos record on transparency, but their arguments is weakened by the fact they voted against the Freedom of Information Scotland Act in .ldquoIn our view, open government need not necessarily mean a bureaucratic system that will cost the taxpayer pound. million a year, declared the then Tory MSP Lord James Douglas-Hamilton. Such opposition has not aged well.In coalition with the Liberal Democrats, Labour introduced the FOISA, but Ministers quickly became exasperated. One dismissed the legislation to me as the ldquonosey bastards charter. I am also old enough to remember Labourrsquos Margaret Curran, at that point the Parliament Minister, toying with a new charging regime in order to deter journalists and lawyers.However, the SNP Government has proven to be an Olympian of anti-FOI activity. And Alex Salmond, as First Minister, was the Steve Redgrave of secrecy.After he became FM, the Scottish Government contended that FOI provided a right to information, not documents. Applicants could not simply ask for emails, reports or minutes, but they would have to say precisely what they wanted in these documents. It was an impossible ask that thrust a stake through the heart of the legislation.In , Ministers told the Scottish Information Commissioner - who adjudicates on disputes - that  of  appeals to the SIC were invalid on the grounds that ldquodocuments were being sought. Some of the cases included requests for correspondence between Salmond and SNP donor Brian Souter, as well as between him and tycoon Sir Angus Grossart, and pop star Sandi Thom.Pushing ahead with this cynical approach, which followed a Court of Session ruling, would have destroyed FOI and Salmond eventually relented.His Government also tried to undermine the authority of the Commissioner. During an appeal process, the SIC can have full access to the information in a dispute, but Salmondrsquos administration queried this power in court. Again, he backed down after a backlash.The Sturgeon Governmentrsquos hostility to FOI is less overt, but no less insidious. Rather than challenging the law through the courts, other ways have been found to dodge its provisions and block the release of embarrassing disclosures.The Act provides a right to ldquorecorded information. If it is not recorded, it cannot be released. And so dozens of vital Government meetings, which have led to decisions that bear a cost to the public purse, have never been minuted.Backers of billionaire Jim McCollrsquos private college project met Government officials in  about securing funds for the project. No minute was taken. The same was true when the then Justice Secretary Michael Matheson held meetings to discuss the reinstatement of a chief constable suspended for alleged bullying. A bad habit appears to have turned into Government policy.The Salmond sexual misconduct investigation Salmond symbolises the SNPrsquos approach to FOI. The First Minister met her predecessor at her house to discuss the Governmentrsquos handling of its internal probe into Salmond. Her publicly-funded chief of staff was also present. But, according to Sturgeon, this was party business and no minutes exist.It is also not possible, claims the Government, to say whether Salmond emailed Sturgeonrsquos office last year about the probe. This is because, apparently, officials ldquodo not keep a log of every email received on a topic.By contrast, the SNP issues regular demands for full transparency from the Tory Government on Brexit and host of other reserved matters.

He denies any criminality.The Herald on Sunday last month asked the Government for the number of emails that the offices of the First Minister and the Permanent Secretary received from Salmond, or his representatives, between January  last year and August .The content of any emails was not requested, just the number of communications, but the response stated: ldquoThe Scottish Government does not have the information you have asked for because while we retain key documents as appropriate, we do not keep a log of every email received on a topic.One insider said the answer was ldquostrange as a search of a relatively small number of staff inboxes would be ldquostraightforward.However, the response has raised further questions about the Governmentrsquos commitment to freedom of information.Sturgeon met Salmond three times last year to discuss the misconduct probe, but no minutes were taken of the meetings.It was also reported yesterday that Sturgeonrsquos officials blocked the release of a letter sent by the First Minister to Evans about her contact with Salmond.On January , the First Minister told MSPs: ldquoI was concerned that [a legal] challenge could be imminent, so I told the permanent secretary then that I knew about the investigation and I told her about the previous meeting, including the reference to a potential legal challenge.ldquoI told her that I supported her decision to investigate and that I would not seek to intervene in the investigation in any way.However, in response to an FoI request by the i newspaper, the Scottish Government said disclosure of the full letter ldquocould prejudice a case currently in court in Scotland.Sturgeonrsquos chief of staff, Liz Lloyd, was also present at the meeting Sturgeon had with Salmond at her home, but her attendance was not in her official Government diary."},{"url":null,"title":"david-pratt-looking-at-the-implications-of-returning-from-is","story":"EVERY day their numbers grow. There are now over , in detention, according to the most recent estimates, and those are only a result of the latest fighting.Last Wednesday, more than  members of the Islamic Stategroup, most of them foreign fighters holed up in the enclave of Baghouz in eastern Syria, gave themselves up.Thousands more women and children, many of them the wives of these same IS cadres, are already cramming the camps set up for those displaced as the jihadist terror group disintegrates in the last slither of territory that remains of their once self-proclaimed caliphate that spread across swathes of Syria and Iraq in an area roughly the size of Britain.And speaking of Britain, back here it takes a lot to get people talking about a news story beyond Brexit, but the ongoing debate over what should be done about Shamima Begum is one such story.For the past week, the issue of whether the nine-months pregnant woman, now aged , should be repatriated has polarised British public opinion. The debate over her fate is not the first and will certainly not be the last over what do with foreign fighters and supporters of IS as the detention camps of northern Syria fill up and the challenges posed likewise mount up.With so much polemical heat surrounding the Begum case, itrsquos perhaps worth stepping back and pausing for a moment to cast some badly-needed light on this controversial issue.For itrsquos precisely at this moment that so many complex and serious questions need well thought out solutionsan already pressing and dangerous situation is not to be made worse.To begin with this is not a problem thatrsquos going anywhere fast. Itrsquos thought that up to , international citizens from  countries joined IS in Iraq and Syria between April  and June , according to a report by the highly-respected International Centre for the Study of Radicalisationat Kings College London, published last year.To put this in some context and perspective, currently on the ground the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces say they are struggling to cope with the responsibility of holding the IS detainees from  countries that they have in custody.ldquoWe canrsquot do it alone, says Abdulkarim Omar, a leader of the Kurdish-led foreign-relations commission, which is affiliated with the US-backed SDF. ldquoEveryone is running away from the responsibility, he insists.There is little doubt that the Kurdsrsquo fledgling administration lacks the resources and capacity to put on trial, or detain indefinitely, so many people. Itrsquos vital too that they are in a position to carry out detentions under humane and sustainable conditions over an extensive period of time, something that cannot be done without the advice and support from foreign states and other international bodies.In Syriarsquos Kurdish enclave the leftist ideology embraced there means a rejection of the death penalty and focuses on rehabilitation rather than punishment for those foreign fighters captured. This is dferent from Iraq where the Western-backed government often carries out the death penalty, earning the condemnation of Western human-rights groups.Last week, Iraqi prime minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi said Iraq will repatriate Iraqi IS members held by SDF in Syria as well as thousands of their family members. A senior Iraqi intelligence official told reporters that up to , Iraqis, including IS fighters, their families and refugees will be brought back home by April where many of them will live in a tent settlement in western Anbar province.The official, who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media, said IS members will be interrogated by Iraqi security agencies, a move that will give human rights groups cause for concern as to their potential fate.For the moment though itrsquos Syriarsquos Kurds who are shouldering most of the burden when it comes to dealing with the crisis. Faced with uncertainties over the their own future because of the impending withdrawal of US troops and the threat posed by Turkish forces, they remain caught between a rock and hard place both politically and strategically over those IS captives they have taken.ldquoThey are being held in an area that is not stable and any vacuum or chaos could allow them to break out of prison and it would be a burden and big danger, warns Abdulkarim Omar.These past weeks have only underscored such arguments along with the transnational scale of the problem captured foreign fighters present. Russians, families from central Asia, Ukrainians and Canadians were all reported to be among those to have fled Baghouz recently, providing a sharp reminder of the global scope of the IS jihadist organisation.A little less than a fortnight ago, as the Baghouz operation intensied, six foreign jihadists of ious nationalities who had actively participated in terrorist activities of the group for years were also captured, the SDF confirmed in a statement. The men are reportedly from Russia, Germany, Turkey, Sweden, Morocco and an unspecied country in Latin America.Although you could be forgiven for thinking so going by some media reports, the case of British woman Shamima Begum is far from unique.Among the civilians fleeing Baghouz recently was a German woman who also came to live under IS as a -year-old. Meanwhile, a woman identied by a French news agency as Leonora, now , escaped to a screening centre for the displaced where she described travelling to Syria two months after converting to Islam. She became the third we of a German IS fighter named Martin Lemke, bearing him two children in Syria. Her husband was detained by the SDF after the family fled the fighting. ldquoWe gave up together, she said.Faced with such a erse range of nationalities, Kurdish officials have reached out to all countries with citizens in detention, but few have responded.Kazakhstan, Russia, Sudan and Indonesia have repatriated some families. At least one American, a woman, and an Iraqi woman have also been ed to their countries, says Kurdish foreign-relations spokesman Omar.A huge part of the problem, of course, is that itrsquos near impossible to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution to what overall could be as many as ,-plus people the SDF and Kurdish authorities are holding.Many governments, especially Western ones, take the attitude that those who chose to join IS surrendered their citizenship rights when they decided to leave their countries, Amarnath Amarasingam, a senior research fellow for the Institute for Strategic Dialogue recently told the Washington Post after visiting northeastern Syria and interviewing detainees.ldquoThe broader argument is: You went over there, you renounced your citizenship, and you joined an organisation that gave no second chances to anyone, he said.Added to this are the understandable concerns of some foreign authorities that ees might not be genuine in their remorse and could spread radical ideology or plot future attacks, says Amarasingam.Some observers, however, see this as a ldquodistracting fear. Joseph Horowitz, senior legal officer for the Open Society Justice Initiative, whose specialisms include human rights, national security and counterterrorism, says that first and foremost people ldquoneed to be assessed on an inidual basis rather than be subjected to collective assumptions and attitudes that are one step away from a presumption of guilt.Radicalisation, Horowitz argues, remains in many instances  and is often injected with discriminatory religious and cultural stereotypes about who performs ldquoradicalisation, who can be ldquoradicalised and what constitutes indicators of ldquoradicalisation.Such observations, however, will do little to allay the fears of those already uneasy about the labyrinthine legal terrain that exists over ees. In many instances for example itrsquos far from clear whether there would be enough evidence to prosecute and imprison many of those coming back, especially in Western countries where evidentiary standards are high. In this respect the chaos in Syria works in the favour of ees.Ali Soufan, a former FBI investigator who now runs the Soufan Centre, dedicated to the deradicalisation of extremists, says that unless they were well-known figures or featured in videos committing war crimes as in the case of British Arab Mohammed Emwazi ndash nicknamed Jihadi John ndash it would be dficult to make any charges other than minor ones stick.Some ees says Soufan might also claim they only travelled to help fellow Muslims in distress and were unaware of ISrsquos atrocities, a claim that on more that one occasion has already been made by those choosing to come back from Syria and Iraq. Such legal conundrums are only set to increase as the number of ees gains momentum.Already Western European countries have seen a total of , nationals , according to the ICSR study. In another analysis of six EU countries, carried out by the European Parliament, half of those who left the UK have ed, the highest rate among the six countries examined.By and large though the pattern by which IS ees are dealt with in EU countries is based on criminal investigation and risk assessment. Rehabilitation and reintegration scheme have also been introduced inside and outside prison. Other measures include restrictions on movement, and powers to withdraw and refuse to issue passports.Here in the UK, for some time the Government has been seeking to block theof anyone considered a security threat with a range of legal powers.Many of the known IS members who were dual nationals have had their British citizenship removed, like members of the ldquoBeatles cell of which Mohammed Emwazi was part, before his death.This citizenship removal invalidates their travel documents and means the UK can avoid responsibility for repatriating them from Syria or future legal proceedings. The most recent official statistics show that  people were deprived of British citizenship in  and  in .The power has been used for criminals as well as terrorists, and the law allows it in cases ldquoconducive to the public good.But making a person stateless is against international law, so it can only be used for dual nationals and last November two cases were ruled unlawful.In the coming weeks and months the use of all these measures will be stepped up as the UK Government seeks to reassure a nervous public.ldquoAny British citizen who doesfrom taking part in the conflict must be in no doubt they will be questioned, investigated and potentially prosecuted, Theresa Mayrsquos official spokesperson was at pains to point out last Thursday as the furore around Shamima Begum intensied.Speaking around the same time while attending the Munich security conference, Alex Younger, the head of Britainrsquos Secret Intelligence Service , warned that ISrsquos threat is likely to ldquomorph and spread and its threat is ldquodefinitely not done.He cautioned about showing triumphalism at the demise of IS.ldquoThe military defeat of the caliphate does not represent the end of the terrorist threat that we face, he said.Like it or not, dealing effectively with ees will play a vital part in neutralising that threat. This is not the time, as many have suggested, to say ldquolet them rot in Syria.For most likely they will not but instead be recycled into the jihadi cause."},{"url":null,"title":"two-thirds-of-organic-land-in-scotland-has-disappeared","story":"And yet, almost unnoticed, Scotland has lost its early lead. Two-thirds of what was once organic land has reverted to conventional farming just as other nations soar ahead. Scots, hit by first the financial crash and then Brexit uncertainty, consume far less chemical-free food than most other western Europeans.Even after years of gradual increase in demand, the total market for organic food and drink in Scotland last year was less than a twentieth of that of Denmark, a country of roughly the same size.In  the Scottish Government moved to stall the decline with a new plan of subsidies and support. The number of producers is at a six-year-high and the amount of land farmed originally has stabilised.But with reforming agriculture now a global climate change priority, can Scotland, and its multi-billion-pound food and drink industry, now catch back up with faster-moving rivals The ShoppersWilliam Swanson knows his food. Or rather, he knows what can be in his food. And that worries him.The retired analytical chemist is doing his messages, squinting at the ingredients and provenance of some chilled tofu.After a career checking, among other things, how much pesticide or herbicide is in what we eat, Mr Swanson takes care of himself.So he, we Janette and daughter Louise - all vegetarians - are browsing in Locavore, a store on Glasgowrsquos Southside which sells mostly organic or local produce. His concern  Chemicals. His wersquos  Plastics.ldquoI am really worried about plastics and all the extra packaging you have these days,rsquo Mrs Swanson. ldquoHere you bring your own bottle and fill it with shampoo.rsquo Behind her, customers are doing the same with milk from a tap on big stainless steel fridge.Reuben Chesters likes what she is saying. He runs Locavore. He waves towards his green-grocery section where there is barely any plastic, bar bags of salad. Locavore packages some of its greens - often from its own small-holding in East Renfrewshire - in plastics. But they are biodegradable, made from thistles. Most of his shoppers pick up their loose veg and pop in in their own bags - or paper ones.But concerns in to plastics and pesticides - the traditional drivers of organic shoppers - now fit in to a bigger picture: global warming.The RetailerLater, perched on a old-style dustbin full of loose rice, Mr Chesters, , explains that people come in to his store for a whole bunch of reasons - not least the coffees served in s beige cups and saucers at tables next to big picture windows,Some are health conscious, he says. Some are environmentally conscious. Some both.But why did he get involved  ldquoClimate change is my initial driver, he says. ldquoAlong the way, everything  has got tied in with it, overall sustainability, for employees and suppliers and packaging and the wider natural environment,ldquoBut climate change is a huge part of it. Food is very often overlooked as a cause of global warming. Food is a third of all greenhouse gases, before we start tying in transport and energy production related to it.That makes Locavore, its aisleslightly dusted in good clean earth from loose boxes of organic root veg and its walls painted autumnal yellow, the front line in the war against global warming. It and an entire global movement to make food and farming more sustainable.Agriculture accounts for around a third of carbon emissions, compared with perhaps a th for aviation. Why  Party because conventional farming uses vast quantities of fertilisers made using fossil fuels. The take-away:we want to save the planet, we are going to need to change the way we farm. What kind of farming avoids chemical fertilisers  Organic.Tackling climate change, cutting greenhouse gas emissions, is a global and Scottish policy priority. So what are national and local authorities doing to support change in farming The IssueScience - and the the United Nations - is on Mr Chesters side. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation backs low-impact farming, using a combination of old customs and new technology. \"The lower-input of fossil fuel dependant resources and the use of renewable energy all present opportunities for organic agriculture to lead the way in reducing energy consumption and mitigating the negative affects of energy emissions,\" it says.The Scottish Government agrees. It has a plan to reboot Scottish organic farming. Its objective is far from hidden: \"An increase in the proportion of land managed organically,\" it declares, \"will ultimately help to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.\"That, at least, is the aspiration. The reality is rather dferent. Mr Chesters is quickly upscaling Locavore, which has its own smallholdings producing salads and even livestock and a chain of loyal suppliers.But it is far from always easy to source Scottish organics, even for some of the nations iconic produce. Fancy home-grown organic strawberries  Rapeseed oil  Ayrshire tatties  They do not exist. A single orchard is trying to grow organic apples.Organic advocates are quick to stress the commercial market for produce has been growing steadily for seven years. The Soil Association, which certies producers as organic, measured the entire UK market at pound. billion in , its highest ever figure. That amounted to . per cent of all Britains food and drink. A lot  Yes, but not by international standards.There is no Scottish breakdown of that number but separate figures suggest the market is disproportionately small north of the border.The Scottish Government cites data from consumer intelligence firm Kantar World suggesting sales of organic groceries were up some . per cent in the year to March , to roughly pound million.That compares with a figure in Denmark, which is roughly the same size as Scotland, of more than pound. billion in . More than  per cent of Danish groceries are organic. That is the highest figure in the world. In Sweden the figure is nine per cent in Germany more than five in France more than four.And yet it used to be Scotland that was ahead of the game. Back in  some . per cent of farmland was certied organic. The figure is now hovering at . per cent, having risen in , for the first time in a decade, to , hectares. Across the UK the organic acreage fell from . per cent to . of all farmland.Meanwhile, in the rest of the European Union, the trend is the exact office. The share of EU land farmed organically has jumped from . per cent in  to . per cent in .There is a a slight health warning on the scale of Scotlands \"crash\" in organic acreage. Some of the decline comes from hill farms which have deserted certication schemes, finding the extra expense of going organic was not delivering premium prices for their lamb. These businesses may have owned a lot of rough grazing land but they may not have produced much meat.The Big EstateOne of the big hill farming businesses to drop out of Scotlands organic scheme was Atholl Estates, effectively three or four huge chunks of Highland Perthshire.It is , hectares in total. The equivalent of nearly half Scotlands current total organic land area. It had been an early adopter of organics. So quitting was not taken lightly.Its general manager, Andrew Bruce Wootton, blamed demand. Just not enough Scots were ready to pay more.\"Sadly, I think it was the loss of premium prices in the market probably caused of downsizing in the organic acreage,\" he said. \"Pre-financial crash there was a very healthy premium, particularly in the aftermath of mad cow disease and other food scares.\"People were concerned about how their food was produced and where it came from. Economic pressures have put pay to that discretion.\"Mr Bruce Wootton cited other problems with being organic. His estates centre-piece, Blair Castle, missed weedkiller on its lawns and gardens. Its appearance, he said, started to \"worsen\".But Mr Bruce Wootton raised another issue. There are strict rules on what counts as organic. You can lose certication - and subsidies, such as they are,you flout them. But that does not mean that conventional farmers or producers cannot use some organic methods.\"We maintain a lot of the standards and approaches the organic scheme taught us,\" he said. \"So there is a legacy improvement to the environment but the scheme was not making commercial sense to us.\"The agronomistPeter Lindsay, breaking off from ploughing a field at his farm, Wemyss, near Forfar, echoes Mr Bruce Woottons warnings on price.But he admits that is far from always commercially easy, not least for farmers selling a premium product, such as grass-fed Scotch Beef. Consumers do not, he reckons, want to pay for two premiums, one for for a quality provenance and another for organic.Mr Lindsay works for SAC Consulting, a spin-off firm of Scotland Rural College, SRUC. One of his jobs is to help farmers go organic. So he knows the score.ldquoThe credit crunch made things dficult. People did not have spare cash. Demand dropped. But now I think we are seeing an increase again.Mr Lindsay things the demand is coming first for cheaper produce, vegetables rather than prime beef. But the thing about organic farming is that it is particularly well suited to a traditional mixed farm producing a whole range of produce, from potatoes to cereals to meat.That is because organic farmers rotate their fields, from livestock to dferent plants. ldquoWith more organics, ldquoMr Lindsay explains. ldquoYou wonrsquot see fields of monoculture. Yoursquoll see more weeds. And yoursquoll see more wildle as beetles and other bugs come back - and the birds and animals that feed on them. And there are more native breeds, animals more suited to our grass.But with just two per cent of Scotland farmed this way, Mr Lindsay acknowledges it will be a while before Scotlandrsquos agricultural landscape reverts back to is old image.ldquoOrganic is still niche. I cannot see the tide turning completely. There is a long way to go before we notice an impact. In some ways, organics is easier for Scottish farmers. Because itrsquos ato traditional methods. It is all very much grass-based. More organic farming might just mean Scotland starts to look more like itself.The farmerThat is how is how Robert Shanks feels. He has a dairy farm, Queenscairn, near Kelso, and has recently gone back to organic milk after a few years of conventional. His voice brightens up when he talks about his new-ish herd: Frisians. ldquoI love the black and whites,rsquo he says. ldquoMy grandfather started with them in . They eat our grass and here in the Borders we have as good grass as anywhere.When he was making non-organic milk he had Holsteins, an American breed that has bigger yields than Frisians, but which rely more on extra food than the more traditional British animal.ldquoIt is like a turkey that cannot fly, he said of the foreign cow. ldquoAll they do is have feed shoved down their necks. That feed, of course, is not organic. The cost of organic cereals or soy for as animal feed is prohibitively high. Hence a switch to native breeds.But that comes at a cost. Mr Shanksrsquos Frisians produce - per cent less milk than his old Holsteins. That is  litres less of the white stuff per cow per year.Mr Shanks, who has  cows, has no problem with friends and neighbours, some of whom have more than  animals, sticking with conventional farming. Like Mr Bruce Wootton at Atholl Estates he stresses there are plenty of good clean Scottish producers who are not organic but still pretty environmentally responsible.ldquoSome people pooh-pooh organic farming, he explains. ldquoBut I say it is like farming  years ago but with modern equipment. I think it is the modern way. I do think there is an overuse of chemicals.ldquoI think the government has abdicated responsibility on food policy to the supermarkets. That is why we have obesity and poor health. And it is why farmers are not making much money - I am living proof of that. Yet we are producing a surplus of food but wersquore not rich. That doesnrsquot make any sense.Mr Shanks loves clover, the way farmers like his grandfather, also Robert, kept their grazing lush and green. This little plant helps fix nitrogen in his grass, boosting growth, rather than the chemical fertilisers most farmers use. It is not quite as effective. But it works. That gets Mr Shanksrsquo Frisians their dinner. And, he swears, it makes their milk tastier.ldquoEverybody thinks their product is good,\" he says with pride. \"But I think my milk tastes better, because the grass-fed cows produce more butterfat.\"The DairyRobert Graham buys Mr Shanks milk, all of it. Hes managing director of Scotlands biggest independent dairy, Grahams. Organic business is doing well for him, with year-on-year growth, he says, \"in the teens\".A few years ago over breakfastMr Graham dreamt up a new product, or rather than old one: organic non-homogenised milk in a bottle. Or milk, as it used to be called, with cream on the top. \"It has a dferent taste profile,\" he says. \"And it has been phenomenal and is selling in Waitrose and Sainsburys across the UK.\"A litre of Mr Grahams whole organic milk sells in Waitrose for pound., in a recyclable PET bottle. The same quantity in Locavore is roughly the same, pound., though you have to bring your own refillable container.Those prices, in most supermarkets, would buy you more a standard four-pint, .L plastic bottle of conventional semi-skim.The GovernmentPolicy-makers know high prices for organics will depress the market, not least with Brexit uncertainty on the horizon.So the state - with its climate change agenda - has to pick up some of the slack. That means subsidies - and public procurement, for school, military or hospital dinners - to push demand to a scale where prices can come down off their heights.Take rich Denmark again. Its government last year announced a package of subsidies of nearly poundm for its organic sector in -. Ministers in Copenhagen are snfing export opportunities too. \"We are seeing places where the middle class is growing and demand becoming larger. We see it particularly in China, its food and environment minister, Esben Lunde Larsen, told Ritzau, a news agency.And Scotland  Conventional food and drink experts are booming. So is the domestic market. So what is the Government here doing to support the sht to organics  It is currently offering subsidies through something called its called Agri-Environment Climate Scheme. A spokeswoman valued such support at poundm. That is not poundm this year. That is the figure for total subsidies, including a predecessor fund, ever, to date. True, there is also free advice on hand for farmers.Back in , just as figures underlined the scale of decline, the Government announced a plan to increase organics. It ends next year but has no specic targets. How can we measure its success  A spokeswoman said: \"We do not support the idea of a land target as conversion to organic is a business decision for each farmer.\"The planrsquos vision is to have a vibrant, successful, sustainable, world-renowned Scottish organic food and farming sector by . We are currently assessing progress with delivery of the plan.\"There is some good news, she said, the number of organically certied producers was up in , to a six-year-high.The Government, meanwhile, does not buy much organic good. It is investing in Food for Le, a scheme that helps schools purchase local or organic food for lunches Only two Scottish councils, north and east Ayrshire, have managed to get full gold awards under the project. That means  per cent of what goes in their dinners is organic.Scaling up this scheme, whisper organic market watchers, could be revolutionary. Producers selling to the state, even at low margins, could scale up and cut costs. The dference, they argue, between selling by the cardboard box, and by the palet, is huge.The LobbyChampions of organic farming sound upbeat. David Michie, of Soil Association Scotland, concedes the industry took a hit after the financial crisis, from -. Demand, is recovering, but by the very nature of farming, supply is taking time to catch. \"Perhaps inevitably, farmers did not see organic as a viable option after ,\" he said. \"As sales in the market picked up again, there was a lag between this sales growth and the amount of land farmed organically because the conversion period to organic from conventional farming is two years.\"Mr Michie said more and more businesses are applying for the conversion subsidies from the government, \"in part because support payments are guaranteed for the next five years... but also because organic sales have been growing.\"The Soil Association - which has been supporting organic farming for decades before it became trendy in the s and early s - backed the Scottish Government approach.Mr Michie said: \"In the past wersquove found that targets have been counterproductive because increasing production is not always matched by increasing consumption.\"Having organic farming as a National Priority, where farmers are helped to get access to conversion and maintenance support, is more appropriate.\"The ShoppersBack at Locavore in Govanhill, the Swansons have thousands of whole or organic products to choose from, many Scottish. But are they too expensive  Is organics a middle-class fad  Mr Swanson nods.\"If you look at some of the product, you would have to say thatit was not organic or locally sourced, it would be cheaper,\" he says. \"I think there is an argument to say it is for people with money.But there is a but, he reckons. Root vegetables or salads, even organic ones, are not expensive compared to ready meals. \"If you were prepared to make your meals from scratch, your food would be cheaper and tastier,\" he said.Mr Chesters listens. His food, he says, is price competitive with the supermarkets organic range. Locavore is a community interest company, so any profits are for public good. But he admits getting poor people to buy is \"tricky\"\"Our custom is overwhelmingly local, walking distance,\" he says.\"We dont have the basement prices or a Lidl or where-ever because we are doing this properly and doing things properly is expensive. We are conscious there are barriers.\" \"We have a good food fund, which is effectively a food bank we operate. We see food, and our spending on food, as a tool for social good.So when you buy a litre of our milk youre supporting the shop here as a living wage employer, youre supporting a local farmer and youre reducing plastic use.\""},{"url":null,"title":"time-for-a-cool-night-out-with-scotlands-top-adventurers","story":"The Herald on Sunday has lined up extreme adventurer Aldo Kane, wild swimmer Calum Maclean, explorer Hazel Robertson and parkour athlete Robbie Grfith for the first of our Cool Conversations series.In our debut event on March , Kane will join the three other ists to share their tips, insights, and answer burning questions from audience members on how they manage to pull off unimaginable feats and stunts.Kane, , was given the top spot in our Cool List, which is the basis for the new series of talks and debates.He is set to tell audience members all about becoming an adventurer, how he manages to achieve the impossible and what working with some of South Americas real narcos was actually like in the flesh.Maclean, a wild swimmer, is set to talk about making the transition from a regular job to plunging into ice-cold lakes for a living, while Hazel Robertson will share her experiences as the Royal Scottish Geographic Societys explorer in residence.The youngest of our , -year-old Robbie Grfith shot to fame online when he did his own free-running take on Trainspottings famous Choose Le scene.The film shows the parkour athlete leaping, rolling, flying and careering through Edinburgh streets while carrying out breathtaking stunts.Based around our Cool List, and staged by the prestigious Edinburgh Grand Hotel, attendees will get the chance to share some time, and a cocktail or two, with these boundary-pushing adventurers.Other Cool Conversations events will bring together some of the countrys coolest writers, musicians, mindfulness gurus, bloggers and creatives."},{"url":null,"title":"conspiracy-theories-indyref2-energy-prices-and-inclusive-education-herald-on-sunday-letters","story":"Families should not have to fight for support.

Why such an effectively zero conviction rate after  years  Is it because pound million was spent by the UK Government on tackling FGM not here in the UK but in Africa, as announced by the International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, in November The UK Governmentrsquos track record for both convictions and funding over the past  years speaks for itself and shows us the  FGM Act of Parliament is as useless as one that goes by the name Do Not Step on the Grass.Dr Graham SeedLivingstonDouble standards on permissionWhy does the Scottish Government need permission from Westminster to hold a referendum to leave the Union of the UK but Westminster did not need permission from anyone to leave the European Union Scotland voted to remain but not only are we outnumbered by English voters we hardly ever appear on discussion programmes about Brexit.Real control over Scotland comes from Westminster, not Brussels.Bill KerrCumbernauldJust a theory  Donrsquot be so sureIn his article ldquo +   , it is sad indeed to see Neil Mackay stigmatise dissenters and parrot the Establishmentrsquos denigration of iniduals prepared to challenge official mainstream narratives . Mr Mackay implies those who do not believe government explanations for certain major events such as  , the moon landings or the assassination of President Kennedy are innumerate, paranoid, deranged weirdos.In doing so he disparages over , highly intelligent, educated and respected architects, physicists, civil engineers, explosives and demolition experts from across the world who have clearly stated that it is impossible for the twin towers to have collapsed as they did purely from fires on the upper floors caused by aircraft crashing into them.Rather than taking cheap shots at these experts, perhaps Mr Mackay might care to explain how they are all mistaken. Perhaps he could also explain how World Trade Centre  ndash which had not been struck by an aircraft ndash likewise suddenly collapsed. By applying the basic laws of physics to the destruction of the buildings, experts have proven that official explanations that fire caused their collapse are fraudulent.Regarding events in Dallas in , Mr Mackay likewise denigrates the thousands of scientists, ballistic experts, legal experts, film analysts and others who have debunked the official Warren Commission finding that a lone gunman, Lee Harvey Oswald, killed President Kennedy. Anyone who now believes that guff about Oswald must be seriously intellectually challenged.On the moon landings, Mr Mackay likewise dismisses as cranks the many top physicists and radiation specialists across the world who state categorically that it is impossible for living beings to survive passage through the lethal Van Allen radiation belts that exist between planet Earth and the moon. Official accounts that the astronauts were protected internally with massively heavy lead shields are beyond a joke.No astronauts have died after passing through the radiation for the straightforward reason that no manned spacecraft have ever traversed that expanse. Any Herald on Sunday reader who wishes to understand how the ldquomoon landings were actually faked in Hollywood studios would do well to purchase a copy of the truly astonishing documentary film American Moon by a real investigative journalist, Massimo Mazzucco.Arguably the biggest ldquoconspiracy theory of all relates that the mainstream press and its reporting is controlled by the ruling oligarchs. Mr Mackay does nothing to dispel this. Indeed, with this article he does quite the opposite.Dr Jim MacgregorDollarLetrsquos check the list againI AM surprised by Clark Crossrsquos reference to ldquosix Green unelected list MSPs who gathered only , votes . He knows they are list MSPs, so presumably knows they were elected with ,list votes.Perhaps next year Scottish Labour will support giving Scottish councils the same powers that Labour introduced in England, and perhaps the Conservative and Unionist Party will also offer a budget proposal that aligns north and south of the Border.ButMr Cross is concerned about potholes and the shortage of teachers, what taxes can councils use to pay for them Alan RitchieGlasgowAnd one last question ...The ultimate in Schadenfreude must be David Dimbleby smiling to himself after witnessing Fiona Brucersquos inept handling of both audience and  on last weekrsquos Question Time.Come back, David ndash all is forgiven.James StevensonAuchterarder"},{"url":null,"title":"random-acts-of-kindness-and-other-sunday-pursuits","story":"A random act of kindness meeting specic acts of entrepreneurialism spawned a worldwide movement of good actions, gts and downright gratitude culminating in this day, today.It was in a Sausalito restaurant in  when Anne Herbert scrawled the words ldquopractice random acts of kindness and senseless acts of beauty on a place mat. It was a play on the phrase \"random acts of violence and senseless acts of cruelty\".This was before the take-off of social media but, in that far-off analogue age it spread and set off a chain reaction, taken up by newspapers and radio and TV stations, things broke out spontaneously, like taping ndash not supergluing! ndash coins to playgrounds for kids to find, or fight over, smiling at strangers , or taking some freshly-baked cakes to a neighbour, but nothe has a tendency to come out with a hammer .It didnrsquot become formalised as the Random Acts of Kindness Day ndash indeed burgeoning to a week, today being the first of this years celebrations ndash until the Random Act of Kindness Foundation was set up in .

Nowhere does it suggest perhaps relieving the debt burden on struggling African economies, or sending the solution to the Brexit conundrum to Theresa May and the EUrsquos chief negotiator Michel Barnier. Or letting Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson know where he can find the aircraft he needs to put on the plane-less new carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, which he is sending to the South China Sea to take on the Chinese when it isnrsquot even launched yet.Williamson is one of the yapping pack of recent intake Tories who are just waiting for the bloodied Prime Minister to make her final stumblebefore pouncing. He looks and talks like one of those glib and shiny financial advisers who mis-sold pensions, and is probably dim enough to have sold one to himself.He was co-owner of a Staffordshire pottery company which, famously, produced a range of tableware for Charles and Camillarsquos wedding with the wrong date on it. No surprise there, then.Of course, the greatest act of kindness would be to put Theresa May out of her misery. It could begin by sending her a timepiece, without the necessary mechanical works, so it couldnrsquot be run down on Brexit. Or a programme, any programme, for a way ahead. Her software library is clearly bare ndash shersquos obviously gone control, alt delete through the lot searching for one that works.

For MSP Ross Greer it would be a pair of long trousers, and for Tory MP Ross Thomson a jacket without sleeves, perhaps a strait one For the Old Firm managers, Rodgers and Gerrard, the greatest kindness would be the defenestration of SFA compliance officer Clare Whyte.

Grey of hair and beard, he wore his wistfulness on his sleeve, like a sad Santa or a down in the dumps Gandalf. When we last saw the Frenchman he was suffering from a brain tumour and heading for the operating theatre, fate uncertain. When we meet him again he is in Amsterdam with we Celia celebrating the birth of their first grandchild.Also in Amsterdam is an Englishman, Edward Strattonwho is looking for his missing niece, Natalie, a drug addict.

It might be important.It would have been the wise viewer who kept notes in general, because the first instalment scattered plot lines left, right, and centre.

All right mate, donrsquot go on, therersquos a missing woman to find.Stratton insisted on tagging along, even though he had already taken Nataliersquos photo around the De Wallen district, where the local ladies like to take their clothes off to give the windows a good clean .Baptiste spotted they were being followed. It is skills like that which explain why he is so in demand. After an unfeasibly long chase in which a paunchy Stratton and a limping Baptiste manage to catch a young guy, it seemed as though they had hit on a break.Donrsquot speak too soon.

Short of a calamitous sht in the military dynamic on the ground whereby the Kurds find themselves preoccupied with, say, advancing Turkish forces and are hard pressed to concentrate on securing the IS prisoners, they will remain incarcerated.Quite simply, itrsquos in no onersquos interests ndash least of all Washingtonrsquos ndash to have hundreds of jihadi fighters back in circulation.That said, therersquos no doubt the Kurds are currently struggling to cope with the responsibility of holding perhaps , IS detainees, many of them foreign fighters from up to  countries.ldquoWe canrsquot do it alone, was how it was summed up recently by Abdulkarim Omar, a leader of the Kurdish-led foreign-relations commission, which is affiliated with the US-backed SDF.ldquoEveryone is running away from the responsibility, he insisted.Like others who have visited this part of eastern Syria, I can vouch for the fact that the Kurdsrsquo fledgling administration lacks the resources and capacity to put on trial, or detain indefinitely, so many people.The Kurds then are right when they say they should not be left to shoulder this burden. Aside from recognising this, there are very sound, pragmatic and strategic reasons why it would make sense for Europe to take back its fighters.Mr Trump alluded to this last weekend when he said that the US doesnrsquot want to stand by and watch as IS fighters ldquopermeate Europe, which is where they are expected to go.While not all those fighters being held in eastern Syria are of European origin, many are. The prospect of them at some point being able to move around freely again, perhaps making their way illegally to Europe or rejoining the global ranks of IS or a similar organisation, is worrying to say the least.No doubt this was very much on the mind of the head of Britainrsquos Secret Intelligence Service , Alex Younger, when he warned ISrsquos threat is likely to ldquomorph and spread and that its threat is ldquodefinitely not done while attending the Munich security conference over the last few days.Mr Younger also cautioned about showing triumphalism at the demise of IS, something Mr Trump, of course, is already doing by declaring a ldquo per cent victory.This is where Mr Trump is wrong and, indeed, his triumphalism flies in the face of a recent report by his own US Department of Defence that warns an ldquoeffective, clandestine IS organisation appears to be taking hold.In describing the future course of IS, counter-terrorism officials speak of an ldquoatomised, clandestine network of cells with a decentralised chain of command.This is the reality faced on the ground so, while Mr Trump is wrong to talk of all-out ldquovictory, hersquos right in voicing concerns over the potential capacity of IS fighters currently detained being recycled into the jihadi cause and ranks.For this reason alone the British Governmentrsquos reluctance to take back UK nationals who have served with IS or supported their ranks in Syria and Iraq is incredibly short sighted.Evidently, itrsquos at odds too with the kind of thinking expressed by Britainrsquos head of overseas intelligence.As its stands, the options are simple. Either run the risk of leaving those UK nationals in Syria and them rejoining IS as it goes back to its roots and re-galvanises itself as an insurgency ndash or bring them back.In so doing they would effectively be taken out of circulation and an opportunity to glean invaluable intelligence gained. Adding to these considerations too is recognising the importance of having those accused of atrocities stand trial and,convicted, facing punishment.Time and again IS has shown its capacity for strategic retreats in hard times only to rebound when circumstances change.As the MI chief made clear a few days ago: ldquoThe military defeat of the caliphate does not represent the end of the terrorist threat that we face.Itrsquos time the UK Government woke up and recognised the long-term implications of any decision it makes not to bring back its nationals who fought for the jihadists.Itrsquos time it listened to Mr Trump on that point at least, evenit should ignore his boast of ldquovictory over IS."},{"url":null,"title":"a behind the scenes tour of traffic scotland s

Connelly has worked in traffic control since  so theres not much he hasnt seen. The Beast from the East brought the worst weather conditions hes encountered during his many years of service. The team is both proactive and reactive in its mission to keep Scotland’s roads moving – planning for issues it can see coming and responding quickly to those that it can’t.Partnerships play an essential role in the day-to-day operations here.For example, we’re sitting in the resilience room where Transport Scotland, the Scottish Government agency which oversees our transport industry, meets during major crises, such as the Beast from the East.It is here, too, where action plans are drawn up to cope with major events on the annual calendar or roadworks on vital routes.A Police Scotland officer is based in the centre at peak times, along with Traffic Scotland’s media officers who Tweet updates throughout the day and INRIX, a radio team which transmits travel updates, both on the website and to most of our radio stations.From September to April, a MET office employee is also based in the centre.But Traffic Scotland has many more partners behind the scenes too.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"It looks likely that the council will raise the areas Council Tax rates by three per cent\"  Counterfeit cash alert after incidents reported in Fe viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"Stein explained: “We work closely with event organisers to ensure people get to the Open or Royal Highland Show with as little disruption as possible, particularly when two major events are on at the same time.“We also work with the road operating companies, Freight Haulage Association and public transport providers, such as Abellio Scotrail. We co-ordinate road and rail works to minimise the impact for commuters and the Scottish economy.”With all of the country’s roadside SOS calls also being answered at the centre, there are few down times.It’s a round-the-clock job and often a tough one, with operators witnessing incidents that take a toll.Even Stein, despite his many years in the job, isn’t immune.He explained: “Operators can take a call from someone saying they’re going to jump off the Erskine Bridge, pan the camera round and see them jumping. That can really stay with someone.“One that sticks in my mind was an accident at Charing Cross in Glasgow.“The car was a mess and as we panned the camera round we saw a child’s car seat, empty, on the road.“The room fell quiet but nothing was said. Later on, the police told us there were no fatalities and no children had been hurt – the sense of relief here was amazing.”Staff have access to counselling, should they need it as a result of anything they’ve witnessed.But you get the sense of a camaraderie among the team too which undoubtedly helps get them through the tough days.Last February and March, the Beast from the East proved a real challenge – some operators didn’t make it home for days, while others couldn’t make it in.Stein was at the helm through it all, steering the ship through the worst road conditions witnessed in Scotland in a generation.He said: “It was pretty bad in  but the Beast from the East is the worst weather I’ve ever experienced.“Usually, we can marshall maintenance teams and gritters from one part of the country to help in other areas hit by severe weather. That just wasn’t possible. “I was camped out here for five days, as was Humza Yousaf, the then transport minister. The operators couldn’t get home either so they just got on with the job, like they always do.“It was the first red weather warning in Scotland – everyone learned from it.”A Hilltip Icestriker from Finland is now being trialled on the M to ensure recovery teams can access incidents and an electric powered spreader has been deployed on the M.As for daily operations, the public also has an important role to play.“We have just over  CCTV cameras on km of roads,” said Stein. “It’s not a lot to cover such a large area.“So the public are often our eyes and ears, alerting us to breakdowns so we can send out a recovery team.“We get a lot of thank you letters as a result.”Those worried about big brother watching need not fear either.Stein added: “We don’t record number plates or incidents, unless the police ask us to.“So while we get a lot of requests, we can’t help solicitors looking for accident recordings – we don’t have them.”Crossing over the Forth is now far more reliableTraffic Scotland’s National Control Centre was opened on April , , by then depute first minister Nicola Sturgeon. Also used as a contact and education centre for pupils to find out more about the £. billion Queensferry Crossing, thousands of children visited to get a bird’s eye view as the project unfolded. At . miles , it is the longest bridge of its type in the world and also the tallest, towering mhigh. But has it eased congestion for those travelling along the east coast artery between Fe and Edinburgh According to Traffic Scotland statistics, the crossing is very much doing the job it was intended for.Since September , there have been  occasions when the Forth Road Bridge would have been closed to high-sided vehicles due to high winds.Wind shielding on the new crossing enabled it to remain open, affording far more reliability for commuters and hauliers who regularly use it.The hard shoulder on the new bridge also means there are no longer lane closuresvehicles breakdown along its span.Stein said: “The crossing’s improved reliability is delivering benefits not only for commuters but for businesses and the wider Scottish economy too.”"},{"url":null,"title":"crossing borders with your dog after brexit","story":"A.

It’s all linked in.“It’s about truly understanding the value of grass. If you value it, and you manage it through the season it can have a real impact on profitability.”Knowledge Transfer Specialist at QMS, Emily Grant, said: “Spring grass is hugely valuable to any livestock system, whether for lambing ewes, calving cows or growing youngstock.

If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others. If this is approved, it will make a massive dference to the town centre, although there will always be some motorists who will take a chance and park there.\"However, Councillor Mackay has misgivings about the extent of the restrictions planned for other parts of Wick.Monday  Feb  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Harry set to attend Mey games","story":"THE Mey Highland Games is going to ldquoput Caithness in the global spotlight, according to its organiser Captain Richard Otley, after Prince Harry announced he would attend the event this year.Rumours were re last year that Harry and his we Meghan would attend the special event which included para-athletes for the first time but when the royal retinue appeared at pm there was no sign of the couple.Capt Otley believes that the information released over the weekend to the media about Prince Harryrsquos attendance may have come from Buckingham Palace itself.

This was despite the fact that the name and address of the person they needed to contact — his mother Edna — was engraved on the memorial.#Vandals couldn#t have done a better job,# he said.Following this wave of public concern, OIC convener Harvey Johnston and chief executive Alistair Buchan have now released a statement apologising for the concern and upset that this project has caused.#Following a tragic accident involving a young child at a Glasgow cemetery, the Scottish Government asked councils to carry out detailed inspections in the interests of public safety,# they said.#We therefore engaged in the kirkyard safety programme for all the right reasons, but recognise that the process we have followed needs to be improved. It was never envisaged that the resulting work would leave kirkyards in the condition they are in. We are sorry about the concern and upset this has led to.#As a caring organisation, responsive to public concern, we will restore kirkyards to the condition people would expect. We will also consider how best to contact and discuss the remedial work required with those concerned. People’s safety is an important concern for us and we will continue to carry out headstone inspections. As at Warebeth , we will use blue pegs to mark stones identied as being unsafe and highlight these to local community representatives.#These stones will not be touched until we publicise the inspection results and give relatives the time they need to discuss with us any work they might wish to carry out themselves.#The statement also confirmed that further updates from the council will be provided further updates over the weeks ahead.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Whether it’s our personal information on social media or important financial details, it’s vital that we’re aware of how to keep our safe and secure from cyber criminals.”“By really getting under the skin of these hackers, our Cyber Sense workshops can point out how to understand how these iniduals work. Through the games we’ve designed, attendees will be able to competitively play roles on both sides of a cyber-crime.

Known today as Rae Strait, it was the missing link in what would become the first navigable Northwest Passage.He also reported back on the ill-fated Franklin expedition, reported evidence of cannibalism — findings which were effectively rejected by the then establishment, and which led to Rae#s achievements being almost completely ignored.The modern-day team, who hope to raise further awareness of these achievements, will be led by Scottish-born and Canada-based expedition leader David Reid, with Scotland also represented by Broxburn-based former Royal Marine Richard Smith.The team will also include two Canadians — adventure film-maker Gerry Tutte and adventurer Frank Wolf.Over  years later and supported with modern-day kit from outdoor specialists Tiso, the explorers are hard at work preparing for the physical and mental challenge of hauling kg sledges for nine hours daily and for up to  consecutive days.Their route will cover undulating, windswept tundra, river valleys and sea ice during what can be the coldest time of year.The Arctic expedition will finish once the four explorers have finally reached Gjoa Haven on King William Island.Mr Smith said: #The Arctic Return expedition will be extremely tough but ultimately our aim is to raise awareness fo the exploits of John Rae and to help restore his rightful place as one of the greatest Scottish explorers in history. It is also our hope that this awareness will inspire the public to support fundraising efforts by the John Rae Society, to restore Rae#s birthplace at the Hall of Clestrain in Oprhir.The team have said any addition funds raised are to be used to produce a documentary film and book about the le and exploits of Rae, the expedition and the history communities, culture and wildle of the Arctic.The public will be able to track the team#s progress at their official website and through social media.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These include:* A possible community buyout of the Black Isle Leisure Centre run by High Le Highland for Highland Council.* Appointing a business consultant to update the  business plan and probe funding applications.* Appoint a design team by competitive tender to revise the building plans and invite tenders.It was noted that the Black Isle remains a growing area with future housing and an expanding population.While a lottery bid for pound million towards the estimated poundm cost of the scheme failed back in , negotiations with the Scottish Land Fund via Highlands and Islands Enterprise to consider developing the project as a community enterprise company have continued.Mr Sinclair said: \"A unanimous positive attitude was evident at the meeting which allows further progress to be made to develop this very important project for the benefit of folk on the Black Isle and beyond.\"A follow-up meeting is planned later this month.Whats your view  Email newsdesk@spp-groupMonday  Feb  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We are all ambitious for improvement and what has struck me is the huge buy-in from all staff in challenging circumstances.ldquoThis budget will enable us to be sustainable and I am really confident that we have the necessary knowledge and expertise in our top team to take forward the change programme that is required.Chief executive Donna Manson added: ldquoThis budget process has been about us being connected. Connected to our communities, to our staff, to our partners, to each other ndash building relationships and enabling better conversations and improved understanding.ldquoI really appreciate the input from staff across the organisation during the whole engagement process, and for some really honest feedback. I am equally delighted with the really positive engagement across the political groups.ldquoWe need to manage all our resources, to redesign, to become more resilient, to be more efficient, to invest in our workforce and to plan for the future.

After all these glib, old charlatans had done to crush their hopes and lay waste to their futures, there they were, refusing to be beaten or to surrender to the nihilism of their elders.With their banners aloft, in cities across the country, they stood as a rebuke to the Brexiteers and the climate change deniers, who have shrugged off their responsibilities like Bullingdon tailcoats. Taking to the streets so soon after MPs voted against the negotiating position they had endorsed a fortnight earlier, the strikers’ principled stance made Westminster’s shallow and shambolic politicking at a time of national crisis seem even more crass. The children’s resolve should have shamed those politicians and their hangers-on. It would have shamed Tories of yore. But, as we long ago established, this lot are beyond shame. And so, instead of reflecting on their own inadequacy, they chose to double down on the protesters, trolling them in language so lacking self-awareness it felt like they were set-up lines for some awful joke. Theresa May, who has frittered away the past two years, castigated the children for time-wasting Andrea Leadsom , who has achieved precisely naught in this process, threw up her hands in horror at their “truancy” and Toby Young, who swallowed and perpetuated all the Brexit spin, accused them of falling for “crude propaganda”.When did the baiting of young people become the leisure pursuit of choice for angry, white commentators who dismiss them as conformist, then call for them to be suspended for skipping a single school day Despite studying harder and facing a more precarious jobs market than previous generations, they are relentlessly denigrated by hostile nonentities with a fraction of their insight or spirit. And they cannot win. If they are not apathetic, they are virtue signalling. If they don’t have opinions, they are ignorant but dittothey do. Last week they were criticised for being uncouth by allies of Jacob Rees-Mogg after he had defended Boer War concentration camps on the grounds that they had the same mortality rate as Glasgow at that time.You only had to watch Piers Morgan shout down Green MSP Ross Greer as he tried to voice dissenting views on Winston Churchill to understand what they are up against. Morgan is the acme of middle-aged entitlement the template for the kind of men who so fear the ebbing away of their power, they treat every bold new idea as a threat to be extinguished.Those of us who despise these figures, seize on the images of the striking children with a desperation born of watching our country systematically dismantled.In the US, it was the survivors of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High massacre who rekindled hope in a nation worn down by its leader’s refusal to do anything to halt the succession of school shootings.Emma Gonzalez held Republican politicians to account for taking money from the National Rle Association and got called a “skinhead lesbian” by a GOP candidate for her trouble.For others, however, the rally was evidence that the next generation was the answer to our prayers that one day, the current crop of amoral dissemblers would be swept away by these amazing campaigners.Here in the UK, it is those school pupils who refuse to sit back and let the planet expire that are keeping us the right side of sanity. Inspired by Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg, these children are determined to force governments to prioritise climate change.Young accused Thunberg of peddling hoods because she said no action had so far been taken when, of course, hundreds of countries signed up to the Kyoto protocol and the Paris Agreement. Well, Toby, aren’t you the big man, picking up on a -year-old’s word choice, while ignoring her broader point  You founded a free school and yet you sneer at these children instead of trying to harness their energy. I bet you let out a victory whoop when you thrash your kids at tennis.The striking children were also criticised because they weren’t being specic enough about what they \u2028wanted politicians to do asit’s reasonable to expect teenagers to have written up a -point plan for stopping the polar ice caps from melting when world leaders have failed to make any serious impact. This hostile attitude was mirrored by the politan police who – having turned a blind eye to the aggressive pro-Brexit yellow vests – were seen putting several teenagers in handcuffs.Although the temptation to treat the climate change strikers as mini-Messiahs is strong, we have to be realistic. Those who took part will be a mish-mash of genuine activists, the curious and kids who just fancy missing double maths. Some of them may – as has been suggested – be calling for others to make grand gestures, while leaving their phones on charge all night .But, at a time when so many politicians are out only for what they can get, these children are taking a stand. Wiser than their years, they understand climate change ought to be top of the agenda. They can see our politicians are too busy “taking back control” from the EU to take back control of climate change policy and meet our own greenhouse gas emissions target. And they know education is about more than sitting in a classroom.By striking, the pupils are shouldering the responsibility that rightly belongs to adults. They are shining a harsh light on the feckless and the greedy the do-littles who have allowed so much of the world’s animal le to be wiped out on their watch.Fortunately, these kids are only a few years off voting age. Judging by their chants of “F*** off Theresa May,” they won’t be backing the Tories, but the fact they are already politically active increases the prospect of them participating in the democratic process. By the time the Brexiteers are toasting their own wickedness in their special place in hell, some of them could well be in power. In the next few weeks, we may pay the price of governmental indference and crash out of the EU with a No Deal. Shop shelves could be stripped bare and medicines impossible to come by. All this while David Attenborough is warning of the potential collapse of civilisations.But look at all those bright, shiny faces beacons of hope on a desolate landscape.

He also had – less ferocious, it must be said – criticism of the PM. May’s continued refusal to rule out a no-deal Brexit was disappointing, he said.What’s more, the Malthouse Compromise – an agreement drawn up between Tory MPs backing both Remain and Leave which suggests the use of technology to maintain an open border in Ireland – was, said Harrington, “fancul nonsense”.We are used, by now, to backbenchers in the Commons speaking their minds about Brexit. Whether it’s Rees-Mogg opining about the need for the most Brexity Brexit possible, or his colleague, Anna Soubry, making the case that any kind of Brexit will be a disaster for the UK, those who don’t feel the restrictions of office have been enthusiastic in sharing their views.But when a government minister speaks up, using the sort of language employed by Harrington, that’s a whole new ball game. And I’d like to hear more of it.The Prime Minister convinces nobody when, through a rictus grin, she speaks of the possibility of post-Brexit harmony. Doesn’t she, in fact, look weak and unsure as she tries to herd the feral cats of her party’s rightmost wing So Harrington’s furious intervention brings us some clarity about the problems the ERG and their fellow pro-Brexit MPshave created with their blanket refusal to consider any kind of compromise.This sort of outspokenness is to be encouraged.Perhaps moderate Labour frontbenchers – by which I mean shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer – might feel emboldened to be similarly frank about the treachery of those in his own party who, despite claiming to stand up for the poorest in society, are – even now – preparing to help the Prime Minister deliver a Brexit that stands to cause deep and lasting damage to the UK economy. And while he’s about it, maybe he could speak more clearly about the appalling failure of the Labour leadership to do anything approaching useful about the abhorrent anti-Semitism that now disfigures his party.Let Richard Harrington be your guide, Keir. Go on. Speak your mind.The SNP could also do with some straight-talking from those in authority. A group of MPs including Joanna Cherry and Angus MacNeil are currently engaged in a campaign to force the First Minister’s hand on the issue of a second referendum. Nicola Sturgeon’s preference is to take things more slowly. Only last week she said she would like to see how Brexit plays out before calling for the powers to hold indyref.This makes perfect sense. Voters are ided as never before and the idea that, amidst this political turbulence, a new Yes campaign might cut through and bring about a majority in favour of the break-up of the UK is utterly fancul.Perhaps a wise authority figure – deputy First Minister John Swinney, say – might have a public word. Those who rebel against the leadership position are doing the nationalists’ cause absolutely no favours at all.Political leaders find it dficult to speak truth to their parties. Splits over policy and strategy require those in charge to do what they can to keep everyone happy. This diplomacy is, by and large, a good thing. If dferences of opinion can be contained and smoothed over, a party can convincingly present itself as a broad church.But sometimes those dferences of opinion are of such a magnitude that no amount of desperate spin can hide the splits. To ying degrees, the Tories, Labour and the SNP are now split over how they should tackle big constitutional questions. The stable governance of the country is not helped by circumstances where small cabals of extremists are indulged by their leaders.Harrington expressed an exasperation that will be familiar to many of us. He has watched as a small group of right-wingers have held the government and – by extension – the country to ransom. And now he has decided that enough is enough. May has allowed this bizarre situation to develop because of her unwillingness to stand up to these critics, to these zealots who would throw her under a bus given half a chance.Constitutional change can never – no matter what its most enthusiastic proponents would have us believe – be an entirely painless process. By its very nature it is isive and creates uncertainty. But, here we are, facing these big questions about both the UK’s place in the world and Scotland’s place in the UK.If we are to find our way through these minefields, we will not be helped by giving credence to the arguments of extremists for whom compromise and pragmatism are dirty words.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"laura chow revise law to give charity lotteries vital boost","story":"A decade of crises, an era of conflict and tragedy with displaced people, high levels of isolation and loneliness and a breakdown in trust. Yet despite  years of global chaos there remains one truth # people continue to care. They care about their community, they fret and worry about the next generation and, in particular, about our planet. And we have a resilient and determined Third Sector to back them.So many charities throughout the UK and across the globe have endured a torrid time following the  financial crash and year after year of austerity. Public sector cuts – mainly local authorities having to rationalise – led to a greater focus on statutory duties while many of the services we count on have been picked up by charities stepping in to fill the gap. Last year in Scotland four out of five people used a third sector organisation – although, remarkably, only a quarter were even aware that they had.And now, in the final throes of Brexit, countless charities are facing the threat that millions in EU funding may be cut. Those EU cuts will force charities to turn to new income streams, even the smallest, locally-run organisations will feel competition grow. The impact may even be felt by the very people in communities who came together to address their own needs during the years of austerity, including some in Scotland, where  per cent of charities are local.However, even through what history will regard as an age of major financial uncertainty, the third sector, in its quest for fairness and equality, continues to gain public support.More than one million people volunteered  million hours of their time in Scotland last year. We have , charity trustees across the country and, according to the Charities Aid Foundation Scotland Giving Report, in , across Scotland, people gave an estimated £. billion to charity,  per cent more than the year before. At People’s Postcode Lottery, we have strict selection criteria for good causes to be supported. Trust is key to these long-term relationships which focus on transparency, honesty, integrity and mutual dependence. We trust our beneficiary organisations to put our players’ funds to the best possible use year after year.Since launching  years ago, People’s Postcode Lottery has awarded £ million to good causes. The figure rises substantially each month.Funding comes through  grant-giving trusts and People’s Postcode Lottery operates society lotteries for  other good causes. A decade ago  per cent of ticket sales went to good causes but that percentage has now risen to  per cent. Players sign up with their postcode and pay £ a month to be automatically entered into every draw. Prizes are announced every day of the month.The majority of our funding, in addition to being long-term, is unrestricted. We believe charities are experts in their fields and know where funds can be used best. Charities supported choose how to spend the money they receive. However, charity lotteries are the only type of fundraising which has limits imposed on it by law. People’s Postcode Lottery is working hard to update the legislation. We want to ensure charities can get the maximum amount of funding possible, which in turn will benefit people, places and charities throughout Scotland and the UK.This can be achieved with a straightforward change to the current legislation and at no cost to the taxpayer. Following calls on the UK government for reforms to the legislation, their public consultation last year set out their preferred option of a £m annual sales limit, up from £m. The current limit has been in place since  and the government have been considering reforming the current limits for more than five years, so we can expect the new limit – whatever it is set at – to remain in place for some time to come. Now, with charities facing such a tough funding environment, updating the law on charity lotteries is one sure way for the UK government to get more funds to the charity sector at no cost to either the taxpayer or the Treasury.Laura Chow is Head of Charities at the People’s Postcode Lottery©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scots labour mp ian murray refuses to sign corbyn loyalty pledge","story":"An Edinburgh MP says he wont be signing a \"loyalty pledge\" to the leadership which is being distributed amid growing speculation of a split in the party.Former shadow Scottish Secretary Ian Murray branded the pledge a \"little bit ridiculous\" and insisted the focus should be on Brexit.\"My loyalty has never been in question to the Labour party,\" he told BBC Politics Scotland today. “Indeed my pledge is every single weekend when Im out knocking on doors, delivering leaflets, staffing streets stalls and doing advice sessions with my constituents - thats my pledge to the Labour party.\"I think these pledge things are a little bit ridiculous in my view.

We would like to thank everybody for the great support locally.”The house was originally built in  for Eilidh#s great grandfather Samuel Campbell, and for many years it operated as a temperance hotel.Fire ravaged the building in the s and, although part of the domestic side was occupied up until around  years ago, it has since lain dormant.Councillors on the review body said the couple deserved sympathy and support in their vision to restore a building which had been in Mrs Mcniven#s family for four generations.The couple#s supporting statement before planners said: “It is important to remember that this is a property that has been in the same family for  years and is about to become a new home for a young local family. The historic value of the property is not lost on them. However without intervention it may very well be lost entirely.”Dingwall councillor Margaret Paterson said she thought it “sad” that obstacles had been placed in the way of a couple who proposed to put so much into a building that was “almost falling down”.Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and Raymond Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness, also spoke in support of the couple#s plans.Councillor Bremner said he believed the aluminium window frames, as proposed for the development, had changed considerably from previous types which did not stand up well to spray from seawater.He added: “I have a lot of sympathy with the applicants and with the points made in their appeal. I don#t have an issue with the change of use.”Broadford and Strath Community Council had lobbied in support of the couple, while neighbours and local businesses also backed the proposed conversion.Community council chairman Hamish Fraser said: “They are proposing to restore a building that will become an asset to the community. It#s a common-sense decision to support a young couple who want to live and make a business here.”Planning officials had turned down the original application on the grounds that it had breached three policies of the Highland-wide local development plan.In their reason for refusal planners said modern windows and a door with patterns “is not in keeping with the character of a historic building”.In his letter of support of the couple, local historian and broadcaster Professor Norman Macdonald said: “In many years of regularly attending Highland Council planning committee meetings at all levels I do not recall a single application where a big and ambitious idea has come to the brink of jeopardy over such relatively immaterial and tangential matters.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/BROADFORD-PIER-HOUSE-H-FRASER-3.jpg","title":"the waterboys set to kick off skye live festival","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLegendary Scottish-Irish folk-rock band The Waterboys are to kick-off the Skye Live festival’s fth-anniversary celebrations this autumn.The opening concert in Portree on Thursday th September will see the bandto Skye for the first time in nearly  years.

It is a safe bet that there are only three: Robert Somerville, John Keenan, and Bob Fulton.Back in March , when they were union shop stewards at the town#s Rolls Royce plant, the three men # and thousands of their co-workers # were responsible for virtually grounding the air force of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power just a few months before in a savage CIA-backed coup. The documentary #Nae Pasaran#, screened in Portree last weekend, tells the story of how these principled trade unionists came to be awarded the highest honour the Republic of Chile can bestow upon foreigners.With much of the world appalled by the overthrow, in September , of the democratically-elected socialist Government of Salvador Allende, it fell to Bob Fulton # a burly, no-nonsense Christian with wartime experience of fighting fascist dictators # to set the ball rolling in East Kilbride. Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world. It may even have contributed directly to the saving of seven lives.Among the hundreds of Chilean exiles arriving in the UK were seven rumoured to have escaped execution or imprisonment because the air force acquired spare parts from Israel, South Africa, and India. So desperate were the Chilean authorities for this materiel they may have swapped the seven detainees for what they needed. Sierra never proves this conclusively, however, because the UK Home Office refused to release certain files relating to the boycott.And what of the jet engines, left to rust in East Kilbride  They were whisked away early one morning in . To this day no one knows who took them, but the Rolls Royce workers were told they were back in service with the Chilean air force. A year later Margaret Thatcher came to power and relations with the Pinochet regime were quickly normalised. Arms exports resumed in earnest.But the #blacked# engines were never used again. One of them, which Sierra discovered in a derelict yard outside Santiago, was shipped back to Scotland in , the year before #Nae Pasaran# hit the cinemas. It is due to be installed, as a lasting monument to the boycott, in a college campus in East Kilbride in the very near future.#Nae Pasaran# celebrates people power. After the screening, the topic was the subject of a short talk by Councillor Chris McEleny, leader of the SNP Group on Inverclyde Council, who also answered questions from the audience on British involvement in the destruction of Yemen, the desire by Tory Brexiteers to deregulate and deunionise even further, and the situation in Venezuela. Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile. We are seeing the same media pattern, a capitalist conditioning programmeyou like, drip-feeding propaganda to make intervention look like the right thing to do. We are seeing that right now with Venezuela so we need to see the same solidarity that Bob Fulton and others showed in the s.#Sadly, as Bob and his comrades lamented, in an era of weakened trade unions such a workplace boycott could probably not take place now.

I was born in , my family have been resident in Ballymena for generations, Allen, obviously, on my fathers side and Gribben on my mothers. My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

She remarked, with what would appear at first blush to be commendable restraint: “The man has no manners.”But on hearing Andrea’s mention of the word “manners”, a little bell went off somewhere deep in Squinter’s hippocampus and after a short period of beard-scratching and pencils-sucking, it came to Squinter why the Honourable Member is on rather thin ice when it comes to matters of polite conduct.Come back in time with Squinter to the summer of , just two weeks before Britain voted to leave the EU. Andrea was locked in a battle with Theresa May for leadership of the Conservative Party.

But I have children who are going to have children who will directly be part of what happens next.”So there we have it.

Which makes him of considerable interest to journalists, since the resentment he clearly still feels makes him a little bit more willing to open up about things than other DUP reps.Jim’s been at it again this week and, given the state we’re in at the moment, you’ll probably not be surprised to hear that it’s Brexit-related. Jim revealed that at the extraordinary meeting at which the party decided to back Leave in the months leading up to the EU referendum in , there was zero discussion of what a Leave vote would mean for the local economy. This would be an awkward revelation for most parties, but after the tsunami of controversies that the DUP has been through in the past couple of years, it seems to have reached the point that its brand is so polluted the tin can’t get any more dented, the label any dirtier. But that’s not the disaster that it would certainly be for any other party because the DUP’s substantial vote clearly consists of people who don’t care what they get up to as long as they’re not Sinn Féin.Lack of planning – it’ll do for ye every time. Fail to prepare, prepare to fail, that’s the old saying and nowhere does it ring more true than in the crazy world of Brexit. Let’s take a look at a few of the most notorious failures of a lack of foresight and seewe can work out where the DUP Brexit calamity fits in…Betamax’Member when video cassettes were the most exciting innovation in the history of technology  You don’t  Well, you must be under , so let’s seewe can explain. Two Japanese giants of the global electronics industry were caught up in the race to win control of the massive new market. JVC produced the eventually successful VHS format, while Sony produced the toploading Betamax system. Although the Betamax system was of a superior picture quality, it was considerably more expensive and had a shorter recording time. At a meeting in , Sony were advised by Matsushita engineers to switch to the VHS format, but declined. It wa a historic mistake, dealing the company a crippling financial blow from which it would take years to recover.Ford EdselFord were inordinately pleased with the Edsel, a new model released in the United States in , the year after the Ford family relinquished control of the company. The Edselwas designed to give Ford the upper-hand in the highly competitive premium intermediate market . The company missed the design boat, though, as the car harked back to an earlier age at a time when families were increasingly turning to compact vehicles. The Edsel was discontinued two years later, with sales signicantly less than half the break-even sales figure. Executives took their eye off the ball and didn’t realise the Edsel was flopping until over .bnhad been spent on design, manufacture and new dealerships. To this day, new models that fail are still referred to in the US automobile market as ‘Edsels’.New CokeIn the mid-s, as other soft drinks were increasingly threatening the dominance of Coca-Cola, the company decided it was going to ditch the original Coke formula and go with an improved ‘New Coke’.The  launch was a disaster and sales were badly hit, particularly in the southern states where Coca-Cola was considered an integral part of American culture. Tens of thousands of complaints flooded into company HQ weekly. The problem was not so much with the taste – the company had disastrously underestimated the hold that the Coca-Cola brand had on the American psyche. Smelling blood, rivals Pepsi began a new ad campaign with the strapline ‘Now I Know Why Coke Did It’ . Fans started booing ads for New Coke at large sports events. Just  days after New Coke was launched, the company announced that it was bringing back the old formula.Has to be a Brexit message in there somewhere, no "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-13.55.54.png","title":"eye on the past february","story":"RUC men sided with loyalist strikers last MayA SECRET memo prepared by British army intelligence has revealed that senior RUC men were closely involved with the Ulster Workers’ Council strike last May.The memo, prepared for Whitehall ministers some time ago, shows also that unormed members of the RUC “connived at and assisted with the maintenance of UWC and UDA roadblocks”.Referring to Special Branch actions during the strike the report says: “Co-opted personnel were isolated from information on events by being sent on routine tasks or being given rest days.”The ‘co-opted personnel’ referred to are Special Branch men recruited by British military intelligence to keep an eye on what is happening within the Special Branch.“As a result a ally clear picture of RUC reliability area by area has not emerged,” says the report.And it goes on to say that RUC activity of a routine nature appears to have failed by as much as  per cent.It goes on to predict that in a situation where there were large scale attacks on the Catholic population  per cent of the Special Branch would throw their weight behind loyalist gangs. A copy of the report, which was prepared as a briefing document for ministers in the Wilson Government, found its way into the hands of a number of journalists in London recently.Besides casting considerable doubt on the loyalty of the RUC to the British Government it claims that  to  per cent of the UDR could be regarded as hostile during a doomsday situation.BRITISH military policemen are being trained for civilian duties at a military training camp in Kent and it is believed that a large number of them will be drafted into Belfast and Derry within the next few weeks.The British Redcaps are expected to be used in areas like Falls and Andersonstown to take over from infantry patrols which will be withdrawn from the street.A number of UDR men from the thBattalion have attended a two-week course at the same camp and one report suggests that they may be used to form the nucleus of a ‘community police force’ in Belfast for a trial period. There have been two previous attempts to phase in military policemen to civilian duties. In the Bogside area of Derry they were withdrawn after a few days because of resistence by local people.Price sisters’ lives threatenedTHE Prisoners’ Aid Committee in London has said it is concerned about the safety of Irish political prisoners in British jails because “there is evidence of systematic victimisation by prison authorities and attempts to create hostility among other prisoners.”According to the PAC the Price sisters’ lives have been threatened by prisoners in Durham Jail. Since Christmas seven Irish prisoners have been ‘arbitarily’ moved to prisons far away from their families and another Irish prisoner’s cell has been set on fire. Officially the Home Office would not comment on the allegations but other sources firmly rejected them as being completely unfounded. There was nothing unusual in prisoners being moved to other jails under the nomal “dispersal systems”, they said.Since being transferred to the women’s wing of Durham from Brixton Prison, London, Dolours and Marion Price have been put on dferent floors in dference parts of the wing, the PAC statement said. The reason given by a deputy governor, Miss Ford, for the separation was “security”.The PAC said that the cells to which the sisters were moved were filfthy.The PAC said that in a letter to their father, the sisters said that their lives had been threatened by other prisoners all of whom were in need of medical treatment, some being “drug addicts or sex perverts”. They are being “continually harassed” by short-term prisoners, who wanted information to try to sell stories about the girls to newspapers, the statement said.“They have asked to be separated from Judith Ward, whose behaviour is bizarre, but Marion has been put into the neighbouring cell to this prisoner. Despite the fact that the Home Office describes Durham as a top security prison, Dolours and Marion and Judith Ward, are the only Category A prisoners there.“The other  prisoners in the women’s wing are Category C and they subject the girls to continuous anti-Irish abuses and obscenities. Miss Ford, the deputy governor, has instructed them to associate with these prisoners, although some of them have threatened to poision the Price sisters’ food. The families are complainning to the Home Office about the treatment of Mr Price and Mrs Claire Murphy, the girls’ sister, by Miss Ford on their last two visits. This treatment represents a marked worsening of prisoner attitudes from that of the prison staff in Brixton where the girls were during their hunger-strike.”Pay rise for home helpsHOME helps in the Andersonstown areas who were threatening strike action some months ago have just been given a big pay rise.The new rate for the job, which paid only p per hour this time last year, has climbed to p.After the reorganisation of local government services home helps who were working in the Antrim County Council area protested that they were being paid p an hour less than colleagues who were working in the area formerly controlled by Belfast Corporation.In some parts of Andersonstown women working within a hundred yards of each other were being paid at rates which were   p dferent.A pay rationalisation last December by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board, which now controls the district’s home helps, brought all of the women’s pay up to a standard rate of p per hour.Most of the women work at least ten hours per week, with the average time spent looking after old and housebound people being around  hours.Local Ads in paperPAULA’S Glen Road Shopping CentreLadies and Children’s Outfitters.

If there are other ways of doing it that are just as effective that perhaps we haven’t yet explored then we will do that too.”He continued: “I don’t think it’s the mechanism that matters, it’s the objective:you can get to a place where the potential longevity of the backstop, the potential that the backstop lasts forever can be adequately dealt with, that’s what we’re all seeking to do.”But Tory Brexiteer Sir John Redwood said it was not possible to “gloss” the Withdrawal Agreement.“It needs signicant changes, I’m not saying a little change would be sufficient, it requires a renegotiation,” he told the Press Association.Sir Bill Cash, Conservative chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, saidthe changes were just “flowery words” then the deal “won’t wash”.“The backstop is unacceptable because it means that we remain in the EU indefinitely and also would do immense damage to relations with Northern Ireland … and therefore as far as I’m concerned unless the wording actually has legal force and has substance it isn’t going to work.”Meanwhile, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Labour would “look at” a proposal put forward by backbenchers Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson to back a second Brexit referendum.“I met Peter and Phil last week, and what they’re saying isParliament does agree some form of deal, why not have a confirmation referendum after that ” he told Marr.“We’ll look at that in the debate over the next week.”Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood urged the Government to allow a free vote on ruling out a no-deal Brexit at the end of the monthMrs May cannot get her deal through the Commons.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Tobias Ellwood urged the Government to allow a free vote on ruling out a no-deal Brexit He told BBC Radio  Live’s Pienaar’s Politics he would support such a vote, saying: “I will intend to do that. I hope I will not be tested in that way.“I hope that we will either get the meaningful vote through or indeed measures are taken which will then allow people like myself to then express those through a free vote.”On Saturday, Mrs May urged her party to “move beyond what ides us” and sacrice “personal preferences” for the national interest.After another tumultuous week in Westminster which saw tensions in the party reach boiling point, Mrs May used a letter to all  Conservative MPs to warn them: “History will judge us all for the parts we have played in this process.”She said: “I believe that a country with our innate strengths, enviable resources, and enormous talent can face the future with confidence that our best days lie ahead. But we stand now at a crucial moment.“I do not underestimate how deeply or how sincerely colleagues hold the views which they do on this important issue – or that we are all motivated by a common desire to do what is best for our country, evenwe disagree on the means of doing so.“But I believe that a failure to make the compromises necessary to reach and take through Parliament a Withdrawal Agreement which delivers on the result of the referendum will let down the people who sent us to represent them and risk the bright future that they all deserve.”The Prime Minister willto Brussels for further talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker this week, and intends to speak to the leaders of every EU member state over the coming days.Meanwhile, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay will meet the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier on Monday to discuss the proposals of the Alternative Arrangements Working Group of Tories, who have been seeking a compromise solution to avoid the need for backstop.And Attorney General Geoffrey Cox will set out what changes would be required to eliminate the legal risk of being indefinitely trapped in the controversial Irish backstop in a speech on Tuesday."},{"url":null,"title":"boy six bought roses for every female in his town for valentines day","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mrs Mitchell explained that following her sonrsquos death, his owed back pay from the Army would have settled the debt.The soldierrsquos mother also revealed that he had told her about two incidents in Afghanistan which had upset him.In one of them, he had been due to be the soldier at the front of the patrol but was swapped with a colleague at the last minute. The soldier who replaced him subsequently suffered severe leg injuries in an attack.Mrs Mitchell also told the inquest that towards the end of , her son had become hyper vigilant, confided in her less, was jumpy and struggled to sleep.She described how he had successfully applied for his ldquodream job in the Army as an outdoor instructor, explaining this had involved undertaking courses in the UK, Spain and Germany which left him very tired.The soldierrsquos mother also described how her son had felt isolated after a knee injury held him back from joining his unit in Afghanistan, and instead had to serve with a dferent unit.She said that when he ed to Ballykinlar and the new job, he continued to feel isolated as a number of soldiers were taking redundancy at that time.ldquoEverything hit him at that precise moment.

But she did not realise that her living in Cardf, away from family and friends, would take such a toll on her.ldquoI was just very, very homesick because our experiences in Northern Ireland were so unique and I didnrsquot have anyone that I could explain that to, she said.ldquoI felt emotionally unsupported. I felt very much like fish out of water as I was surrounded by a lot of very wealthy people and I struggled to connect with them. I was longing for the familiarity and the closeness, and the craic of home. My homesickness lasted for many years, it didnrsquot just go away.ldquoEvery time I went home for Easter or Christmas I was in floods of tears going back to the airport but yet I made myself do it, nothing nor nobody  was forcing me to do it.She went gone to appear alongside actors such as Sir Patrick Stewart of Star Trek fame in an acclaimed production Macbeth which played Londonrsquos West End and New Yorkrsquos Broadway, as well as former X-Files star Gillian Anderson and  Shades heart-throb Jamie Dornan in the psychological murder drama The Fall.Niamh is currently working on two film projects and says that as a newly married woman, her professional and personal le is going great.However, she maintains her mental health by practicing yoga and mediation and feels it is important to be upfront about having had issues.She explained: ldquoI donrsquot see a problem talking about mental health because I donrsquot like that itrsquos still taboo. If it helps one person seek help, then thatrsquos great.ldquoPeople could be sitting with mental problems and they donrsquot know it. Because thatrsquos what anxiety and depression do, they sneak on you and it really starts to alter your view of the world without you noticing.ldquoOver time with mediation you can be in control of your mind. It does not have to be in control of you. Itrsquos easier said that done as itrsquos a long and slow process but itrsquos absolutely possible.While she has excelled in support roles such as the policewoman in The Fall and a nurse in Holby City, Niamh has her eyes set on being centre stage and ldquoplaying a really bad person in the future.ldquoI really want to play the evil person in something.

So, well done everyone again.The feature of the U- boysrsquo race was the performance of Newcastle ACrsquos Christopher Neill who took the race by the scruff of the neck from the beginning of the second lap to positively run everyone  into the ground. Well done to him. Another star in the making The East Down Ladies continued their quest for honours in the Cross Country League with Niamh Kellett leading from the front and coming home in th place, supported in th place by Deirdre Weatherall and Joanne Foster, a fast finishing st.The vital fourth scorer was to be a toss up between Clare Carson and Janine Murray with Clare continuing her recent good form crossing the line in th place to give the club fourth place on the day, in the league competition.While Janine, despite struggling in the last lap, crossed the line in th place out of  finishers, for another valuable participation point.A feature of the day for me and indicative of the camaraderie engendered by cross country running, was the activity of the Murlough AC squad who as each one finished ed to the run in area to loudly cheer home their club mates, some of whom were experiencing cross country running for the first time.Such were the ovations that it must have seemed aseach had won the race.

The link with this area is part of our history, that is why I am here to meet with the council chairman and to visit local schools.The deputy mayor is keen to see links re-established between schools in France and the Ballynahinch area.ldquoThe link can help inspire young people in France and in this area and forging the link again will provide us all with new motivation, she added.David Stewart, who was a member of the former Ballynahinch, Drumaness and Spa twinning group and is now a key member of the Rowallane and Slieve Croob group, is also particularly keen for the formal link to be re-established.As someone who has visited Lamorlaye on a number of occasions and witnessed the value of cultural exchanges involving young people in particular, he hopes formal links with the French suburb can be reformed.ldquoThe old twinning link seemed to lose some of its impetus, but the Rowallane and Slieve Croob group is a much broader association, he continued.ldquoWe are delighted to have some people from Galicia with us at the moment and it would be fantasticthe Lamorlaye folk could join our group as well to be part of the Celtic region partnership.David added: ldquoYasmine has told us about some of the reformed committees in Lamorlaye, some of which are looking at environmental issues which I believe would be of interest to people in our area.Karen Patterson, acting chairwoman of the Rowallane and Slieve Croob twinning group which includes Ballynahinch, Drumaness and Spa area, is also keen to see Lamorlaye join the Celtic region partnership.ldquoYasmine approached David and we are meeting with council officials to discuss reconstituting the twinning link. She is keen to meet with local schools and while the initial focus is on those in the Ballynahinch area, we would be keen to roll this out to others, Karen explained.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council provides us with financial support as does Sport NI and we are grateful for all the support we have received. As part of our cultural heritage, looking at our past and history and aspart of our overarching Celtic nations initiative, we want to bring everyone together.Karen added: ldquoMoving forward, the focus is on culture, sports, language, arts and crafts, music and dance.

the experience of recording in the same studio as The Beatles ldquosurreal, Sean explained how the opportunity arose.ldquoIrsquove just recently joined up with a guy called Rory Gallagher, hersquos from Kilcar, Donegal, and his project is called Rory and the Island for he owned the Island Bar over in Lanzarote for five or six years before he came home. He asked me would I come along and join him so we have been out on tour and we were over playing in Camden, in London last week, said Sean.He continued: ldquoHe signed with a record label called Buddy Records and they got it all sorted for us to go in and record with Abbey Road, so we were recording our new single lsquoCall My Name.rsquoWith the new single due to release on Spoty at the end of next week, Sean said: ldquoWersquove got it all nearly ready to go so therersquos just a few mixes that need to be done.Talking about the recording day, Sean said: ldquoWe were in early morning and we were just straight into it, I never really got thinking about it and about midday we took a walk around the building and seen all the big studios.ldquoWe recorded in the Gate House studio and we went into Studio Two and Studio Three to do wee bits of sample and background vocals. That was where The Beatles, Ed Sheerin and Adele all wouldrsquove recorded in as well. So it was just madness, he added.During the recording of the single Sean played his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle, an instrument which has a tale of its own to tell. Sean explained: ldquoMy great grandfather had ordered this fiddle in  before the First World War broke out and hersquod sent the money with the order. Basically then the war broke out and the fiddle didnrsquot turn up so he thought all was lost. As soon as the war was finished in , the fiddle arrived at the door. He couldnrsquot believe it. So I took it with me to Abbey Road and the song we were recording was a slow song, and therersquos a lovely deep tone out of the fiddle so I took it with me.ldquoIt was my grandadrsquos father and my grandad was delighted that I took it with me, he added.When asked how he first met Rory, Sean explained that it was through his dad, Conor Magee. He said: ldquoRory was in a band way back years ago called The Revs and they wouldrsquove been doing sets at the likes of Slane Castle. My dad is a sound engineer, and he done the sound for The Revs about  years ago. We were going over to Lanzarote and I didnrsquot know Rory at all and dad had messaged him to seehe would get me up for a song in the Island Bar.Sean continued: ldquoHe got me up and shortly after that he sent me a message to seeI wanted to do a couple of gigs over in Lanzarote. He asked me thenI wanted to go out on tour with him when he was home. So it came out of nowhere really.Sean has since been touring with Rory and the Island for the last six months, travelling all over Ireland and the UK. Talking about their upcoming gigs, Sean said: ldquoWersquove Germany for St. Patrickrsquos weekend and America then in April, over to New York.He added: ldquoWe also have a local gig in Charliersquos Bar on March .

Beth was one of those rare people who always seemed kind and sincere.People remarked that she was always patient and helpful, always listened to your answer when she asked you how you were.\"She was no push-over either, though. She had steel, and was utterly intolerant of injustice.

Itrsquos an event that is becoming bigger every year for the month of January.The event is where people decide to try veganism out for an entire month after Christmas. This means cutting out both meat, dairy and eggs.But where can you goyoursquore looking to try out veganism in Penarth  There are a lot of dferent places you can eat out and shop in, says Penarth based vegan and fair organiser Sue Thomas.Ms Thomas has been vegan for many years and aims to share her lestyle through her vegan fairs, which feature a wide iety of food stalls and gt stalls.And throughout her many years of veganism, Ms Thomas said she has never struggled in Penarth and recommends people to look locally and ask for options.ldquoI get a lot of my vitamins from Pro Health and Nutrition in Stanwell Road, she said.ldquoItrsquos a great health shop and the owner Juliet is so friendly and helpful. They stock many vegan vitamins and products.ldquoWindsor Fruit Stores in the Windsor Arcade are my favourites for amazing fruit and vegetables, I buy a lot of wonderful organic fruit and vegetables from them.ldquoThe owners Mike and Tricia are so helpful and always suggest things for me. Unusual fruits and veg too from time to time. They also have a great supplier that does not spray their produce.Ms Thomas recommends trying to switch dairy milk for other options, and for those taking part in Veganuary she suggests oat milk.ldquoI personally love oat milk as itrsquos so good in coffee and I love it on my cereal, she said.ldquoI do buy Oatly Barista from Jos Organics in Glebe Street which is yet another great place for vegan goodies or sometimes I do go to Sainsburys and the Co-op.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Firstly, they should make contact with their UK suppliers, service providers, logistics companies, wholesalers or distributors, to seek assurances about the continuity of the goods and services they rely on to do business.ldquoNext they should check to seetheir suppliers use the UK as a landbridge to move their goods. If they do, this might cause delays and increased costs after Brexit.

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThree vehicle crash near PortadownPartner and child were lsquomaking too much noisersquoDiscovery of mans body sparks murder probeJail sentence for man who spat and screamed at hospital staffConcern as disabled woman who carrys oxygen tank slapped with parking ticket          ..

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcg.jpg","title":"ryder cup legend to address belfast leadership conference","story":"Posted on Friday February  by Ulster Business Ryder Cup legend Paul McGinley has been revealed as one of the key speakers at a leadership event taking place in Belfast next month.

The building is being marketed by Osborne King and RHM Commercial. “Given the lack of available grade A office accommodation in Belfast we are excited to bring a building of this size and quality to the market,” Richard McCaig of Osborne King said. “In our experience deliverability of projects is key in order to attract tenants and Lighthouse offers the chance for an occupier to secure the largest amount of existing office space available in the city.” Nick Rose of RHM said it is “extremely rare for an entire building of this quality to become available”. “The superb location combined with a signicant car parking provision will undoubtedly prove attractive to the market. Given that Lighthouse is a few minutes walk from Belfast City Hall and adjoins the -bed Radisson Blu Hotel we expect signicant interest from corporate occupiers.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"kainos taking on bankmore square for belfast office scheme","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Tech firm Kainos will take on a massive proposed office scheme in Belfast for its new headquarters, it has emerged.
