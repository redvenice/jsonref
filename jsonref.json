Two months on, Qwest continues to support the local community, delivering food, medication and even treatsThe effects of the coronavirus crisis extend far beyond those who have contracted Covid-19, with lockdown taking its toll on at-risk groups in cities, towns and villages countrywide. The past eight weeks have seen volunteers and local authorities rally together to help those in need. Efforts to help include work by the private sector, which has played its own part in helping those people who need it most.For energy and services company Engie, the Covid-19 pandemic has seen its teams support councils and local communities in ways that move far beyond their normal duties. The company, which has 15 major local authority partnerships and is active on regeneration projects in more than 400 communities, has deployed staff to help deliver resources, such as welfare boxes, through several of its contracts, including Qwest – its joint-venture partnership with Cheshire west and Chester council.Qwest’s engineering team was the first to distribute these urgent boxes to residents in the area and has continued to do so, delivering non-perishable essential food items to people who are shielding from the virus. Team leader Leon Cooke and his colleagues have swapped their usual maintenance roles to help deliver the parcels, working until 10pm on the first night to make sure 69 people got the supplies they vitally needed.“We pick up the parcels from Ellesmere Port Sports Village and then deliver them around the county,” says Cooke. With support from elsewhere, the whole team isn’t always required to help, and Cooke finds his engineers vying to get involved. “We get a real sense of achievement. We’ve got nine engineers and some days we’re only asked for two, so the lads are really fighting as to who can go out. We have work on, but everyone’s working from home at the moment – only urgent jobs are getting carried out maintenance- wise – so they’re champing at the bit to help the community. We’ve developed a ‘wheel of fortune’, so if we get a phone call saying: ‘I need two engineers to help out volunteering’, I spin and pick an engineer.”Delivering parcels isn’t the only way the team has been involved, with staff driving to Manchester to collect donated supermarket food, including treats such as Easter eggs, for the council’s food hub, according to Qwest managing director Ben Cummins.Cooke and a colleague also helped one resident who had recently been discharged from hospital by carrying out vital adaptations to his home. “He was in need of some grab handles in the bathroom, so we went out and fitted them,” says Cooke.Cummins adds: “Although it’s not our normal job, Leon and his team said they’d go in and help.”Qwest has plenty of stories of staff going the extra mile to help members of the community. In one case, a team member working in the contact centre took a call from an elderly resident with a disabled son and a husband with terminal cancer who could only eat soft food. Concerned about how long they would have to wait for the right food, the employee walked to a nearby supermarket, queued up, bought the food and dropped it off, meaning the family got it within a few hours of calling.On another occasion, an employee received a call from a diabetic resident who was shielding and hadn’t eaten properly for days. He was struggling to control his blood sugar levels. The team member did the shopping and delivered the food to the man – and his dog. “Our staff know the right thing to do,” says Cummins. “They’re highly competent and caring iniduals. They don’t do the job just for the money – they do it because they care.”Delivering food parcels isn’t the only way Qwest has shifted its work to help the local community amid the coronavirus crisis. Staff have also collected medication for residents, delivered PPE, and distributed PCs to council staff working from home. Qwest has also introduced an AI chatbot for the council’s website, to direct concerned residents to external websites for advice, and is providing security staff at distribution centres and at hotels that are housing people who are homeless.The roles team members have taken up may differ from their usual jobs, but volunteering isn’t anything new for staff who devote hours to helping the community on a regular basis, says Cummins. They helped to put a roof on a community centre last year and also worked on gardens at a care home. That desire to help comes from recognising that those affected could be their own family and friends. “One of our members of staff is 78. He is shielding,” he says. “The reality is we’re helping our wider community who pay our wages. Ultimately this is our family as much as it is anybody else’s. It’s about doing the right thing and recognising that we’re all in this together,” he says.Cooke agrees, saying that while staff are aware that by volunteering to help on the frontline they may be putting themselves at risk, they have the right equipment to stay safe and ultimately want to help. “There’s a sense of pride. We have a really close team – we all look after each other. From day one everyone was volunteering and wanted to help. One of our engineers has underlying health issues, so there’s no chance of him going anywhere, but he’s concentrating on maintenance tasks. We’re really happy just to work with the community and keep everything going with regard to the parcels.”Cummins says: “The question we’ve asked ourselves several times is, if we don’t do it, who will? There’s risk in everything you do, but it’s about balancing that risk, otherwise we’d end up with people dying at home, or having to go out and get shopping and putting themselves at far greater risk than we would be. It’s proportional, it’s managed risk.“The one thing I’d say on behalf of Leon and the other staff, our cleaners for example, is sometimes these roles are undervalued and overlooked. I think what this has brought home is the importance of what they do, and the value that they bring every single day, even when people don’t notice it’s there. When it stops, suddenly everyone notices.”This type of work carried out by frontline staff such as Cooke and his team has already been recognised by Cabinet Office minister Lord Agnew, who said: “The way we have seen many large organisations and their staff move from their normal day-to-day work into projects to help tackle coronavirus has been remarkable. They have been able to turn around projects very quickly, such as delivering hundreds of new ventilators to the NHS and setting up systems to deliver much-needed resources, including food parcels and PPE equipment, to those who really need it. Their work is a tribute to their organisations and a wonderful example of their commitment to working on behalf of the public.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

In West and South Yorkshire, an academy trust executive and a food services boss stepped in to see how they could help A delivery of food arrives at a doorstep. Inside the hamper are bags of pasta, tins of tuna, tomatoes and baked beans. There are also blocks of cheese, yoghurts, milk and cereal. It’s a basic shopping list, but for the children and their families receiving this box it’s a lifeline, meaning they are able to feed themselves for the next few days.“We’ve had calls from people in tears”, Pam Knox, chief financial officer from the Waterton Academy Trust, who has been delivering the food bundles. “If they’ve not been able to get out, or are pregnant, they’ve emailed and they are so, so grateful.”The closing of schools on 21 March had a knock-on effect for some children, as, at the very baseline of support from the education system, they have a few meals a day provided for them. While some schools are still open for key workers’ children and vulnerable children, there are families in every city, town and village who will be struggling now more than ever.“We’ve got some quite high levels of deprivation in some of our communities,” says Knox. “There are some sad stories out there. So in the early days of the pandemic, we talked about how best we could support our families.”The trust - which oversees 13 schools in West and South Yorkshire - partnered with ISS Education, a company that provides facilities management services and acts as caterers for 400 schools across the UK. The problem they faced was how to get the food out to the 550 at-risk children and their families while still observing the lockdown.Right from the start, both companies were adamant that they didn’t want to resort to food vouchers. Knox says: “I personally didn’t want to do that because I didn’t feel that the food would necessarily get to the children involved. For me, it would have been the last resort.”Working alongside Linda Cregan, food services director for ISS, they trialled a packed lunch scheme for the first two weeks, where the kids would walk to school to pick up a sandwich and a yoghurt. “What that meant was that some of the children had to come to school to pick those up,” says Knox. “It simply wasn’t working – we had surplus food. They didn’t feel comfortable coming to school to pick something up every day. They really didn’t see the benefit of it.”When the prime minister announced the lockdown, he urged the public to use food delivery services. Orders for online grocery delivery across the UK jumped up. Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s sites all crashed with the strain of business, while Ocado’s CEO noted that demand spiked to 10 times the normal level. Knox and Cregan realised that home delivery might be the answer to their problem: they too could deliver a hamper of food to those who needed it the most.“We designed the hampers to give some store cupboard staples like pasta and bread, that meals like lunch or dinner could be made from,” said Cregan. “Then we made sure that there were fruit and vegetables in there.Similar to other pricier food boxes available to buy on the market, they also had the idea of including ingredient lists and recipe cards. Cregan says: “It was to give an idea of what you could do with those ingredients and to encourage children to cook with their families. It’s giving them a creative way to do that by providing the recipes that went alongside the food.”It worked, presumably as it gave families stuck at home an activity to all take part in together. “We have had children on Twitter showing us what they’d been cooking with their recipe books,” says Cregan.The free school meal allowance has been increased because of the lockdown, giving £15 for the weekly box, of which the team are currently delivering 550 a week. However, Knox notes that even with this support, there are people who fall between the cracks: “Some people aren’t on the free school meals register, but need to be. If we have spare hampers, we deliver those ourselves to people who the current crisis has left in difficulty.”Cregan adds that it takes all parts of the chain to make things happen. “It’s been lovely to see the focus on making sure vulnerable children get everything that they need, and having so many people making that happen has been a great thing.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Further routes will be added in the following weeks, as and when passenger demand rises and lockdown measures ease further across Europe.The airline will resume flights from its main airports in the UK, including London Gatwick, Liverpool, Edinburgh and Belfast International. It will also begin flying again from cities in France, including Paris Charles de Gaulle, Nice, and Lyon, as well as Geneva in Switzerland, Lisbon and Porto in Portugal, and Barcelona in Spain.The company will introduce enhanced cleaning and disinfection of its aircraft, make disinfectant wipes and hand sanitiser available on board, and require all passengers and cabin crew, as well as ground crew, to wear masks. There will be no food service onboard, initially.The move comes as European authorities have released new guidelines to ensure the safety of passengers as regular flight schedules resume in the region after the coronavirus crisis shut down the majority of air traffic.The measures recommended by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control include the wearing of medical face masks, washing hands and observing physical distancing where possible.The organisations say passengers do not need to worry about the air quality because “filtered air on airplanes is safer and cleaner than many of us breathe on the ground”. EasyJet will, however, not block the middle seats in its planes despite saying last month it was considering such a move. It says the measures “have been implemented in consultation with aviation authorities” and in line with government and medical advice.EasyJet calculated that blocking middle seats could have made flights unprofitable at a time when airlines were under financial pressure. The idea had previously been dismissed by Michael O’Leary, the chief executive of its main rival Ryanair, who said it would be a “hopelessly ineffective” way to keep passengers safe.EasyJet’s chief executive, Johan Lundgren, said the airline was taking “small and carefully planned steps” to gradually resume operations.“We will continue to closely monitor the situation across Europe so, when more restrictions are lifted, the schedule will continue to build over time to match demand, while also ensuring we are operating efficiently and on routes that our customers want,” he said.EasyJet’s announcement comes just days after the airline revealed that the personal data of 9 million customers, including email addresses and travel details, was accessed in a cyber-attack. Of those people affected, 2,208 had their credit card information stolen, although no passport details were uncovered.The company has contacted customers whose card details were taken, while everyone else affected will be contacted by 26 May. The breach is one of the largest to affect any company in the UK, and raises the possibility of easyJet paying a large fine at a time when the coronavirus pandemic has put severe pressure on its finances.Haji-Ioannou has argued that an order for 107 airlines from Airbus is endangering the survival of the carrier he launched from Luton airport in 1995."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adc2c678c676467dc5b9c65a33149dc2e55bdccc/0_120_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23309117ed22a25a9c3986a75a031cb8","title":"africa coronavirus successes innovation europe us","story":"Examples of innovation aren’t getting the fanfare they would do if they emerged from Europe or the USRemember, early on in the Covid-19 pandemic, the speculation as to how apocalyptic it would be if this disease hit the African continent? I do. There was deep anxiety about what it would mean for countries with lower income populations, dominant but harder-to-regulate informal economies and far fewer healthcare facilities than the UK or Italy.There have been coronavirus mistakes and misjudgments, and deaths, and each one is a tragedy. And no one knows the course the pandemic may take next – the continent, like the rest of the world, isn’t out of the woods yet. But what has also happened is that many African nations, realising early on that large-scale, expensive testing and hospitalisation was not an option for the populations, had no choice but to take a more creative approach.Take the two African countries I have called home – Senegal and Ghana. Senegal is developing a Covid-19 testing kit that would cost $1 per patient, which it is hoped will, in less than 10 minutes, detect both current or previous infection via antigens in saliva, or antibodies. It’s hard to know exactly how this compares with the price of Britain’s tests, but many of them use polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, to detect the virus, and cost hundreds of dollars. And I can testify that a leaflet that came through my door in London this week offered me a private testing kit for £250.Senegal is in a good position because its Covid-19 response planning began in earnest in January, as soon as the first international alert on the virus went out. The government closed the borders, initiated a comprehensive plan of contact tracing and, because it is a nation of multiple-occupation households, offered a bed for every single coronavirus patient in either a hospital or a community health facility.As a result, this nation of 16 million people has had only 30 deaths. Each death has been acknowledged inidually by the government, and condolences paid to the family. You can afford to see each death as a person when the numbers are at this level. At every single one of those stages, the UK did the opposite, and is now facing a death toll of more than 35,000.Ghana, with a population of 30 million, has a similar death toll to Senegal, partly because of an extensive system of contact tracing, utilising a large number of community health workers and volunteers, and other innovative techniques such as “pool testing”, in which multiple blood samples are tested and then followed up as inidual tests only if a positive result is found. The advantages in this approach are now being studied by the World Health Organization.Across the African continent, the lack of access to expensive pharmaceutical products, not to mention a well-founded historic lack of trust, has fuelled interest in whether traditional herbal remedies have anything to offer. One plant in particular – Artemisia annua, or sweet wormwood, which belongs to the daisy family – is drawing particular attention after the president of Madagascar, Andry Rajoelina, claimed it was a “cure” for Covid-19.That may sound Trumpian, and the WHO has cautioned that further trials are needed before it can be advocated as a treatment for the disease. But I contacted the respected Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces in Germany, which is currently conducting clinical trials on a different breed of the same plant, in this case grown in Kentucky.This specially grown, more potent variety of sweet wormwood is being tested on cells to determine its effectiveness in fighting coronavirus infections and the results so far, the institute’s director, Prof Peter Seeberger, told me, are “very interesting”. Human clinical trials are likely to follow.More than 20 African countries have already ordered the Madagascan version, a vote of confidence for Rajoelina, who has taken to showing up at meetings and TV appearances with a bottle of a brown herbal drink made from the plant, touting its benefits.The reason you probably haven’t heard about this, he says, is because of patronising attitudes towards African innovation. “If it was a European country that had actually discovered this remedy, would there be so much doubt?” he asked on French TV. “I don’t think so.”The scientists will have to say whether his “cure” actually works (among those calling for better evidence of its safety and effectiveness is Madagascar’s own National Academy of Medicine). But on Eurocentric attitudes, he has a point. The African continent has a stellar history of innovating its way out of problems – just look at how mobile money and fintech has turned it into one of the most digitally savvy regions in the world. It has been well documented how a patronising attitude towards east Asia is what allowed European countries to be caught by such surprise at the spread of this disease. Now a similar mindset seems set to ensure we don’t learn the lessons Africa has to offer in overcoming it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5825e2879cada7ef9d4ebb698048658ba75f2d72/0_434_4815_2889/master/4815.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f0812abe61ba9f75ba9e1565f4eb17c","title":"britains pride past not matched vision future","story":"There have been times over the last few weeks when it has felt as if we were living through a looped replay of Dad’s ArmyMirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all? The Covid-19 crisis is a mirror held up to each nation. Some, such as Jacinda Ardern’s New Zealand, look very good indeed. Many have celebrated an unfamiliar unity, solidarity and selflessness, praising as distinctively Spanish, Italian or Danish the very same qualities that just across the frontier are being lauded as Portuguese, French or Swedish. Others, such as the United States and Poland, are tragically revealed as incapable of achieving national solidarity even when faced with such an external threat. Instead they appear more politically polarised than ever, like a man whose right arm is fully engaged in wrestling with his own left arm while a tiger mauls his back.How does Britain look in the Covid-19 mirror? Let’s start with the good news. At the end of last year, the ide between Brexiters and remainers seemed miles deep. These were the new tribes replacing political parties, it was suggested, and the civil war between them might last for decades. Yet there was neither Brexiter nor remainer when Covid-19 came to call. We pulled together. Unlike Donald Trump, Boris Johnson has shown due respect for the science around this pandemic. As in many other European countries, Britain’s weekly evening applause and widespread volunteering in support of health and care workers has been genuinely moving. The “whatever it takes” economic response of the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the Bank of England has been swift, bold and fundamentally correct.Now for the bad news. Britain’s muddled handling of the Covid-19 crisis has put another big dent into what used to be its reputation for good government. Although Brits have come together across the Brexit ide, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have each had different public health responses, highlighted particularly by Scottish nationalist leader, Nicola Sturgeon. The most striking thing, however, has been the way that Britain in general, and England in particular, has reverted to a nostalgic celebration of our shared past in the second world war, with no corresponding sense of a shared future.There have been times over the last few weeks when it has felt as if we were living through a permanent, looped replay of Dad’s Army, the TV comedy series about Britain’s Home Guard in the second world war. The unchallenged media hero of this crisis is Captain Tom, the 100-year-old war veteran celebrated for raising millions of pounds for the NHS by doing a sponsored walk around his garden. Not a day goes by without more photographs of him in his blue blazer and campaign medals, and he has just been given a knighthood. Spitfires flew overhead to mark his 100th birthday. Mentions of Winston Churchill and the blitz are two a penny. The forces’ sweetheart, Vera Lynn, now 103, has been back in the charts with her wartime hit We’ll Meet Again – quoted by the Queen in a televised broadcast to the nation in the slightly more Queen’s English version, “We will meet again”. This wartime nostalgia reached a peak around VE Day, helpfully explained by one Daily Mail souvenir blurb as the day Britain celebrates its “victory over Europe”.I am irresistibly reminded of the comment made by a former US ambassador that the British “seem to know mainly what they used to be”. Now, before some dyspeptic columnist hands me the journalistic equivalent of the white feather, let me affirm that the British are absolutely right to be proud of their wartime record. What our parents and grandparents did under Churchill’s leadership in 1940 really was in many ways our “finest hour”, and if we Brits can still draw strength and inspiration from it, good.The trouble is that this justified pride in that past is not matched by any corresponding vision for the future. Yet to be a nation in good mental health requires a sense both of where you are coming from and where you want to go. Ideally, you want a narrative connecting the two. It is a somewhat painful irony that Germany has managed to turn its own horrendous second world war record into the starting point of such a positive narrative, as its president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, demonstrated in a magnificent speech on VE Day, while Britain seems to have only the retrospective half.The main reason, however, for there being no shared vision of the future is that … we have no shared vision of the future. The Johnson government, in particular, represents an ultra-Brexity “very well, alone!” fantasy which is not shared even by many Conservatives.In Spain’s transition to democracy in the 1970s, after a bitter civil war and a long night of dictatorship, it was felt that the price of national unity was amnesia. In Britain after Brexit, the price of national unity is nostalgia.Yet precisely in this crisis we see what some of the ingredients of that shared future could be. A country that has superb scientists and universities, with an Oxford University team possibly about to create one of the first effective Covid-19 vaccines in the world and Imperial College London not far behind. A country with outstanding public service broadcasting – the BBC has had a good Covid-19 “war” – and other first-rate media and creative industries. A parliamentary democracy that functions well even when most of its representatives can’t physically meet in parliament. A society with a deep commitment to its National Health Service and to a strong welfare state. A place where doctors and nurses from all around the world, migrants themselves or people of migrant background, take the lead in saving the lives of others, including that of the prime minister himself, tended in intensive care by nurses from Portugal and New Zealand.The question now is who can articulate a vision for Britain in 2040, not 1940. Step forward Labour’s new leader, Keir Starmer, and propose a future to match Britain’s best past."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8009b477d7e922d861e62a7c94cafe18b233a20/0_293_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1c715645379ab0a39948350ca342091","title":"coronavirus reality monsters aliens horror movies","story":"Horror movies are a consolation at the moment – proof that things could be a lot worse In the weeks and months after my kids were born, I couldn’t tolerate watching violence on television. I sought out the softest, lamest shows around. I watched multi-season family dramas in which people yelled at one other, broke down, stormed off, then came back, reconciled and broke down again.I did two seasons of Midsomer Murders, the winsome drama that began in the late 1990s, and dug up prestige BBC shows from a decade earlier – the kind in which characters in large drawing rooms exchange brittle remarks, and all the relationships between the men had a gay subtext. I thoroughly enjoyed Downton Abbey.The pandemic has seen off our usual methods of escape, and for those of us lucky enough to be home and safe, the question of where to go in our heads can be tricky. It’s unhealthy to fall down a news wormhole, but avoiding the news seems bad too. Novels require more peace of mind than I have. And while the days are fraught with commitment – schoolwork, housework, regular work, lesson prep, the ceaseless whir of the printer and the sink full of dishes, again – they also seem aimless and without end. No one goes to bed in my house any more. If there’s a minute off, it is hard to know where to go.It started with The Outsider, the HBO adaptation of a Stephen King book in which a shapeshifter – I talk about “shapeshifters” now – causes boils to break out on his victims’ necks, then comes back in the form of their abusive dead mothers to taunt them. I kept waiting to lose interest, as I tend to do with horror. Instead, I was beside myself with enjoyment. I binged the series in three nights straight, thinking it was the best thing I’d ever watched.From there, I moved on to The Terror, the Hulu show based on Sir John Franklin’s doomed 1845 expedition to the Arctic. It has Ciarán Hinds blustering about in period costume, and it illuminates an interesting period of naval history but that wasn’t it. In the second episode (spoiler alert), a demonic polar bear appears on the scene, ripping a bunch of sailors in half and putting Hinds head-first down an ice hole. Bingo.Since it came out, in 2018, I’d been avoiding A Quiet Place, the John Krasinski alien flick in which a woman (Emily Blunt) has to give birth in perfect silence, lest she alert to her presence a bunch of flappy-legged creatures who “see” through their ears and eat humans. Artwork for the movie showed Blunt, wide-eyed with terror, with a hand over her mouth. God, I thought. Why do people watch this stuff?It’s all I watch, now. Through a combination of anxiety and boredom, lethargy and fear, the only thing I’m interested in is the apocalypse. In the early days of the lockdown in New York, it was easy to watch regular TV and feel a pang of sadness and alarm at scenes in busy restaurants. Now, I couldn’t care less those about those people clinking glasses or pushing their way through Times Square. They are innocent to the point of delusion.I don’t want thoughtful internal journeys, or wistfulness or subtlety. I tried Normal People and was impatient to the point of fury this is all very well, I thought, but when is someone going to lose an arm? How could it possibly compete with something like Train to Busan, the brilliant South Korean zombie flick in which fast-moving zombies take over a train, causing a fund manager to reboot his humanity? (“At a time like this,” he tells his daughter, “only look after yourself.” Well, he certainly learns his lesson).I watched Cargo, a great Australian zombie movie starring Martin Freeman, in which, after the zombie apocalypse, only the indigenous people survive. I rewatched War of the Worlds, the Tom Cruise version, in which he spends the entire movie just shouting his kids’ names. It was as terrible as I remembered, but there was no denying the fact that, at the sight of the aliens gathering in a weather event behind what looks like the Long Island Expressway, I was infinitely soothed.I went back to Contagion, of course, Steven Soderbergh’s virus movie from 2011. But, strangely, it didn’t hit the spot. I don’t want documentary. I don’t want a show about a virus, unless it is extraterrestrial. Consolation only comes in watching something worse than reality, that externalises the sense of the world gone insane. I want monsters, and aliens, and armies of the undead. I want to see people being stalked by an unnamed terror. I want some reflection of savagery that won’t be smoothed over, an emergency that can’t be absorbed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b210c8c5c0aa06bb35aa5b6581c3a1ead14473f/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=cb09f55aee1d9b05ba38e8eb12bbeae6","title":"very very upsetting students face tough decisions over university","story":"Many feel uncertain about quality of education they will receive under restrictions to combat coronavirus Thousands of students due to start university in September are feeling uncertain about what to expect, with online learning and physical distancing measures likely to be in place, with one in five considering whether to defer.Many are worried about the quality of education they will receive, and have concerns about starting life away from home under a raft of regulations aimed at reducing the spread of coronavirus.For those studying more practical, hands-on degrees, there are questions about whether these courses can be effectively transferred online.“With medicine, especially at York, where I’m going to study, they put a big emphasis on developing interpersonal skills with patients, and being in a medical setting from really early on,” said Amaala Malik, 19, who is starting a degree in medicine in September.“We’re supposed to be spending some afternoons in GP clinics by week three, but I can’t really see a scenario where they let young medical students back into hospitals and clinics at the moment, and that aspect of medicine was the one I was most excited for. Hopefully by later years it’ll be something I can do again, but developing those patient skills early on is really important.”Malik has already undertaken a gap year, so is hesitant to take another year out before starting her degree.“Because medicine is such a long degree, the idea of taking another gap year is not something I’ve really considered,” she said. “All my friends have already begun uni, and in a way, I don’t want to be left behind.”The shift to online teaching has led many to question whether the high tuition fees are worth the education they will receive, with some opting to defer until the following academic year.Dominik Wojciechowski, 21, is due to start a degree in music in September, but is trying to defer. “It’s just a waste of money,” he said. “If you don’t have orchestral classes you don’t get the experience of playing in an orchestra, which would prepare you for your career, and you won’t be able to learn the repertoire and literature of music as well.”Alongside physical distancing, the potential lack of access to facilities and equipment was also a major concern for Wojciechowski.Many students have lost part-time jobs that supported them during university, leaving them struggling to fund their education.Throughout her degree, Amy Tetsola, a 20-year-old marketing student at the University of Leicester, has had a zero-hours contract working various jobs in the hospitality sector. Since the coronavirus pandemic, this work has stopped. Tetsola is concerned about the financial implications of undertaking study without a part-time job, and has decided to defer her final year of study.Like Wojciechowski, she is struggling to reconcile the high tuition fee costs with the education she will receive.“Given my third year is the most important year of my academic career, I don’t want to compromise it by having everything delivered virtually. I’ll pay nearly £10,000 for that year, and I may have to pay full fees for online teaching. It’s not worth taking that chance,” she added. “We’re paying a lot of money to jump on a Zoom call.”Some courses will not allow deferrals because of coronavirus, and for many students, the risk of losing the place is too great to take.“It’s been a dream of mine for a long time to go to Cambridge, and part of me is terrified that if I was to reject the place and try again next year, it would be much more competitive because so many people will have deferred,” said Emily, who is due to start her master’s degree in September.Emily said the loss of her dream university experience is “very, very upsetting”.“Those opportunities for networking are incredibly important, meeting those people is a huge part of the degree,” she said. “How am I mean to make friends sat in a dorm room?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5aca35abd597d287bd07d5bfca583485016b67f2/0_254_5026_3015/master/5026.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c3e0fc354703fc6aa0cee99f17bc0ed","title":"fly fishing lockdown coronavirus new york","story":"The emptied streets made even the water under Manhattan Bridge a perfect place to cast but after a while I wanted moreWhen New York City initiated its quarantine – when the subways emptied out and the restaurants closed up, when the well-off and well-connected abandoned ship, when the ambulances began howling down deserted streets – I went fishing.Like an estimated 36 million Americans (at last count), I found myself out of work and with no immediate prospects. My wedding, scheduled for March, was postponed indefinitely. So, with the future on hold, I grabbed my fly rod and did what I normally do when it’s time for a timeout from the world: I hit the water.At first, I fished a trout stream 45 miles north of the city, a tree-covered brook where, even in normal times, it’s hard to bump into a stranger. I went every few days, even if it was too cold for a hatch of insects. But as the lockdown dragged on and I began racking up highway tolls at an alarming rate, I shifted to the East River in front of my apartment, in Dumbo, Brooklyn, the waterfront neighborhood famous for its stone streets, loft apartments, and high carrying capacity of insufferable tourists.A few years ago, the non-profit Billion Oyster Project created a manmade reef underneath the Manhattan Bridge by dumping shucked oyster shells into the water. Most gawkers who come to the neighborhood to take selfies under the bridge don’t realize there’s a living (if not exactly thriving) marine habitat directly below. In 2016, middle schoolers studying the East River habitat discovered horseshoe crabs and even a tiny lined seahorse, among other underwear critters. There also happens to be a resident population of striped bass, the north-east’s most celebrated piscatory prey. (It’s the state saltwater fish of New York and New Jersey, as well as five other east coast states.)Ordinarily, the parks enforcement patrol frowns on casting from the shoreline here – too great a chance of snagging an unwitting Instagram influencer, I suspect. But with out-of-towners non-existent and most New Yorkers at home feeding their sourdough starter, the paths were mostly empty.Every few days, depending on the weather and outgoing tide, I walked five minutes from my apartment to a paved boardwalk that juts out into the water near the bridge’s Brooklyn-side pylon. From there I’d cast out into the tidal current and strip in a yellow and silver fly. The best spot for landing the lure lined up directly with One World Trade rising in the distance. I didn’t always catch fish, but I did occasionally stripers up to 25 inches that I quickly released. It was my version of backyard birding or indoor gardening: a modified version of an old hobby that let me turn off the news for a few hours.Plus, I got to see the city life on the streets, at least what remained: firefighters on a morning coffee break, Orthodox Jewish families strolling along the waterfront, dog walkers letting their charges run free on the grass (also frowned upon by the park patrol). Once, a young couple sat on the bench across the path from me and proceeded to make out as if I was invisible to them. Some New York habits, it seems, are hard to break.As the weeks wore on and New Yorkers began tiring of their side projects and stagnating routines, more people appeared on the pathways. Occasionally, tensions peaked. A few times I heard someone scold a stranger for not wearing a face covering. I wore a buff around my neck, but because of my looping casts with fly line and a 20 barbed hook, I never worried about onlookers getting too close.Eventually, the act of fishing began to wear thin, even for me. Hospitals like Elmhurst remained overwhelmed by the virus. Millions more joined me in the ranks of the unemployed. (But hey, at least Wall Street was booming.) Whatever reprieve fishing offered began to wane.Still, the water was hard to resist. Just this morning, as gray clouds hovered above Lower Manhattan and spit out drops of rain, I returned to my usual post underneath the Manhattan Bridge. I didn’t catch anything. Something about the conditions just didn’t feel right.My fiancee, an executive coach and motivational speaker, is fond of expressions like: “Not all storms come to disrupt your life some come to clear your path.” She’s pathologically positive, and only has moments of doubt when she realizes we can’t host Shabbat for the tenth week in a row. This is to say – at least for a chronically jaded journalist like me – she’s delightfully annoying.While I’ve been fishing or walking the dog, she’s been busy volunteering as a suicide counselor for Crisis Text Line and giving free webinars on mastering mindful productivity at home. Twice a day (at least) she cranks to We Are the World and belts out one particular line, every single time. “There’s a choice we’re making … we’re saving our own lives!”I thought about this while staring off into the Manhattan skyline. In the recent stories I’ve read about the spike in mental health issues, it’s often argued that humans are a social species. We’re hard-wired for human connections, and that’s why forced seclusion is so difficult for us. More than that, I think, we’re a communal species, designed for collaborative work and shared progress. That’s the reason why, at least in part, it feels so good to lean out the window every night at 7 o’clock and cheer for the frontline healthcare workers. In that context, fishing for a few striped bass wasn’t the antidote. I was no longer craving a distraction I was longing for expansion.So I did the only thing I could do: I reeled up and went home, then opened my laptop to do a quick sweep for jobs. Afterwards, I signed up to volunteer with City Harvest. I didn’t do it for anyone else, exactly. It was time to save my own life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ea8a1746bb8c8c155fc0f2179a72e6ba2b9a3ba/0_31_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4ac5fc44c1ddf3264c9e223e136b3e9","title":"kim kardashian wests face masks provoke controversy","story":"The reality star’s non-medical masks, launched through her shapewear company, suggest the line between fashion and necessity is becoming increasingly blurredThe reality TV star Kim Kardashian West is the latest designer to capitalise on the coronavirus crisis by launching a line of face masks – and has sparked a race row in the process.Launched over the weekend under the celebrity’s shapewear label, Skims, the non-medical seamless masks come in five skin tones and reportedly sold out in less than 30 minutes. There is now a waiting list for them.But their runaway success came hand in hand with accusations of “casual racism”, according to some on social media, who pointed out that one of the masks was not the right nude shade for a black model. The Skims site has now changed the model and the mask she wears. Skims had not responded to the ’s request for comment at time of publication.Skims announced that it would donate 10,000 masks to various local relief charities in Los Angeles, where wearing a mask is mandatory if physical distancing is not possible. This public act of generosity has been widely reported, alongside news of sales.A host of other fashion brands have responded to the coronavirus pandemic by rearranging their supply chains to manufacture masks and other pieces of personal protective equipment, in many cases not for profit. At the same time, some large profit-making companies have been accused of “coronawashing” or using the pandemic as a public relations vehicle. Others, such as ASOS and Boohoo, have faced criticism for profiteering from the crisis by making “fashion masks” in leopard and paisley prints that offer little or no proven protection.The Skims masks cost $8 each, and are available in colours named sand, clay, sienna, cocoa and onyx. Given that the masks are “non-medical” – the website cautions that the mask is “not a respirator and will not eliminate the risk of contracting disease or infection” – wearing them would appear to be as much about style as pandemic precaution.There is concern that should mask-wearing become mandatory, this line between necessity and fashion statement is going to blur, and this arm of the industry will get bigger. The masks currently sit under “accessory” on the shapewear label’s site."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a1361e5ffb5bd7bbf31ad561e15a05d069c8aba/0_398_3492_2095/master/3492.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e29316a4e38ce79d46224c075ef7444c","title":"its a way to live out fantasies how animal crossing became fashions new catwalk","story":"The biggest video game of lockdown has become a new home for fashion lovers where avatars can dress in Prada, Off-White or Sports Banger hoodiesNintendo’s Animal Crossing, the best-selling game of the coronavirus pandemic, has become an unlikely outlet for fashion fans in lockdown. Avatars have been wearing bootleg creations inspired by Prada, Gucci, Chanel and Thierry Mugler catwalk looks or created specifically for the virtual world by designers including Marc Jacobs, who has created a six-strong collection for the game, and Valentino.There are various ways to attain new clothes in this soothing cyber society in which players can pick fruit and make friends with anthropomorphised animals. The Able Sisters, a tailor shop in the game that is run by two hedgehogs, has become as talked about in some quarters as Harvey Nichols. Here players can “buy” anything from pleather masks to neon tights using the game’s currency of bells.But players are not limited to preset Nintendo designs – the ability to create custom designs has led to a host of riffs on high fashion and streetwear looks. There are hoodies by the cult streetwear brand Bathing Ape and Virgil Abloh’s Off-White outfits nodding to well-loved names in the fashion industry such as Sacai and Jacquemus and even signature wet-look tops inspired by the cult designer of sexy menswear, Ludovic de Saint Sernin, and the now infamous “Fuck Boris” design the Tottenham-based bootleg label Sports Banger.A number of experienced creators are fuelling the game’s high-fashion credentials. Richmond Young is a web developer who has been giving players the chance to wear cutting-edge looks from Bottega Veneta, Dries Van Noten, Louis Vuitton and Gucci via Crossing the Runway, an Instagram account dedicated to the fashion of Animal Crossing. “People plug a serial number into their game, the garment arrives in their closet, and they can wear it immediately,” he explainsIt isn’t the first time fashion has crossed over into video games – Moschino’s Jeremy Scott designed clothes for EA’s simulation game The Sims, while Nike has collaborated with Fortnite on a digital version of the brand’s iconic Air Jordan trainer. But it plays a unique role in Animal Crossing because, says the ’s video games editor, Keza MacDonald, “it’s a game about self-expression”,“Plenty of games let you pick an outfit, but Animal Crossing lets you pick all the elements of an outfit, from socks and hats and shoes to dresses, turn-ups, shorts, parkas … that makes an Animal Crossing outfit feel unique,” she says. The looks range “from cute to traditional, or madcap to understated, so you can walk about in a frog hat and a pair of orange leggings or put together a blazer-and-chinos smart-casual combo.”Shel Orock, an industrial designer and co-founder of Crossing the Runway, thinks the appeal is similar to Instagram’s #OOTD: “A lot of people can’t go outside and flex their outfit and show it off, and this has been our way of playing into that.”In this world, unlike the real one, designer threads come free. “It’s a way to live out fashion fantasies without having to pay the steep price,” says Michele Yue, one of the founders of Nook Street Market (NSM) on Instagram, a play on the famous Dover Street Market, whose 23k+ followers are treated to looks from Molly Goddard to YSL.While some brands may be unhappy about having their designs riffed on, in the experience of Vivian Loh, another NSM founder, “designers and their teams are often very receptive.” Orock has had similar reactions: “JW Anderson’s social media recently featured our work in their Instagram story.”According to the New York City-based label Barragán, whose clothes have appeared in the game: “We were absolutely thrilled when gamers started to tag and DM us showing off their creations. We like to take it as a form of honour and flattery.” Fellow New York brand Vaquera, whose designs also show up on avatars from time to time, sees it similarly: “It’s been really inspiring to see how people are using Animal Crossing to live out fantasies, whether it be with clothes, gardening or a dream home.” While none of them has a Nintendo Switch and so haven’t been able to play, “we’re dying to create our own Vaquera Island”.This peak in interest for digital fashion comes at a time when the pandemic has increasingly been forcing the industry, from fashion weeks to photoshoots, online. The world’s first entirely virtual fashion week took place in Shanghai in March, with Russia fashion week following suit and London fashion week men’s showcase in June being planned as a digital event.In this context, Animal Crossing is helping open up the conversations around the shape of fashion in the future, thinks Young. “We as consumers need to see this as adapting to a new way to shop, a new way to dress up – and the fashion companies can see this as a new way that people can get into fashion.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/151c709150120384d94337477e4d97744e1f7c6f/0_112_3889_2333/master/3889.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d31b1ef51208739db44778a8a8a80ad","title":"the fashion system must change bfc and cfda call for an industry reset","story":"The UK and US fashion trade bodies have issued a joint statement, outlining a vision of how to rethink the industryThe fashion community is urging the industry to use the hiatus brought about by the global pandemic as a time to rethink and reset, with the Council of Fashion Designers of America and the British Fashion Council on Thursday issuing a joint message calling for change.It comes at a time when the industry is facing what some see as an existential threat – some estimates predict that half of the entire British industry could cease to exist by the end of 2020 – with many shops shutting and clothing sales plummeting.The joint message, an unusual move from the US and UK trade bodies, sets out recommendations intended to encourage greater creativity for designers hampered by the constant need to deliver new collections, as well as recommendations to help limit the industry’s environmental impact.The message encourages “brands, designers and retailers, who are used to fashion’s fast, unforgiving pace, to slow down”, and the delivery of clothes to stores to better match “when the customer actually needs them”, so “closer to the season for which it is intended”. One of the quirks of the industry is that winter clothes are often delivered to shops in summer season and vice versa.With cruise or pre-collections that fall in between the two main annual collections fairly commonplace, often debuted in lavish locations such as palaces in Marrakech or on the Great Wall of China, it also recommends that “designers focus on no more than two main collections a year”. This, it says, will “provide our talents with the time they need to reconnect to the creativity and craft”.While much of the industry has been moving online during the crisis, with virtual fashion weeks and photoshoots, the organisations look to a future in which non-digital events are again possible. It calls on brands to show “in one of the global fashion capitals in order to avoid the strain on buyers and journalists traveling constantly”, which, they point out, has increased the carbon footprints of many iniduals working in the industry.It is hoped that by making the recommended changes, the industry will have a knock-on effect on how consumers view their clothes, too. “We are united in our steadfast belief that the fashion system must change, and it must happen at every level,” the statement says. “These changes have been overdue for a while, and the fallout from coronavirus has forced us all to prioritise the process of rethinking how our industry should function.”The BFC and CFDA message follows other high profile interventions calling for an industry rethink, in what some are calling a watershed moment. Earlier this month, a group of designers including Dries van Noten, Gabriela Hearst and Thom Browne wrote an open letter to the fashion industry calling for changes that would make their businesses “more environmentally and socially sustainable, and ultimately align them more closely with customers’ needs.” While industry site Business of Fashion also developed a manifesto, which was signed by more than 600 designers and industry executives, calling for a reimagining of the fashion calendar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44149600444193dcf340f8f719d582652738be21/30_0_3750_2250/master/3750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=604abe606dd8d274f6dbc2ea3489f298","title":"i pastafari review","story":"Michael Arthur tracks the made-up religion’s legal battles to raise questions about the essence of faith – and of satireRepresenting what would be a solid second part of a double bill of docs about wacky religions to follow (the better, funnier) Hail, Satan?, Oregon-based director Michael Arthur’s I, Pastafari takes an amusing look at the followers of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, AKA Pastafarianism. A relatively new but fast-growing addition to the field of made-up satirical religions, this serious-about-being-silly cult was basically invented in 2005 by a graduate student named Bobby Henderson. He wrote an open letter that went viral to the Kansas state board of education (which was debating whether to allow the teaching of intelligent design alongside evolution), demanding that the board also give equal time in classrooms to the study of how the Flying Spaghetti Monster created the world. Soon, other “worshippers” in effect crowdsourced instructional texts and eight commandments: your basic liberal humanist guidelines gussied up with mock-religious language – and the obligatory semi-frivolous court cases.The film tracks several cases in particular, particularly that of some worshippers in the Netherlands who want their right to wear colanders on their head recognised legally for the purposes of official identification cards. There’s the case of a schism in Germany who prefer pirate gear, for unclear reasons. This cues up some interesting debates around the essence of religion, given EU guidelines that demand worshippers must be “serious” about their beliefs. Does that disqualify parody or satirical religions like this? Can’t satire be deadly serious? Does the use of tacky pasta-based puns (such as substituting “r’amen” for “amen”) immediately undermine those claims?The stakes felt a bit more urgent in Penny Lane’s Hail, Satan? which also had more charismatic characters and uglier, stupider antagonists than the patient jurists who rule against the pastafarians here.

You’ll never eat quiche lorraine again!Quiche has a branding problem. The stodgy staple of the British summertime is often seen as nothing more than a beige egg pie, served old and cold on buffet tables with other stale classics such as pork pies and scotch eggs.Its main problem is also its biggest success: quiche lorraine. There is nothing particularly interesting about quiche lorraine, yet it dominates the conversation. It is the quiche to which everyone defaults, out of habit and lack of imagination.Quiche deserves better. It is time for a rebrand, for people to recognise quiche as adaptable and exciting. We should be eating quiche all year round. Though French in origin, quiche has been welcomed with open arms into British cuisine. It is our answer to pizza and we should treat it with the same adoration that Naples treats its doughy son. Whisk together a few eggs with some cream, then pour into a pre-cooked pastry case and bake: you have made quiche in its base form – and a simple, economical midweek meal. But, like pizza, quiche is so much better when you make the pastry from scratch, then fill it with meat and vegetables and strong cheeses. There are infinite possibilities here are a few to get you started.Strictly speaking, a quiche is still a quiche if it doesn’t contain cheese, but there is no denying that they tend to be better with cheese. Gruyére and cheddar are the two classic quiche cheeses – they are versatile and inoffensive, so they work well with most other ingredients. But other cheeses are just as good when paired with the right partner: emmental and courgette, goat’s cheese and watercress and feta with spinach and tomato, for example.One of the quiche’s best qualities is that you can pack it with almost any vegetable and it will still work. Some combinations complement each other better than others. Mary Berry’s courgette and spinach quiche is a classic of the genre, but butternut squash works, too, as do mushrooms, cauliflower and asparagus – and even just the humble onion. For something a little less traditional, try Bon Appétit’s roasted vegetable tart, which uses red peppers, tomatoes, aubergine and sweet potato.Quiche lends itself well to all kinds of seafood: Ruby Tandoh’s herbed salmon and ricotta rendition is a great place to start (is there a more summery dish than salmon quiche?). Once you are ready to graduate from salmon, you could try smoked haddock, cod, crab, tuna or even scallops, if you are feeling flush.As you already know, sausages are versatile and work well cooked, chopped and buried inside a quiche. Keep it simple with a caramelised onion and sausage quiche, or try something more continental with this smoky chorizo and manchego take. Believe it or not, the hot dog quiche already exists.When it comes to meaty quiches, lorraine dominates the conversation, but there are alternatives. Quiche is a great way of using up leftover meat: chicken, pulled pork, black pudding, it all works. It goes without saying that ham is good too, but this is so close to quiche lorraine (which uses bacon or lardons) that you may as well just do that instead.Tomatoes generally work fine in a quiche, but cherry tomatoes, with their size and sweetness, are perfect for it and deserve their own section. Kim-Joy’s cherry tomato quiche is topped with one large tomato sporting a decorative sushi nori face. Anna Jones’s includes a medley of other vegetables.It is rare for cheese to get top billing when it comes to quiche, but not so for blue cheese quiches. Some recipes keep it simple and call for a generic blue cheese (see Oliver Rowe’s asparagus and blue cheese recipe). Others want something more specific (Ruby Tandoh’s broccoli and gorgonzola quiche). A friend swears to me that pear and roquefort quiches are also a thing.One of the few criticisms I will accept about quiche is that it is not the healthiest of meal choices. After all, it is mainly eggs and pastry (and cream and cheese and meat). There is a way around this, though – to have your quiche and eat it: make it without the pastry, like a frittata. There are plenty of recipes out there for crustless quiches, but, with the right ovenproof dish, there’s no reason why most wouldn’t also work without the base (although it may require a bit of experimentation to get the best results). You could also try alternatives to pastry, such as a sweet potato crust.Still not convinced? If you really, really can’t live without it, then Felicity Cloake has the recipe for the perfect quiche lorraine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30fe0df32e6d6a7cbe37bf6658a89c2764090c86/0_95_2991_1794/master/2991.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=942f1f642a87c9ceae4107b51d2d76e2","title":"bbc may delay hunt for new director general amid pandemic","story":"Exclusive: shortlist features just one woman as potential candidates weather crisis in current rolesThe BBC is discussing delaying the hunt for its next director general because of the pandemic’s impact on the recruitment process, as it emerges that the current shortlist features just one woman.It is understood that the BBC is considering postponing interviews with the final candidates to replace Tony Hall from early June to September. Under such a plan, which is understood to not yet be signed off, the successful candidate would be hoped to be in place by January.Sources say the coronavirus crisis has affected the number of potential applicants because many are top executives at companies grappling with issues such as furloughing hundreds of staff and cutting costs, which means they might be viewed in a poor light if they were involved with a potential move to run the BBC.The BBC is known to have shortlisted three candidates: Will Lewis, the former chief executive of the publisher of the Wall Street Journal, and two of the corporation’s most senior executives, Tim Davie and Charlotte Moore.The corporation had several contenders it thought might accept the fourth shortlist position, with the hope that one of the highly qualified female candidates being considered would throw their name in the hat, but this has not happened.The fourth candidate on the list is understood to be Doug Gurr, the New Zealand-born head of Amazon’s UK and Ireland operations. A spokesman for Amazon UK said: “We never comment on rumour and speculation.”The BBC is known to have approached a number of highly qualified female candidates about participation in the recruitment process: Alex Mahon, the chief executive of Channel 4 Carolyn McCall, the chief executive of ITV Jane Turton, the head of All3Media, the production group behind shows ranging from Call the Midwife to Gogglebox and Sophie Turner Laing, the former senior Sky executive and outgoing head of Endemol Shine Group, maker of shows including Broadchurch and Black Mirror.Davie, who is seen as the frontrunner for the role, is chief executive of BBC Studios, the broadcaster’s commercial arm. His colleague Moore, who works on the licence fee-funded side of the corporation, is the BBC’s director of content. Lewis, who has become embroiled in the phone hacking scandal at his former employer News UK, publisher of the Times and Sun, left his role at Dow Jones earlier this month.

Placing this ad directly before Joe’s hugely popular children’s daily PE class is a total betrayal of his work, and highly insensitive, irresponsible marketing. Children don’t need more salt, more saturated fat, more sugar, more excess calories being pushed to them during a pandemic, or indeed at any time.“Children are even more of a captive audience during this lockdown, and we are hugely concerned they are still being subjected to unhealthy food advertising like this. The food industry and government focus should be on building up people’s health and resilience, not undermining it.”Kellogg’s said in a statement: “It was not our intention to advertise Pringles to a younger audience. We are careful about where we place our advertising as we know we have a responsibility to act in the right way. “Joe’s fitness channel has historically been aimed at adults which was the case when we placed our advert on it (booked on 18 March). His audience shifted recently with the launch of ‘PE With Joe’.“As soon as we were made aware that the audience of his channel had changed, we took steps to remove our advertising and we have put measures in place to prevent a repeat.’’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f7e920b127366f18089a49c639f0bcb3b7300f1/0_297_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d9bebd00fddcea5124ba790955e95d6","title":"uk hot weather and social distancing in pictures","story":"As lockdown restrictions in England were relaxed and temperatures climbed to 28.2C, people headed for beaches and parks, leading to concerns about social distancing.

The majority of the taxable capital gains (£34bn) were received by 9,000 iniduals, who each made gains of £1m or more.The report noted that despite being ignored in official statistics, taxable capital gains were often related to people’s work, and were more akin to earnings from employment than passive investment returns. They include the £24bn of gains eligible for entrepreneurs’ relief and £2bn of ‘carried interest’ – performance bonuses – for fund managers.Dr Andrew Summers, assistant professor at the LSE, said: “Capital gains are taxed at much lower rates than regular income, but the legal line between these is very blurred. This means business managers have a big tax incentive to take their rewards as gains instead of salary or idends. When we look at the types of gain going to people at the very top, that’s exactly what we find. A lot of capital gains are, in fact, just repackaged income going to the already-rich.”Arun Advani, assistant professor at Warwick University said the newly available data also made a difference to the trend in the distribution of income over time.The report noted that capital gains had fallen sharply during the financial crash of 2008-09 and were likely to follow the same pattern during the current crisis. But it questioned whether capital gains should be taxed at a much lower rate than income given that the benefits went mainly to the rich and there was a pressing need for the government to raise revenue.Anneliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor, said: “This groundbreaking research demonstrates clearly how capital gains reveal an unequal society and the challenge ahead to undo a decade of rising inequality.“This pandemic has shown how many low-paid workers are taking enormous risks to keep us all safe. We must have a fairer settlement after this crisis - with those with the broadest shoulders making more of a contribution”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a98a0b0cfd2a0423b8769a7ec6e8ad0b8ee6945/0_118_2872_1724/master/2872.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=735f08ada7337eeecdf14afa6ba41797","title":"the 100 greatest uk no 1s no 12 sinead oconnor nothing compares 2 u","story":"Seismic and ethereal, O’Connor’s cover of an obscure Prince track remains a haunting, heartbreaking evocation of lost loveIt’s been 30 years and 142 days since Sinéad O’Connor scaled the charts with Nothing Compares 2 U, her only Top 10 hit. It wasn’t the only anomalous thing about this agonised account of post-breakup malaise: it was a seismic power ballad from an alternative rock star on the ascent a cover from an artist beloved for the intimate, bracing candour of her songwriting. In the accompanying video, O’Connor came over as ethereal and wounded in reality, she would soon earn a reputation as one of the decade’s most fearlessly outspoken figures. Nothing Compares 2 U was an outlier and an instant classic – in many ways, O’Connor never recovered from its success.By the time the 80s ended, O’Connor had established herself as a force to be reckoned with her 1987 debut, The Lion and the Cobra, wove Ireland’s heady folk tradition through spiky new wave to considerable acclaim. O’Connor’s manager, Fachtna Ó Ceallaigh, suggested she record Nothing Compares 2 U for the followup. An obscure album track written by Prince and released by his side project the Family in 1985, in O’Connor’s hands it was an obvious hit: the magisterial simplicity of the vocal melody shining over a spare and slightly schmaltzy instrumental. There were more devastating moments on her second album, I Do Not Want What I Haven’t Got (in particular Three Babies, a song about miscarriage), but, on Nothing Compares, O’Connor gave one of the most compelling vocal performances in pop history: shattered but single-minded, distraught yet disgusted by the idea of leaving her heartbreak behind. She’s so convincing – especially in the video, famous for the real tears she cries – that it feels almost ghoulish to witness.According to the Family vocalist, Paul Peterson, Prince “didn’t like” O’Connor’s version. The animosity didn’t end there: in 1991, O’Connor began telling an anecdote in which Prince threatened her with violence at his home. Startlingly, O’Connor’s four-week stint at No 1 meant Nothing Compares 2 U outperformed all of Prince’s releases in the UK (and, in the US, only When Doves Cry was a bigger chart success), which may well have been a cause for consternation. The fact Prince released a new, live version in 1993 might count as harder evidence of his displeasure.O’Connor’s Nothing Compares 2 U is clearly superior to all the versions that came from Prince’s camp. On the Family’s stilted and strangely apathetic rendition, the verses are spliced with harmonies that spill over into a duet, while Prince’s 1993 recording is a full-blown call-and-response with collaborator Rosie Gaines: both convey a togetherness that undermines the insulated sadness of the lyrics. (Prince’s original version, recorded in 1984, is punctuated by similarly jarring funky flourishes.) O’Connor also changed the arrangement of the chorus, shifting the “to you” into a dissonantly beautiful monotone and spiking the pitch of “nothing” on the titular lyric – melodic tweaks that communicate despair with minimal frills.By drawing out the emotional weight that eluded its creator, O’Connor fashioned one of the all-time great cover versions. There was a price. Its evergreen appeal – charting as recently as 2012, its video still a music channel staple – and its deviation from the rest of her work fragmented O’Connor’s career: it made more sense to view her as a one-hit wonder than a multifaceted musician. O’Connor’s troubling behaviour in the intervening years, from incendiary political protest to Twitter cries-for-help, has arguably overshadowed even her biggest hit. In musical terms, however, time has only cemented Nothing Compares 2 U’s place in the pop pantheon. Three decades on, this haunting, heart-wrenching evocation of the grief of lost love remains peerless."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc65066ce995c4c4bc9c6ea2246438647da549ee/0_33_3130_1878/master/3130.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4d918b63a7fbc4e037e369d40502c57","title":"the 1975 notes on a conditional form review","story":"(Dirty HitPolydor)Piling on genres and themes, the unwieldy NOACF smartly interprets contemporary chaos yet seriously lacks quality controlNotes on a Conditional Form is an album that seems to have mushroomed out of all proportion. Initially intended as a swiftly-released companion piece to its predecessor, 2018’s A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships, it apparently ended up taking the 1975 19 months in 15 studios in four countries to complete. You can tell as much, just from a cursory spin – if it is possible to give a cursory spin to something that’s 22 tracks long and lasts 80 minutes.The first thing you hear is an ambient instrumental backing a lengthy speech by Greta Thunberg. That’s followed by a yowly punk track, a burst of post-dubstep experimentation, a mainstream pop song, a bit of Radiohead-circa-Kid-A meandering, a song that sounds like Teenage Fanclub, a melancholy acoustic ballad that might have been made for the soundtrack of a quirky indie romcom, something that recalls the more commercial end of baggy-era alt-rock, Radio 1-friendly faux-gospel-infused piano balladry and a guest appearance from FKA twigs. As you reach the hour mark, and they keep piling on the musical styles – sax-solo-assisted 80s MTV rock, a house tune featuring dancehall star Cutty Ranks – the experience feels less like listening to an album than randomly flicking through Spotify. You start to think: God, what next? Technical death metal? Something that sounds like Bucks Fizz? The pipes and drums of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards?Of course, eclecticism is part of the 1975’s appeal. They started life as the kind of slick alt-rock band that even the NME hated: one reason they’ve vastly outstripped their peers in that musical area is their understanding that we live in an age when generic boundaries and tribal loyalties have collapsed. If everyone likes a bit of everything, why not try and reflect that? This concept has served them well in the past, but their fourth album feels stretched to an incoherent breaking point.Randomly flicking through Spotify is bound to throw up some duds, and so it proves. There are fantastic songs on Notes on a Conditional Form, where their melodic deftness shines or their desire to experiment yields idends: Then Because She Goes is beautiful If You’re Too Shy (Let Me Know) and Me \u0026amp You Together Song are gleaming examples of the 1975’s way with a straightforward pop song Bagsy Not in Net’s combination of high-drama orchestration and UK garage-influenced rhythm really works, and Guys is an authentically touching depiction of the band’s formative years.But it’s easy to lose them amid the inconsequential instrumental interludes, the stuff that sounds like throwing ideas at a wall in the hope they stick, or that’s allowed to ramble on past its sell-by: as Yeah I Know or Having No Head amble along, it’s hard not to notice that once the band start fiddling with tech, they tend to forget about writing tunes. You end up applauding their ersity while wishing they’d been a bit more stringent with the blue pencil.The lyrics, too, are a mixed bag. Matty Healy has a good handle on the complexities and contradictions of millennial life, he’s empathetic – take Jesus Christ 2005 God Bless America’s sweet, sad vignettes of closeted gay suburban teens – and he’s frequently funny: hearing a celebrity ex’s song on the radio leads him to protest “they’re mugging me off across a nation”. But he’s also rather too self-conscious in his desire to be the Voice of a Generation: the distorted blast of People is authentically bracing, but the lyrics keep addressing “the kids”, something it’s hard to do without sounding like Rik Mayall favouring the rest of the Young Ones with one of his poems.Similarly, Healy’s penchant for painful honesty frequently shades into updates on his inability to keep it in his pants that sound perilously close to humble-bragging, and there’s a lot of ponderous self-examination regarding the downsides of rock stardom. In fairness, he seems aware that ponderous self-examination regarding the downsides of stardom is seldom a vote-winner – “have a complain about your fame,” he sniffs at persons unknown, on Tonight (I Wish I Was Your Boy) – but that doesn’t stop him doing it. It’s a sympathetic soul indeed who hears the opening lines of Playing on My Mind (“Will I live and die in a band?  My consciousness controls my hand”) without an involuntary roll of their eyes.To all of which, the 1975 might reasonably respond: that’s the point, stupid. They obviously want to be a band that reflects their era. Oversharing, the humblebrag, a surfeit of ponderous self-examination and a self-consciousness that comes from feeling as if you’re always being watched and judged on social media are all – like the aforementioned collapse of music’s generic boundaries and the confusion of abundance with quality – hallmarks of modern-day life. It makes Notes on a Conditional Form a curious thing, an album whose flaws are inherent in what it sets out to do: music for the no-filter generation, with all the good and bad that entails.Collard: FavourSumptuous, super-soft street soul - if that isn’t a contradiction in terms – that might have been designed to soothe the lockdown-fevered brain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20e4627447f3152b3a1f64d2eea5563eb863cff9/0_398_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=292598d450c3dedc4a233bd98e20b8e0","title":"how coronavirus led to rough sleepers being housed in hotels","story":"Amelia Gentleman reports on life inside the hotels that are now housing some of the more than 5,400 homeless people across England and Wales.

There was frustration that during the current crisis they had been at the back of the queue for key resources.One respondent said: “The NHS are understandably a priority, but other key agencies, particularly those attending deaths in the community (police, fire, medics, funeral directors) have had difficulties in accessing PPE. It’s not just PPE, there has been a critical shortage of body bags, with suppliers providing them at 10 times the normal price.”The review expanded on concerns over the government’s controlling approach and failure to communicate vital Covid-19 information and intelligence to local response teams, which first emerged in a shorter version of the report highlighted by the  last week.It said LRFs felt isolated from national decision-making and were unable to effectively plan their response, adding: “Where there was sharing of data and guidance from central government, the way in which it was managed appeared to create additional confusion.”There was frustration that local emergency teams often only found about government plans when they read about them in the press. One respondent said: “Government needs to actually consult about what is planned, not simply announce something at a press conference and expect it to work the next day.”A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “Councils, local resilience forums and other local partners are doing invaluable work in their communities across the country with support from government. They are a highly trusted and valued community which has regular contact with ministers and officials.“We share information from across government along with key data on a daily basis and will continue to work closely with them to understand any pressures they are facing in their important work so they can make the appropriate plans for their local areas.“We left the EU with a deal on 31 January this year. We have worked closely with local resilience forums and local government to ensure a smooth transition and we are well prepared to support them as we look towards the end of the transition period.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ea1eed70cc411f4d4382f4d2b2ebd39634ca281/0_0_2251_1349/master/2251.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80067a78c6c05b4af97a06b21889c1d1","title":"uk coronavirus live news update covid test and trace second wave","story":"Scottish first minister explains measures in phase one of loosening of restrictions former Tory party chair calls NHS migrant surcharge ‘monstrous’ The Downing Street lobby briefing is over.

Both figures have continued to rise since 2013.Meanwhile, EU net migration fell to 49,000, down from 75,000 recorded a year earlier and after hitting peaks of more than 200,000 in 2015.Downing Street has described the complaint about Boris Johnson to the Independent Office for Police Conduct as a waste of police time.

In the 10 minutes that follow, director Marina Zenovich assembles a tableau of reminiscences that make that shocking admission seem somehow understandable. We see Armstrong’s stepfather, Terry Armstrong, claim that “Lance would not be the champion he is today without me, because I drove him. I drove him like an animal.” (“He beat the shit out of me,” Lance recalls.) We hear Armstrong explaining how he forged his birth certificate to pass himself off as a 16-year-old and enter his first triathlon, rationalizing the deception with cool command: “Forge the certificate, compete illegally, and beat everybody.” We watch as cycling contemporary Bobby Julich recalls how, at the end of his first head-to-head race against Armstrong, when they were both still teenagers, Armstrong yelled at him: “Come on you fucking pussy, let’s keep going – I’m not done yet.”The casual violence, the callous disregard for rules and the feelings of others: Armstrong did not come to any of these late in life, once his course as a professional cyclist was set. He was practically marinating in insensitivity from the womb. Born into a rotten system, Armstrong stayed rotten. What emerges at the end of these four hours is the story not so much of a single bad apple as a profoundly bad batch – a comprehensive, cradle-to-gallows account of the downfall of an elite athlete performing exactly in line with his surrounding incentives. Amid the brutality, competition, and insecurity of life in post-Reagan America, is it any wonder a man like Lance Armstrong was able to lie, cheat and bully his way to the top? The problem is not this man in particular, Zenovich seems to invite us to conclude, as men in general: their incurable ambition and violence, the fragility of their morals.This structural explanation for Armstrong’s wrongdoing sounds exculpatory, and to a degree it is. It’s certainly one that Armstrong himself appears eager to embrace. Zenovich sat for eight interviews with Armstrong, between March 2018 and August 2019, and it’s those conversations that form the core of Lance, which takes in the full sweep of the Armstrong saga, from his childhood and breakthrough world cycling championship at the age of 21, to cancer, his first experiences with cortisone and growth hormones, the seven consecutive Tour de France victories, his belligerence in the face of doping allegations, and the final unravelling of his career, from 2010 to 2013, as the full extent of his drug use came finally to light. Zenovich says Armstrong set no ground rules for their discussions (“Nothing is off limits,” he told her) but she cannot identify, even after two years of work on Lance, exactly what his motivation for participating in the documentary was. Was it an exercise in image rehabilitation? An attempt, in the cliched language of sporting redemption, to “tell his story”? “I don’t really know,” says Zenovich. “But I came to it with an open heart. I tried to straddle the good and the bad.”In Lance we see Armstrong combative, defensive, distracted and restless, the coiled fury that propelled him – back arched, eyes dead-ahead, through all those time trials and mountain stages – still very much visible. What we don’t see much of is remorse or self-reflection. Armstrong’s preferred pronouns throughout the documentary are “you” and “we”. “I” does not get much of a workout: “The only way you can dope and be honest is if nobody ever asks you, which is not realistic. The second somebody asks you, you lie. We all lied.”Doping, Armstrong maintains, “was just ingrained in the sport, right up until the time that I got there from Plano, Texas”. His basic thesis is that he was a blameless naif, thrust into the maw of an evil sport. Here he is, for instance, on the development of EPO and his own turn to doping, under the tutelage of the notorious drug doctor Michele Ferrari, from the mid-1990s: “The performance benefits were so great. The sport went from low octane doping, which had always existed, to this high octane rocket fuel. So that was the decision we had to make.”Cheating, in other words, was the work of a collective, which makes it easy to resist personal responsibility – as Armstrong clearly still does. Derek Bouchard-Hall, the former CEO of USA cycling and a contemporary of Armstrong, tells Zenovich that “there were no morals and ethics” around doping in the 1990s, that people “were still figuring things out, and we forget that now” – as if the history of drug use at the Olympics, anabolic steroids, Ben Johnson and all the rest had somehow passed the world of cycling by. This is, of course, an assertion as ludicrous as it is unbelievable – but it offers an insight into the intensity of the delusion that pervaded the sport that Armstrong came to dominate.Armstrong reveals himself, throughout Lance, to be a master at evading the question – at reframing it, redefining it, and stacking it with caveats in order to cast himself in a better light. It’s Not About the Bike, his 2000 autobiography, he tells Zenovich with a completely straight face, was unfairly picked apart, because “everything in that book was true, except for when I address doping”. The accusation that he used Livestrong, his cancer foundation, as a “shield” to protect himself from doping allegations is “unfair”, he maintains – “though I used cancer occasionally as a shield”.Despite the pantomime of self-examination that Armstrong performs, reluctantly, throughout Lance, what comes across most convincingly is his lack of regret. “I wouldn’t change a thing”, he tells Zenovich – and it seems true that for Armstrong the most critical injunction of living is still, as he says repeatedly, to “get your hate on”.The scale of Armstrong’s remorselessness can be grasped in the intensity of the venom and contempt he maintains for many of his contemporaries. Former competitors who now greet each other warmly, he says, are “wimps”. Floyd Landis, the former teammate whose testimony provided the impetus for the US Anti-Doping Agency investigation that eventually brought Armstrong down, is dismissed as a “piece of shit”. Armstrong describes Julich, in virtually the same breath, as both a “friend” and a “whiner”. Ironically it’s left to Landis himself to offer the most telling appraisal of Armstrong’s character. Reflecting on his own attempts to deflect doping allegations after he failed drug tests in the wake of his 2006 Tour victory, Landis says: “It’s hard lying to people, I’m not very good at it. Lance is very very good at it … He’s very uncomfortable being himself.”The documentary’s only real moment of vulnerability comes when Armstrong reflects on his friendship with Jan Ullrich, the 1997 Tour winner who spent the early 2000s in second place on the final-day podium in Paris, before succumbing to his own drug-borne fall from grace the year after Armstrong retired. In 2018 Armstrong travelled to Germany to visit Ullrich, who had just been released from the psychiatric hospital to which he’d been admitted after a series of assault charges. Zenovich asks why he went to see Ullrich. “The reason I went to see him is I love him,” Armstrong replies, before breaking down in tears. “It was not a good trip. He was the most important person in my life.”Within moments, however, that vulnerability is gone and Armstrong has re-armored himself in a carapace of sneers. A rant about how Ivan Basso, Erik Zabel and George Hincapie are household names in Italy, Germany and the US – are they? – while Marco Pantani, Ullrich and Armstrong are dead or disgraced follows, and then it becomes clear: this moment of emotional authenticity is really an exercise in self-pity. If me, Armstrong seems to say, why not them as well?Coming as it does on the heels of The Last Dance’s uncomplicated celebration of success and competition, Lance offers a welcome study in the corruption of the male athletic ego. The line between Michael Jordan – brash, insensitive, gifted, wildly successful – and Lance Armstrong – brash, insensitive, gifted, wildly successful, and a drug cheat – is syringe-thin. If Lance, like its subject’s career, proves the ease with which that line can be crossed, the road to self-recognition, for Armstrong at least, appears far more demanding. In the opening minutes of the documentary, Armstrong recounts a scene at a restaurant, shortly after his exposure as a drug cheat, at which he was assailed by a crowd of angry patrons yelling, “Fuck you!” Armstrong comments with a shrug: “Some people just can’t chill the fuck out. They’re pissed still, and they’ll be pissed forever.” What’s obvious is that Armstrong himself, even after years to reflect on his misdeeds and manipulations, still can’t see that he’s exactly the same: an angry man, who will probably never be quite himself without his rage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfcb9c37da77da5d2deb49b1cec43260dfe8089b/573_425_4368_2622/master/4368.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=0e9ff5ed1114fb6f1ff79a9ce8dc891f","title":"huawei matebook x pro review windows 10s macbook pro rival","story":"Pros: great screen, slim and compact, excellent keyboard, great trackpad, USB-C, Thunderbolt 3, USB-A, fingerprint scanner, Nvidia MX250Cons: gets hot when on power, no disk encryption out of the box, trackpad rattle, battery life not class-leading, no SD card slot, pop-up webcam has an up-nose angle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d20c2c0544660c337abe163d6bf33f1980efd36/0_36_5536_3324/master/5536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70cf956de09dd9304b912fe6a5a1cb62","title":"your best holiday food or drink memory","story":"Whether it was cheap-as-chips or budget-busting, tell us ab out the most mind-blowing food-and-drink experience you’ve had on your travelsPerfect pizza in a Naples backstreet or spicy-sharp noodles from a Hanoi stall?

So with that in mind, Fox’s Labor of Love will probably end up as the biggest hit of the summer.Because, and I really can’t stress this enough, Labor of Love is stupid. It is arguably the most knuckleheaded show I have seen in half a decade. You could take this show and bury it in the desert, and people would still be able to locate it from the stench of its utter, logic-defying stupidity. Watching Labor of Love is like pulling your brain out of your ear with a corkscrew and booting it into a lake. Let me try to explain.In textbook dating show fashion, Kristy is a 41-year-old orcee who must choose between 15 different hunks. Together they will, in the words of host Kristin Davis, “skip the dating and go straight to baby-making”. Because, that’s right, Labor of Love is a dating show where the prize is a real life flesh-and-blood baby. The entire show exists to help one woman choose a candidate to impregnate her. It’s a mating show, not a dating show. Love, as we’re told, is optional.Clearly, we were already headed this way. Dating shows cannot simply be dating shows any more. We’ve had Love is Blind, where couples propose to people they haven’t even seen. We’ve had Married at First Sight, where people get married the instant they meet. Of course there was eventually going to be a show about women being impregnated by men they barely know.Labor of Love isn’t necessarily the logical endpoint of the genre – because that’s Sperm Lottery, a reality show of my own invention where a woman repeatedly inseminates herself with random sperm samples sent by anonymous donors, and then marries the father of the child she likes best – but it’s close. It’s another moment of human purity bulldozed by television. To be clear, I hate it.It doesn’t help that the potential fathers all feel like dopey offcuts from other reality shows. They all uniformly, regardless of age or background or race, look like slabs of battered ham. They’re all a bit too dumb, their emotional problems a bit too overt. They say things like “I appreciate the interactions we had” instead of actual human words. They look, obviously, like the sort of people who’d sign up for a reality show about getting a woman pregnant.The format is awful, especially the part where the woman eliminates potential fathers on an iPad app. The house they all live in is awful, not least because one of the rooms is an infantilised man cave called “The Father Hood”. The tasks are all awful, ranging from the annoying (“look after some children at a party”) to the insulting (“get your sperm analysed”) to the apparently randomly generated (“spraypaint negative adjectives on to a car and then beat the car to death with a hammer”). Labor of Love is so terrible that it doesn’t even feel like a television series. It feels like a document designed to be presented to God as an argument for the total eradication of the human race. It feels like an open invitation for the coronavirus.Now, it’s important to point out that I have only seen half of the series. In episodes five, six, seven and eight, there’s a fighting chance that everyone involved in this legitimate horror show comes to their senses and starts to rebel against the system a little. The show does already have something of a backdoor in the first episode we see that Kristy has had her eggs frozen, allowing her the option to back out of the deal and go it alone in the event of her realising that going on a dating show just to get pregnant is arguably the least dignified thing any person could ever do. Hopefully that’s how this ends.But honestly, on the basis of the first four episodes, that isn’t going to happen. She’s going to have a baby with one of these gibbering corned beef statues. Their relationship will falter. The child will grow up and discover how they came into being and embark on an unbreakable cycle of destructive behaviour that leaves a permanent trail of regret behind them. On the basis of the first four episodes, this whole show is nothing but a recipe for suffering. Everyone involved in it should be truly ashamed. To reiterate, I hate it.However, if any Fox executives are interested in paying me for the rights to Sperm Lottery, please get in touch through the usual channels.

Governments, drugmakers and researchers are working on about 100 programmes, with experts predicting that a safe and effective means of preventing the disease could take 12 to 18 months to develop.On Monday, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said that if Oxford University’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate proved successful, then up to 30m doses for the UK could be available by September. AstraZeneca said it has now finalised its licence agreement with Oxford University for the “recombinant adenovirus vaccine”, which will be known as AZD1222.Pascal Soriot, the chief executive of AstraZeneca, said: “This pandemic is a global tragedy and it is a challenge for all of humanity. We need to defeat the virus together or it will continue to inflict huge personal suffering and leave long-lasting economic and social scars in every country around the world. We are so proud to be collaborating with Oxford University to turn their groundbreaking work into a medicine that can be produced on a global scale.“We would like to thank the US and UK governments for their substantial support to accelerate the development and production of the vaccine. We will do everything in our power to make this vaccine quickly and widely available.”The company said on Thursday that it had received more than $1bn (£820) from the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (Barda) for the development, production and delivery of the vaccine, starting in autumn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4361503416f1399edc222b7ee8deaf70ad15b6e7/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e492e9ddea6a66b91cc1f5577f204e2b","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance thursday","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:After the biggest single-day increase in cases worldwide so far in the pandemic, the number of confirmed infections has passed 5 million, with the Johns Hopkins University data currently listing 5,016,171. The true number is likely to be significantly higher, due to differing testing rates, delays and under-reporting. This is true for deaths, too. At least 328,471 people have lost their lives in the pandemic so far.The World Health Organization gave a stark warning on Wednesday that the coronavirus pandemic is far from over, after 106,000 new cases were recorded worldwide over the past 24 hours – the most in a single day so far. Speaking in Geneva, the WHO’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the virus was spreading in poorer countries, just as wealthier nations were emerging from lockdown.In China, the city at the centre of the initial coronavirus outbreak has officially banned eating wild animals. A notice on the Wuhan municipal government’s website on Wednesday said that it is now prohibited to eat, hunt or breed wild animals, including terrestrial animals deemed as protected, as well as those that exist in the wild or are bred.The head of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Thomas Bach, has warned that the Tokyo Games would have to be scrapped if the coronavirus pandemic made it impossible for them to take place next year. But Bach added that the IOC is committed to holding the Games, even though the outbreak could force organisers to take precautions, including quarantining athletes.The official coronavirus death toll in Russia passed 3,000 on Thursday, as a US transport plane made its way to deliver ventilators to help treat Russian patients with severe symptoms. Officials said 127 people had died of the respiratory disease in the past 24 hours, bringing the total official death toll to 3,099. The country’s nationwide tally of confirmed cases of coronavirus, the world’s second highest, reached 317,554, after 8,849 more people tested positive for the virus.EasyJet is to resume a small number of flights in the UK and France on 15 June, with increased safety measures onboard including mandatory wearing of face masks, as it returns to the skies after grounding its entire fleet on 30 March.Afghanistan’s health ministry has said it has run out of hospital beds for Covid-19 patients in most parts of the war-torn country. Officials warned of a human catastrophe on the eve of Eid with streets “full of dead bodies” amid a continued surge of transmission across the nation, as Kabul recorded its worst day of the crisis for the second day running.Europe should brace itself for a second wave of coronavirus infections, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments on disease control. “The question is when and how big. That is the question in my view,” said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.Donald Trump has said he may seek to revive a face-to-face meeting of Group of Seven leaders near Washington, after earlier cancelling the gathering due to the coronavirus pandemic. “I am considering rescheduling the G7, on the same or similar date, in Washington, DC, at the legendary Camp David,” the US president tweeted on Wednesday. “The other members are also beginning their COMEBACK.

As recently as October, an international review of pandemic planning ranked the UK the second best prepared country in the world (behind the US). Two months on, any breezy confidence has evaporated. The government is facing growing complaints over a series of policy missteps that critics say are responsible for the worst death toll in Europe. How did a country that supposedly had one of the best pandemic plans in the world end up suffering one of the worst outbreaks? A review of official documents and interviews with politicians, national security advisers and experts in risk management suggests one answer may be that ministers stuck closely to the recommendations of a well-honed plan for a different disease: the flu.The origin of the UK’s strategy for a catastrophic influenza pandemic was a tractor blockade at a Cheshire oil refinery in September 2000. Several dozen farmers, angry about the cost of fuel, blockaded the Stanlow oil refinery and refused to leave until the Labour government agreed to a reduction in duty.The blockade began on a Friday. By Wednesday, the UK was on the brink of collapse. Copycat groups obstructed other fuel depots. Enormous tailbacks of panic-buying motorists stretched out of petrol stations and down motorways. Fire engines and ambulances were days away from running dry, and NHS trusts faced cancelling elective surgeries. One supermarket started rationing.The protests ended and ministers later agreed to freeze fuel duty. But according to politicians and civil servants in government at that time, the shock of the fuel crisis sparked a realisation at the highest levels of Whitehall that civil emergencies could bring down a country.“For a few days, a few hundred protesting people outside fuel depots brought the country to a halt,” said Sir Peter Ricketts, a diplomat and later David Cameron’s national security adviser. “The shock of suddenly finding the country stopped because of a few fuel depots being blockaded was a real wake-up call.”Within just the following year, the UK suffered more fuel protests, floods, foot-and-mouth disease, and the aftermath of September 11. Tony Blair’s government decided a completely new approach to civil emergencies was required, and established a revised and expanded civil contingencies secretariat in the Cabinet Office, backed by new legislation.The ambition was “to create something which was better suited to the way in which the UK is run”, said Bruce Mann, the director of the unit from 2004 to 2010. Civil contingency planning would cascade downwards through tiers of government, he said, all the way from Whitehall to networks of local emergency response groups.Mann’s unit dealt with a “relentless” series of civil emergencies during his six years in charge, including periodic outbreaks of infectious disease, endless fuel supply crises including the explosion at the Buncefield fuel refinery, bird flu scares, and the aftermath of terrorist atrocities both domestic and overseas, including the 7 July 2005 bombings.But the team also had a second responsibility: predicting entirely new risks and anticipating how the government might respond. Within its first year the unit drew up the national risk register, a comprehensive catalogue of all the civil emergencies that could conceivably strike the UK, which continues to be updated annually. At the top of the list – then and now – was an influenza pandemic.Early versions of the register now read as eerily prescient. “In addition to the severe health effects, a pandemic is also likely to cause significant wider social and economic damage and disruption,” stated the 2008 register. “Normal life is likely to face wider social and economic disruption, significant threats to the continuity of essential services, lower production levels, shortages and distribution difficulties.” Deaths would range from 50,000 to 750,000.“Pandemic influenza has been one of the top risks in the risk register for a long time,” said Miles Elsden, a mathematician and former government scientist who specialises in contingency planning. Elsden helped coordinate meetings of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) during the 2009 swine flu outbreak. “Everybody had been expecting something to come along,” he said. “The reasonable worst-case scenario that was the basis for most of the planning was Spanish influenza,” he added, referring to the 1918 flu pandemic that killed between 50 million and 100 million people worldwide.Prof Lindsey Davies, a public health doctor, was brought in as the UK’s first national director of pandemic influenza preparedness in 2006. Having been handed the “fairly skeletal” existing plan, Davies began battling for additional resources. To get them, she would need to force ministers to realise the potential scale of a pandemic crisis. Together with Mann she coordinated the first major nationwide simulation of a flu pandemic in 2007, codenamed Winter Willow.One question surrounding the government’s handling of the coronavirus is whether it implemented recommendations from a second, 2016 flu pandemic simulation, codenamed Exercise Cygnus. The report, which was leaked to the , made several recommendations that appear to have been overlooked.But Winter Willow was the far larger exercise. Where Cygnus involved 950 people, Winter Willow marshalled more than 5,000 people, including government ministers, civil servants, emergency planners, NHS staff, and emergency services personnel to coordinate the first real attempt to test how the UK would hold up under the strain of a pandemic.As well as pinpointing holes in the planning, Winter Willow galvanised ministers into taking the threat of a pandemic seriously. “Ministers, when they were faced with the reality of it, suddenly realised that this actually could be disastrous,” Davies added.But a second consensus has also emerged: that one of the UK’s big mistakes, rather than failing to plan, was planning for the wrong illness.Whole tracts of the UK’s comprehensive pandemic strategy turn upon any pandemic being flu – a different type of disease to a coronavirus. The emergency pandemic stockpile contains millions of doses of Tamiflu and Relenza to help alleviate the worst of the symptoms for anyone catching the new flu disease, and a National Flu Pandemic Service would distribute them. Stockpiles of existing flu vaccines that might be effective against the new strain would be distributed to inoculate health workers, while contingency contracts with pharmaceutical companies would be spun up to manufacture more flu drugs.The government’s most recent national security risk assessment, compiled last year, predicted a potential catastrophe in the event of a flu pandemic: trillions of pounds in damages, deaths in the five figures, disruption lasting for months. However, the risk assessment’s prediction for the potential impact of a new disease like a coronavirus was staggeringly off target. The worst-case scenario for a novel infectious disease in the UK, the government’s risk assessment said, “could be on the scale of the Sars outbreak in Toronto, Canada”, which involved 438 probable and suspected cases and 44 deaths. Economic damage would be limited to a few billion pounds, mostly from nervous tourists staying away.The British government’s focus on flu, and the failure to look at how Asian countries were responding to the coronavirus, was recently described by the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt as “one of the biggest failures of scientific advice to ministers in our lifetimes”. “It is now clear that a major blind spot in the approach taken in Europe and America was our focus on pandemic flu rather than pandemic coronaviruses, such as Sars or Mers,” he told parliament.The extent to which Boris Johnson’s government stuck to a protocol laid out in its flu pandemic plans is made clear by reviewing the 2011 strategy for responding to a flu pandemic (the most recent published version available). It reads like an extraordinarily precise description of the steps the UK government did (and did not) take in its initial response to Covid-19.Mass gatherings such as football matches and live music events would continue, in part to “help maintain public morale”. There would be no quarantining of international arrivals at airports, though passengers would be encouraged to report any symptoms upon arrival. Face masks would not be recommended for use by the public. There is no mention whatsoever of healthy people being confined to their homes in an attempt to prevent transmission.Perhaps most striking is that the decision to wind down contact tracing on 12 March, widely viewed as an error that has hamstrung the UK’s ability to fight back against the coronavirus, is also alluded to in the government’s flu pandemic strategy.Its first “detection and assessment” phase ( seemingly an analogue for the “contain” phase of the coronavirus response) describes how the focus would shift away from “actively finding” and isolating confirmed and suspected cases, and instead turn to treatment of the disease once there was “evidence of sustained community transmission of the virus”. It even anticipates that detection and assessment could itself be a “relatively short” phase, depending on the circumstances.The flu strategy bluntly concludes: “It will not be possible to halt the spread of a new pandemic influenza virus, and it would be a waste of public health resources and capacity to attempt to do so.”There is one obvious but important reason why the UK may have focused its attention so much on planning for influenza: following Spanish flu in 1918, subsequent pandemics included Asian flu in 1957, Hong Kong flu in 1967, and swine flu in 2009. Barring HIVAids, almost every significant disease outbreak for the past hundred years has been some form of flu.A Department of Health spokesperson acknowledged that several steps taken by the government resemble those set out in the strategy, but cautioned against interpreting this as the result of some blinkered focus on the document. While useful, they stressed, the strategy would have been only one of several elements considered by government scientific advisers, alongside emerging data from Wuhan as well as new research into the nature of the virus.They added that contact tracing did not stop when Britain moved to the delay phase, but was instead focused on specific settings at risk of infection such as residential care homes. “This is an unprecedented global pandemic and we have taken the right steps at the right time to combat it, guided at all times by the best scientific advice,” they said.Prof David Tuckett, an expert in decision-making under uncertainty who runs a research group called CRUISSE at University College London exploring how organisations can respond to “radical uncertainty”, has some sympathy for ministers. It would be natural for ministers to turn to their flu pandemic plan, he said, because it was the only one they had – but that can be precisely the peril of placing assumptions into the core of your plan.“You have a model based on your central case, and you have a whole set of useful things you’ve learned from some exercise or other,” Tuckett said. But if the crisis being dealt with is substantially different from the one a government has planned for “then a central case will distract you from thinking. That is, in a way, what happened.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d674a901dcccd9e23b837e7b1e2c69b0b1de8e0b/0_185_5548_3329/master/5548.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=768429bab06eeda7bae2e20b593ed835","title":"fewer young adults sticking uk lockdown rules study coronavirus","story":"More than half of young adults are no longer sticking strictly to UK lockdown rules, according to a survey.The World Health Organization (WHO) guidance on face masks has remained consistent during the coronavirus pandemic. It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers – not the public.\u0026nbsp“Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,” the WHO has stated.Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.\u0026nbspThere is no robust scientific evidence – in the form of trials – that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.Also underlying the WHO’s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..The lead author of the study, Dr Daisy Fancourt at the UCL’s epidemiology and healthcare unit, noted there had been “generally a very high” level of compliance.The findings come alongside a decrease in confidence in the government in England since the easing of lockdown was announced on 10 May.Fancourt said: “Confidence in government … is lowest in those under the age of 30.”Those questioned were asked to grade the government’s handling of the pandemic from one to a top mark of seven. Their rating had dropped from five at the beginning of lockdown to about four, according to those who were questioned between 11 and 17 May.Levels of anxiety and depression had not improved since the easing of lockdown, while worries about getting ill from Covid-19 had fallen slightly.Fears about food, finance and unemployment were a cause of stress for some people. The researchers found that about one in 12 were worried about unemployment, while about one in eight were anxious about their finances.Stress about being able to get enough food had stabilised in the past week, with fewer than one in 20 people saying they were worried about this.The Nuffield Foundation is funding the study, which is backed by Wellcome and UK Research and Innovation.Cheryl Lloyd, the head of the education programme at the foundation, said: “Interestingly, while life satisfaction levels have remained stable, full compliance with lockdown restrictions has fallen over the past week, especially among those under 30.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c628188c890a9a7e6bf0f71a1cc8cc6288b931f/0_17_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93957b770b907444636fc5b95b7d0b87","title":"modis plan to rebuild india parliament draws fierce criticism anish kapoor","story":"Anish Kapoor among those pouring scorn on redevelopment of Lutyens’ central vista, branding it an act of ‘political fanaticism’It was built by Sir Edwin Lutyens as the grand imperial heart of India, then reclaimed as the seat of power for an independent republic.Now, government plans to redevelop Delhi’s emblematic central vista and build a new parliament have drawn fierce criticism.Writing in the , the acclaimed Indian-born sculptor Anish Kapoor has described the plans to rebuild the nation’s power corridor as an act of “political fanaticism” by Narendra Modi, India’s Hindu-nationalist prime minister.The “expensive vanity project”, Kapoor writes, is Modi’s “way of placing himself at the centre and cementing his legacy as the ruler-maker-builder of a new Hindu India”.The project, added Kapoor, is going ahead “without an articulated architectural position, public consultation, parliamentary debate or peer consent”.Delhi’s central vista, home to the grand complex of government buildings, is one of the most recognisable sites in India. The long and grassy avenue sweeps down from the India Gate war memorial to the Rashtrapati Bhavan, or prime minister’s residence as its better known, with the circular Parliament House building in between. It was designed by British architects Lutyens and Herbert Baker following the 1911 decision to move the capital of the British Raj from Calcutta to Delhi.The geometric design, with wide avenues and sprawling lawns, was modelled on European capitals such as Paris but was also infused with Indian influences from the architecture of Hindu temples to the red-stoned grandeur of Mughal forts. The vista remains the only area in India designated grade 1 heritage status.Now, under a $3bn development plan, over the next four years an entirely new triangular parliament building will be erected next to the current heritage Parliament House, which was built in 1929, as well as a new residence for the prime minister. It will repurpose the north and south blocks into a national museum, demolish some newer ministry buildings and erect a vast new secretariat along either side of the vista, which will house all the government ministries currently scattered across Delhi. It will be the most significant transformation of the physical structures of government in India since independence yet according to many opponents, it is not needed at all.The government and HCP Design, the architecture firm overseeing the project, say its necessity is not up for dispute. “From the day after independence, parliament was too small, because the existing building was the council house for the British raj,” said Bobby Desai, director of design at HCP. “We have limped along since then. It was certainly never designed to be a parliament building for a country of 1.4 billion people.”Currently 550 representatives sit in the parliament, but is still based on the 1971 census when India’s population was a just 580 million, meaning a single elected official now looks after an average of 2.5 million people. This will be up for review after 2026 and there are estimates it could raise the number of parliamentarians to over 900, thus requiring more seats.But opponents to the project have questioned why the Indian government cannot follow the example of ageing parliament buildings all over the world, from the French parliament to the Houses of Parliament in the UK and the Senate in the US, and renovate the current structure, which is less than 100 years old.Desai insisted that it was unsafe to do so, and that an entirely new building was the only option. “The current building has heritage status and physically can not be expanded any further, without being incredibly invasive,” he said. HCP say their design will also create 75 acres more of public green space, including part of presidential palace Mughal gardens being opened up for the first time as an arboretum showcasing India’s bioersity.With Delhi currently the most polluted city in the world, many have questioned why there are funds for this grandiose development but not to clean the city’s toxic air. The coronavirus pandemic, and the massive financial strain it has put on India and its millions of migrant workers, has led many to argue that the billions could now be better spent on urgently needed healthcare and welfare. However, a petition for the vista development to be delayed due to the pandemic was rejected by the Supreme Court last week.“Everything about this project has been flawed,” said Anuj Srivastava, an architect who has been part of Lokpath, a group opposing the development. “There has been no transparency, no consultation and they are pushing forward with it so fast just so they can get it done before the next election. It’s clearly nothing but a vanity project for prime minister Modi, to build parliament in his own image, at an unaffordable cost.. “A heritage area like this is under strict architectural control but that seems to have been completely disregarded,” Srivastava added. “The government is riding roughshod over all the committees and bodies which are supposedly meant to protect this area.”The selection process that awarded the project to HCP, a firm known for their close ties to Modi, was accused of a lack of transparency.Desai acknowledged that there had been “objections” to the lack of public consultation on a project. “I’m not saying we have absolutely achieved the mark of how public consultation should happen in these projects,” said HCP. “I think there is some lack from both ends, both from us and also from the end of the government.”Historian Sohail Hashmi said the project was problematic on both a practical and symbolic level. For the first time, it will see all government buildings concentrated in a single place. “We should be talking about distributing power and instead we have a design which will be the very embodiment of the concentration of power,” said Hashmi. “A monument to a crazed dictatorial desire to have all government in one place, under the watch of one man – our prime minister.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2775802024c46d29876443795648dd2e48388b5/0_218_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d3fa83f909cd1b868fcbfdad475693d","title":"suriname election coronavirus president desi bouterse","story":"Coronavirus has stalled opposition’s momentum against president who was recently found guilty of mass murder as country heads into an electionWith the economy in tatters, corruption scandals piling up – and a recent mass murder conviction to add to his previous guilty verdicts for drug trafficking, it seemed until recently that president Desi Bouterse’s 40-year grip on power in Suriname was coming to an end.But as South America’s smallest country heads into an election on 25 May, the Covid-19 pandemic may have thrown him a lifeline.Bouterse is the great survivor of Latin American politics – and its most outrageous outlaw. After coming to power as the leader of a 1980 coup, Bouterse ruled as military dictator before adopting a behind-the-scenes role in the 1990s and 2000s.He was elected president in 2010, proving uniquely able to win support across the many ethnic groups that make up the former Dutch colony’s population of half a million. He was re-elected at the head of his National Democratic Party (NDP) with a smaller margin in 2015.Over his last decade in office, he has tried to delay and disrupt a legal case over his role in the 1982 murder of 15 prominent opposition at Fort Zeelandia, a pink-brick fortified chateau in Paramaribo, the capital. But in December a military court found him guilty of murder.He is appealing the decision and looks unlikely to see the inside of a cell, but the verdict marked a victory for the opposition.“That the president could be convicted by an independent court is a compliment to the independence of our justice system. It shows that no one is above the law,” said Chan Santokhi, leader of the opposition Progressive Reform Party (known by its Dutch initials VHP) – and a former chief of police who led the investigation into the murders.The criminal dealings of the Bouterse family are widely known. In 1999 Dutch courts convicted Bouterse in absentia of smuggling nearly half a ton of cocaine into the country, meaning he can no longer travel to countries with extradition treaties with the Netherlands.His son, Dino, currently resides in a Mississippi prison cell, having offered Suriname as a base for Hezbollah operations to DEA agents working a sting. In 2011 Bouterse granted a pardon to his foster son, Romano Meriba, who had been convicted in 2005 of the murder of a Chinese trader and of throwing a hand grenade at the Dutch ambassador’s residence.Such scandals have not dented Bouterse’s appeal. With the no-nonsense aspect of a heavy-weight boxer and a melodious voice he deploys in man-of-the-people speeches and impressive Frank Sinatra renditions, Bouterse curates a loveable tough-guy image that has won him widespread popularity among working-class Surinamers.But if his persona reminded some of Hugo Chávez – who he considered a friend and ally until the Venezuelan president’s death in 2013 – then so, too, did his fiscal profligacy and disdain for democratic institutions. He boosted social spending and doled out public sector jobs to allies even as gold and aluminium exports – the country’s primary source of revenue – tanked.To cover the cracks, the government raised more than $1.5bn in Chinese loans, development finance and a $550m 10 year bond from Oppenheimer, a New York investment bank.“We warned the banks that the Central Bank was broke and not to be trusted – it hasn’t published a report since 2014 – but they didn’t listen, and the Central Bank used the savers’ foreign exchange to cover the government’s imports,” said Ramautarsing.Suriname’s longterm economic prospects could be brighter, however.In January international oil firms announced they had discovered offshore oil, leading to speculation that the reserves recently developed in Guyana could extend into Surinamese waters. If Bouterse can cling on to power, his next term could see billions of dollars of foreign investment.Until recently, however, that seemed unlikely. “The loss of purchasing power as a result of the weak currency has cost Bouterse a lot of middle class support, particularly in the capitol where opposition parties have grown rapidly” said Hans Breeveld, a political analyst at Anton de Kom University in Paramaribo.But the Covid-19 pandemic has stalled the opposition’s momentum. To date the country has had 11 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and one death, but a curfew and social distancing measures have been in place since 8 April, cutting off the sparsely populated forested inland regions from the coast.That has made it impossible for opposition groups to organize ralliesor reach inland areas. The pandemic has prompted to the EU to cancel its election observation mission, although the Organization of American States (OAS) will send a ten-person team.“In the interior you need just 700 votes for some seats, compared to 7,000 in the capital. There’s been no oversight of what’s happening in the interior and Bouterse’s party has a history of using national funds for his campaigns,” said Breeveld. Santokhi warned that a failure to oust Bouterse would have wider ramifications for the region.“Surinamers have a choice between a better future or to become the next Venezuela” he says. “Should Bouterse retain power, the Caribbean region can expect to see economic refugees and cross border crime.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4258635.1590015720!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leaving cert students must opt in to receive calculated grades","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe new calculated grades system is being set up following the cancellation of Leaving Cert exams on public health grounds due to Covid-19.

Junior Cert results will not be considered.Teachers will be required to provide a “fair, reasonable and carefully considered” judgement of the likely percentage mark each student would have achieved if they had sat their exams and completed coursework under normal conditions.Marking systemIn order to determine where students rank inidually in a class, each student may be marked out of 1,000 and these scores will then be converted to per centages.These grades will then be sent to the Department of Education where a unit will compare information on how students in the school have fared in particular subjects in the Leaving Cert over the past three years compared to the national standard.Sources also said that teachers will be directed to declare conflicts of interest when grading Leaving Cert students who are close family members under official guidance to be issued shortly.In such circumstances, another teacher in the school or the deputy principal may be asked to examine available evidence of a student’s performance and mark the candidate accordingly.In cases where students who are studying a subject outside a recognised school, Mr McHugh has signalled that these students will be examined on a case-by-case basis.A total of 2,858 external candidates are entered to sit the Leaving Cert this year, many of whom are studying in an alternative setting such as a private college.For students in receipt of home tuition with an association to a recognised school, the guidance will provide information for school authorities to engage with the home tutor in arriving at a decision.Whether a valid estimate of performance can be provided will depend on whether the home tutor is a registered teacher and where the school is satisfied with the evidence used to support the judgment.In cases where a student has moved school recently and the length of time is such that the teacher considers that they do not have enough evidence to make a sound judgement, the guidance will state that the teacher should consult school management about acquiring additional information from the student’s previous school."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4259068.1590059049!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"primary schools unlikely to reopen in june as union sees mammoth task in september","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe National Public Health Emergency Team has said it does not see schools returning before September.  File photograph: Dave ThompsonPA Wire.It is unlikely that primary schools will reopen in June, the general secretary of the Irish National Teachers Organisation (INTO) John Boyle has said.Getting children back to school in September will be a “mammoth planning task” he told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland. With 20 school days to go before the summer break it would be very difficult for schools to reopen, even on a phased basis. Mr Boyle warned that it may not be possible for all children to return at the same time in September as there will be logistical issues particularly in rural Ireland where many children travel to school by bus.Also speaking on Thursday, Cillian De Gascun, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory and member of the National Public Health Emergency Team said at the moment NPHET feels “the prudent thing to do is to leave schools closed.”Speaking on the Today with Sarah McInerney Show, Mr de Gascun said there is not yet enough evidence to suggest that children pose no risk of passing on the coronavirus.However, he said a number of countries have brought schools back in recent weeks and NPHET will be “watching what’s happening in those settings over the next two to three weeks and that will inform our decision”.“We will continue to keep that under review, but we are aware how difficult it is for children not being in school, not having access to their friends, not having that sort of social interaction, so we do know how difficult that is,” Mr De Gascun said.The INTO’s Mr Boyle said children with complex educational needs will be provided for through summer programmes.The INTO has been engaging with stakeholders to prepare for the return of children to school, and to see if it would be possible for all children to return at the same time. The teachers’ union is “certainly up for that challenge,” he added.The deaths of another 11 patients with Covid-19 were reported by NPHET on Wednesday. There have now been a total of 1,571 Covid-19 related deaths in the Republic.A total of 64 new laboratory confirmed cases of the disease was reported by NPHET at its daily briefing, bringing the total number of cases to 24,315. This is the fifth day in a row in which the daily case number has remained below 100.Meanwhile, Minister for Education Joe McHugh said massive logistical work is required in order to reopen schools in time for September.Mr McHugh said it was clear that a “one size fits all” approach will not apply because of the ersity of school and education settings.Áine Lynch, chief executive of the National Parents’ Council Primary, said a decision to keep schools closed until September was made at a time when public health conditions were worse than they are now.The World Health Organisation (WHO) special envoy on Covid-19 also said it is was time to think about reopening schools in Ireland.Mr McHugh, however, said opening schools needs to be “carefully managed” and planning is under way for the reopening of educational institutions from the beginning of September, in consultation with stakeholders and with regard to the experience of other countries.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Strong backing for more ambition to address carbon emissions, according to pollDublin, Louth, Limerick, Clare and Galway properties most vulnerable, analysis findsReducing use of fertiliser and antibiotics also on agenda in bid to safeguard environment"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteriaAs top marine predators, dolphins accumulate the most man-made toxic pollutantsGlobal warming presents potentially damaging cascades of impacts, new study findsFifty brain teasers on all things natural from sealife to flora and what tofu is made of"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: BloombergWhat is the scale of infection in meat processing plants?There are 16 coronavirus clusters – each defined as two or more cases – in meat plants involving 828 infected workers, as of last Saturday. This is an increase from 500 a week earlier when there were 12 clusters. Some 16 meat factory workers have been hospitalised during the pandemic. HSE chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry put the number of infected workers at 860 on Wednesday.Why are meat plants susceptible to outbreaks?Employees at meat plants work in prolonged close proximity to other workers, increasing the risk of transmitting the virus. The rigid production lines, often involving for example in a conveyor belt of pig carcasses on hooks passing along a factory’s “kill line”, means that the nature of the work is at close quarters involving repeated activity by hundreds of staff standing shoulder to shoulder. As an essential industry producing food, meat plants were not closed during the pandemic.How busy can it be in a meat plant?Butchering, when not automated, is a fast and heavily labour-intensive process. For example, the processing of as many as 450 pigs per hour – or seven pigs processed along the line every minute – means that each worker often only has a few seconds to complete their task of cutting on each animal.Can the process contribute to the spread of the virus?Possibly. The gruelling nature and pace of the meat processing, cutting up so many animals in a short space of time, means butchering can involve strenuous physical exertion and heavy breathing by employees. The boning hall of a plant can also involve large numbers of workers congregating around a common table in another physically demanding part of the process.What other conditions might lead to the spread of the virus?Conditions in plants can be hot with workers butchering warm carcasses with knives that must be repeatedly sterilised at high temperatures. This can create a steamy atmosphere. Some plants can be poorly ventilated, contributing to the spread, while physically distancing may not have been observed in worker common areas such as at sinks or in canteens and changing rooms.Could other factors contribute to the spread at meat plants?Yes. Many meat plants employ lower-paid foreign workers who share accommodation outside of work, where they could have acquired the virus and can spread it further. Public health officials has been offering alternative accommodation to workers at risk of passing the virus on.What precautions have plants taken to prevent the spread of the virus?Plants have reduced production by processing fewer animals, staggered working shifts and staff departures and arrivals, and reconfigured production lines including installing partitions, where possible, to ensure workers maintain two-metre physical distancing.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"OPW says majority, but not all, obeying coronavirus rulesWind warnings in place as warm weather gives way to heavy rain and thunderPubs are supposed to reopen in August, while restaurants are allowed to reopen from end of JuneVaradkar says hundreds of lives could be saved this winter with flu vaccineCourts Service is believed to have received advice from expert who raised issue of \u0026lsquotwo-hour limit\u0026rsquo at D\u0026aacuteil committee hearingSt Mary\u0026rsquos Hospital has been one of the worst hit nursing homes in the countryGarda\u0026iacute appeal for witnesses after woman allegedly assaulted by man who fled sceneDeSouza fought battle to allow US-born husband to stay in NorthCar belonging to man missing since January 2002 found in Co Fermanagh lake this weekOperation will last 24 hours amid continued breaking of limits during Covid-19 lockdownTest can detect if person has had Covid-19 and can determine prevalence in population\u0026lsquoIt\u0026rsquos a bit early for that, isn\u0026rsquot it?\u0026rsquo says priest after playing Orange Order tuneGroup of consultants withdrawing from Covid-19 arrangement with the StateMinister says massive logistical work required to reopen schools in SeptemberSignificant increase in number of complaints received by office of An Coimisin\u0026eacuteir TeangaCandidates will have the option to re-nominate subject levels through online systemGroup of multinationals in Ireland has worked with academics in the pharma sectorStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4259144.1590055851!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"lol twelfth comes early as priest plays the sash at the end of mass","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFr Jimmy McPhillips is   seen operating a mobile device to play the final tune but instead of a hymn or some other piece of music we hear the familiar opening bars of The Sash.The Twelfth of July was brought a little early to a Catholic Church in Co Fermanagh by the playing of The Sash My Father Wore during Sunday morning Mass.His LOL moment - laugh out loud and also in this case Loyal Orange Lodge - commanded much wider viewing however when the little incident was posted on social media.It happened at the end of Mass when the priest says to viewers “let us go in peace and love to serve the Lord”.Fr McPhillips is then seen operating a mobile device to play the final tune but instead of a hymn or some other piece of music we hear the familiar opening bars of The Sash.“Sorry, that’s the wrong one.

Photograph:  Leon FarrellPhotocall IrelandPA WireA significant minority of people in receipt of the €350 pandemic unemployment payment were paid less than €300 a week before the payment was introduced, a Government report has said, as questions continue about the future of the payment.The report, compiled by the Department of Business, raises concerns about “significant disincentive effects associated with the pandemic unemployment payment with 38 per cent of recipients previously earning less than €300 per week”.With almost 600,000 people receiving the special payment, it means that over 200,000 people are better off unemployed than they were while working. That number includes many people who were working part-time in the hospitality industry.Although there are growing worries in Government about the sustainability of the payment, Ministers are likely to extend the special payment over summer, declining to either signal a firm end date or to close the scheme, according to sources familiar with the discussions on the topic.Yesterday, the Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe warned that the Government would face demands to increase regular job seekers’ benefits up to the level of the weekly Covid-19 unemployment payments if these were to be maintained at the current rates until the end of the year.At present people who were unemployed prior to the current coronavirus crisis receive jobseekers’ benefit of €203 per week. However those who lost their jobs on foot of Covid-19 receive a special pandemic unemployment payment of €350 per week.There is a general belief among Ministers that the €350 a week payment cannot continue indefinitely. But there is no consensus on how to bring it to an end.Yesterday, Mr Donohoe said if the Government was to continue paying the special Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment at the current levels until the end of the year as had been suggested, it would then face “an understandable issue” in which citizens who were unemployed prior to the current crisis would ask why their jobseeker benefits were so much lower.Mr Donohoe’s forecast of demands for unemployment benefit equality came as the Government faced calls to extend the separate special weekly € 350 payment for those with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 infection to cancer patients who were cocooning.The Irish Cancer Society said on Wednesday cocooning cancer patients “must have fair access to pandemic illness payments so they do not feel forced to risk an unsafe return to work”.The group said it was unfair that cancer patients who were unable to return to work because they are cocooning could not access the payment.Everything

lose from a joe biden presidency","story":"Joe Biden is old enough to beware an American Democrat who talks tougher than a Republican. The former vice-president was 17 when John F Kennedy shamed Richard Nixon for “losing” Cuba to communism. As politics, it worked well enough Kennedy clinched the presidential election of 1960. But it also set a standard of aggression that seemed to bind him in office. Within months, he would sign off on a proxy invasion of the island. Soon after, he dispatched more “advisers” to South Vietnam. History would not thank him for either gesture.Campaign rhetoric, then, is never costless. As the Democrats’ White House nominee, Biden cannot ignore President Donald Trump’s jibe that he is soft on China. But the more he answers in kind (Trump “rolled over for the Chinese”, says one Biden advert) the more he boxes himself in. We are seeing two men counterbid each other into an ever harder line against Beijing. Whoever wins, don’t assume it can be relaxed.The pity of it is that Biden has a better course open to him. He should redefine what a firm China policy entails. It is not a self-harming tariff war or an exorbitant arms race. Rather, the point is to maximise the share of the world that favours US leadership. If there is to be another cold war, it should be fought with the subtlety of the first.Memory being a simplifying instrument, we recall the US-Soviet conflict as a bilateral one: arsenal against arsenal, spy for spy. More than that, though, it was a contest for the allegiance of third parties. There was nothing inevitable about France staying true to the west, and not sliding into nonaligned status. There was nothing given about a bloc that encompassed both Greece and Turkey, both Japan and South Korea. The US achieved these miracles through cultural attraction, economic inducement, diplomatic finesse and military protection. In Latin America there were moral compromises with tyrants. In the end, the US alliance stuck, and the opposing one frayed. The Soviets simply ran out of countries that aspired to their ­patronage.The cold war was not just a missile race, then. It was a popularity contest. If we are entering another one, Trump is uniquely unsuited to winning it. China has much more to lose from a Biden White House. Its efforts to peel countries away from the US, or at least to make them hedge, count on un­attractive leadership in Washington. Soft powerA change of president would complicate the task. Biden need not be a statesman of Metternichian cunning, just one that is benign and attentive to familiar allies.“Soft power” is the reflex term here, but it implies something fancy, when what we mean is the plainest common sense. A renewed commitment to Nato, less trade militancy, a pretence of seriousness on climate change: all could stop Europe, Australia and other American allies slipping out of Washington’s orbit through neglect.If anything, the US has to be more creative than it was from 1945 to 1989. It accounts for a smaller share of world output than it did in the postwar Marshall Plan era. It cannot just shore up wavering countries with raw largesse. Nor is it up against a closed rival, but rather a trading one that beguiles third countries with commercial treasure. If it is to recruit and retain allies, they must come to regard Washington as a less high-handed master than Beijing. It is not work for which Trump is temperamentally fitted.Even if he loses in November, Trump will go down as a landmark president. He hardened the US line on China in a way that now appears irreversible. Biden’s job is to persuade voters who salute Trump for that feat that his usefulness has been served. Identifying a rival takes pugnacity and even a certain paranoia: maybe no other president could have done it. But the same traits disqualify him from the patient, nuanced work of building and tending a non-China bloc.Landing this argument will be tricky for a speaker as ragged as Biden. But not as hopeless as out-toughing the president. Kennedy only pulled it off because Nixon had some sense of restraint.Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, there was nothing that Trump was not willing to say about China. With the economic boom gone, his way to ­re-election is to foment a sense of siege against the world outside America. Biden should not emulate this fire so much as point out its counter-productiveness. China wants nothing more than to launch a charm offensive against an unarmed opponent. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"boris cant afford surrender contemptible teaching unions","story":"What is going on? Are the hard-Left education unions actually going to manage to delay the partial reopening of our primary schools? Is the great Vote Leave Government, until now an astonishingly successful establishment-slaying machine, about to suffer its first defeat? Are the Michael GoveDominic Cummings schools reforms of the 2010s about to be avenged by a tiny rump of unrepresentative activists convinced that they are refighting the Miners’ Strikes of the 1980s?Let us hope that it is a clever bluff from the Government, a case of “appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak,” as Sun Tzu put it in the Art of War. Boris Johnson can’t afford the unions to defy him. Schools must start reopening on June 1, and the small gang of selfish activists seeking to derail this must be crushed pitilessly.This is not an attack on teachers. With the infection rate collapsing, most are keen to return to some sort of normality, as are heads and governors. They miss the children in their care and have done their best to continue to teach them remotely in the chaos of the past few months. They deserve our utmost gratitude. We should ensure that the return to the classroom takes place as safely as possible.But I strongly object to elitist union leaders who are seeking to sabotage, through undemocratic means, the extraordinarily careful, limited reopening planned by the Government. Theirs is a contemptible ideological act, an offensive, snobbish snub to the millions of workers who have already returned, without complaint, to hospitals, factories, shops, logistics operations and offices.The prolonged closure of our schools – a move I supported, perhaps mistakenly, at the start of this crisis, when the scale of the pandemic, the forms of social interaction most likely to spread it, and the groups most at risk from the virus were all unclear – is fast turning into an educational, social and economic calamity. Millions of children are not being educated at all, others barely so by the end of the summer, they could have fallen 12 months behind, forgetting everything they learnt earlier this year.Others are missing the sport, the clubs and friendships. Some are depressed many poorer children are going to bed hungry abuse cases have shot up. The consequences in terms of social mobility, knowledge, productivity, mental health and crime will plague us for years.The gains in achievement eked out by the GoveCummings reforms in the state school sector, and the return to greater rigour over the past 15 years, could be wiped away. We will tumble down the international Pisa league tables, especially if our schools end up shut for longer than those of our European neighbours. The gap between poor and rich is growing again the private schools, to their credit, are doing far better than the state sector, with some even delivering full, real-time online lessons.The indirect impact is equally cataclysmic. Parents of younger children cannot work at all, Zoom or no Zoom. Millions of others are house-bound: they cannot travel to shops or factories or hospitals or warehouses. Our economy depends on childcare and schooling for parents to be able to operate, especially with grandparents in confinement. The costs in terms of unemployment will be horrific. Hundreds of thousands of lives will be ruined.The real critique of the Government’s plans is that they are too modest, given the dramatic decline in new infections, especially outside care homes: Labour should be arguing that schools should be reopening faster. Why isn’t Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, pointing out that his R-rate has collapsed to almost zero, demanding that all schools in the capital be released from lockdown to allow the city he supposedly cares about to start to recover? Instead, the Left, once again, has allied itself with the barons against the people.It is not as if reopening schools is somehow eccentric. Europe is leading the way, with adaptations for social distancing, without a surge in new infections. It is now clear that almost no children have died from the virus, that they usually suffer far less than adults when they do get it, and that they are unlikely to pass it to adults. Yes, a small number of youngsters have suffered some rare symptoms – but why do the British trade unions believe that what is good for French, German, Danish and Swedish children is too dangerous for British ones?It’s time for the Government to return to its Vote Leave ways, and launch a proper fightback. This is no longer a “national”, “wartime” Government with mass support that therefore needs to tread in a bipartisan way: politics is fast renormalising. Brexit and Tory voters agree with the Government, Labour supporters and Remainers don’t. Sir Keir Starmer is on the warpath.Johnson must consider urgent legislation to force all state schools to reopen, drafted in such a way as to prevent any informal boycotts. The growing number of councils that are refusing to comply should lose control of their schools, with all of them turned into academies. This may be the time to wipe away the Local Education Authority model in its entirety. Schools should also be mandated to keep online lessons going for those year groups still at home. The timing of the summer holidays should be reviewed: the school year must either be extended, or the autumn term should start earlier. Every state school should publish a 12-month plan detailing how they will ensure that children catch up.This crackdown should go hand in hand with leniency in other ways. Parents who are too worried to send their children to school should be allowed to keep them at home until the start of the next academic year. Teachers in vulnerable groups should not be forced to work. The authorities should do everything in their power to minimise risk and pay for plentiful PPE.But our democratically elected Government has the right to reopen state schools, and the unions no right to obstruct it. Johnson cannot allow himself to be cowed into extending the lockdown yet further. He should show some Thatcherite ankle, and call the far-Left’s bluff.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"culture secretary rules regional variation easing lockdown covid","story":"The Culture Secretary has hailed promising figures showing that only small numbers of people are now testing positive for coronavirus in London.Oliver Dowden said the Government may consider lifting restrictions in micro-hotspots when track and trace is in place but ruled out regional variations, saying the intention was to still move as a whole nation.It comes amid growing unease that economically damaging restrictions are still in place in areas in which the virus has been virtually eliminated. Last week, The  revealed Public Health England (PHE) modelling suggested that fewer than 24 people a day were being infected in London, with the number halving every 3.5 days.New analysis by Oxford University for The  shows that six major London hospital trusts have reported no virus deaths in the past 48 hours.Homerton, University College London, Hillingdon, North Middlesex, Whittington Health and Guy\u0027s and St Thomas\u0027, were recording up to 16 deaths a day at the peak of the crisis, and have totalled more than 1,000 deaths between them since the start of the epidemic.New testing data released by PHE this week also appeared to show that nobody had tested positive on Tuesday, although the figures have since been revised to 14 cases. Mr Dowden said the numbers were promising and moving in the right direction but, asked by ITV at the Downing Street press briefing whether lockdown could be eased regionally based on the PHE figures, he ruled out the idea.We have to be highly cautious about it, he said. The Prime Minister set out the path that we will go down in terms of easing lockdown. The next stage... we said from the earliest will be from the beginning of June.We want to proceed as fast and as we safely can, because clearly there are benefits for children and clearly benefits for the wider economy. I think it is best though, and the Government has said this repeatedly, that we move as a whole nation, and that would include of course the whole of England, in doing so.There is increasing concern among some ministers – including the Chancellor – and many Tory MPs about the potential for long-term damage to the economy because of the number of people still off work.The Treasury estimates that the coronavirus crisis will cost the economy almost £300 billion this year, and figures released this week showed that 10 million private sector workers are now relying on Government furlough schemes.Getting the capital back to work is the key to minimising what Rishi Sunak describes as scarring of the economy, with London generating almost a quarter of the nation\u0027s gross domestic product. The south-east as a whole, including London, accounts for nearly 40 per cent of GDP.The Oxford analysis, by Professor Carl Heneghan and Dr Jason Oke of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, shows that there 41 of the 131 acute NHS trusts have not reported a single death from coronavirus in the past 48 hours.The same trusts recorded 320 deaths between them in the same timeframe around the peak of the crisis on April 7-8.Some 40 per cent of all trusts, including the non-acute, have recorded no deaths for the past seven days, including 10 major acute trusts, mainly in the south-west.The former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said the figures showed it was time to unlock.We must get on with it, he said. London is a significant chunk of the capability of the UK and this is on the decline everywhere. If we behave as the Government has been saying, not so much social distancing, but continuing with the hygiene, my general view is that we need to be lifting lockdown now.On Wednesday, NHS England announced just 166 new deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 25,080. The numbers of deaths have been falling by around 100 every seven days for the past month, and there are also fewer than 10,000 people in hospital for the first time since March.A declining number of cases and deaths is one of the five tests set out by the Government for the easing of lockdown in the UK.Another is maintaining a low \u0027R\u0027 number, which tracks how many people the average coronavirus patient infects.Data modelling by Cambridge University\u0027s MRC Biostatistics Unit has already suggested that the \u0027R\u0027 number in London is significantly lower than elsewhere in the UK, hovering at around 0.4 compared to a national average of at least 0.7.Former Cabinet minister Theresa Villiers said growing evidence of a decline of the virus should allow ministers to feel confident in easing the lockdown more quickly using regional variations.We need to get the economy going again, she said. There is real measured progress on getting new cases down that should be the signal to let life get back to normal. However, Tobias Ellwood, the chairman of the defence select committee, urged caution, saying: The stats we are looking at have a few days lag. What we have seen in the past is this, London, is where the virus can flourish, in big cities. This is fantastic news, but the good work needs to be leveraged and not lost by celebrating too soon. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"earlier lockdown could have prevented three quarters uk coronavirus","story":"Three-quarters of coronavirus deaths in Britain might have been avoided if the lockdown had begun a week earlier, modelling suggests. Researchers said that if the UK had imposed the measures seven days earlier its death toll now would be on a par with the 8,000 in Germany.They also said it would have been possible to have a shorter and less economically damaging lockdown.Britain introduced its lockdown measures on March 23, when 359 deaths had been reported. Germany took such steps on the same day, but had reported only 86 fatalities at that time. The UK\u0027s death toll has now exceeded 35,000 people. Modelling from British scientist James Annan suggests that entering lockdown a week earlier would have reduced the number of deaths by three-quarters.Mr Annan, from Blueskiesresearch.org.uk, said an earlier lockdown would have been shorter and had less economic impact. In a related blog, he wrote: Implementing the lockdown one week earlier would have saved about 30,000 lives in the current wave (based on official numbers, which are themselves a substantial underestimate). It would also have made for a shorter, cheaper, less damaging lockdown in economic terms.Modellers said the calculations showed that even small changes in the timing of interventions could make a significant difference. Dr Kit Yates, senior lecturer in mathematical biology at the University of Bath, said: In the early stages of an epidemic, the number of cases is growing exponentially. This means even a small change in the rate of spread or in the timing of interventions can make a big difference a short period of time down the line.It is clear that, had we locked down sooner, we would have reduced the spread earlier, limiting the number of cases and consequently the number of deaths. The other benefit of locking down earlier would have been bringing cases under control sooner and potentially allowing the release of lockdown sooner.The modelling was revealed on Radio 4\u0027s More or Less programme, which highlighted differences in the testing regimes used by different countries earlier in the epidemic, with Germany carrying out 50,000 tests daily at a time when the UK could not even achieve that weekly. As a result, at the point both countries entered lockdown, Germany had identified around 27,000 cases, when the UK had confirmed just 9,000, researchers said. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"charts show uk road recovery","story":"By Saturday millions of people across the UK will have been under lockdown for two months, but now pockets are emerging across the country where the virus is being stamped out.The prevalence of Covid-19 has fallen by as much as 40 per cent in just two weeks, and statisticians have estimated deaths from the virus could be eliminated by next month.As the clamour for lifting lockdown grows, falling numbers of infections and deaths can provide hope, but they come amid stark warnings against undoing the hard work achieved since March and risking a second wave.The UK is now well beyond the peak in new cases, and the number of infections detected has fallen significantly throughout May.In the two weeks since May 6, the average number of new infections over the previous seven days dropped by almost 40 per cent (37.9).Fewer than 2,500 new cases were detected on May 20, almost 30 per cent lower than the same day the previous week.It comes after a worrying plateau in the number of new cases lasting since early April. For almost 40 days the average number of daily new cases failed to fall below 4,000, but recent days there has been a sharp decline.The delay has left the UK trailing its neighbours in feeling secure to venture out of lockdown.Denmark allowed schools to reopen on April 13, followed by some small businesses a week later. The country was one of the first in Europe to take action to arrest movement, imposing a lockdown on March 11, almost two weeks before the UK.In the Czech Republic a state of emergency was declared the same day, before the country had recorded its first death, and an easing of restrictions came on April 20.It meant total lockdown was only in place for 33 days in Denmark and 40 days in the Czech Republic.According to data released by the Office for National Statistics, it is now clear deaths from coronavirus in hospitals across England and Wales peaked in April 8, and the spike in care home deaths came just over a week later, around April 17.The Government has been roundly criticised for the lack of protection afforded to care homes, and while it is not yet clear what caused the delay in the peak of deaths, they are now are falling in all settings.In the fortnight between 24 April and 8 May, the number of weekly care home deaths fell by 40 per cent, and deaths in hospital fell by 59 per cent.It left more people dying from coronavirus in the community than in hospitals in England and Wales for the first time, paving the way for the number of patients in hospital with Covid-19 to fall below 10,000 for the first time this week.Some leading statisticians have estimated deaths from coronavirus in Britain could peter out by the end of June if current trends continue, but warned hospitals and care homes need strict monitoring to ensure no further outbreaks..The number of deaths on Monday was 545, down from 627 a week ago, and the seven-day average is now 378. Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that, on average, deaths are now falling at a rate of around 30 each day.Carl Heneghan, professor of evidence-based medicine at the University of Oxford, said that there would be a sporadic rise and fall in deaths over the next four to six weeks but he would not expect to find coronavirus listed in the ONS death data by the end of June. Speaking at a briefing in central London, Prof Henegan said: I think you can already see that regions are reporting 48 hours without deaths, trusts are starting to do that.I think by the end of June we\u0027ll be looking at the data and finding it difficult to find people with this illness in the deaths if the current trends continue.But we will continue to have these sporadic ups and downs for about four to six weeks. People shouldn\u0027t panic if we have no deaths for a couple of days and then we have eight or 10 because you will see that, as we go down to lower numbers, we will have a bit more variation in the data.As some of the smallest NHS trusts in England are beginning to enjoy successive days with no new Covid-19 deaths, many others have seen significant falls in fatalities.Of the 218 trusts covered in daily data from NHS England, some 167 have seen reductions in the number of coronavirus deaths between the periods of 8-14 April and 8-14 May, the latest period for which full and reliable data is available.The trusts which have seen the largest drops in the number of deaths are University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust in the Midlands, and London\u0027s Barts Health NHS Trust and the Royal Free London Nhs Foundation Trust.Find out how many NHS deaths there have been in your local Trust by searching the table belowThese trusts have seen the number of deaths in the weeks commencing 8 April and 8 May fall by 156, 126 and 97 respectively. University Hospitals Birmingham, a Trust at the forefront of the battle against the coronavirus outbreak in the West Midlands, saw 180 deaths between 8 and 14 April, compared to just 24 between 8 and 14 May.While a handful of England\u0027s NHS trusts have seen more deaths between 8-14 May compared to 8-14 April, none have seen deaths increase by double figures.The trust which has seen the largest increase in coronavirus deaths between the 8-14 April and 8-14 May periods is Doncaster And Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, with deaths increasing from 22 to 28.The Government Office for Science has announced that the latest \u0027R\u0027 number range for the UK is now 0.7 to 1.0, up from 0.5 to 0.9 last weekend. The reproduction \u0027R\u0027 number is the average that shows many people one person with coronavirus will pass it on to.A government source said the epidemic had now largely moved into care homes and hospitals, and that the number of infections in the community was very, very little.Analysis by Public Health England (PHE) and Cambridge University calculated on May 11 that the \u0027R\u0027 reproduction rate had fallen to 0.4 in London, with the number of new cases halving every 3.5 days.On March 23 – at the peak of contagion when lockdown was announced – 213,000 people a day caught the virus in London, according to the research.That fell dramatically as soon as the restrictions were brought in, tumbling below 10,000 by April 7. Despite significant progress made to reduce the spread of the virus in London, Mr Dowden said on Wednesday London\u0027s schools and non-essential retail stores would for now remain on the same timetable as the rest of the country. The Prime Minister set out the path we will go down in terms of easing the lockdown. He set out this three-stage process, he said.The next stage we\u0027ve said is from the beginning of June around for example opening up non-essential retail. Lockdown measures are expected to be eased further at the beginning of June, when some primary school children will be allowed to return to classrooms.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"chinas new normal lockdowns lifted amid second wave beijing","story":"Handfuls of people milled around one recent morning at a popular art district in Beijing, where galleries are among the first in the world to begin re-opening as coronavirus restrictions subside.Visitors trickling in are greeted with a facial recognition robot scanning their temperatures and a security guard asking for personal details to be registered on a mobile app to assist with contact tracing. “These are excellent artworks,” said Cheng Liukai, 20, a university student, gesturing at one video installation. “I’m not afraid of getting virus at all anymore.”Authorities engineering a return to a more recognisable pace of life are taking no chances, immediately re-instituting lockdowns whenever new cases are found. A handful of infections are still being reported daily, often appearing in clusters along borders to the north, by Russia and North Korea, and the south, lining south-east Asia.Entire cities have been sealed again, with citizens forced to quarantine for as many as 35 days and to undergo nucleic acid tests.In Shanghai, 20 people were forced to quarantine after one infection was detected on Monday – the first in two months.Travellers coming through certain affected areas, like Wuhan, are still required to quarantine upon arrival, reporting temperatures multiple times a day and having sensors or cameras installed at their doors to ensure compliance.Delegates attending China’s annual parliament meetings starting today – postponed from early March – have shortened them from the usual two weeks to one, and asked people to quarantine and be tested in advance.To enter public areas like outdoor parks, shopping malls, banks and bars means submitting to frequent temperature checks as pictured below, displaying a “green” health code – a contagion risk profile – and registering personal details, such as name, mobile and ID numbers.Many restaurants have begun letting larger groups dine together, relaxing previous rules of one person per table.

Some media organisations were quick to criticise the lack of face masks, but the first visitor hospitalisation appears to have involved a woman being charged by a bison. One of Yellowstone\u0026#39s more imposing residentsA rather innovativecreepy solution to social distancing has been adopted by a handful of bars in Vienna. Kleinod Prunkstück, a swanky cocktail joint in the Austrian capital, has placed 30 mannequins at tables that would otherwise go unused to help real-life customers maintain their distance, and add a little atmosphere. The set-up helps other local businesses too – the mannequins are made in Upper Austria by Linz workshop Atelier Mirow, and are dressed in smart clothes from Vienna’s boutique fashion shop Philipp Maly. Several other bars and cafés in the city, including the famous Cafe Central coffeehouse, are also using strategically placed mannequins as part of their reopening plans.What\u0026#39s your poison?European Union regulators have called on passengers to wear face masks, observe physical distancing and regularly wash their hands in new guidelines for safe post-lockdown air travel.The European Union Aviation Safety Agency and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control issued a joint document outlining the recommended measures.Ryanair\u0027s boss Michael O\u0027Leary praised the proposals, adding: 14-day quarantines are ineffective and unimplementable. Requiring international arrivals to quarantine only after they have used multiple public transport providers to get from the airport to their ultimate destination has no basis in science or medicine. We strongly urge Europe\u0027s Governments, especially those in Ireland and the UK, to mandate to the wearing of face masks for airline, train and (London) underground passengers, as this is the best and most effective way to limit the spread of Covid-19 in public transport environments where social distancing is not possible.Reports (since played down) that the UK is trying to build air bridges with other European countries appear to have contributed to a spike in traffic to flight search website Skyscanner. It says:Ben Cooke, an Isle of Wight hotelier, has urged local authorities to stop demanding that visitors stay away:I speak for not just myself but my fellow business owners when I say we are looking forward to welcoming back visitors. Hospitality is ingrained in our community, and we are excited for the prospect of visitors coming back to enjoy all that the Isle of Wright has to offer, including great independent inns, pubs and restaurants that support local fishermen, farmers and suppliers.Read the full story.The legendary Venice Simplon-Orient-Express will be returning to the tracks on July 8. The opening journey will be between Venice and London, with further dates and routings to follow shortly afterwards.Making the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express safe in the age of coronavirus represents a serious challenge. While beautifully decorated in the Art Deco style of the train’s 1930s heyday, compartments are, to put it mildly, cosy. In recent years lavish grand suites have been added to the mix, but – in keeping with the original – most of the compartments on the train do not have ensuite facilities and in the past, a rather endearing feature of journeys has been the nocturnal wanderings along narrow corridors to the shared facilities frequently brushing past fellow passengers on the way.Much of that is being rethought. Adrian Bridge has the details. A suite on the luxurious trainThe world\u0027s biggest passenger plane, the A380, was already falling from favour before the lockdown. Now it seems few will fly again. Air France, doubtful about post-lockdown demand for travel, now plans to put all of its A380s (nine in total) out to pasture. It follows Lufthansa retiring six of its 14 superjumbos last month, while Emirates, the largest operator of the aircraft, could ditch as much as half of its 100-strong fleet.Food and wine offer two very good reasons to visit Italy, but strict post-lockdown rules mean many of its most iconic restaurants are facing an existential threat.Venice\u0027s famed Harry\u0027s Bar, for example, the birthplace of the Bellini cocktail, has closed until further notice. We can\u0027t think about opening with just five or six people allowed inside at a time, owner Arrigo Cipriani told AP. Milan\u0027s fine-dining Manna restaurant will also remain closed for the foreseeable future, despite the easing of lockdown, while seven out of 10 restaurants on Rome\u0027s picturesque Piazza Navona were still shuttered on Wednesday. Sun-soaked, uncrowded, famously friendly and relatively corona-free, Greece sounds like the perfect destination for a post-lockdown holiday. But will it be welcoming Britons this summer? There are positive signs, with hotels given the green light to reopen from June 15 and direct international flights to tourist islands returning from July 1.  Speaking on Wednesday, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said visitors would not be required to self-isolate but would be subject to coronavirus testing. The Foreign Office still advises against all but essential overseas travel, however, while the UK government\u0027s quarantine plans could make holidays impossible for the majority of Britons. Some fascinating quotes from a Government source have poured a large quantity of cold water over Grant Shapps\u0027s \u0027air bridges\u0027 scheme, and suggested the UK\u0027s proposed quarantine on overseas arrivals could be around for a while. It all sounds like very bad news for holidaymakers and tour operators. They suggested Dominic Cummings, the Prime Minister\u0027s senior adviser, is a driving force behind the quarantine plan. Quarantine will mean all international travellers, including returning holidaymakers but excluding those from the Common Travel Area, will have to supply their contact and accommodation information and self-isolate for 14 days. Here\u0027s what we learnt on Wednesday: You might be able to visit Spain this summer, but probably an island, not a cityYou might also have to wear a face mask on the beachTravel restrictions are being lifted in Australia, Italy, India, Vietnam and beyondTravel bubbles, air bridges and sea bridges all (sort of) mean the same thing.

She explains: “It’s the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme to protect the Time Stone.”Why is it hard to take pop stars seriously as actors?What the pandemic reveals about the value of Tom Stoppard’s artBut, Hulk persuades the Ancient One to give him the Infinity Stone by telling her that Doctor Strange gave it away.The Ancient One concludes that Doctor Strange must have given it away for a good reason because “Strange is meant to be the best of us”, so she gives the stone over to Hulk. Here lies the inconsistency. In 2016’s Doctor Strange, the Ancient One refused to train Strange when he visited Kamar-Taj. If she knew the prophecy about the stone in 2012, why would she refuse to teach him?“Stubbornness. Arrogance. Ambition. I’ve seen it all before... I cannot lead another gifted student to power, only to lose him to the darkness,” the Ancient One tells Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor).Why, then, would the Ancient One would be so convinced of Strange’s ability four years earlier? Entrusting the Time Stone to a stranger, purely based on the news that it was his desire, seems like quite a big stretch.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And what does it mean for the government and for ordinary people?The UK government auctioned a tranche of debt to the financial markets on Wednesday which, for the first time in history, had a negative yield.That means that if the investors were to hold the debt until it matured they would get less back than they paid for it.Government borrowing this year heading to £300bn, says OBRSharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut why would investors pay the government for the privilege of lending it money?And why is it happening now?What does it mean for the public finances?And how could it affect the livelihoods of ordinary people?The Debt Management Office, a public body that sells state debt on behalf of the Government, auctioned a parcel of state debt worth £3.75bn to financial investors, a group that generally includes banks, insurance companies, pension managers and hedge funds.The parcel of debt – known as a Gilt-edged security or “Gilt” – is due to mature in July 2023, which is the date that the holders of the Gilt would be repaid their money by the government.The yield on the Gilt is the effective annual interest rate that the investors receive and is determined by the price investors pay to buy the security.The yield on this Gilt, as set by a competitive auction, was -0.003 per cent.Gilt yields have been very low for many years, but this is the first time that the yield on a Gilt has been negative. And the implication is that the investors would ultimately lose money on their investment.Why on earth would investors buy these bonds if it guarantees they will lose money?First it’s important to note that negative yielding government debt has been a feature of several other governments’ bond markets in recent years.Japan and Germany have issued debt at negative yields for some time.Indeed the total value of negative yielding debt around the world at the end of last year was $11 trillion, having peaked at $17 trillion. That’s around a sixth of the total global bond market.Negative yields remain something of a puzzle, but the most common explanation from analysts is that investors, in an era of considerable uncertainty and volatility in markets, are prepared to pay a big premium for the confidence that they will get most of their money back, even if it means a slight loss.Regulation may play a part too, with pension funds, banks and insurance companies effectively compelled since the global financial crisis by regulators to hold more liquid (easily sellable) assets like government bonds as a share of their total assets.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIt may also be that some investors are speculating that Government bond prices are going to go up even more in future and that they will still be able to sell their own holdings at a profit in future, even if they have a negative yield when they buy them.So why have UK yields only gone negative now?The most likely explanation is that it’s because the Bank of England has signalled in recent days that it is considering taking its main interest rate negative for the first time.Central bank interest rates tend to have a big influence on bond yields.Why has the interest rate on UK debt fallen to record lows?Those countries that have seen negative yields already have negative interest rates from their own central banks.The Bank is also expected to announce more Gilt purchases soon as part of its response to the Covid-19 recession, which may be bolstering the confidence of some speculators that they will be able to sell their negative yielding Gilts to the central bank at a profit.“The impact of the Bank of England’s rate cuts and increased asset purchases is absolutely clear from this morning’s groundbreaking gilt auction,” said Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.What does this mean for the Government?In the immediate term it signals strong market demand for Government debt, which is comforting at a time when it is expecting to issue more than £300bn of Gilts in order to pay for its emergency coronavirus spending.Low or negative yields also mean that the Government does not need to worry much about the annual costs of servicing that borrowing.What does it all mean for ordinary people?A government with stable market financing is good news for people receiving state assistance in this crisis because it diminishes the risk these programmes would have to be ended suddenly because the government could not borrow.However, the fact that bond yields are so low probably reflects pessimism from investors about the economy’s medium and long-term economic prospects.If investors thought the economy was going to grow strongly in the years and decades ahead they would be expecting higher inflation in the years ahead and would probably be charging the government more to borrow in the form of higher yields.If investors are right about the bleak overall economic outlook that’s bad news for ordinary workers and households.And low bond yields means the return on many pension saving pots will be lower, meaning people might have to work longer to achieve a financially comfortable retirement.

One of the links was the Kremlin-directed Internet Research Agency (IRA) which, between 2015 and 2017, flooded social media with “false reports, conspiracy theories, and trolls.”“One big area that we were behind on in 2016 but I think now are quite advanced at is identifying and fighting these co-ordinated information campaigns that come from different state actors around the world,” Zuckerberg said. “I feel pretty confident that we are going to be able to protect the integrity of the upcoming election.” Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince 2016, the company has made numerous decisions in order to try and quell the influence of bad actors on its platforms – which also include Instagram and WhatsApp. This has included creating an archive for political adverts with information about ad impressions and spend, as well as demographic data such as age, gender and location. There is also now a verification process in place for advertisers, while “millions” of fake and suspicious accounts have been banned.Trump threatens Twitter and Facebook over ‘illegal situation’In 2019, the company said it would take action against content that “does not directly violate our Community Standards, but still undermines the authenticity of the platform” by reducing its distribution in the main News Feed and adding in contextual information next to the post so people can better access details about the publisher. These actions continued into 2020 ahead of the upcoming US election. However, while the question of whether the company is prepared for the upcoming election remains to be seen, evidence suggests that some problems still remain. During the UK election in 2019, the company refused to remove doctored videos by the Conservatives, which criticised the now-leader of the Labour Party and then-Brexit spokesperson Kier Starmer.  Rebecca Stimson, Facebook’s UK head of public policy, said at the time that “we don’t believe a private company like Facebook should censor politicians. This is why we don’t send content or ads from politicians and political parties to our third-party fact checking partners”.Even when the company said it would partner with fact-checkers, it still said it would not remove misinformation – a particularly troubling aspect when a study found that 88 per cent of all Conservative adverts were found to be misleading compared to seven per cent of Labour’s adverts.When Conservative Party adverts were removed, where clips from BBC news reports were used out of context, it was done on the grounds that it violated intellectual property rather than because the government was proactively spreading disinformation. Writing in 2019 Facebook’s ex-head of global elections integrity ops Yaël Eisenstat made scathing criticisms of the social media giant, stating that “the real problem is that Facebook profits partly by amplifying lies and selling dangerous targeting tools that allow political operatives to engage in a new level of information warfare.”Facebook wants to build a ‘hateful meme’ AI to clean up its platformTech platforms rush to remove viral, false ‘Plandemic’ videoFacebook announces oversight board to decide free speech controversiesShe added: “It’s clear that the company won’t make the necessary fixes without being forced to, either by advertisers who refuse to spend money on their platforms until Facebook cleans up the spread of misinformation and other harmful content employees who continue to demand accountability and responsibility from their leaders and most immediately, government action.”An ex-employee of Cambridge Analytica – the firm which scraped user data in breach of Facebook’s terms and conditions to tilt the election in the Republican’s favour – said that Facebook has not learned its lessons since the 2016 election.“Of the billions of dollars that are being spent on the American elections, most of the political advertising money will flow to Facebook and – based on what I saw at Cambridge Analytica – none of it, as far as I am aware, will be fact-checked. No content will be blocked or removed, even if it’s found to be demonstrably false” Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Brittany Kaiser wrote.“Fake news ads from the Trump campaign about his political rival Joe Biden were blocked by CNN, but have been hosted on Facebook for months racking up millions of views by impressionable voters.”Facebook\u0027s work since the last US elections has attempted to walk the fine line between freedom of speech and ensuring its platform is free from misinformation and disinformation, but it remains unclear whether or not it has been enough to protect democracy.

I’ve been speaking to colleagues in Scotland, Wales and across the country, and I’ll continue to try and lobby the government on this one.“We’ve been successful on other issues. I’m hoping to be successful here, but I leave the option available, which is to make it mandatory in London only. But I’m hoping we can persuade the government to do the right thing.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Mr Khan said he wants to work with the government “to reach a sensible compromise”, as he noted that some train services in London are not under his control, but said that next week he would consider using his powers as mayor to make face masks compulsory.Scientists, including those in the government’s advisory group, Sage, are ided over the efficacy of face masks and coverings in protecting against coronavirus, which significantly reduce the spread of “droplets” of infection.However, others remain concerned that incorrect usage of masks could negate these benefits.The government itself has given contradictory statements on their usefulness, finally recommending their usage in enclosed public spaces on 11 May, the day after Boris Johnson urged people to return to work.The prime minister had previously said they would be “useful” once lockdown was eased to ”give people confidence they can go back to work”, two days after health secretary Matt Hancock denounced the Scottish government’s advice to wear masks as being based on “weak science”.NHS bosses have warned that supplies must be prioritised for health care workers, with NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson cautioning in April that there must be “clear evidence” to justify their widespread usage.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The rocket can reach a height of approximately 100km, and carry a payload of up to 60kg.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“It is very hard to oversell what we have achieved here with this test the whole team has pulled through again to deliver another UK first, said Dr Jack-James Marlow, who led the operations of Skylark L’s static fire testing.We have successfully static tested a fully integrated, sub-orbital Skylark L launch vehicle in flight configuration. This means we performed all actions of a launch but did not release the vehicle. The rocket engine successfully burned, with all vehicle systems showing nominal operation.”Trump says ‘space is the future’ at unveiling of Space Force flagAstronomers find ‘regular rhythms’ coming from distant starsSpace debris from failed rocket misses New York City by minutesSkyrora’s chief executive officer, Volodymyr Levykin said: “As the launch aspect of the UK’s new space industry starts to emerge, there will be many events that have never happened here previously and this is one of them. This was a mammoth effort in very trying circumstances, so it is quite an achievement to be proud of.”The company claims this is the first static fire test of its magnitude since the Black Arrow Programme, a three-stage British satellite carrier rocket that was used for four launches between 1969 and 1971.In September 1970, the Black Arrow attempted to carry a British satellite, Orba, into space, but failed to reach orbit. The next year, however, it did carry the Prospero satellite into space, which made the United Kingdom the sixth nation to place a satellite into orbit via a carrier rocket.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some countries’ emissions dropped by as much as 26 per cent on average during the peak of the confinement.Visualising the biggest carbon crash ever recordedIf pre-pandemic conditions return by mid-June, then 2020 emissions could decline by a more modest 4 per cent compared to 2019, though this would still be the largest single annual decrease in absolute emissions since the end of World War II.A UN report last year said emissions needed to drop by 2.7 per cent a year keep warming well below 2 degrees Celsius, and 7.6 per cent a year to keep below 1.5C.“Population confinement has led to drastic changes in energy use and CO2 emissions,” said lead author Corinne Le Quéré at the University of East Anglia.“These extreme decreases are likely to be temporary, however, as they do not reflect structural changes in the economic, transport, or energy systems,” she added.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailPrevious analysis of data from Carbon Brief and the International Energy Agency revealed the unprecedented scale of the emissions decline.China saw the largest drop in emissions in April, followed by the United States, Europe and India.In the countries with the strictest lockdown restrictions, emissions from aviation plunged 75 per cent in early April, while emissions from land transport fell by 50 per cent and from power generation by 15 per cent.Emissions from industry declined by around 35 per cent, with a lack of data causing some uncertainty. Emissions from residential buildings, however, increased by 5 per cent, the study said.“The emissions reductions occurring because of Covid-19 will clearly be unprecedented. What is less certain is how the economy will rebound in late 2020 and 2021,” said Glen Peters at the CICERO Center for International Climate Research in Norway, which took part in the study.“As different countries and sectors recover, it is unclear if activity levels will return to normal levels or if we may see permanent shifts in behaviour,” he added.The environmental impact of coronavirus containment measures has also led to a huge reduction in air pollution in the form of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions, which are released by cars, aeroplanes and other combustion engines.Satellite images captured by the European Space Agency showed a dramatic decrease in NO2 emissions in 2020 compared to 2019.Additional reporting by agencies.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The scheme is slower, and the deadline is approaching.How benefit denials could force EU citizens to work through pandemicHome Office won\u0027t know how many EU citizens undocumented post-BrexitHundreds of EU nationals told they don’t have right to stay in the UKOutrage at Home Office after at-risk EU nationals left without helpIt’s impossible to maintain now that closures of phone advice lines, local scanning centres, and inability to send in documents had no impact.”John Vassiliou, partner at McGill and Co solicitors, told The Independent he had noticed significant delays in straightforward non-complex EU settled status applications, citing one case where a child client who had been waiting for a decision since January, despite all his family having been granted by March.It\u0027s left the family stressed and concerned about the child\u0027s application. I contacted the Home Office to ask about the delay and was simply told that the \u0027case is currently under consideration\u0027. This has not provided any explanation for the delay and is far from reassuring, he said.There is also concern among the 57 charities that have been awarded funding by the Home Office to support vulnerable EU nationals apply to the scheme, who say providing this help is considerably more challenging when they cannot meet applicants in person.Home Office support services for EU settlement applicants have been reduced during the pandemic due to the lockdown, and people have been unable to submit identity evidence by post, but the department said these services were reopening next week.Responding to the latest figures, Minister for Future Borders and Immigration Kevin Foster said: “EU citizens continue to make huge contributions to our country with many European doctors and nurses playing a key role on the front line in the fight against Coronavirus.“I am pleased we’ve already had more than 3.5 million applications to the EU Settlement Scheme, with over a year left until the deadline.

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Cars mounting pavements to get by whilst pedestrians try to cross the road. All the offences have been recorded and will be processed in due course.”Meanwhile images from popular beaches including Southend, Bournemouth and Brighton showed crowds embracing the sunshine – with some questioning on social media how efficiently people could socially distance.Current government regulations allow for people to meet up with someone outside their household as long as they remain 2m apart to limit the potential risk of coronavirus – with no limit on the amount of time the public can spend out in public areas such as parks.The introduction of the measures, and particularly an easing of the rule which stopped people driving to far away spots, have raised concerns that coastal communities and those who live near beauty spots could see their regions overwhelmed by day-trippers.In the Lake District locals have erected signs warning the public away, while the park’s chief executive has urged people to ‘consider and respect the local communities’ by staying clear of the region.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A single phase may  more than one review period. Some measures may be lifted earlier than planned, some later.The SNP leader said lockdown had been necessary to mitigate the massive harm caused by the Covid-19 virus but it was creating its own harms, such as loneliness, isolation, deepening inequalities and economic damage.She said: There is no completely risk free way of lifting lockdown but we must mitigate the risks as much as we can and we must not at any stage act rashly or recklessly.For all our progress, this virus has not gone away. It continues to pose a significant threat to health and if we move too quickly or without proper care, it could run out of control again very quickly.Social distancing and hand hygiene remain key planks of the Scottish government\u0027s advice, and people are urged to wear face coverings in enclosed spaces, such as when using public transport.The announcement of Scotland\u0027s phased approach to lifting lockdown comes more than a week after Boris Johnson announced separate plans to ease restrictions south of the border.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In 2017-18, £55bn of taxable capital gains were recorded – more than double the amount recorded just five years earlierThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Domino Park, a six-acre park located off the East River in Williamsburg, has been covered with white circles meant to encourage social distancing in the era of Covid-19. A video shared online showed residents lounging in the circles, which are about six feet in diameter and spaced away from other circles to remind residents to not interact with others. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSeven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“They’ve made little round human parking spots in Domino Park in Brooklyn,” wrote Jennifer 8. Lee in the caption to her video. Three months ago the idea of positioning oneself in a painted circle to lounge outside would be a bizarre concept. But now most residents have embraced the park’s guidelines and followed social distancing measures by only sitting in the circles when on the turf.“If you were to take video footage from the world today and show it to someone from 2019, they would think it was from some near-future Hollywood dystopian television show instead of real life,” Ms Lee said. Pictures taken on Monday also showed a majority of residents using the circles and wearing masks when at Domino Park. The public park is owned by a private company and not operated by New York City. Mayor Bill de Blasio and other government officials have collaborated with the NYPD to encourage residents to practice coronavirus protective measures when outdoors, such as passing out masks at parks. Signs also popped up at a number of parks and locations around the city to remind people to stay apart from others when out. Last week the mayor said there would be limits to capacity of parks like Domino Park, Sheep Meadow in Central Park, and piers 45 and 46 in Manhattan’s Hudson River Park over the weekend. But it was not clear if or how these capacity limits were enforced. No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Indonesian government has done little to stop the trade of wildlife in the country\u0027s markets.Earlier this month, a coalition of animal rights groups wrote to Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo warning him of the risks posed by the trade of wildlife, as well as dog and cat meat, in the country’s live animal markets.The Dog Meat Free Indonesia coalition wrote: “Despite the worsening situation of the pandemic globally and throughout Indonesia, with all 34 provinces now affected and over 13,000 coronavirus infections and nearly 1,000 deaths nationwide, the sale of wild animals including bats, rats and reptiles alongside dogs and cats and other domesticated animals in markets throughout the country continues unchallenged.“This is in defiance to ever-growing calls from governments, inter-governmental human and animal health experts and key stakeholders from around the world for the immediate closure of live animal markets globally.“It is impossible to ensure that meat sold at these markets is safe for human consumption, and given the unhygienic conditions, it is only a matter of time before the next deadly zoonotic disease emerges.”The Animals Asia Foundation was one of the charities in the coalition who signed the letter. The founder, Dr Jill Robinson MBE, expressed her “100 per cent” support for The Independent’s campaign to ban the wildlife trade.Founder of leading animal charity backs The Independent\u0027s campaignDr Robinson told The Independent that live animal markets are “dirty, dangerous places” that cannot be properly regulated, least of all in countries where “no animal welfare regulations exist, or are poorly enforced if they do”.The trade of wildlife was thrown into the spotlight as the coronavirus is believed to have emerged from a seafood market in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. 27 of the first 41 people who became infected with Covid-19 had been exposed to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, according to a study published in medical journal, The Lancet.Researchers believe the Covid-19 jumped from an animal to a human in a “zoonotic spillover” event.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The local administration in the Chinese city said on Wednesday that along with the consumption ban, Wuhan would become a “wildlife sanctuary” where virtually all hunting of wild animals was banned with the exception of measures for ”scientific research, population regulation, monitoring of epidemic diseases and other special circumstances”. As part of the ban, the city introduced stringent controls on the breeding of all wild animals, prohibiting any to be reared for food, CBS reported. Wuhan will also join a wider scheme across the country to offer buyouts to farmers who breed wild animals.​Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFounder of leading animal charity backs The Independent’s campaignWoman jailed for illegal trade in wildlife has sentence doubledArmy of volunteers ‘could be used to fight off invasive species’Coronavirus fears as China plans to entrench mink and fox fur industryWuhan, a city of 11m people in the Hubei province of China, saw the first cases of Covid-19 late last year. The origins of the pandemic are still being investigated but one of the suspected sources is the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the city which included a live animal section reportedly selling more than 30 species of animals including live wolf pups, golden cicadas, scorpions and civets. China closed the market in January.On the whole, researchers agree that the most plausible explanation is that the virus made the jump from an animal to human in a “zoonotic spillover” event.China has been under pressure from the global community to tackle its illegal wildlife trade after it was linked to the emergence of zoonotic diseases. Coronavirus: China’s farmers offered buy-out to end wildlife breedingThe global death toll is now 318,789 people from the coronavirus, the World Health Organisation reported today. More than 4.7m people have been infected worldwide. Last week, two central provinces in China announced plans for a government buy-out for wildlife farmers to help transition those whose livelihoods depend on breeding wild species for consumption away from the practice.The plans would give wildlife farmers in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, two neighbouring regions, the opportunity to be compensated for switching to grow fruit, vegetables, tea plants, or herbs for traditional Chinese medicine. There is also an option to breed other animals such as pigs and chickens.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Each wild goose or Chinese muntjac deer will be worth 2,457 yuan ($345) each.In February, China issued an unprecedented temporary nationwide ban on all terrestrial wild animal commerce and consumption, including exotic species raised on farms. The initial buy-out covers 14 species of farmed wildlife and only farms operating legally with breeding permits before the February ban are eligible for the programme.At present, the Wuhan ban lasts for five years. Similar bans are in place in the cities of Beijing, Shenzhen and Zhuhai but they have been made permanent.Dr Peter Li, Humane Society International’s China policy specialist, said: “Wuhan’s ban on wildlife consumption is extremely welcome as a clear recognition that the public health risk of zoonotic disease spread via the wildlife trade must be taken very seriously if we are to avoid another pandemic.There will however be no less severe of a disease risk from wildlife consumption in five years’ time, so anything short of a permanent and comprehensive ban is still a risk too far. Wuhan becomes the fourth city in mainland China to show such leadership, but we now need cities and countries across the world to step up to the plate and shut down the dangerous wildlife trade.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

and you can even tape down some wire to stfen the mask,you have any.Finish by punching holes in each end and threading elastic through to fit around your ears.If you dont have elastic bands you could also use a hair tie.Another method involves using a T-shirt without the need for any sewing or stitching.A YouTube tutorial by Runa Ray explains that for the T-shirt method, you need to cut out a in by in rectangle from the material.Then fold it in half and measure in on either side before making an equal number of cuts along the edges with scissors.Then turn the fabric inside out and knot each of the tails, but leave the four outer edges.Cut two more strips of material and tie them to the ends - these are the straps that will go around your ears.Some people have also used a vacuum cleaner bag to create a face mask, which is a bit more complicated - and only worksyou have a spare, clean bag to hand.Here we take a look at some of the dferent types of face mask and how well they work...N respiratorsN masks are disposable face masks that are proven to filter the air to an industrial standard.Manufacturers y, but the N is a stamp from the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to show that it is efficient.The N stands for Not resistant to oil because the mask only protects against particles, not fluids, while the  means it filters out  per cent of airborne particles.They generally have an eight-hour shelf le before becoming clogged depending on the work youre doing.As they offer so much protection, they are used by doctors and nurses in a medical setting.However, they have not been recommended for use to the general public yet due to supply issues for health workers.Surgical masksThese disposable three-ply masks are fluid-resistant and theyre the most common type of facial protection youll see health care staff wearing.They are used to prevent infected droplets from doctors, nurses and carers entering the respiratory system of the patient.Although they dont have built-in air filters, they are considered effective enough for most staff outside of intensive care.The nose clip can be bent to fit snugly around the nose, however they are a loose fit and the material gapes at the sides so they dont protect against all particles.When they become wet, theyre effectiveness is also reduced.Also, they are disposable and are only intended to be worn once.DIY dust masks Found in most hardware stores, dust masks can offer some level of protection from particles -worn correctly.If it says FFP then it’s a basic kind of dust mask and offers the lowest level of filtration for this kind of respirators mask.To meet European standards, they have to be able to filter at least  per cent of particles - with FFP filtering  per cent.That means that it can’t filter out tiny particles associated with viruses and bacteria.You can also get a FFP mask, which looks similar but has a small filter in the middle to catch almost all airborne particles.Short of being a full gas mask it offers the best protection - as long as it fits properly - and is more effective than N as well as the FFP and FFP.Cycling masksThese are generally worn by cyclists to prevent them from breathing in pollution in heavy traffic.Usually made from neoprene, they fit tightly to the face and are intended to offer a level of protection from airborne particles.Some are also marketed as N, or N grade, which means the amount of filtered airbone particles is either  or  per cent.Homemade masksAs many people cant get their hands on a mask, some have turned to fashioning their own.Theres been tips on using vacuum cleaner bags and even sanitary towels to cover your face.While most wont be as effective as anything you can buy in a store, they will offer more protection than not covering your face at all.Research by Public Health England in  looked at the suitability of household materials that could be used as masks to filter bacterial and viral aerosols and found vacuum bags actually worked well.Experts say that you should aim for multiple layers - a double layer of tightly-woven cotton with a thread count of at least  was one of the best barriers, according to researchers in the US.Even a bandana, scarf or T-shirt can be used to cover your nose and mouth while in public. Experts have previously said in order for the use of face coverings to be effective, nine in  people need to wear them.The Government document states face coverings should not be used by children under the age of two, people with respiratory conditions as well as those who could find it hard to wear them correctly such as primary school age children.Experts are still pretty ided on their effectiveness outside of a medical setting.Wearing a mask can act as a physical barrier to prevent infecting othersyou are sick by blocking the droplets that come out when you cough or sneeze.But some experts argue that people can accidentally infect themselves when taking a mask off or they can lead to complacency with other measures such as hand-washing.New evidence from Hong Kong about face masks has been shared confidentially with the World Health Organisation.The data hasnt been made public yet but it reportedly suggests that the protective gear was effective in slowing the spread in Asian countries.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.”SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.Professor Susan Michie, of University College London, said there is not good evidence to suggest wearing masks will cut transmissions.She said: They do not protect against the virus getting into the eyes - only close fitting goggles do this.People may not fit the masks properly or take them on and off. Touching face masks and not taking them off in the correct way may mean people contaminate their hands and spread the virus.People may have a  sense of reassurance and thus pay less attention to other behaviours key to reducing transmission such as social distancing and hand-washing.Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, reviewed  studies which looked at the efficacy of face masks in preventing respiratory illness.He said the research was poor, adding that it was as easy to make an argument for opposing the widespread use of masks as it would be to make an argument promoting their use.Most experts are in agreement that for masks to work as they are intended, they must be used correctly.Dr Jenna Macciochi, a lecturer in immunology at the University of Sussex, told the Mail: To be effective, a mask has to be fitted correctly, worn correctly and disposed of correctly — which is not something the general public has been trained in.She added that not wearing one correctly is potentially more hazardous than not using one at all, as you may infect yourself with the particles the mask is protecting you against when you take it off.The WHO says surgical masks can only help when used with other preventative measures such as frequent hand-washing.Many other countries are asking its citizens to wear a mask, such as France and the US.Although people in the UK are not being advised to wear masks, they are now being advised to wear face coverings on public transport or in shops.Scotland has recommended people use face coverings , for example fabric such as a scarf, to cover their nose and mouth.Northern Ireland has issued the same advice on face coverings.There are worries inside the NHS thatthe UK government change the policy and advise all Brits wear a mask it could mean there wouldnt be enough for health workers.The UK government has said asking people to wear face coverings isnt the same as asking people to wear face masks.Speaking on May , the UK governments chief scientic adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said wearing face masks had a marginal but positive impact on the spread of infection.Where masks may have a role is where distancing isnt possible, where there might be undue crowding, he added.But Sir Patrick says wearing a mask should not replace social distancing and hand washing - which are both vital. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He has stuck to his promise and shown up every day, despite having to have surgery on his wrist and being in evident pain at times.Not only that, but he is donating the revenue from advertising on the show to the NHS. He embodies the perfect combination of qualities required to be a good business person: Do all you can, give something back and be ethical.In the past six weeks he has made more than £.million as new fans snapped up his -Day Plan well-being programme from his Body Coach site.But I really don’t think this was about making more money or becoming more famous.Bear in mind that Joe, who is only , has already made millions following the success of his cookbook and his online fitness classes.He really didn’t need to make more money or be more famous.I honestly believe he just wants children everywhere to experience the joy of fitness.There is a lot to like about Joe. But one thing I love about him is that one of his first le goals was to buy his mum, Raquela, a house. Having grown up on a council estate in Surrey, with Raquela and brothers Nikki and George, Joe always dreamed of being able to spend his earnings on his mum after she supported him in the earliest days of his career.“My mum’s always lived in a council house. We’ve never had mortgages. It wasn’t on the radar for us.“So when I could take that money I earned from that book and say ‘Mum, I’m buying your house. It’s yours’, that was an amazing moment for me.”Joe didn’t have an easy childhood. He has spoken about his father Gary still struggling with heroin addiction. But rather than repeating history, he actively decided to take a dferent path.He found exercise as a coping method. “I used exercise probably as a way to manage my feelings,” he has said.He said: “Because of my dad’s addiction, and the damage I saw it cause, me and Nikki steered clear of it. We weren’t smoking weed. We were training, exercising and playing sport. Along the line, I decided that wasn’t going to be my destiny.”Things in le either crush you or make you the person you were always meant to be. The strength of character it takes to turn your back on the path chosen by your first and most important role model — your dad — is immense.It would be so easy for him to have chosen the same path as his father or use his father’s addiction as an excuse for not making the most of his le.Joe has said he tries not to dwell on his past nor judge his dad. All that matters to him now is being happy and looking forward.The moral of this story is: Put the graft in, keep pushing yourself and never give up.But one of the many likeable things about Joe is how readily he credits Raquela for her role in his success, saying she taught them “right and wrong”, while his dad was “in and out of rehab”.She must be a hell of a woman to have brought up three boys so well. Joe and Nikki work together now, which is testament to the strength of their family ties.Knowing all this about Joe makes it all the more amazing he found his happy ever after when he married his model we Rosie in , and the pair now have two adorable children — Indie who’s  months and four-month-old Marley.It would be easy to resent his success. But how could anyone wish Joe anything other than happiness, given what he has overcome and also his approach to le I’m as keen as the next person for the lockdown to end and for normal le to resume – at least as much as it possibly can.But when I read about the fliers advertising mass gatherings, promising picnics and live music in cities across the UK this weekend, I couldn’t believe my eyes.At least eight events were being organised by anti-vaxxing group UK Freedom Movement, which claims the lockdown is illegal.Its posters headlined “UK Mass Gathering” said: “We say no to the coronavirus bill, no to mandatory vaccines, no to the new normal and no to the unlawful lockdown.”It is also urged people to gather in a major park in the eight locations, including London, Sheffield and Edinburgh, to “bring a picnic, some music and let’s have some fun and say yes to le”.Yes, lockdown measures are extreme and yes, we all want them to relax and for normality to .But what the organisers of this are failing to realise is that you can’t protest or demonstrate against a virus.And while there is so much still left for us to understand about how this particular virus works, to attend a mass gathering in protest seems like a fool’s errand.This event is clearly organised by idiots, for idiots.If only we’d all been quick-witted enough to self-isolate with someone who knows how to do our hair, like Kate Moss, who has been hunkering down with A-lister stylist James Brown.That said, Kate is an absolute beauty and clearly a supermodel, whether she is having a good hair day or a bad one.As luck would have it I am currently living with my mum.She has done a grand job dyeing my roots so far, but I think a blow-dry may be beyond her remit.Luckily, with a pandemic going on, and staff to worry about, I have more important things to think about than my hair.Twitter has been among the first companies to announce that it will not be bringing employees back into the workplacethey would prefer to work from home.And for more and more people, home is likely to be the new workplace – with meetings taking place on screens.The past few weeks have shown us that as long as people have a laptop and wi-fi, many can work from home.For lots of us, being allowed to do so means we save loads of money on travel and hundreds of hours of commuting time, while massively reducing our carbon footprint.And we’ll never have to buy a stale sandwich again.Meanwhile, companies will save a fortune on rent.All in all, this new way of working, for those who can do it, makes sense.Over the past few weeks we have all become much more aware of people’s proximity to us.And yes, with streets that have fewer cars than ever before, no doubt some of us are stepping into the road to avoid another pedestrian who could come within two metres of us.But police have felt the need to issue warnings to pedestrians not to walk into the road to dodge fellow pedestrians because it is dangerous .Seriously, is such a warning really necessary I know we have all been in lockdown for a while but surely we haven’t taken leave of our common sense and will remember to look left and right when we cross the road . . . won’t we It’s now been eight weeks since our Thursday night Clap For Carers began. And looking at this photo of Boris Johnson outside No from Thursday, it’s a good reminder that things are changing all the time.When you compare it to the picture taken of him just days before he was admitted to hospital it really shows the big dference a few weeks make.He looks more or less back to his old self. Also, it’s really cheering to see new mum Carrie looking so well and so happy.We seem to be seeing lots of people in their swim-wear at the moment, with not a. pool in sight!Normally I try to give thanks for my strong and able body rather than worrying too much about what it looks like.But it’s hard not to feel a tad wistful looking at photos of Kimberley Garner, who looks so fit and gorgeous she’d no doubt be awarded swimwear body of the week,such an award existed. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It might feel strange at first, but we’ll get used to it.Militant unions telling teachers they should refuse to go back to work must also urgently rethink their stance.Reopening schools is obviously essentialwe are to prevent the poorest and most vulnerable children falling behind — new research reveals that better-off children are spending a whopping  per cent more time each day on education than those from poorer homes.But as parents can only go back to work once their kids are in class, it’s also the only way to kickstart the economy.Of course, there will always be an element of risk to getting society up and running again. Even before coronavirus, it would have been impossible for anyone to guarantee the safety of every worker every day.But the Government has stressed it’s “extremely unlikely” a school could be the source of a Covid- outbreak.And given the risks frontliners take every single day, that assurance should be good enough for teaching unions.WE welcome the news that the Government plans to push ahead with legislation to end free movement and replace it with a points-based immigration system before the end of this year.The new system is exactly what Brexit-voting Sun readers wanted: it will let us welcome the brightest and best — including doctors, nurses and carers — to the UK based on what they have to offer, not where they come from.And it’s logical to get it introduced quickly so businesses have time to prepare before the transition period ends.Let’s hope MPs have the sense to back the bill.WE can all sleep a little more soundly in our beds now the Government looks set to hit its target of recruiting , contact-tracers by the end of next week.It’s been obvious for a long time that widespread testing and tracing is the best way to contain the virus: all the countries that have fared best have been doing it from the start.But thanks to dodgy advice from Public Health England, Boris and his ministers gave up on it back in March.What a relief they’ve finally seen the light.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Especially my track, Alive.”The music didn’t disappoint, either, ranging all the way from the excellent Icelandic entry, Think Of Things, to knock-kneed techno from some Russian live-wires called Little Big.My personal highlight, though, was the nutty Latvian bird, Samanta Tina, who turned up for her promotional video wearing a PPE mask and squirting a bottle of disinfectant everywhere.If ever it got a bit too “Eurovision”, though, there was a special guest on hand to calm the mood down.Sweden’s Mans Zelmerlow sang Heroes in his back garden , Italy’s Diodato slowly murdered Volare in a CGI amphitheatre and Ireland’s Johnny Logan had either aged quite dramatically or had to be replaced, right at the last second, by Julian Assange on the poignant What’s Another Year.The one constant, though, was Norton, who handled Eurovision’s new socially-distanced, time-delayed, non-competitive format as brilliantly as he did the old one and was in no mood to spare feelings.“Samanta Tina. She’s tried to represent Latvia six times, Lithuania twice and now she’s got through it’s been cancelled. You’d think she’d take the hint, wouldn’t you.”“Serbia’s answer to The Pussycat Dolls, when the question is — name a group that isn’t as good as The Pussycat Dolls ”It was a joy to watch after seeing so many hosts and shows fail spectacularly with “the new normal” and my only real complaint was that there wasn’t enough of him or the event.I wanted a vote as well, of course. But by the time I was ready for Norton to annihilate the regional juries, it was all over.Lesson learned, though. If I ever take this event for granted or complain about the running time again, you have permission to shoot me down in righteous flames.Meantime, stay hellzy.The Real Marigold Hotel, Britt Ekland: “I look in the mirror — it’s OK.

And Aisling Bea.BACK in southern India, on BBC’s hugely enjoyable series The Real Marigold Hotel, Duncan Bannatyne has just bottled the eight-hour overnight train journey to Madurai.It could’ve been the heat, it could’ve been the food and a dodgy stomach.Or it could’ve been the fact Britt Ekland is all over him like a cheap sari, no matter how many times the multi-millionaire businessman mentions his “young we”.A woman who will not be denied, Britt needs male validation and constant reassurance.So, during one of the brief moments she wasn’t pestering Duncan to within an inch of his le, Britt visited a vedic astrologer, in downtown Puducherry, and hit him with this loaded question. “Am I going to have work ”Work  Are you ever, Britt. “The sun is in the constellation of Hasta,” apparently.So I’d expect work on your face, work on your eyelids, work on your rear end.

toll from Covid-, everyone unaffected knows they’re lucky to even be alive.So it’s not the “First-World problem” of having to cancel a holiday that’s the issue.It’s the potential loss of big money —

Contactless payment is thought to be a must ­and some may use new apps to order and pay.It is easier to space drinkers out in a beer garden and scientists say the virus spreads less outside, compared to within enclosed spaces.That means it will be a while before small, cosy pubs re-open their doors to customers.But big pubs where there is enough room inside to keep people apart could be next to get the nod — again with table service to avoid a build-up at bars.Perspex screens, like those seen in supermarkets, could be used to shield diners from other tables and walkways.Eventually, when ordering at a bar is allowed — perhaps in the autumn — screens might also be put up on the counters.Environment Secretary George Eustice told the Commons: We are already working with the hospitality and pub sector to identy what social distancing measures they might be able to put in place.“As the Prime Minister has outlined, we intend that the hospitality sector, including pubs, would be able to tentatively start gradually opening, hopefully during July — subject to the epidemiology supporting such a move.”He was referring to phase three of the lockdown easing plan, which includes pubs. The talks come as welcome news for lockdown Brits keen to catch up with friends and family over a pint away from home.Mr Eustice added: Of course we also recognise that until thingsto something closer to normal and they can open normally, hopefully later this summer, then it will not give them all of the trade they previously had.There were fears that pubs might not reopen until Christmas because of the dficulties with social distancing.Pub bosses on Monday called for the two-metrerule to be halved.In some cases it would allow so few customers it might not be economical to open.Simon Emeny, the chief executive of brewer Fuller’s, said the World Health Organisation advises one metre— which would allow four times as many customers. He said: “I think it’s really important that rules are relaxed by the time pubs reopen.”Jonathan Neame, chief executive of Shepherd Neame, said it would be “profoundly challenging” to keep people two metres apart ­and that could force most pubs to stay shut.”The British Beer and Pub Association’s chief executive Emma McClarkin warned that a long-term shutdown would have a devastating impact on an industry already in decline.“We stand ready to work with the Government to help pubs re-open in a safe and financially viable way as soon as possible.“Actioning advice from the WHO — for example to use one metre for social distancing from July — would enable many more pubs to viably re-open and serve their communities again.”Brewers and pubs have already had to dispose of the equivalent of million pints of beer that had gone stale.Opening pub gardens gives them some hope — and would allow the two-metre rule to stay for now. In mid-May Boris Johnson laid out the first careful steps of easing the coronavirus lockdown as part of a three-phase plan to get back to normal le.In an address to the nation he revealed a detailed roadmap of how to get Britain back on its feet, but still keep the deadly virus under control.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But she did have mental health issues and when I spoke to her about eight months ago on Facebook, she wasn’t in a good place.But I am so saddened at what has happened to her.Tragically, the young womans body was found by Gloucestershire Police last Tuesday night after the driver of a Vauxhall was spotted with concerns they were flouting the coronavirus lockdown.Officers discovered the body parts stuffed in two suitcases. It is understood there had been attempts to burn the remains.Prosecutor James Ward QC told the court this week: When they opened the suitcases, the police said it smelled of barbecue and the smell was sickening from the decomposition.The ex-boyfriend of Phoenix said today that he had gone to Canterbury Christ Church University with her between  and  where she had trained to become a paramedic - but she didnt graduate.He told the Mail Online: She told me and one other friend of hers that she had been raped by a drug dealer.Phoenix was kind and quiet, but also vulnerable. She didn’t have a great childhood after her parents had split up. I was ignorant to peoples’ mental health at the time, so I wouldn’t have been able to analyse then as I can now.But she seemed damaged, and rightly so, by the trauma she went through. I don’t know which way her le went after we split up, but it clearly went south.She never expressed any interest in kids or getting married.The Times today revealed Gordon, , lived in the room opposite to Phoenix in the seven-bedroom terraced property in Lozells.It is understood Phoenix had grown up in Croydon, south London before relocating to the Midlands - later moving into the womens refuge late last year.Her family issued an emotional statement in response to her tragic death on May .It read: “As a family we are devastated with what has happened to Phoenix.“We have family and good friends supporting us and our thanks go out to all of them.“We would also like to thank all the police officers involved in the investigation for their hard work and sensitivity.Neighbour Wahidur Rahman, , said: Phoenix was a really nice young girl. She was lovely.I thought something might have happened to her because I hadn’t seen her in a while.Detective Chief Inspector Scott Grfiths from our homicide team said: “Firstly, I’d like to offer my sincere condolences to Phoenix’s family.“We’ve worked closely with colleagues at Gloucestershire over the past week and our investigation continues at pace.“We’d urge anyone with any information about the tragic loss of Phoenix’s le to get in touch with us."},{"url":null,"title":"britain first leader paul golding","story":"Golding, , was stopped at Heathrow Airport on October  last year on his way back from Moscow by officers from the politan Police.He refused to give the pin codes for an iPhone and Apple computer and was later charged with wilfully refusing to comply with a duty under Schedule  of the Terrorism Act.Golding, the leader of the far-right political group, denied the charge but was found guilty of the offence following a trial at Westminster Magistrates Court in London on Wednesday.Chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot ruled there was no doubt that Golding had failed to comply with requests for information, despite his obligations being explained to him and being warned over and over thathe did not he risked arrest.She handed Golding a conditional discharge for nine months and ordered him to pay a £ surcharge and £ in costs.Ms Arbuthnot said Golding had been lawfully questioned and that under Schedule  there had been no requirement for reasonable suspicion for the stop.PC Rory OConnor, a borders officer with the Met who questioned Golding, told the court that Schedule  enables accredited officers to speak to people in order to make a determination of whether they are or have been concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.The officer explained that it also permitted police to interrogate, search and detain anyone for up to six hours at UK ports.He said he had cause to examine Golding under the legislation and recalled him being initially agitated and clearly angry at being stopped, with him shouting at officers.Prosecutor Samuel Main said that for nearly three hours Golding was questioned about his activities in Russia after flying out with two others on October .The court heard that Golding said he was on a purely political trip after establishing friendships in Russia during an international congress on an earlier date.He told officers that he had ed to the country under the invitation of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia , which he described as a right wing, conservative, patriotic group who were not extreme.English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, watched the proceedings in the courts socially distanced public gallery.Over the course of his three-day trip, Golding gave interviews to the media, met members of the LDPR and visited the Russian parliament, Mr Main said.He also visited Moscows Red Square and laid a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier.In audio recording of the interview played in court, Golding said the request for his pin codes was wildly inappropriate, completely unjustied, and was a political witch hunt.Mr Main said he told officers they hadnt asked him about terrorism or criminality and he was simply a politician.Britain First was deregistered as a political party in November .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the Government furlough system was set up as a fallback to keep people in jobs, not to protect the wealth of multi-millionaires or billionaires by paying their staff for them.Many families who can afford cleaners have dug deep to keep them solvent during this crisis. They have not demanded the public bail them out.Coogan could pay his staff in full without denting even a fraction of the interest on his riches. Instead he chose to make taxpayers do it.That’s greed, all right. As for the comic’s risible claim that “I don’t get anything for free”, it’s not true now, is it It is equally repugnant that Foxtons magnate Jon Hunt has kept his £.billion dry by getting the public to pay his  furloughed country club workers.At least Victoria Beckham changed her mind after belatedly realising from the public outcry how wrong it was for a woman as rich as she is to make a claim.The UK faces a recession of unprecedented scale, with millions unemployed and the Treasury’s depleted coffers struggling to keep us afloat.Let us never forget those mega-rich celebrity hypocrites who abused the State’s generosity during the Covid crisis and brought ordinary people’s ruin even closer.BORIS Johnson must show stronger leadership over getting kids back to school.The softening-up of the June  restart date for primaries betrays a man cowed by the storm the unions whipped up.He must remember that they are led by Corbynites engaging in a political war against the Brexit-backing Tory Government which they detest for destroying their dreams last December.But we do agree with the unions on one thing. If the advice from Sage’s scientists is that ing to school is safe, publish it in full.Then the public, the teachers and their unions can see it.The PM must then order schools to , once they have finalised social distancing measures.If the NEU wants to strike, it can ­ballot members.If local councils refuse to open schools, the Government MUST sanction them. And Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour must decide whether to side with the hard-Left over working people.Boris’s drt is worrying.

Its vast bureaucratic institutions were utterly unable to react to the threat of the virus.So the inidual countries did it all for themselves. Each following a dferent policy. When the moment came, the EU was found wanting. Lethargic, hopeless and riven with internal dispute.There is fury in Spain that the EUwon’t bung them loads of money for being badly hit by the virus.It’s the same in Italy, where  per cent of the population now want to LEAVE the EU. The country that was usually one of the EU’s biggest cheerleaders.A disillusion with the EU is spreading across the continent.People are beginning to see that it’s a good thing to have control of your borders. And that the best way of controlling those borders is through a nation state.The Greeks have been trying to contain a mass influx of refugees from Turkey — and getting no help from the EU in the process. Some senior EU politicians fear that the virus could kill off the EU altogether. Right now it’s on a ventilator and looking very sorry for itself.We can only hope — for the good of our European friends — that someone switches that ventilator off.Once we all emerge from lockdown there will be a financial price to pay. Our economy — the world’s economy — has taken a hell of a battering.But the good news is that we will be in with a much better chance of a full recovery than the EU bloc.From  you will no longer have to pay tarfs on a vast range of goods imported from beyond Europe.I suspect it will lead to a consumer bonanza — which is just what we want. Washing machines, freezers, women’s sanitary products, bicycle inner tubes, Christmas trees — the list of stuff which will be cheaper is almost endless.It’s true thatthe EU refuses to soften its stance about a trade deal with us, then we’ll pay more for cars made on the continent.But even that might have its upside. It will encourage people to buy British. Last year Brits bought only , cars that had been manufactured in the UK. The majority of cars were bought from German plants. Your loss, Germany.The EU negotiators are still being intransigent. They still think they can bully this country.Michael Gove has told them to get real. Sort out an acceptable trade deal for the good of the entire European economy.But eventhey don’t — evenreality fails to establish itself inside their closed minds— it will be the EU that loses out.It wouldn’t surprise me hugelyCovid- outlasted the European Union, frankly. We should all breathe a sigh of relief that we got the hell out of that helpless institution.Just in time.I WONDERCovid- will see an end to hard cash  My local shopkeepers tell me that almost no transactions in the past two months have been paid in cash. It’s all done by card.I’ve had the same  quid in my pocket that was there on March .I bet we don’t go back to paying in cash once this is over. Queuing for ages behind some addled berk at the ATM who is incapable of pressing the right buttons. Cash is going the way of the dinosaurs.And it’s not too far of a stretch to suggest that offices might be on their way out, either. Hugely expensive things to run, offices. And the original reason we had them was to store paper – files and so on. Don’t really need that any more, do we  People have discovered that working from home has many benefits. Not least the pleasure of avoiding pointless meetings with idiots.And for those who feel the need to get away from their families on a daily basis there’s “co-working environments”, or “the park with a load of booze”, as I like to call it.MOST lady slebs are busy during lockdown taking pictures of themselves wearing almost no clothes.Either to advertise products nobody really wants or to advertise themselves. For which many thanks, girls.Scarcely a day goes by without one of them taking a perfectly natural selfie of herself with hardly any clothes on, pouting at the camera like a trout with a botched facelt.Model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has gone a stage further and posted pics of herself taken  years ago. Just in case we’d forgotten.I might get in on the act. Next week I’ll take a selfie wearing a leather thong and nipple clamps, advertising my new skincare product made from vole’s urine.Watch this space.I’m not so sure. Boredom is a greatly underrated virtue. It makes you get off your backside and do something. And our kids have been bored senseless for two months now.You never know, this break might do the kids some good. Fire their imaginations or something.And better still – it means they’re not having left-wing drivel drilled into their heads by the teachers…THE English Football League is in a right old mess.None of its three isions can agree what to do about finishing the season.The clubs in the lowest tier, ision two, have voted to end the season immediately. Those in the Championship want to finish the season, while League One clubs haven’t a clue.There’s talk of Coventry and Rotherham being promoted and a play-off between the next EIGHT clubs.I know a lot of money is at stake. I know the league has signed big deals with the broad- casters. But the sensible thing surely would have been to call the season null and void, across all three isions.Those of us who, like me, support clubs who had a chance of promotion will get over our disappointment.There are more important things than football.So let’s look at Sweden. It became the country with the highest death rate per capita from Covid- in Europe during thesevendays to May .The lockdown has unquestionably saved lives.LAST Friday night I was called  times in the space of an hour by the SAME NUMBER.What’s more, my phone told me the call was coming from Tajikistan. But every time I tried to answer, the caller hung up. That’s totally unfair.I have never in my le spoken to a person from Tajikistan. And I would very much like to do so. It might be interesting.I’m sure it was a criminal of some kind, but that’s not the point.I wanted to knowmy caller was a member of the mysterious Yaghnobi people, who live in the mountains in the north of the country, with their many goats. That would have been exciting.I might start ringing up numbers in Tajikistan indiscriminately. And then move on to Kyrgyzstan.That’s what lockdown does to you.For this they have been attacked by “human rights activists”.Perhaps.But not by the people of Hungary, who fully agree with this measure.Much as I suspect people would over here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

saying they would be finedthey made non-essential travel.Ms Sturgeon is expected to lay out when Scottish children will be able to head back to schools.She has previously warned they may not be back behind desks until after the summer holidays.When asked about plans for English schools to reopen on June , Ms Sturgeon said she did not think it was the right thing to do.She said: I cannot and should not comment on whether that is appropriate for England … but I do know, looking at the evidence I have now, I could not put my hand on my heart and say that would be a safe thing to do in Scotland.English school kids are due to head back to classroom on June , starting with reception, followed by year one and year six. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-cases-per-day-linegraph--MAY-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Instead they will expand existing border screening to carry out the additional checks.And the government documents made clear that the checks will be conducted by UK border officials, snubbing EU demands to have their own personnel carrying out checks.It set up another big row with Brussels, which wanted to install a permanent base in Northern Ireland to oversee the checks.But Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, who unveiled the UK plans in the Commons on Wednesday, admitted that Northern Ireland will have to follow EU rules on agriculture and manufactured goods until at least .The key concession will ensure access to the EU’s single market and keep the border with the Republic of Ireland free-flowing in order to maintain the Northern Ireland Peace Agreement.The Government paper said having a so-called “mini-EU embassy” in Belfast would be “isive” and called on Brussels to “respect the UK’s territorial integrity”.It also promised Northern Ireland businesses would benefit from “unfettered access” when selling goods to the rest of the UK. It ended a row over whether checks would be in place on goods entering the UK from Northern Ireland.Mr Gove, minister in charge of Brexit preparations, said: Our proposals will deliver unfettered access for Northern Ireland businesses to the whole of the UK market ensure there are no tarfs on goods remaining within the UK customs territory discharge our obligations without the need for any new customs infrastructure in Northern Ireland and, finally, guarantee that Northern Ireland businesses benefit from the lower tarfs we deliver through our new free trade agreements with third countries.The plans were given a cautious initial welcome by the EU last night, who said they will be monitoring the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol closely.A European Commission spokesman said: “The detailed legal commitments set out in the Protocol must now be implemented precisely to give full effect to this solution.The time to implement the Protocol is short, and practical implementation measures must start immediately so that the Protocol can be operational by  January . To this end, the Commission stands ready to work with the UK authorities.”In a further sign of relations souring between the two sides, the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier last night hit out at the “tone” of his opposite number David Frost.He said a “new dynamism” was needed in talksthe two sides are to avoid a “stalemate”.Mr Barnier was hitting back at a furious letter from Mr Frost that was highly critical of the EU’s rigid approach to the negotiations.Mr Frost said Brussels proposed deal contains novel and unbalanced proposals which would bind this country to EU law or standards.He said: What is on offer is not a fair free trade relationship between close economic partners, but a relatively low-quality trade agreement coming with unprecedented EU oversight of our laws and institutions.”In his reply, Mr Barnier said he did not think an exchange of letters regarding the substance of the negotiations is necessarily the best way to discuss on substantial points.He added: It cannot be a substitute for serious engagement and detailed negotiations and, in particular, I would not like the tone that you have taken to impact the mutual trust and constructive attitude that is essential between us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Opposition MPs failed in a bid to block the plan for the ‘virtual Parliament’ to be abandoned in a vote last night. This morning, Henry Smith, the Conservative MP for Crawley, tweeted: “Not that I should be surprised by the lazy left but interesting how work-shy socialist and nationalist MPs tried to keep the remote Parliament going beyond  June.” His comments were met with fury from readers, some of whom asked whether he considered all home workers lazy. Others asked whether his comments reflected his own home-working practices. Former Labour MP Liz McInnes said: “Donapost you do any work in your constituency, Henry “Enjoy your recess then - nothing at all to do. The people of Crawley must be so grateful to have you.” And Shadow Exchequer Secretary Wes Streeting said: “If you think that the virtual Parliament and home-working has been a aposwork-shyapos or aposlazyapos experience, then that tells us rather more about how youaposve been spending your working days in recent weeks than the rest of us whoaposve been working flat out.” Labour’s Lloyd Russel-Moyle said: “Henry this is totally below you. We were on a call together on Gatwick yesterday, the fact that you and I did that from our home - was that not work  “The [Government] guidelines isyou can work from home you should - why are you keen to make it impossible to keep working safely.” The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said Tory leader Boris Johnson would not have been aware of the comments, and that he had not discussed it with him.Our focus has been on ensuring Parliament can perform all of its key s.

The Prime Minister yesterday pledged to have a “world-beating” track-and-trace system for Covid- in place by the end of the month. We have repeatedly seen ministers make ambitious promises then fail to deliver on them - we hope this will not be the case with contact tracing. There is a substantial and essential dference between having a system in place by June  and it being fully operational. Ministers need to come clean on whether the programme will be up and running in all parts of the country by this deadline and whether the army of , tracers is sufficient. Track-and-tracing is key to containing the virus and allowing the further lting of the lockdown. Which is why it is all the more scandalous that it has only been resuscitated now after being abandoned on March .

Danielle Finlay Brookes, , was discovered dead on Tuesday night at her flat in an apartment block near the brash Punta Ballena strip. Local reports said she had been discovered leless inside a wardrobe at the property before police arrived after a concerned neighbour managed to get in. Police could not be reached early this morning for an official comment but it is understood Danielle’s death is not being treated as suspicious at this stage. Well-wishers have already donated nearly £, towards a GoFundMe appeal set up to raise money towards repatriation and funeral costs. One of the two expats who set up the fundraising site is Meghan Tattersall, who was badly hurt in a hate-fuelled hit-and-run in Magaluf in May  when she was mowed down by the ex-girlfriend of her new partner. Kemi Coaker, , from Manchester, was handed a two-year suspended jail sentence in May last year after confessing to running over Meghan, , from Leeds, after a plea bargain deal. Sales rep Meghan said in a Facebook tribute on Wednesday: “Your are my best friend and my angel high in the sky. I’m truly heartbroken. “I’m so proud to be able to spend everyday with you. Fly high my princess. RIP to my girl I’m so proud of. I love you.” [sic] Another pal, Jay Burton, said of the tragic expat, originally from Crewe, Cheshire: “Absolutely devastated to hear the news Danielle Finlay Brookes. “You were the le of the party everywhere you were. Hope you rest in peace. Magaluf won’t be the same without you.” He added in a later post: “Sending all my love to everyone  who is struggling through this tough time. “Being stuck indoors, with your mind doing somersaults, thinking you’re not good enough, with the biggest challenge of the day being putting a smile on your face.  “Thinking no-one would careyou just didn’t wake up the next day. “Today seeing all the support from the Maga family after losing an amazing girl who cared for everyone, makes me realise how le is too short and many people actually do care. “To all my friends and family, please check on those you haven’t heard from in a while.” Danielle, who described herself on social media as a “Queen building her own empire” had worked in Magaluf for several years. She is thought to have lived alone. She was described as a worker at the Three Lions Karaoke bar in October  when she filmed Spanish police hitting a female tourist as she tried to break up a fight between two men. She wrote alongside the footage, which was posted on a Facebook page for Magaluf residents: “Spanish Guardia for you - attacking a girl for no reason.” She later wrote an impassioned statement about the incident, moaning Brits in the party resort were treated worse than muggers and prostitutes she claimed were “free to roam the streets.” Emotional pal Rob Dury said: “No words can describe how much all your friends and family will miss that smile. “A beautul young woman taken too soon. Thanks for being you. I will miss your hugs and chats.” The latest tragedy comes just less than a month after the death of another much-loved Magaluf bar worker, -year-old Irishman Anthony Ennis.  He plunged to his death from his eighth-floor apartment in the party resort just after am on April . Anthony, believed to be from Waterville, Co Kerry, worked at the well-known Stereo Bar in Magaluf. He was described as a “diamond of a bloke” by one friend after it emerged he had died. The results of an investigation into his death have not been made public but police are not understood to be treating the incident as a crime. Like Danielle, popular Anthony was gearing up for a much quieter season this year because of the coronavirus crisis. Brits normally make up most of the holidaymakers flocking to Magaluf and its raucous Punta Ballena party strip in the peak summer season months. But local tourism chiefs have predicted they could be outnumbered by other nationalities including Spaniards and Germans this yeara feared UK quarantine keeps them away.

They have also set their own rules, taking into account the inidual demands and challenges for each region of the country. Hereaposs what you need to know: What can you take to the tip  Most rubbish tips are only accepting black bag waste and garden waste that is not collected at the kerbside, and cannot be stored safely at home.Some will also be accepting cardboard and other materials for recycing. You should check the website of your local rubbish tip before setting off. What are the rules  Staff will not be allowed to assist customers, and only one person will be allowed out of the car - so you must be able to unload and dispose of your waste on your own. With very high demand and one-in, one-out policies in operation, you should expect long queues. Some rubbish tips will have a cut off system, sothe queue gets too long you may be asked to go home and come back later. You must remain two metres away from other people, and you will be asked to leaveyou donapost respect the rules, oryou abuse the staff.

Bars, cafes and restaurants have now been closed for almost  weeks - with many businesses being sadly crippled by the lack of business. However, when le s to something that looks a little more like normality, things could be far from normal when it comes to heading out on an evening. Drinking at the bar could become a thing of the past, so could mingling in crowds or even sitting near other diners, reports the Manchester Evening News. Last week, the Prime Minister revealed the governmentaposs plan in easing the strict restrictions, including when hospitality businesses can re-open. Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog here This is currently earmarked for no earlier than July  - but this completely depends on the five tests set out by the government being met which includes a consistent drop in Covid- cases. The ban of people drinking at the bar is one of many proposals being considered aimed at helping hospitality firms reopen. Restrictions on the number of children in outdoor playing areas and patrols of smoking areas have also been put forward among potential measures touted to help sites meet coronavirus guidelines. In the guidance, hospitality businesses have made it clear that they do not wish to move ahead with reopening before the time is right and support a phased reopening approach.  The proposals for restaurants suggest that condiments would not be left on tables, with inidually wrapped sauces and condiments handed out by staff on request. Restaurants would also need to bring cutlery with customersapos food, rather than leave them on tables or allow customers to help themselves. Tables would also be spaced in the restaurant to meet social distancing guidelines. Meanwhile, the guidance suggests that restrictions on customers remaining at the bar after ordering and getting their drink should be considered. It also proposed that customers are discouraged from ing empty glasses, customers are told to keep a safe distance away from bar staff and they will have to form a socially-distanced queue for orders.

But while we love the heat in the day, itaposs a very, very dferent story when weaposre trying to get a good nightaposs kip. As well as opening every window in the house, many people have been keeping their fans on overnight in a desperate bid to keep cool. And according to the experts, for most of us this is actually the right thing to doyou want a good night sleep. But for some people thereaposs a worrying side effect and it might mean you have to reconsider. According to the Sleeping Advisor the moving air causes flurries of dust and pollen. This can be bad news for people with allergies, asthma and hayfever. The dry air can also dry out our skin, so itaposs important to keep moisturising. It can also cause dry eyes which can make them irritable, especiallyyou wear contact lenses. If youaposre looking for an alternative there are a few other things you can try.  To cool down a room, try hanging a wet sheet in front of an open window. Bizarre, but it works. Closing the curtains during the day will also keep your room cooler, which will make it much nicer when it comes to bedtime. The right sheets are also key when it comes to keeping cool. Avoid satin and silk and stick to cooler linen and cotton sheets. Many people are also worried about how electricity their fan uses, and how much it costs to have it on all night. Experts from This Is Money say the answer to this depends on several factors - the kind of fan you have and the amount of energy it uses. You can find out how much energy yours is using by checking the wattage. The total cost will also depend on the amount of hours you use the fan for and the type of energy plan you have, as energy tarf prices y. From estimations, they were able to work out that the average cost of running a fan for  hours a night would be between p and p in total.

She begins by spraying the product very generously all over her head at the roots. That sounds just like what we would usually do, except thereaposs one big dference. Instead of immediately rubbing the dry shampoo in, Cora leaves it to sit for like five or ten minutes. She encourages women to leave it in their hair while doing their make-up.  Then she rubs it in, making sure to spread it through evenly. After that she takes a hair brush and brushes it through her hair. And to finish she follows all of this up with a dry conditioner. She adds: And this goes against everything that Iaposve learned but my favourite dry shampoo in the world is Dove.

But as we all know, there are some people who simply cannot abide by the rules and love to steal the spotlight.Well, one bride couldnapost believe it when she woke up on the morning of her big day to discover that her wedding dress was going to be upstaged by her motheraposs outfit.Jane Lu, the CEO and founder of Australian fashion company ShowPo, tied the knot in October , wearing a white dress from her brandaposs bridal range.  She opted for the Fairy Tale Ivory dress, a pretty simple satin number which cost just under £. In a video posted to TikTok earlier this week, Lu showed for the first time, the moment she discovered what her mother would be wearing.In the clip, she can be seen unzipping her mumaposs garment bag and exposing the dress, which she describes as being more bridal than her own. The gown features white lace and satin.  In the clip she says: Just went to look at my mum’s dress. It’s more bridal than mine. Her friend, who is filming the whole thing laughs and replies: She’s bought a bridal dress. Is your mum remarrying  Like is she doing the vows  Lu captioned the video: I found out the morning of MY wedding that my mum is wearing a white bridal dress. The footage also contains several photos of her mum wearing the dress at the wedding.  Luckily Lu wasnapost too bothered about the situation and was able to laugh it off. But people who watched the video say they wouldnapost have been able to let it slide. One person commented: No, I wouldaposve made my mum go and buy a dferent dress that second. Another said: Straight up I wouldaposve lost my mind. You looked amazing tho. Someone  wrote: My maid of honour wore white to mine... her and my ex-husband are engaged now.

It goes like this: The shopping cart is the ultimate litmus test for whether a person is capable of self-governing. Tothe shopping cart is an easy, convenient task and one which we all recognise is the correct, appropriate thing to do. Toa shopping cart is objectively right. There are no situations other than dire emergencies in which a person is not able totheir cart. Simultaneously, it is not illegal to abandon your shopping cart. Therefore the shopping cart presents itself as the apex example of whether a person will do what is right without being forced to do it. No one will punish you for not ing the shopping cart, no one will fine you or kill you for not ing the shopping cart, you gain nothing for ing the shopping cart. You mustthe shopping cart out of the goodness of your own heart. You mustthe shopping cart because it is the right thing to do. Because it is correct.  A person who is unable to do this is no better than an animal, an absolute savage who can only be made to do what is right by threatening them with law and the force that stands behind it. The shopping cart is what determines whether a person is a good or bad member of society. Some believed the theory to be absolutely true, with one replying: I’m laughing at the people who are like aposbut I’m a decent person and sometimes I don’t feel like putting my cart backapos. That’s the whole point, you inconsiderate, selfish jerk. It DOES say something about your characteryou’re too lazy to do something so small lol.  Another said: The people bashing the test don’t like what it says about themselves or cannot admit to themselves that they are actually inconsiderate jerks. But others disagreed, as one argued: Alternative explanation: Leaving carts for employees to gather is job security, and therefore a good deed. Another commented: A good reason not toit isyou are alone, with young children, and you are too far from theto leave your kids alone in the car. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true\""},{"url":null,"title":"instagram model couldnt sit down","story":"NewsInstagram model couldn’t sit down for four months after botched bum surgery disasterWARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES Shilpa Sethi, , from New Delhi, India, had always wanted a curvy body, so saved up k for a ‘Brazilian Butt Lt’ - however it ended up being a complete nightmareShareCommentsByAndy HillTanveer MannDeputy News Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsShilpa Sethi, , was unable to sit down for months after botched bum surgery\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Shilpa Sethi, , from New Delhi, India, had always wanted a curvy body, so decided to start saving up k for a ‘Brazilian Butt Lt’.The model, who has over . million followers on her Instagram page where she posts X-rated pictures of herself in lingerie, said: I have always admired a curvy body. And I was very flat, at first.She added that despite her mum not wanting her to have the procedure, she went ahead with it anyway. But things did not go according to plan. Shilpa explained: I chose my doctor based on what I later discovered to be fake reviews. That first surgery was botched, and I had complications immediately after the procedure. I was short of breath, and felt a sharp pain in my leg. Unable to contact the Miami-based doctor directly, Shilpa did a little investigating and uncovered a culture of deception in the cosmetic surgery trade. His office staff members had bribed every patient in the office with free [pain relieving] Arnica cream for their fake review. The only reason I’m telling my story now is because I don’t want anybody  to go through what Iaposve been through. I wish I had never picked him as my first doctor. Shilpa is furious with the people who had written the  testimony. She said: People don’t care about other people as long as they get what they want from writing their fake review.  The end result of that surgery was not only a lopsided rear end, but considerable discomfort. It was very painful, and I wasn’t able to sit on my butt for four months. Now, following three more expensive and aposaggressively painfulapos corrective procedures costing a total of k – for which she travelled to Colombia twice and had to undergo a aposJ-plasmaapos to reattach loose skin back onto her muscles – Shilpa is finally able put this painful experience behind her. She also decided to treat herself to breast augmentation in the final cosmetic procedure.

It was a baby girl who had just been abandoned. The rescue team examined the girl and suspected that she was only a few hours old due to the fresh blood and amniotic fluid on her body.

There is a whole lot of work to be done to prove to the government football matches can be staged safely.Now, the Premiership clubs have given themselves some space to think about how to restart football with a new campaign.It’s the only sensible option.Clubs now know what ision they are going to be in and there can be some tentative plans put in place to move forward.That’s a step in the right direction.Dundee now know they’ll have to fend off Heartsthey want to win the Championship and can budget for the year ahead knowing who they will be playing.Whether there are fans in attendance, we’ll have to wait and see.The good thing is, it feels like our game is finally moving forward.The past couple of weeks have seen both Dundee and Dundee United start to reshape their squads for next season.Neither are yet in a position to start signing new players, of course, but there are some hints of what is to come at both clubs.United released a few boys at the end of their contracts – Paul Watson, Rakish Bingham and Osman Sow among them.It’s not a clearout or anything but I think we should expect a number of new faces at Tannadice once some sort of normality reappears.With Watson going, they evidently have a new centre-back in mind.I’d expect them to strengthen the spine of the team, adding a central midfielder and a striker to compete with Lawrence Shankland and Nicky Clark.At Dundee, I only expect a handful of new faces.A striker to partner Kane Hemmings is a certainty while maybe another wide attacker and central midfielder will arrive.What happens with Christophe Berra we will have to wait and see. Hearts might not be too happy with Dundee right now#IT was refreshing to see a bit of live football on the TV over the weekend with the Bundesliga kicking off again.It might not have been what we are used to with no fans, masked subs and someDortmund#s Erling Haaland showing a pandemic still can’t stop him.Germany is leading the way on how to get the game back – problem is I don’t see any other country being able to do it as safely as the Germans.I’M no basketball fan but watching the Last Dance on Netflix certainly made me think about becoming one!Remarkable series on the s Chicago Bulls and the great Michael Jordan.Get it watched!SPFL call   Premiership season with Celtic crowned champions, Hearts relegated and St Johnstone landing top-six finish\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp spfl-premiership-celtic-hearts-st-johnstone embed # secretjwBrECgV\" data-secret\"jwBrECgV\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/05/4696595-1-815x564.jpg ","title":"lee wilkie i am all for reconstruction but now is not the time","story":"I’ve been hugely in favour of league reconstruction for a long time. However, I’m getting the sneaking feeling now just isn’t the right time.That might come as a surprise to people who have read this column over the past few weeks andIt seems like we are slowly moving toward the game eventually restarting.Yesterday’s announcement of the Premiership being called with Celtic champions and Hearts relegated came as no surprise.There was no other credible option.The Jambos will, obviously, feel aggrieved and so will some Rangers fans but it is the right call.I said from the start of the shutdown that reconstruction is the only way to ensure no club is unduly affected by leagues ending early.And I still stand by that.However, the situation we are in now a couple of months down the line leads me to pause for thought.Clubs are in such dire straits right now, nobody really knows how many might go to the wall before the game restarts.If we’ve already agreed reconstruction and, say, five clubs go under, we have to start the whole process over again.The decision-makers in the game have shown over the past few farcical weeks that there’s a realI can see where the Premiership clubs were coming from when they canned the revamp talks  days ago.It looks like a mammoth job to get football back on the pitch sometime soon, eventhe SPFL are planning to restart again in July.With that in mind, I’d prefer reconstruction talks were put on the back burner – not binned, by any means – and talked about in a measured fashion over the next few months.Start the new season as normal – eventhings have to wait a few weeks to get the green light – and then get a plan in place for the season after.That way, the new set-up comes from a foundation of stability rather than the uncertainty the game is surrounded by right now and what the future might hold.At the very least, clubs can now plan for the season ahead, knowing who they will be facing eventhere are still doubts around.The big thing for all clubs is getting that stability back, that certainty to then plan ahead.It feels like that’s coming – once it’s back, start talking reconstruction to improve our game in the long-term.I felt for a couple of my old team-mates who were released by their clubs over the weekend.The coronavirus pandemic is obviously a dficult time for everybody but being without a job through it is horrible.Particularly when there’s no prospect right now of finding another employer.With football clubs unable to make moves in the transfer market because of the shutdown, that leaves players like Danny Swanson and Craig Conway in limbo.Normally, I’d expect them to have plenty of offers to think over this summer.Swansonis one of the most talented players I’ve ever seen in training.He was superb at Tannadice.He obviously hasn’t played so much at St Johnstone for whatever reason, leading to his departure.Conway, meanwhile, has had a really successful career since leaving United.He was always such a fit guy and a great lad to have in the dressing-room, he’d normally find a new club no problem.Right now, though, nobody knows what will happen.I was pleased to see Dundee say they were extending some contracts.Christie Elliott’s for another year, a clause he had in his deal, and Paul McGowan, Josh Meekings and Tom Field till July. Even though that’s just a few weeks, it sends the right message – that they are going to look after players.I don’t imagine every club will be doing that.A lot of players will have a stressful summer coming up with no club able to sign them.Theof football with the Bundesliga starting at the weekend was very much a step in the right direction for me.It might have been a bit strange without the crowds but needs must.

I would stress that anyone turning up to the sites without a booking will be turned away.“We hope to reopen the remainder of our HRCs as soon as possible depending on Government guidance and, in the fullness of time,to a nearly normal service across all of our sites. The booking system will almost certainly be in place for as long as physical distancing measures are required and this may be quite some time.”Aberdeenshire Council said all of the centres will have clearly-defined unloading bays to ensure strict physical distancing is maintained at all times.Only one adult should unload a vehicle # unless two adults are needed for heavy items # and staff will be unable to assist with any unloading.There will be no pedestrian access and no children will be permitted outside vehicles.During the initial phase, there will be no access for trailers or vans, however these will hopefully be able to be accommodated in the second phase in due course.General waste will only be acceptedit is bagged.All garden waste must arrive bagged before being emptied in the appropriate skip. As loose materials take longer to unload and put in a skip, this measure is to make the process quicker and to allow more slots to be made available for residents.There will be clearly-marked areas to deposit white goods and electrical items.No other materials – i.e. bulky items, glass, cardboard, wood, metals, textiles and rubble # will be accepted at this stage.These facilities will operate seven days a week as usual and have extended opening hours from am to .pm.Portlethen will retain its usual -day operation with the same extended hours as where and while opening from Monday, June  will close for two days before re-opening on Thursday, June  so as not to delay the reopening.Aberdeenshire Council Leader, Councillor Jim Gford, said he welcomed theof the recycling centre.He said: “I am delighted that  out of our  Household Recycling Centres are re-opening shortly. We appreciate that some residents may have been struggling to cope with a build-up of additional waste materials and we thank you for your patience.“Our key focus continues to be on providing our core household waste collections and I want to express my personal thanks for the continuing efforts of all our staff to ensure it is business as usual as far as possible during these unprecedented times.”Details of the booking system will appear on the Aberdeenshire Council Waste Services website at https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk waste waste-covid- For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/05/20200506_AFCKIT_147.jpg ","title":"aberdeen officially unveil new home and away kits","story":"Aberdeen have unveiled their home and away kits for the   season.The new strips # which were circulating on social media last night # are of course made by Adidas and carry the logo of sponsors Saltire Energy.Next season#s red home offering is notable for the prominent white v-neck collar, as well as similarly thick white cuffs on the sleeves, while the away kit is white, with black and gold stripes down the middle, and a band round the middle for the Saltire logo.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.8063373-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.8063373-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.8063373-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.8063373-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"three years ago scott wrights hat trick on just his second aberdeen start","story":"Today marks three years since youngster Scott Wright gave Aberdeen fans an exciting glimpse into his potential with a hat-trick against Partick Thistle.Balmedie boy Wright#s low shot from close-range after  minutes was his first goal for the club in just his second first-team start and put the Reds - up.However # intent on taking his chance # the -year-old soon followed it up with another strike, which went in at the near post and put Derek McInnes# team up by three.After the break, Wright would complete his hat-trick when he scored Aberdeen#s sixth with a deflected effort.Since his Firhill treble,Wright#s Dons career has continued in fits and starts.

The boys and girls who qualied from the local area competitions in Lochgilphead, Oban, Tobermory and Campbeltown will be advised of the new Argyll final date and times through their local club or school.#We apologise for any inconvenience and disappointment this postponement may cause to the young athletes and their families.#The annual Crinan Puffer # an .-mile race between Crinan and Ardrishaig # has also been postponed.A fundraiser for Mid Argyll Community Pool organised with the help of Mid Argyll Athletic Club, the run was due to be held on Sunday March .Announcing the postponement, Kirsty Young of Mid Argyll Community Pool said: #In light of current government guidelines to avoid non-essential contact and unnecessary travel we feel that this is the right decision to make.#I will be contacting all stakeholders involved with the organisation and running of the event in the coming days to try and come up with a date to re-schedule the event.#Months of work to raise money for a trip to Holland in April for young Mid Argyll footballers has come to nothing, thanks to coronavirus.Lochgilphead Red Star  players, coaches, parents and supporters were left disappointed when the Amsterdam tournament was cancelled.A committee spokesperson said: #The team are devastated not to be going after nine months of fundraising for the event. We are lucky enough to be getting a full refund from the organisers and at present are awaiting to seethe same will happen regarding the flights.#We would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone from the public to businesses who have supported us throughout our fundraising, from attending coffee mornings, donating at bag packs and online donations and our hypnotist night. Your generosity has been overwhelming .#We plan to let the kids of the team decide which charities they would like to donate the funds to once we receive the refund.#After just one week of the  season, shinty#s governing body, the Camanachd Association, made the decision on Friday March  to postpone all matches until further notice.The association also recommended that this should include all training, festivals and other events.In a statement, the Camanachd Association said: #In light of the government restrictions on public gatherings and the resulting pressure on emergency services and healthcare provision, the Camanachd Association has postponed all fixtures under our auspices whilst a further assessment can be made and to reduce any additional pressure our activities may have otherwise had on emergency services.#The wellbeing of the people in our communities is primary in this decision and we hope that this decision removes any expectations or pressures on participating during a time that we can be focused on doing all we can to suppress the spread of the virus.#The recommendation is that shinty clubs should hold any meetings using remote technology such as Skype.The association statement concluded: #We will endeavour to provide due notice to clubs ahead of any future shinty matches so as there is time to restart training.#The Scottish Football Association also decided to suspend all matches in the interests of public health for the and health and safety of players, match officials and staff across the game.Ian Maxwell, SFA chief executive, said: #This is of paramount importance as the country enters the #delay# phase of the coronavirus pandemic.#The decision to suspend or continue training is at each club’s discretion at this time, however clubs must ensure to follow the current medical guidance issued by the government and the health authorities when making this decision.Scottish Rugby decided that with effect from Sunday  March at pm there would be a short period without domestic competition or training up to March .This includes rugby in all domestic league and cup fixtures, training, festivals and other rugby events as well as the FOSROC Super tournament, which come under Scottish Rugby#s jurisdiction.The Scottish Rugby age grade programmehas been cancelled with immediate effect for the remainder of the season.A Scottish Rugby Spokesperson said: #We have taken on board all expert medical advice before now and we are taking a precautionary approach to give time to assess what the impact of coronavirus will be on Scottish society in the coming weeks before deciding on next steps.#"},{"url":null,"title":"were open for business","story":"Wyvex MediaUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs of today, Friday March , The Oban Times offices will be closed to members of the public # but we are still open for business.Adverts and notices can be dropped off at our offices where they will be picked up by members of staff.Our editorial and advertising teams are available to take your call, just phone us onOban Times:   Or you can email us at editor@obantimes for the Oban Times editorial teamadverts@obantimes for the Oban Times advertising team.fort@obantimes  for the Lochaber Times editorial teamfortadverts@obantimes for the Lochaber times advertising teameditor@campbeltowncourier for the Campbeltown Courier editorial teamadverts@campbeltowncourier for the Campbeltown Courier advertising teameditor@arranbanner for the Arran Banner editorial teamadverts@arranbanner for the Arran Banner advertising teameditor@argyllshireadvertiser for the Argyllshire Advertiser editorial teamadverts@argyllshireadvertiser for the Argyllshire Advertiser advertising team.Or use social media to get in touch!"},{"url":null,"title":"donald clark a tribute","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDonald Clark was for  years the convivial, larger-than-le host at The George Hotel in Inveraray, a notable bon viveur and one of the most colourful characters in Argyll. He died aged  on January  after a short illness.Latterly, his mobility hampered by a leg injury, he would sit in the corner of The George public bar on an over-sized carved wooden stool. From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club. In , he flamboyantly arrived in Inverness by helicopter for Inveraray#s Camanachd Final against Kingussie."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSuch is the all-consuming impact of the coronavirus pandemic and response on all our lives, it is something of a relief to report something away from the subject.The relatively new owner of Inveraray Pier wants to encourage community involvement, but people will need to raise moneythey choose to get involved. A community buy-out was, in fact, an option mooted in the bad old days, but negotiations proved dficult at that time.With a new spirit of openness, this has to be an opportunity worth grasping. Inveraray has pretty well lost its connection with Loch Fyne since the pier has been out of bounds. To have full control over the pier is something townsfolk have dreamt of for years. Now, with enterprise, hard work and co-operation, it seems like it is a distinct possibility.A pat on the back to all the volunteer stitchers # #sewers# doesn#t look quite right written down # out there working hard to provide protective equipment and clothing for health workers.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

Their first request had been to buy a large toy car theyrsquod seen in some YouTube video, filmed by a wealthy family.You can picture the discussion after that. But thatrsquos when the alternative idea came to me.ldquoWell we could make a bogey cart, I said.Laughter at that expression followed of course, but I was sure I had the name right.It was from my childhood, so I Googled it and showed them what I meant, and they immediately agreed.Then I thought ldquowhat have I done  as I had no idea how to make one!I do have vague recollections of making semi-lethal bogey carts when I was wee using wheels from discarded prams and boxes or planks of wood. I still have a scar on my right knee from a bogey crash.If I could do it in my childhood, surely I could build one now I reasoned. Irsquom not very skilled at these things, but maybe thatrsquos because I havenrsquot tried.Besides, I had the expectations of my children to meet, and so I took on the challenge.It seemed to be a good lockdown activity. The first problem was the lack of materials. I recall a fish box was the best to use, and sturdy pram wheels but, during the lockdown especially, these items are not so easy to acquire.A friend kindly gave me a pallet, and I searched YouTube for advice. My heart began to sink.The videos were all made by people with workshops, tools and carpentry skills I lack. Their fancy-looking perfectly made carts just raised my childrenrsquos hopes.ldquoYea dad, one like that.I could feel my manhood was at stake.My daughter looked at me sympathetically and said: ldquoI know yoursquore busy with other things as well dad.So she gave me a generous five days to construct it.I managed to scavenge some wheels from a toy pram, helped again by a friend, and stood looking at the raw materials, trying to make a design in my imagination.I knew what a bogey cart was supposed to look like, but how to make something with the materials I had seemed a huge challenge.I set to work. I sawed and hammered, and made a good impression of looking like I knew what I was doing.But design challenges, in particular how to fit the wheels I had, which were on a frame, meant that the concept needed refined, and reduced in size.My daughter watched as I stood looking confused then determined then confused again.ldquoI overheard her asking her mum, lsquodo you think dad knows what he is doing rsquoSo I enlisted my childrenrsquos help, sawing and hammering together. At least this way we could all share in the glory, or shame, of the final product!At the time of writing I still have three days left to complete the task. In two days I have managed to make what I have euphemistically called ldquoa prototype a completely new concept in home-made go carts.It looks unsafe just now, but I must emphasise it is unfinished but the basic idea is there. I just hope BMW donrsquot steal the concept!The kids have named it the ldquobug, because itrsquos so small, and, well, looks like a bug!ldquoItrsquos a new kind of cart, a bug-cart! proclaimed my boy.I have three days to find a way to make this bug ldquofly safely.The lockdown is taking its toll on many families but the extra time it is giving some of us with family is one of the benefits. Finding creative activities to do during this time isnrsquot always easy.My kids have become hooked on screen activities which normally wersquod restrict. But these are not normal times, and I think parents need to give ourselves some slack and not worry too much. But there is a sense that this time has grounded many of us in simple meaning.Many of us are sharing skills, like baking, cooking, making things, learning activities, which before we often had little time to do together. But also rediscovering lost skills, or learning new ones by necessity, and making do with what we have like starting off making a bogie cart and ending with a ldquobug.The truth is, of course, itrsquos the quality of the time spent together as much as the quality of the final product that is important. Well, that will certainly be my story when the final version is unveiled!Itrsquos such a time of contradictory emotions I long for the end of the lockdown and the separation from other loved ones, and the loss and anxiety it means.But having this time to fill with meaning also feels like a huge privilege a kind of bittersweet liberation of my time.I have guilt about this, and like others, Irsquom trying to help out to compensate.But let us never forget that this time, and our safety, is made possible by the essential workers who are hard at work, keeping society going at such a dangerous time, and saving lives.Their skills and contributions have so often been taken for granted and unacknowledged.It has brought into sharp focus the  notion that low pay equates with ldquolow skilled work.The reality is that many who are low paid are, in fact, highly skilled and, as we are discovering, the most essential workers.I hope one of the legacies of this time will be a real recognition of the vital skills of many low paid workers, by valuing their work, both with status and proper pay.Letrsquos build statues to essential workers, instead of politicians and generals, and express gratitude for their contribution.And commit to being part of the change afterwards that will make this happen.Such were my thoughts as I assembled the ldquobug ndash my makesht haphazard invention of our lockdown time. I hope I will complete it by the deadline.In my area of East Lothian there is a community Facebook page where we can share our stories from this historic period.The ldquobug will be part of my contribution.We will all have our dferent lockdown legacies and stories to remember and record for posterity. What is yours Already safety rules for the bug are being set by my children. Number one rule: dad must never sit on it, but he can pull it.The term rod for my own back comes to mind."},{"url":null,"title":"co-op-customers-east-lothian-help-raise-20-000-local-causes","story":"A

The test looks for antibodies which could help indicate whether a person has developed some immunity against the virus.As it is able to detect  per cent of cases where a person has had coronavirus in the past, the test could prove useful in helping to inform when lockdown restrictions may be safe to ease.The Department of Health and Social Caresaid it is exploring the use of antibody testing across the NHS in England, and later the wider public.DHSC said it was delighted that devices were progressing through validation and is working on plans to roll out antibody testing, adding that an announcement will be made ldquoin due course.Health officials in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland make their own decisions about testing, but are likely to roll out the antibody testEngland adopts it."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-testing-site-operating-former-power-station","story":"Army personnel can be seen carrying out tests while wearing masks as they welcome key workers and family members who received appointments to attend.The mobile unit is using the former Cockenzie Power Station site as one of several bases across Scotland which it will visit as additional testing is carried out by the UK Government.It opened yesterday with a \"Covid Testing\" sign at the entrance to the site.Imagesshow a team of military staff on the site carrying out testing through vehicle windows at the drive through centre.The st Infantry Brigade, which oversees army reserves in Scotland, are running the mobile unit.The mobile units are providing additional testing capacity to the NHS which continues to focus on testing hospital and social care workers.It is hoped the mobile units will be able to offer tests to other key workers and their families from a wider range of identied essential services including those working in the third sector and volunteer care helpers.The unit willto Cockenzie in two weeks time as part of the national testing programme"},{"url":null,"title":"leuchie-house-toasts-superb-inspection-results","story":"Following an unannounced inspection in January, the Care Inspectorate awarded Leuchie House the highest possible score in four categories and the second highest in a fth.The categories were: quality of care and support quality of staffing quality of leadership how well peoplersquos wellbeing is supported and quality of setting.The report said: ldquoGuests experienced respectful and compassionate care at each stage of their interaction with the service.

the real reason why its aircraft have been seen across Scotland.The most noticeable planes to have been spotted recently launched from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire.These large aircraft have been observed circling Glasgow as well as making brief landings during \"touch and go\" manoeuvres designed to practice these tricky and sometimes risky touchdowns.In wartime, some planes have to make landings on rough terrain, so its imperative that pilots are as well-practised as possible.\" alt\"East Lothian Courier: This is an Airbus AM Atlas, the type of airfact seen over Glasgow in recent weeks \" class\"editor-image\"This is an Airbus AM Atlas, the type of airfact seen over Glasgow in recent weeks A spokesman for RAF Lossiemouth told The Herald:\"Due to the lockdown, the public have become more aware and interested in these activities.\"To be clear, these were all occurring prior to the pandemic. But a lack of civil aviation now makes them stand out more.\"Many of the larger aircraft based out of RAF Brize Norton, such as the C- Hercules, AM Atlas, A-MRTT Voyager, and C- Globemaster regularly fly on essential, but routine training missions around the United Kingdom.\"The C- and A in particular fly quite low-level profiles, and on operations they will be used to land in areas where there are not established runway surfaces.\"This can include landing on beaches, for example.\"The quiet skies have made it easier to spot military planes, which can sometimes be identied and followed using apps like FlightRadar.Occasionally, the military planes have been observed performing strange-looking manoeuvres such as flying around in circles .The RAF said these odd flight patterns have a clear explanation: the aircraft were involved in mid-air refuelling.For the last three weeks RAF Lossiemouth has been involved in night flying exercise which concluded on Friday, May  involving Typhoon jets.\"During our night flying window, we launched our first set of sorties around ,\" the spokesman added.\"This meant we were able to generate two or three training serials a day ndash two in daylight, and one in low-light conditions.\"The Typhoon is a multi-role aircraft, which means itrsquos able to conduct a number of dferent missions while in the air air-to-air and air-to-ground manoeuvres to name two.\"To enable our Typhoons to stay on task for longer and travel larger distances, we are often supported by Voyagers ndash the RAFrsquos air-to-air refuelling aircraft based at RAF Brize Norton.\"These Voyager aircraft will fly lsquoracetracks in the skyrsquo, and are usually visible on flight tracking websites which pick up ADS-B.\"In the United Kingdom, live-armed Typhoons are on \"constant standby to react against unidentied aircraft approaching UK airspace as well as aircraft that are operating in an unusual manner, which may pose a threat\".Typhoons are often scrambled on \"Quick Reaction Alert\" missions to intercept planes which enter British airspace\"Our last intercept was against two Bear-F ndash Russian Maritime Patrol Aircraft on April ,\" the spokesman said.\"Additionally the Typhoon Force are involved in NATO Air Policing missions, such as Op AZOTIZE in Lithuania where  Squadron deployed a few weeks ago.\"Typhoons have also been involved in strikes against Daesh.\"A Typhoon jetIf youre worried by the sudden appearance of a military aeroplane, you can generally find out what its up to by visiting offical Twitter accounts or the RAF website.\"The RAF has always been open about its operations and exercises,\" the spokesman continued.\"With the public now spending more time at home, many have taken to their gardens or spent more time on their phones.\"They have also become more acutely aware of the noises above their houses, and wersquove seen a signicant increase in interest in routine, but essential flying as a result.\"When we do launch Quick Reaction Alert, wherever possible we publish information as to who we intercepted, what the aircraft were doing, why the interception was carried out, roughly where it all happened, and we aim to answer as many questions we can whilst maintaining operational security.\"Itrsquos vital that the public understand why this activity is essential to the defence of the

We have used this approach many times in affordable housing schemes.\"The committee approved the plans lodged by Springfield Properties as part of the affordable phase of a larger development at Windygoul South where it is expected around  homes will be built.Members were told the  new properties housing would be taken on by the council once built.They will be builtin the north eastern part of the wider Windygoul South site, in an area bounded to the west by woodland and existing housingon George Grieve Way.Councillor Colin McGinn, ward member for Tranent, Wallyford and Macmerry, welcomed the addition of affordable housing but raised concerns about the impact of additional traffic on the town centre.He called for the council to look at bringing forward proposals for a Tranent bypass, which has been discussed in the past.Mr McGinn said: \"I believe now is the time to look at the bypass.\""},{"url":null,"title":"british-gas-customers-can-get-five-days-electricity-free","story":"Who is eligible for the offer The offer is only available to those who are part of the British Gas loyalty scheme, which is available to all energy customers.Launched in , the scheme provides customers with ious discounts on restaurants and days out, along with prize draws for live entertainment and holidays.Customers can receive up to  free energy days per year through the loyalty scheme, with the amount depending on how long they have been with the supplier.At the moment, British Gas is offering five extra days completely free, as customers are spending more time at home due to coronavirus, and increasing their energy usage as a result. However, customers cannot choose which five days to get free themselves.Instead, British Gas will take an average daily price for your energy usage per month and deduct that amount from your next bill.The value of the free electricity is dependent on an inidual customersrsquo average consumption and tarf prices.According to government figures, the average monthly electricity bill cost almost pound per month in , meaning customers would save roughly pound by claiming the offer from British Gas.But the freebie will come as a welcome reprieve for many, with energy bills having climbed by pound per month during the UK lockdown.How do I claim it To claim the five free energy days, you need to sign up to British Gas Rewards.This can be done via the British Gas website, or through your online account.Once you have signed up, simply select the list of available offers and claim the free energy days.If you are already a rewards user, be sure to claim the offer before it expires on May .Should I still be working from home If your electricity bill has been climbing due to working from home, you will still have to deal with the added expense for a while longer.Despite lockdown restrictions slowly starting to ease in some parts of the UK, the government has advised workers to continue working from home wherever possible.This is to help minimise the number of social contacts across the country, thereby keeping transmissions as low as possible.Workers in England who are unable to work from home can now travel to work,their workplace is open.

Railways were new and fast. A railway, they believed, could have brought prosperity to desperately poor crofters and cotters, opened up the Isle of Lewis to new trade, and helped extinguish troublesome land raids and civil disobedience which had become an all too familiar element of island le.Branching off the Dingwall-to-Skye line slightly east of Garve station, the proposed track would have powered steam trains upland, following the road past the Black Water river, through the Glascarnoch glen and rising to ft towards Braemore Lodge and the estate owned by Fowler, already celebrated as one of Britainrsquos most acclaimed engineers.If the scenery didnrsquot take the breath away from railway passengers, surely the prospect of a steep descent towards the head of Loch Broom would have.Or, the engineersrsquo preferred option, a tunnel carved through the hillside which would bring them, blinking, into glorious sight of the mouth of the River Broom sprawling before them.:Scotlandrsquos  best train journeysOnce in Ullapool, rail travellers would simply have stepped from their carriages at a terminus built at the junction of the townrsquos Shore Street and Quay Street, mere steps away from the ferry to the Isle of Lewis, and potentially one of the most magnicent settings imaginable for a railway station.However, as a forthcoming book written by Andrew Drummond, the best-laid plans of even one of the nationrsquos most celebrated engineers was set to go horribly wrong.And a combination of competition, lack of funds, ided communities and a frustrating lack of support from Westminster would eventually see plans stop, start, run out of steam and then hit the buffers for good.ldquoIt was all a bit of guddle, says Drummond, whose book, A Quite Impossible Proposal: How Not To Build A Railway, will be published this year.ldquoThere were a lot of shenanigans between government, promoters, the Highland Railway Company and other people sticking their oar in.ldquoThere was the extraordinary attitude of civil servants in London, who were very dismissive of the whole thing.ldquoIn fact, the title of the book ndash A Quite Impossible Proposal ndash was one of the comments made by one of the chaps in London.The Ullapool-to-Garve railway proposal was the first of what would eventually become half a dozen railway schemes touted for the area during a boom time in Victorian engineering which unlocked areas of Britain which previously would have taken hours of discomfort by carriages and carts to reach.While the prospect of a train to Ullapool might have tourists today regretting decisions of the past, its vision was not built around their needs, but in herring, crofting and poverty.ldquoThe scheme for the Garve-to-Ullapool railway goes back at least  years before it was given Royal Assent in August , he says.ldquoThe crofters and fishermen of Lewis and Skye had been in revolt. Crofters were invading land, taking it back for themselves and the government was sending troops in to sort it out.ldquoIn the early s, the government had become a bit anxious and the Napier Commission was tasked with looking into the social and economic problems around crofting and fishing.Centred on Stornoway, the fishing industryrsquos biggest problem was getting freshly-caught herring to markets in London, Liverpool and Manchester.The idea of switching from steamers to steam trains captured the imagination of Sir John Fowler. Yorkshire-born, he was one of those Victorian masterminds who appeared capable of just about anything.As chief engineer of the politan Railway in London, he created the worldrsquos first underground railway and laid the foundations for routes which today form most of the London Undergroundrsquos Circle Line. In , he was paid handsomely: the equivalent of almost pound million in todayrsquos money, leading to comments that ldquono engineer in the world was so highly paid.The money helped him to buy the sprawling ,-acres Braemore and Inverbroom estate near Ullapool, where, as well as the suspension bridge across Corrieshalloch Gorge, he put his engineering skills to work building Braemore House on a mountainside ft above sea level, from blue-coloured stone retrieved from a nearby quarry.Surelyanyone could oversee the construction of  miles of railway track from Garve to Ullapool it had to be him ldquoThe line from Garve to Ullapool would have had three sections. The first, Garve to Braemore, would have been very straightforward, adds Drummond.ldquoBut at Braemore, therersquos this steep descent to sea level before the final stretch to Ullapool, again fairly straightforward.ldquoThe tricky part was going down the hill.ldquoThere were all manner of exciting ideas involving both the north and south sides of the valley, but both were steep.ldquoThe southside would have used tunnels and viaducts. It would have been a bit like a helter skelter, butI have confidence in anything it would be confidence in Victorian engineers to do anything they wanted.While some huffed and puffed over the challenges of creating the line, others questioned the suitability of Ullapool as a harbour for the ships arriving to transport countless tonnes of herring.ldquoOne inquirysaid Ullapool was beset by rocks and reefs so ships could not possibly get in there, which clearly isnrsquot the case.ldquoBut the really dficult thing wasnrsquot so much the engineering, it was getting the money together and the government did not want to help.Despite ious commissions and committees to probe ways to improve the fortunes of poverty-stricken island and Highland communities, few positive suggestions were taken up and even fewer received funding.If they wanted to push ahead, the proposers of the Ullapool rail link faced funding the pound, project themselves ndash around poundm in todayrsquos money ndash or finding an established railway business willing to take it on.ldquoThe Highland Railway Company virtually had a monopoly in the north and west of Inverness, and they were not keen on competition, adds Drummond.ldquoThey wanted to extend their line from Dingwall to Stromeferry, on to Kyle of Lochalsh. They didnrsquot want any other lines going to the west coast.Yet common sense and geography should have made the Ullapool route the more attractive. ldquoStornoway to Ullapool is  miles at most, but Stornoway to Kyle of Lochalsh is closer to  miles, says Drummond.If financial support was proving challenging, so too was getting everyone on board the Ullapool express.Some simply preferred the Kyle of Lochalsh option, others argued that shting herring stocks made it dficult to predict the best locations for a rail link.ldquoLewis was practically riven down the middle, adds Drummond.Meanwhile, angry letters were exchanged in newspapers from both sides arguing for and against.ldquoThe Act of Parliament of  had a clause thatwork wasnrsquot undertaken within three years, it would be null and void, says Drummond.While the Ullapool backers fumed, the Highland Railway Company pressed ahead with its Kyle of Lochalsh extension. The -mile section of railway took three years to build and opened in  ndash due to the challenging landscape, it did receive government support.ldquoThat was the galling thing. Someone  got some money but the engineering dficulties were just as bad, explains Drummond.Determined not to be beaten, the proposers of the Garve-to-Ullapool railway carried on. There were further attempts to achieve their dream in , ,  and . Of course, none were successful, leaving the question: what might have been ldquoThe railway would have brought not just fishing trade through Ullapool but all the stuff that hangs off that, says Drummond. ldquoThere was the potential for people travelling to and from work, the provision of education, and medical facilities might have been so much better.ldquoAnd, of course, opening up the railway would open up tourism earlier.Dr Iain Robertson of the Centre for History at the University of the Highlands and Islands, agrees the railway could have brought a long-lasting positive impact.ldquoIt would have been a real tourist asset, he says.ldquoJust as therersquos the Glenfinnan Viaduct that has become a huge attraction, the line towards the head of Loch Broom would have been really spectacular.ldquoYou can certainly imagine a steam train rumbling through the glens on its way to Ullapool.Parallels between opposition and debate over the Ullapool line might well be drawn with todayrsquos controversial HS high-speed link between London and the north, he adds.ldquoThe Garve-to-Ullapool line was very, very isive ndash itrsquos a theme that runs through big railway developments wherever you find them. In this case you have a strong crofting culture, the area is allied to the Free Church, and there may be opposition to any attempt to modernise and change.ldquoHerring shoals can come and go without any warning. And basing your economics on an unpredictable species like herring would have been risky.Drummond, meanwhile, believes Ullapool, with its scattering of whitewashed buildings at the end of a long, twisting road, could today easily have been reaping the benefits of a rail link and still retained its charm.Andother railway proposals to open up sections of Lewis and Skye had also materialised, road congestion from too many tourists would certainly not have posed the same issues as they do today.ldquoThe rail extension to Kyle of Lochalsh didnrsquot cause Mallaig to suffer, adds Drummond.ldquoYou can only wonder at what dference a railway to Ullapool might have made.A Quite Impossible Proposal: How Not To Build A Railway by Andrew Drummond will be published in September by Birlinn.What might have been: the lines that were never builtA spate of railway proposals emerged at around the same time which would have transformed the northwest corner of Scotland.Others would have created rail links between communities now booming thanks to the North Coast  road route.One suggested a rail link between Achnasheen in Ross-shire and Aultbea on the shores of Loch Ewe while another proposed a connection on the Far North Line between Lairg in Sutherland with Laxford.A further plan was lodged for a link between Culrain and Lochinver.Meanwhile, the Hebridean Light Railway Company had plans for Skye and Lewis, with routes that would have transformed island le and tourism.It suggested a line in Skye would have connected the port of Isleornsay with ferries at Mallaig, and another at the port of Uig on the northwest to link with ferries to Stornoway.Another line was proposed between Stornoway and Carloway on Lewis, with branch lines at Breasclete and Dunvegan.None, however, would be built.The only one proposed was an extension of the West Highland Line from Banavie near Fort William to Mallaig. This was recently voted the greatest rail journey in the world and includes the iconic Glenfinnan Viaduct which featured in the Harry Potter movies."},{"url":null,"title":"jura-red-wine-cask-finish-review","story":"% ABVRRP pound for a one-litre bottleTHE Isle of Jura ndash a remote, almost desolate place, sat between the mainland and that whisky Shangri-La, Islay.The population is tiny ndash barely  ndash and therersquos only one road of any note.George Orwell lived there, and completed Nineteen Eighty-Four there.

An idea can be worthwhile no matter who supports it. However, it is not an accident that UBI is attractive to tech plutocrats and small state visionaries.To those on the left, UBI seems like an exercise in humane wealth redistribution, and to a certain extent it is. But those on the right see it very dferently: as a means of undermining the big state. Citizenrsquos income becomes a lever against spending policies.In Alaska, the Independent Democrat governor, Bill Walker, recently tried to reduce the PFD in order to improve education funding. Last year he was defeated by the Republican Mike Dunleavy who promised instead to double the UBI, and cut public spending in the state by pound. billion.Public services being sacriced in order to put more free money into peoplesrsquo pockets isnrsquot quite what advocates of UBI envisage. But there is a logic here:peoplersquos incomes are determined exclusively by the state, politics will become about the level of that distribution.Imagine a system in which everyone receives pound, a year, as proposed by the Reform Scotland think tank. Leave aside the increase in taxes required to pay for it. Rich or poor old or young, you get the same chunk of change from HM Government.First off, this is not enough to live on and is the same as the current level of Universal Credit, currently pound a week. It is a mystery to me why this is seen as a boon to humankind. A whole raft of means-tested benefits would have to be added on top, like housing benefit, disability benefit and child benefit.UBI advocates say: well, itrsquos only a start. Anyway, people can top it up with a job. But think of what happens at election time Along comes the Real Income Party of Fiscal Fortitudeled by a charismatic populist who says, like Dunleavy in Alaska: ldquoThis isnrsquot a universal income itrsquos universal poverty. Vote for me and Irsquoll double it.Since taxes will already be sky high to pay for UBI phase one, he or she will promise to pay by making the state more ldquoefficient. Get rid of bureaucrats. Cut waste. End subsidies. Get rid of immigrants trying to grab our money.This populist aspect of UBI hasnrsquot been considered because most of the existing UBI experiments are not UBI. In Finland, , long-term unemployed were given euro a month for two years subject to a means test. The results were indferent, though most of the recipients said they felt better. But this was not UBI, which is meant to be given to everyone, working or not.Spain is about to introduce another non-UBI. The Socialist-Podemos government is planning a non-contributory cash payment of around euro, a month restricted to families who fall out of the existing means-tested social safety net.Neither the Spanish nor the Finnish scheme is inidual, unconditional or universal, the three key criteria for UBI. Politicians hailing these schemes, like Labourrsquos Rebecca Long-Bailey, appear to be unaware of this.Other schemes exist in the developing world. The biggest, in Kenya covering , villagers and paid for by the US charity GiveDirectly, has been under way since . It has been praised for not constituting a disincentive to work. But since the UBI there is only  dollars a month, that is perhaps not surprising.Any UBI worth the name in a country like the UK would have to be set at something close to average wages. Otherwise, what is the point  I simply donrsquot see the sense in offering people a UBI at the same poverty level as Universal Credit.And to give a living UBI to everyone, wealthy included, and then tax everyone massively to pay for it, seems to be a perverse form of redistribution.UBI is addressing a serious issue. Think tanks claim that automation will kill a third of all routine jobs. Capitalism doesnrsquot need big workforces any more because it has evolved beyond industrialisation.But UBI is not the way. The benefits of automation should be spread by taxation, shorter hours and higher pay, not by creating a society of serfs living on a miserable stipend.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

However, it is not an accident that UBI is attractive to tech plutocrats and small state visionaries.To those on the left, UBI seems like an exercise in humane wealth redistribution, and to a certain extent it is. But those on the right see it very dferently: as a means of undermining the big state. Citizenrsquos income becomes a lever against spending policies.In Alaska, the Independent Democrat governor, Bill Walker, recently tried to reduce the PFD in order to improve education funding. Last year he was defeated by the Republican Mike Dunleavy who promised instead to double the UBI, and cut public spending in the state by pound. billion.Public services being sacriced in order to put more free money into peoplesrsquo pockets isnrsquot quite what advocates of UBI envisage. But there is a logic here:peoplersquos incomes are determined exclusively by the state, politics will become about the level of that distribution.Imagine a system in which everyone receives pound, a year, as proposed by the Reform Scotland think tank. Leave aside the increase in taxes required to pay for it. Rich or poor old or young, you get the same chunk of change from HM Government.First off, this is not enough to live on and is the same as the current level of Universal Credit, currently pound a week. It is a mystery to me why this is seen as a boon to humankind. A whole raft of means-tested benefits would have to be added on top, like housing benefit, disability benefit and child benefit.UBI advocates say: well, itrsquos only a start. Anyway, people can top it up with a job. But think of what happens at election time Along comes the Real Income Party of Fiscal Fortitudeled by a charismatic populist who says, like Dunleavy in Alaska: ldquoThis isnrsquot a universal income itrsquos universal poverty. Vote for me and Irsquoll double it.Since taxes will already be sky high to pay for UBI phase one, he or she will promise to pay by making the state more ldquoefficient. Get rid of bureaucrats. Cut waste. End subsidies. Get rid of immigrants trying to grab our money.This populist aspect of UBI hasnrsquot been considered because most of the existing UBI experiments are not UBI. In Finland, , long-term unemployed were given euro a month for two years subject to a means test. The results were indferent, though most of the recipients said they felt better. But this was not UBI, which is meant to be given to everyone, working or not.Spain is about to introduce another non-UBI. The Socialist-Podemos government is planning a non-contributory cash payment of around euro, a month restricted to families who fall out of the existing means-tested social safety net.Neither the Spanish nor the Finnish scheme is inidual, unconditional or universal, the three key criteria for UBI. Politicians hailing these schemes, like Labourrsquos Rebecca Long-Bailey, appear to be unaware of this.Other schemes exist in the developing world. The biggest, in Kenya covering , villagers and paid for by the US charity GiveDirectly, has been under way since . It has been praised for not constituting a disincentive to work. But since the UBI there is only  dollars a month, that is perhaps not surprising.Any UBI worth the name in a country like the UK would have to be set at something close to average wages. Otherwise, what is the point  I simply donrsquot see the sense in offering people a UBI at the same poverty level as Universal Credit.And to give a living UBI to everyone, wealthy included, and then tax everyone massively to pay for it, seems to be a perverse form of redistribution.UBI is addressing a serious issue. Think tanks claim that automation will kill a third of all routine jobs. Capitalism doesnrsquot need big workforces any more because it has evolved beyond industrialisation.But UBI is not the way. The benefits of automation should be spread by taxation, shorter hours and higher pay, not by creating a society of serfs living on a miserable stipend.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

A shop assistant was palpably distressed as she told me she couldnrsquot go with her pregnant daughter for her scan, or see the twins she usually collects twice a week from school. One of my friends had booked to fly to Australia to be with her daughter when her baby ndash the first grandchild ndash arrived. Instead, she is stranded thousands of miles away, anxiously watching the calendar, and knitting, knitting, knitting.Itrsquos no surprise that the likes of Zoom and Facetime have become emotional le-rafts, with everyone rushing to climb aboard. Earlier this week, my sister was making granola with an eight-year-old, an hourrsquos drive away in Glasgow. With four of her grandsons in one household, portal sessions can be chaotic. The two-year-old usually makes an appearance only at the bottom of the screen, detected by a tuft of blond hair moving at speed beyond reach.If you could see the profiles of those using this technology, yoursquod find it flooded with retirees, desperate for a glimpse of their families and their youngest. It might be a poor substitute for a hug, but most would agree that online chats are better than nothing. Children grow so swtly, time-lapse photography would make you giddy. They shoot up faster than Leylandii, and learn new words every day. My great-nephewrsquos favourite just now is ldquodisgusting. He applies this to his motherrsquos cooking.Half the older population is probably, like me, filling their devices with adorable pictures, and frantically upgrading their cloud storage to contain it all. It makes me wonder, did my grandparents delight in photos of my siblings and me  Irsquoll never know. Thinking of them is like going back to another place and time ndash which is where, as Edwardian Londoners, they came from. When I was a girl, most folk were considered decrepit at . And often they were, worn out from work and hardship. Reaching retirement was the time for pipe and slippers rather than bungee jumping or skying. The grandchildren who visited once a week, or month, or at Christmas, were patted on the head, spoken to in a loud voice, and indulged with sweets. When it was time to leave, there was rarely any protest.I used to envy school friends whose aged relatives were closely involved with their lives. Today, that closeness is taken for granted, as the older folks work a rota, caring for youngsters after school or during holidays, while their parents work.It is one of the loveliest rapports to observe. In a culture that puts a lot of pressure on the young, to do well at school or university, to look good and be popular, the advice and companionship of those who have seen it all, and take a relaxed view, is invaluable. Therersquos much hand-wringing about the state of modern society, with fractured or dysal families causing heartache and instability. Not much is said, however, of the role grandparents play in holding things together and nurturing those on the first and most precarious rungs of le.Adjectives that can be applied to most working mothers and fathers include irritable, harassed and exhausted. Those over , especially once their careers have ended, have shot those rapids and are in calmer waters. Grandchildren instinctively recognise that theyrsquoll find in them a champion who puts them first, whether itrsquos as a bulwark against strict rules and nagging, or simply someone who isnrsquot always watching the clock. Time and patience are the most important gt a grandparent has to give: to play, read, go for a walk, watch a film, or take a child to football practice and roar encouragement from the sidelines. It doesnrsquot really matter what they actually do together, simply having someonersquos attention for a few hours is priceless. And for granddads especially, I suspect, itrsquos a chance to offer something they had in too short supply when they were raising their own brood.In terms of the family machine, therersquos never been a time when this ageing cohort has been more crucial to its smooth running. With most parents working within a year or two of a childrsquos birth, the period when offspring need to be collected from nursery, or be cared for after school or out of term-time, has signicantly expanded. Only recently have economists begun to calculate the worth of this unpaid army of nannies, chauffeurs, shuttlers, carers, cooks, cleaners and counsellors.It wonrsquot surprise anyone who falls into this group to learn that the hidden price of childcare on the national balance sheet is huge. One analysis in  estimated that, on average, such help annually saves a family pound. Thatrsquos pound billion across the UK. Few grandparents would ever see their contribution in pounds and pence, even those who are far from well-off themselves. Yet it is implicitly understood that without their help, countless thousands of households would struggle to hold down their jobs and make ends meet.The ongoing effect of Covid  on contact between generations could be profound. As the world s to work, many grandparents will be obliged to watch on, from relative isolation, for who knows how much longer But for most who are in this predicament, itrsquos not the maths thatrsquos worrying them. It is the absence of physical contact: fingers sticky with chocolate, displays of cartwheels and bunny jumps, revision schedules more complicated than a ScotRail timetable. And it is a two-way loss, children missing out as much as they do. The loving web that binds young and old is usually invisible, and passes largely unnoticed. Yet, as wersquoll soon see, itrsquos a crucial network that keeps the country running.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

What happened was that, during a News at Ten programme, Ms Smith said Nicola Sturgeon had ldquoenjoyed the opportunity to set out her own lockdown rules and not have to follow whatrsquos happening in England and other parts of the UK.But the First Minister took umbrage at this. ldquoNever in my entire political career have I lsquoenjoyedrsquo anything less than this, she said. ldquoMy heart breaks every day for all those who have lost loved ones to this virus. Which prompted Ms Smith to try to clary things: ldquoI had meant to say hellip she has lsquoembracedrsquo the opportunity to make a policy unique to Scotland. I said enjoyedrsquo by mistake.Now, I have no idea what Ms Smithrsquos political opinions are, but there are a few things worth saying about the original news report and the First Ministerrsquos response to it because they reveal quite a bit about the BBC, the SNP, and the relationship between politics and journalism.First, the news report. The problem with reports of this kind in which broadcasters are asked to analyse the dayrsquos events is that theyrsquore trying to do an almost impossible job: analyse whatrsquos going on while appearing to be totally factual and unbiased: in other words, express an opinion without appearing to express an opinion.But the premise is flawed. Sarah Smith. Me. You. We are not unbiased. As soon as a journalist decides to cover one story or another ndash or use one word or another ndash they are being influenced by unconscious bias. Ms Smith was also self-evidently not giving us untainted facts, she was expressing an opinion and it would helpthe BBC used the right word for it ndash opinion ndash and stopped acting, in its rather hoighty-toighty way, like itrsquos completely unbiased. It isnrsquot: it seeks to control bias, which is a totally dferent thing.But as well as defending Sarah Smith, Irsquod also like to make an appeal to the First Minister here, because her response leaves a lot to be desired. First, her tweet was doing a thing that journalists get a lot: responding with how-dare-you horror to something you havenrsquot actually said. Ms Smith was suggesting the First Minister was enjoying, or embracing, the political elements of the crisis, not the personal consequences for the victims, and it was unfair of Ms Sturgeon to suggest otherwise with talk of loved ones and broken hearts.Ms Sturgeon also needs to be careful about the pot she stirs. I was talking to a colleague recently who told me that hersquod been seeing a therapist because of the vilication and mockery hersquod received from SNP supporters, including ministers, and the effect that it had on his self-confidence. You might say: \"If you dish it out, you gotta take it\", but all I would say to senior SNP politicians, including the First Minister, is: before you single out a journalist, take a look behind you at the snarly hordes you are about to unleash and encourage.The other problem with tweets like the First Ministerrsquos is that they encourage something  thatrsquos troubling: a belief among some of her supporters that the BBC is institutionally anti-independence. The BBC is like any other large organisation in Scotland: there are people in it who believe in independence and there are people who donrsquot, and it does at least have rules that seek impartiality. But, in tweet after tweet, its critics accuse it of being anti-independence and the result is what psychologists call an availability cascade: a belief that grows because of the number of people saying it.The cascade also has another curious effect. SNP supporters who believe the BBC is biased against independence have boycotted its coverage. For them, this preserves the cascade, but the problem for the BBC is that other viewers ndash unionists, left-wingers, right-wingers ndash are doing the same thing for dferent reasons.Which leads us back to poor Sarah Smith standing there with a microphone trying to navigate it all and appear neutral. What shersquos saying to us is: ldquoTrust me, Irsquom a journalist ndash a neutral, unbiased BBC journalist. But perhaps the BBC could be more honest about whatrsquos really going on: she is expressing an opinion. And perhaps, when she hears the opinion, the First Minister could try to be a little less touchy.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

lting restrictions, with some rules likely to be loosened within days of the next formal lockdown review on May .Initial steps are expected to include allowing golf and fishing, opening garden centres

The start date of the new term will bestandardisedto  August  only for the purposes of managing Covid-, which will mean an earlier than planned start for some schools.:Coronavirus: Tories claim public has no confidence in Health Secretary over care homes figuresAnnouncingthe route map in Holyrood,MsSturgeon said: ldquoDuring June and over the summer, an increased number of children will have access to critical childcare - such as has been provided for the children of key workers during lockdown.ldquoWe will provide, where possible, transition support for children going into primary  or moving from primary  to secondary school.ldquoFrom  August, all schools will re-open. However, to allow appropriate physical distancing, children willto a blended model of part time in-school and part time at-home learning.ldquoThesearrangementswill not represent a completeto normality by August. But we judge them to be the most sensible approach we can plan for at this stage.Union leaders have warned that drawing up blending learning plans will be challenging for teaching staff.EIS general secretary Larry Flanagan said: \"The Covid- crisis has had a signicant impact on schools, pupils and teachers over the past months.\"Our members will welcome the clarity provided by the First Ministers announcement today, and the clear statement that schools will not re-open until after the summer and onlyhealth conditions allow.\"This will provide valuable time to allow schools to prepare for what will be a very dferent learning environment, with physical distancing requiring smaller class sizes and schools delivering a blended approach of part time in-school learning and part time remote learning for most pupils.\"He added: \"The EIS has worked constructively with the Scottish Government and with local authorities throughout this crisis and will continue to do so in the best interests of learners and teachers.\"There is a strong shared commitment to protecting the health and wellbeing of everyone in the school community. Delivering a new blended learning approach is potentially the biggest curriculum challenge of this century, however, and it will require signicant commitment from all parties to make it work.\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"May ,  at : pmStay at homewill be the message to Scotland residents, as lockdown restrictions begin to relax from next Thursday, May .

The Orcadian is awaiting clarication on how this will be put into practice in Orkney.Speaking about the enhancement of key worker testing, NHSO chief executive designate, Iain Stewart said: “Testing will be undertaken at the COVID- Assessment Centre with results being available within hours rather than days.#Currently our laboratory continues to provide a clinical service and the health board is confident at this time that demand for COVID- testing can be met and will be managed daily. However, it may be necessary on occasions to prioritise other cohorts such as those in Group One when demand for testing exceeds capacity”.   If you are a key worker, and you or a family member is symptomatic of COVID- — a fever or a new and persistent cough for more than half a day, or a change in your sense of taste or smell — you may be eligible for COVID- testing. You can see the full list of keyworkers and their priority categories in Scotland by clicking here.Sara Lewis, consultant in public health at NHS Orkney added: “The testing process will not include a health assessment. It is recommended thatyou are displaying symptoms of COVID- you should visit the NHS Inform website in the first instance or contact NHSto seeyour symptoms are consistent with COVID- infection“If NHS advise symptoms are consistent with COVID- and home isolation is required you should contact your employer to obtain a copy of the testing referral form. A copy of the form can  be requested by visiting NHS Orkney’s website or emailing HighlandIslandMailKirkwall@scotland.pnn.police.uk ”.“Completed testing forms should be emailed from an employee’s line manager or human resources deparment representative, where available, but in any case providing verication that they’re absence from work, on account of self-isolating, is preventing their respective organisation from operating and providing an essential service in Orkney. #Forms should be emailed to the gateway address of HighlandIslandMailKirkwall@scotland.pnn.police.uk which is co-ordinating the testing service on behalf of Orkney Local Emergency Co-ordinating Groupwith the exception of Orkney Islands Council employees or health and social care workers who should continue to access COVID- testing through the process currently in place.“On receipt of the referral the testing centre will contact you or your household member to offer an invite for testing. Test results should be available on the same day as testing, iniduals will be contacted by the COVID- Assessment Centre who will confirm the test results with the inidual and their employer. Test results of household members will be anonymised in line with Scottish Government guidance.“Any iniduals found to have a positive COVID- test result this will be reported to their line manager, their GP and NHS Orkney’s Public Health Department for follow up”OLECG chairman, Chief Inspector Matt Webb said: “We would like to thank all the keyworkers who continue to work so hard to ensure services continue, enabling us to safeguard and protect the residents of Orkney.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

HIAL#s modernisation plans would see air traffic control operations at a five airports, including Kirkwall Airport, centralised to a control centre in Inverness, using remote tower technology.Speaking last week, councillor Graham Sinclair, chairman of OIC#s Development and Infrastructure Committee, said:“We need to fully understand the impact on our community before any decision is made to create a remote air traffic control centre in Inverness.”“So it is disappointing that the government and HIAL have disregarded a call by this council, and others, for them to undertake an Islands Impact Assessment before by moving ahead with their plans.“We asked for this earlier in the year and expected the assessment to be completed before HIAL began to undertake a procurement process.”Councillor Sinclair added: “An immense amount of work was undertaken before the passing of the IslandsAct to ensure that Islands Impact Assessments would be carried out to give communities like ours a say when major changes such as this are proposed.“This appears to have been ignored on this occasion, which is why we are asking for the process to be paused until an assessment is undertaken.”HIAL#s position is that impact assessment is being carried out. Spokesman said: “An island impact assessment is currently underway and is being undertaken by an independent consultant. This will include consultation with local authorities and community groups. It is anticipated that the process will be completed and a draft report produced by June .“While every endeavour will be made to maintain this timescale [for the IIA], we acknowledge that the current restrictions and physical distancing requirements may require this timeline to be extended.”“Procuring remote tower technology is part of the next phase of our ATMS Programme. This technology will help deliver sustainable aviation connectivity and deliver a flexible, resilient air traffic service that will be highly adaptable as we ensure our airports are fit for the future.“The procurement process for such tenders is a y process We anticipate that the process to procure the remote tower technology solution will be completed by December  January .“We have reviewed our capital programme to allow us to implement key projects, and have other projects shelf-ready for when we are able toto some semblance of normality.

In Orkney, this currently stands at two and seven respectively.However, the Scottish Government and NHS Orkney have refused so far to confirm the number of people in each area that have been tested, partly on the basis of concerns around patient confidentiality.Mr McArthur said: “In the absence of a vaccine, any move away from lockdown needs to be backed up by a reliable regime of testing and tracing. We need to keep the virus in sight, so we can properly manage the risk.“If there are any issues in getting this set up, local areas need to know so that those problems can be raised and then fixed.“That is why it is essential that Ministers are as transparent as possible.  Being up front about the amount of testing taking place at a local health board level is a key part of achieving that transparency, keeping people informed and building public confidence.“Without knowing the extent of testing in Orkney, it is dficult to know what to make of the relatively low numbers of confirmed cases of COVID. That is a point I have been reinforcing with Scottish Ministers and NHS Orkney over recent weeks.“The First Minister has called for a ‘grown up’ conversation about how we take the dficult decisions in easing lockdown restrictions.  Grown up conversations, however, are founded on transparency and honesty. That is why we need to see detailed figures on a localised basis.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We are having to limit the recycling collections to single green bins each week.#So we would ask people to remain patient and,they cannot fit all their weekly items in a single bin, to continue storing some for future collections.”Green recycling bins and boxes should be put out on your usual bin day. You should remove the caddies inside — and the items for collection should be included in your single green bin or box as the council will be unable to pick up more than one at a time.Grey bincollections for household waste will continue on a fortnightly basis — again on your usual collection day.Councillor Drever added: “We’ve tried to make the arrangements as straight forward as possible.“You’ll be putting a green bin or box out weekly — and a grey bin or red bags once a fortnight. The thing to remember is to do this on the day of the week when your bins would normally be collected.“We will be using a mix of waste and recycling vehicles to help us clear the backlog, with all materials collected to be sent for recycling.”The recycling collections will take place as follows:Meanwhile, the council is currently developing plans for the partial re-opening of some Household Waste Recycling Centres in June, in line with the recent announcement by the local government organisation, COSLA, and subject to further guidance from the Scottish Government.The possibility of resuming recycling collections in Westray and Shapinsay and re-opening isles recycling points is also being looked at.More information will be provided soon.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now, why does not Nicola change the dictate for Shetland  We would love to sunbath also, between the snow showers!!!!!😂😂😂😂How fortunate that the Scottish, Welsh and Irish leaders are maintaining their more sensible , balanced and wary approaches .Enlighten us Haydn, why is the infection rate lowerin England than in Wales and Scotland  I for one am not the least confused by the messages, just what is confusing you She niver agrees wIth what the rest off the UK IS DOINGBruce, you make it look asNicola, is acting like a Tory##..The Tory policy being##..me, me, me and melolSince you appear to not know, there has been confusion in Britain today about the actual meaning of BoJo’s statement yesterdayand , as I write, he is trying to explain himself away on TV. THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place. Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .On that basis I think we need Nicola Sturgeon down here in England as well!Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful. In all probability Ian will not strike gold but how thankful we would behe did !!Fake news  Trump tried to buy Moussa and replace the old stone buildingswith a shiny new tower and Miss Sturgeon will use the proceeds to building a border wall.The deal came unstuck when China claimed Shetland as part of its North Sea and Atlantic territorial waters. It is understood that Miss Sturgeon has been learning Madrin while Scotlandis locked upOwen Jones has denied that he supports Identity politics, woke culture and he is not a social justice warrior.CNNhires Greta Thunberg to appear on a  as an expert on Covid .Best not to bother with why UK has biggest obesity problem in Europe.

This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .So in summary, the gospel according to Ian Tinkler is that BoJo the clown hasn#t put his size  feet in it at all as the death rate is higher in Scotland than in England.Ian, I think your calculations are the wrong way round and show what you might call a #survival ratio# rather than a death ratio. There#s also a decimal place error but for the purposes of comparison that doesn#t really matter.If you work it out in deaths per million of population you can see that Scotland has a lower death rate.England:  from      per mPlease do not put words in my mouth Robbie. What is happening in Scotland is down to The SG and Nicola, as theFM and former Health Secretary. Trying to make political capital out of people dying is morally reprehensible, obnoxious and malign. Bo-Jo and Nicola have equal responsibility for any mistakes, they both shared and followed the best science they could. For once they were in harmony and agreement. The NHS was not overwhelmed, lives were saved, be thankful for that. Fortunately, the injection of disinfectant, we will leave to a real clown who is now mainlining hydroxychloroquine!!! Perhaps Darwinism will step in soon! God save America.Oh this is too funny to pass by! Mr Tinkler creates his own, entirely , Coronavirusfigures to make a political point and is immediately shot down. He then states that only an idiot would try to use coronavirus figures to make political points. Well, on that we totally agree # only an idiot would.The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place. However the critical site for immunity is probably conserved.So, the death ratio in Scotland from Covid , according to the self-proclaimed STE expert is .. That, I believe, is patently incorrect, not to mention entirely absurd, and would mean that . people from  person had died from the disease. As an analogy, based on a notional teeth count,someone had, let’s say, ten teeth and subsequently had one removed then the ratio of teeth removed to those not having been removed would be  , or %.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"general manager at streamline ","story":"We have an exciting opportunity for a self-motivated and results-driven General Manager to join our Operations team at our Lerwick Depot.

With these, on Friday th May, pupils took part in three virtual quizzes, via Google Meet, one each for nursery, P- and P-.During the summer term at school, the pupils would normally take part in a fundraising event.Teachers linked this with the quiz and asked for a donation to charity in order to take part.

Others were and remain in the accountable control of local government.Even when the larger British utilities were privatised during the s and s, which was the equivalent of the Conservative Party giving its friends in big business a licence to print money, their unique importance was recognised by the simultaneous establishment of independent watchdogs such as Ofgem and Ofcom # the second of which has, through the telephone network, a vague and ill-defined authority over the internet.That vagueness should be claried that definition should be made in no uncertain terms.Nobody made the internet an essential utility.It has become one by popular consensus.Now that it is no longer a recreational luxury, but a basic necessity for any full member of our st century society, it must be made affordable and properly accessible in every corner of the land.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3121081.jpg--.jpg?1589361498000\n","title":"pipe band pays tribute to chairman","story":"Broughshane  District Pipe band are deeply saddened at the sudden death of their esteemed chairman and friend Robert Montgomery.

Duane Farrell, CEO of relationship counselling service Relate NI, has said anxieties around money, childcare and living space are all putting stress on couples and households as lockdown continues. He said as traditional forms of support for households, such as receiving health visitors, fall away, families are looking for support for their relationships. Speaking to the BelfastCoronavirus podcast, he said: Our relationships are an essential part of our health and our wellbeing at this time, and sometimes when there are challenges, that can also affect our health and wellbeing. It#s a perfect storm that households are experiencing at the moment - increases in worries about finances as people are furloughed or let go from their jobs, really close proximity, people will have a whole host of things that take up their week and they have all disappeared.It#s led to people relying much more on other family members for support - which can sometimes expose cracks in relationships, he said.

Any existing tensions that there are in a relationship are being brought sharply into focus during lockdown in these last two months, even where relationships have previously been really strong. There are new challenges being faced because of the pressure people are under. Tensions will be exacerbated but even stronger relationships will face tests.Mr Farrell said couples and families are advised by Relate NI to keep lines of communication open.

Take time to check in with one another on a regular basis, especially when we#re feeling stressed or anxious. Taking that time out to communicate clearly and family members listening and responding as much as possible, he said. Parents are facing additional challenges such as facilitating school work for their children, he said. One of the particular stresses we face is on our own mental health, trying to do so many things - becoming a teacher, trying to work from home, becoming a teacherthat#s your story.

You#re trying to take out those opportunities for conflict. Perhaps the dining room table is used by children in the morning for school work and it#s used by mum and dad for other things in the afternoon.The PSNI have reported an increase in incidents of domestic violence in recent weeks. Mr Farrell appealed to those victims to ask for help. It#s important to say the police, Women#s Aid, the Domestic Sexual Violence helpline are there to support people in that situation. being locked down in people#s homes, it#s not necessarily a safe place for everybody. It#s important to reach out and know that there are services out there to support them.When asked whether there has been an increase in couples contacting Relate NI who are hoping to separate, he said while he hasn#t heard of an increase, there is a possibility that will happen post-lockdown. It#s something we#ve seen particularly in China where there#s been a spike in requests for orce, there#s a risk something similar will happen here, he said. Victims of domestic abuse can contact police on the non-emergency  number or  in an emergency.

Credit:Steve Parsons PA WirePA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappA person on the NHS coronavirus contact tracing app, which Isle of Wight residents have been trialling. Credit:Steve Parsons PA WireMark BainTwitterEmailMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA contact tracing programme involving all confirmed positive cases of Covid- has started in Northern Ireland.The region has become the first of the four devolved nations to launch the plan, with all new positive cases now being traced.Finding all the people someone has been in contact with once they have tested positive for Covid- is seen as a key part in preventing the spread of the disease, according to the Public Health Agency .“This is another example of the herculean work right across the HSC system to fight back against Covid- and keep people safe,” said Health Minister Robin Swann.“The battle against the virus is a long-term challenge and contact tracing will have a very important role as part of that.”Dr Jackie Hyland, Consultant in Health Protection at the PHA, said contact tracing at this stage involves new ways of working given the scale and the fact that new evidence is continually emerging about the illness.“We have teamed up with colleagues in the university sector and Health and Social Care Trusts to put in place all the necessary logistics,” he said.“We are now rolling out contact tracing further and working with the public to support people who may have been exposed so they can get tested and self-isolate to help prevent spread of infection.“We are progressing our plans for scaling up the second phase of the Northern Ireland contact tracing service, informed by the learning from the current pilot programme. This work involves testing all aspects of the programme.“From May  we have been undertaking contact tracing for all confirmed positive cases of Covid-.“Testing is also now available to everyone in Northern Ireland aged over five with symptoms, which will form an important part of the contact tracing programme.“The number of staff currently required changes each day in line with workload, but we have sufficient staff trained and available to manage contact tracing and meet demand.”The Department of Health is also taking forward work around digital solutions that can support the wider contact tracing programme when it goes live.The land border with the Republic of Ireland is an important factor in the spread of infectious diseases and therefore contact tracing.There are well-established systems in place to work with colleagues in the Republic on contact tracing and management of infectious diseases, and the health service is working at pace to develop new, more efficient ways of working collaboratively to reduce the spread of Covid-, and help protect cross-border travellers.For now contact tracing is being carried out exclusively by telephone and in a similar manner to the method used at beginning of the pandemic.“Our very first case was an inidual who landed in Dublin Airport then travelled to Northern Ireland back to their home and we saw the Public Health Agency and the Health Service Executive actually working together to do that contact tracing, so we’re taking that approach to begin with,” the Health Minister said.Mr Swann said he had spoken to his counterpart in the Republic, Simon Harris, on Tuesday morning regarding the development of a contact tracing app and he was also monitoring progress on digital technology within the NHS.“We’re still looking to see which will be the best fit for Northern Ireland,” he said, adding that two apps could be used in Northern Ireland until a bespoke app could be created.He had previously said that his preference would be for a single app which would work across the British Isles, butdferent apps were used they would be compatible.Contact tracing was suspended in Northern Ireland in mid-March. A pilot programme resumed on April  and Mr Swann said he expected the contact tracing service to be in place “for the next year at a minimum”.The Executive, guided by health experts, now believes the focus on contact tracing can help limit any impact of a second wave of Covid-.On Tuesday evening, a virtual meeting to discuss the ongoing response to coronavirus on both sides of the border took place between Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis, the First and Deputy First Ministers Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill, Tanaiste Simon Coveney and the two health ministers.In a joint statement, Mr Coveney and Mr Lewis said they discussed the respective plans for emerging from lockdown “given the importance of implementing consistent approaches wherever possible and strong collaborative arrangements”.“Strong data-sharing arrangements North South would be a necessary part of the easing of restrictions,” they said.What is contact tracing Contact tracing aims to identy and alert people who have come into contact with a person infected with coronavirus.The process starts with someone who has been tested positive for Covid- being asked to list all the people they’ve recently been in prolonged contact with.A contact tracing team member will then phone these contacts and talk to them about their risk of infection. Everyone who has the infection and who is a close contact will have to self-isolate. To be successful in contact tracing people need to provide their phone number when they get a test.Why is it important Contact tracing has been credited with helping to lt restrictions in other countries, like South Korea, when combined with stringent testing measures.The most important element is speed.The five-stage process — sampling, testing, communication to a positive case, contact tracing and contact quarantine — all needs to be done in a -hour window to be effective in preventing spread.Why was it halted Contact tracing was halted by the UK government on March , though that proved to be a controversial move as many experts believed it was key to slowing the spread of the virus. The government was subsequently accused of not having the capacity to run it effectively.On April  the Department of Health in Northern Ireland restarted an ‘enhanced contact tracing pilot’, which, it says, is now operating five days a week. It’s felt by the Executive that it could prove crucial in limiting the impact of any second wave of coronavirus.That service is set to be expanded to operate over seven days soon.How does it operate in Northern Ireland For now, Northern Ireland is relying on telephone contact, but the speed of the process should increase dramaticallya mobile phone app becomes available.The process is off to a slow start and on May  the Health Minister said  staff were trained and working on contact tracing. On that date there were said to be  more tracers in training with a further  volunteers having come forward to join the list.In April Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride had said he estimated  to  staff would be needed for contact tracing to work efficiently.Is a contact tracing app likely to be used The development of an app to speed up the process of contact tracing is seen as key to maximising the impact of the scheme, but that has raised questions over whether Northern Ireland should be involved with the UK or on an all-Ireland basis.At the moment the UK and Irish governments are working on separate apps, but Health Minister Robin Swann said no decision has yet been made on the best way to proceed.The app would be able to identy people the patient may not know — like fellow passengers they have been in contact with on public transport or in supermarkets.But there have been concerns about privacy, particularly in Northern Ireland where security workers who may be reluctant to use it over fears their personal details could be compromised.Should contact tracing be organised on an all-Ireland basis Addressing media earlier this week, the Health Minister insisted there needed to be “a clarity of message”.And while a single app that works across both the UK and the Republic of Ireland would be the best solution for Northern Ireland, the logistics of that are proving problematic. Northern Ireland might have to settle for a compromise,it can be agreed, that would see UK app compatible with one in the Republic, arranged as part of the memorandum of understanding between authorities north and south of the border.Since Ireland is one geographical area, andcontact tracing is to be a long term project, then it makes sense to have an all-island approach.Is this likely to be a long term project The NI Executive has maintained that contact tracing is a crucial component for ending the lockdown, and that wider surveillance of the virus in the community is necessary.The system is expected to be in place for at least a year, possibly longer.

We want to know.Janet Hetherington , who lives in the Waterside area of Londonderry with her husband David and son Andrew, says she fell ill following the death of her friend from a mystery virus.A friend of mine died of an unknown virus at the start of January, she says. I started feeling very unwell at her funeral. I was coughing and coughing. A few days later I couldn#t move. I was so exhausted, I was totally wiped out and had to sleep all the time. The fatigue was like nothing I#ve ever had before, it was unreal. I would go for a shower and have to lie down afterwards. It took so much out of me Janet HetheringtonI couldn#t stop coughing. I tried every single cough medicine but nothing would help this hacking cough. I couldn#t sleep for coughing and that just added to the exhaustion. I was ill for about six weeks, right until the end of February. Every time I thought I was coming around, it would hit me again. I couldn#t taste anything and I wasn#t interested in food at all.The fatigue was like nothing I#ve ever had before, it was unreal. I would go for a shower and have to lie down afterwards. It took so much out of me. It was a horrendous experience. I went to the doctor and he said that there was something awful going around. I#m in a choir and I had been talking to some of the other members who said that there were a lot of people complaining about the same symptoms. One of the ladies said that it took seven weeks for her to recover.North Belfast IT consultant Vivian Fergusonis convinced he had the virus before Christmas. I started a new job in the first week of December, he says. In the second week of December I developed a headache and lost my sense of taste and smell. I went completely off food. The pain in my head got far worse over the next few days. It was a crazy pain that paracetamol wouldn#t even budge. I also had a bad dry cough.I remember getting a fever. I just had to stay in bed. Throughout it all the headache didn#t go away at all. It stayed strong. I was in bed for around six days, completely floored. It was only after that time that my headache shted. It took weeks for the cough to go away. Half of my office was also sick with the same symptoms.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseVivian Ferguson FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappVivian FergusonI have had nothing like that ever before. The headache was unreal. When it started coming on the news about the coronavirus and there was a list of the symptoms, it made me think. I#m convinced that it was coronavirus. I#ve never been as sick.Though many people are convinced they may have had coronavirus, medical experts disagree. Dr Tom Black, chair of the British Medical Associationand a GP in Londonderry, says he is convinced that the bug making people sick before Christmas was a dferent virus.My view would be consistent with the prevalent view that we wouldn#t have seen Covid in December and January, but we saw other viral illnesses that could have been mistaken for it Dr Tom Black, British Medical AssociationThere certainly was a viral illness in December and January, he says. But it wouldn#t have been consistent with what we then found with the Covid virus. From a patient#s point of view you would have got a sore throat, a temperature, felt unwell, some vomiting and diarrhoea as well. So I suppose there are some similarities but that is because they are both viral illnesses. We certainly didn#t see the level of very severe respiratory symptoms that we then saw with Covid.My view would be consistent with the prevalent view that we wouldn#t have seen Covid in December and January, but we saw other viral illnesses that could have been mistaken for it.Dr Black says that he disagrees with suggestions that December#s widespread illness was in fact the first wave of coronavirus and that we have just left the deadly second wave.Our microbiology colleagues are very clear about when the infection came and when they were able to pick it up on their very accurate tests, he says. I think we are still in the first wave. The severity of Covid was markedly dferent from a standard flu. It is a much more severe illness in a minority and we didn#t see those patients until we were in the pandemic.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr Tom Black, chair of the BMA in Northern Ireland FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr Tom Black, chair of the BMA in Northern IrelandAnd Dr Black says, although there are less patients presenting to our hospitals, the virus is still out there. We have fewer cases appearing into general practice. We have fewer cases coming into the Covid centres that the GPs man and we have fewer cases in hospital and in ICU. So in all four areas we have reduced numbers of cases, he says. It#s not gone yet, it#s still endemic in the community. There seems to be a concentration in two places - in care homes and among health care workers. So we are going to have start increasing our testing of patients and staff in care homes, which has been announced by the minister. And we are going to have to increase our testing among health care workers.As for how many of us might have acquired herd immunity, Dr Black also estimates the numbers are still very low, saying that just % of the Northern Irish population might have had the virus already.

In labs around the globe they are racing against time in a frantic bid to create a Covid- vaccine ­- seen as the key to vanquishing the virus and setting society on the road back to normality.The world is waiting, hoping, expecting, but it is a pressure to deliver that weighs heavily on the shoulders of the scientic world.It is said the best way to tackle an enemy is to understand how that enemy operates, and that is why understanding the nature of Covid- is vital.There is still a lot more to find out .. This is still a new virus as it#s only been around for a few months. The problem is, this is still a very new virus, said Dr Ultan Power, professor in molecular virology at Queen#s University.We have learnt so much about it in such a short space of time, it#s quite remarkable. But there#s still a lot more to find out.We know the virus does not have the ability to mutate in the way influenza changes. It#s not as dramatic as that, but this is still a new virus as it#s only been around for a few months. We still don#t know what it will look like in one or two years# time. That#s an issue to begin with.The simplest way to imagine Covid- is as a tiny tennis ball with #spikes# around the surface, which are formed by proteins.Those spikes interact with another protein on the surface of the human cell called the ACE  Receptor.The spikes help the virus to roll along the cell until it comes across this receptor.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMolecular virology professor Dr Ultan Power FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappMolecular virology professor Dr Ultan PowerThe ACE  Receptor is the lock, the spike protein is the key. Connection allows the virus to enter the cell using viral RNA, and that is the most important part of the virus. It effectively acts like a photocopier.RNA manages how the other parts of the cell . When the virus RNA gets into the cell, it reassigns everything to one job - make more virus particles.Instead of the cell doing things to keep our bodies working efficiently, it focuses on making viruses. One gets in, thousands of virus particles come out. They infect other cells, and eventually other people. That process happens over and over again, and very suddenly - in just a few weeks - you have a global pandemic.No one is going to be sitting in a laboratory and waving a magic wandThe human immune system reacts to defend the body, but for some people the immune system is overwhelmed. Overactive, it causes damage to tissue and organs. Lungs may be unable to operate. The weaker the immune system in a person, the more likely serious damage is caused, hence the shielding of those most vulnerable in our society.A lot of the drugs - antivirals - being trialled and tested across the world are trying to stop this viral replication.A vaccine is seen as the game-changer, the route back to the world we knew.Vaccines teach your immune system how to create antibodies that protect you from diseases.Having a vaccine also benefits the whole community through herd immunity.If enough people are vaccinated, it is harder for the disease to spread to those people who cannot have vaccines.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr Anthony FauciAFP via Getty Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr Anthony FauciAnthony Fauci, the face of America#s fight against coronavirus, believes a vaccine may be ready in  to  months.It sounds a long time, but history shows it really isn#t.Fauci#s timeline would shatter all precedents for developing a new vaccine, which can take many years. The fastest vaccine was for mumps, and took four years.Optimism about an Aids vaccine was once high, but  years later we still wait.Dr Power added: Unfortunately, no one is going to be sitting in a laboratory and waving a magic wand and suddenly saying there#s your vaccine. It#s a much more complicated process than that.There are around  vaccines in clinic at the minute, most of them targeting the #spike# protein, which latches itself on to the cells.If that can be nulled then the virus can#t latch onto the cells and cannot become active and infect.But there#s no one definitive process on how to develop the vaccine in the first place, and that#s before you get to the testing stage.Read MoreSuzanne Breen:Opinion Selfish party-goers will en the time coronavirus lockdown restrictions remain for all of us in Northern IrelandSome of the candidate vaccines involve hugely weakening the virus, before putting it into the body. The idea is to stimulate the immune system to create enough of the right type of antibodies to be ready to fight the real thing. Others involve finding a way to get a virus particle that our systems can easily fight off, and get that to carry the spike protein from SARS-CoV, the virus that causes Covid-. The idea being our cells which make antibodies will learn to recognise the shape of the spike protein, and be ready to stop it entering the ACE- receptorwhen it arrives on the real virus particle. At Oxford University Irish Professor Adrian Hill is heading a team using this method, the current leaders in the race to develop a vaccine to stop the virus.And a final truly modern method is being worked on by several companies, including US-based Moderna. It involves cutting up the RNA of the virus, effectively clipping up the page before it is put into the photocopier. The aim of this is to isolate the bit of the virus RNA that makes the spike protein, and get that into our cells. Our cell machinery will then #photocopy# the spike protein, but never see the rest of the virus particle. Those spikes will be recognised by the immune system, which will make antibodies, ready for a time when the spikes arrive on the virus particle. These are known as RNA vaccines, and many experts believe they will be key to fighting infectious diseases in the years to come, but the technology to produce them has only become viable in the last few years, and none have yet been rolled out. You must be sure any vaccine will not cause more damage.Once approved, they would be very quick to produce, but testing of such designs - and all designs - would be crucial. Dr Power explained: It#s very dficult to say what the best method is and the construction of the vaccine is critical.And we have to remember our primary targets are the elderly and they are much more dficult to vaccinate than younger people as their immune system is weaker.But once the method of production of the virus is settled, the next step is to scale up to a level where you can produce millions of doses.Then it#s a case of repetitive testing through several phases, with safety the main issue throughout the whole process.With pre-clinic trials, perhaps involving mice, you allow the virus effect to be minimal but we can determine the capability of immune response toxicity levels, whether the vaccine does too much damage to be useful.If the vaccine gets through that stage, then it is on to testing in a clinic. But, as Dr Power explains, many hurdles still lie ahead.He added: Safety is again the key, making sure there are no problems caused, watching the consequences and toxicity levels. Any signs of toxicity and a decision will have to be made on whether to progress to the next phase.That#s when you introduce the vaccine to a series of trials with a limited number of subjects, again ensuring safety all the way through. You look for dose effects, how much of the potential vaccine produces the best results. Then you select the dose to proceed with to another stage.Using a much greater number of people, perhaps thousands, there must be a robust response. If everything comes together and the vaccine still produces positive results then the steps to authorise can start. A decision will be made whether to manufacture or not and all the details in the dossier will be looked at before a licence to produce is granted.By the end of this year we might have a candidate, but it#s too critical to rush through.It all sounds like a lot of work, and it is.With this pandemic there is a lot more pressure to produce and there#s a temptation to relax a little in terms of vigilance, said Dr Power.But you must be sure any vaccine will not cause more damage. Normally the whole process takes around  years.I spent nine years working on a vaccine and it fell at the third stage. It#s not easy, there#s a lot that can go wrong. And eventhe vaccine does work, can we be sure it will still work in a year#s time You normally need at least a year to monitor that, take time to draw breath and then move to the next step. If there#s anything viable within the next  months we#re talking about history book stuff. By the end of this year we might have a candidate, but it#s too critical to rush through.There can then still be issueany vaccine is brought to market, Dr Power explains.Read More This has been #worst event to hit us in  years, even after two recessions,# says NI business ownerProblems can develop, a one in a million reaction can be missed.He added: It#s wonderful to see the aspiration to produce a vaccine for Covid-, but the pressure of your country is not what you want on your shoulders, especiallythings go wrong down the line.We all want this so badly there#s a real danger of problems. We have to work out which specic people have a bad reaction - that#s normal with any vaccine.There#s a risk with everything and those risks will be found out in trying to gain approval to bring to market.The risks must be balanced. Those people who have a reaction will then not be given the vaccine and the theory is that herd immunity protects them. The virus struggles to find those without vaccination. The majority protect the few.He added: But in everything we do we can#t lose sight of the fact that we must always follow the data. That takes a considerable amount of time.

Picture by Frank McGrathCatherine FeganMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailMiguel Plangca was  when he left his home in Ozamis city in the Philippines for a new le in Ireland.Like many Filipinos who relocate to the Republic, he had come for employment and managed to secure a job in Naas with Green Isle, one of the country#s biggest frozen food producers.For the next  years he did little  but work, clocking up thousands of gruelling hours on the factory packaging line and sending money home to his we Gilceria and his five children in the Philippines.When Gilceria died from cancer in , his heartbroken children came to live with him in Naas, Co Kildare.Last week, tragedy struck the Plangca children once again when Miguelsuccumbed to the coronavirus.My Dad made so many sacrices for us. He was a good man and everything he did he did for us Mikee PlangcaIt came as such a shock, his -year-old daughter Mikee told the Irish Independent.Dad had been sick for about a week in the house, with a cough and what he thought was a cold and then he ended up in ICU. He spent  days there before he died. It#s very hard for us to take it all in at the minute.Together with her siblings Michael , Johnand Chekie , Mikee is now an orphan.I#m concentrating on minding my brothers and sisters for now, she said.We don#t know what will happen. We would like to stay in Ireland because that#s where we have made a le, where our friends are and our [Filipino] community is, but we don#t know.The Plangca children first arrived in Ireland four years ago. Until then, they had lived their lives in the Philippines, where their only contact with their father was through video calls and twice-yearly visits.Their half-sister Stephanie, a daughter Miguel had from a previous relationship, was living in Abu Dhabi.My father made a decision many years ago to come here to provide for us, said Mikee. holds a photograph of her father Miguel who was a factory worker and lost his le to Covid-, leaving Mikee and her  siblings orphans.

Picture by Frank McGrathHe left so we could stay in the Philippines and have a better quality of le. Every month he sent money home to us.We were like many other families in the Philippines who had a parent in another country working to provide.Then when my mother died, we came here to Ireland to live with him.After completing sixth year at school in Prosperous, Co Kildare, Mikee opted out of going to college.Instead, she applied to be a full-time carer for her brother Michael, who has intellectual disabilities.My brother is my responsibility, said Mikee.When we first came to Ireland, Dad was working day shts but he switched to night shts so that I could go to school. He looked after Michael during the day and worked at night.My Dad made so many sacrices for us. He was a good man and everything he did he did for us.Meanwhile, Miguel#s sister Fely had followed in her brother#s footsteps by moving to Ireland herself in .She later married an Irish man and settled in Naas, where she works as a childminder.I was working in the Philippines, not earning a lot of money and my brother encouraged me to come here, she said. I met an Irish man and got married and I made a le here too.When Gilceria died and the children came here Miguel was finding it dficult to cope on his own and he talked about moving back to the Philippines. I said no, you can do this, so they moved in.My husband said to bring them in to live with us and that#s where they were living when this all happened.After Miguel fell ill with Covid-, Fely also contracted the virus.We were all praying he would get better. In the end it was no good, the virus was too strong Miguel#s sister, Fely Miguel was hospitalised on April  and Fely joined him in Naas General hospital six days later. When Miguel#s children were tested, Mikee and Michael were found to be Covid positive.Michael and I had no symptoms, said Mikee. We self-isolated in the house for a month. We were too scared to go out.Fely was discharged on April , but her brother#s condition worsened.My mother and siblings would call him every night at six o#clock, she said.They would talk to him in his hospital bed and we were all praying he would get better. In the end it was no good, the virus was too strong.Last year, the Green Isle pizza manufacturing site in Naas where Miguel worked was bought over by Birdseye.Colleagues remember him as a kind and gentle colleague. When he became ill, the Filipino community stepped in to look after his young family.We had to try to help out as best we could, said Aina Conway, president of the Kildare Filipino Community.They have recovered but they have lost their father and they are in shock. I speak to Mikee most days and she has cried every day since her father was brought in to ICU. At the moment she is just trying to be strong for the little ones.Together with the Philippine consulate, the Kildare Filipino Community are raising money in aid of the Plangca children.They have their aunt, but Mikee has been the mum for a long time, said Aina.Now that they have lost their father, they need all the support we can give them. Miguel came here to provide a better le for his children. You look at the kids now and that#s them forever, with no parents. It#s incredibly sad.

He is considering inviting his friend, Olympic star Sebastian Coe, to come too.Speaking to the Belfast , Mr O’Callaghan explained how the events unfurled, saying: “I set up an Irish Athletics History social media page in January and one of the contributions to it was a photograph of Delaney Crescent in Strabane named after Ronnie Delany.“I casually mentioned that the spelling wasn’t right and that wouldn’t it be greatwas corrected and I could bring Ronnie up to see it.“Less than a couple of hours later the Mayor, Michaela Boyle, came on to the page and said that was a great idea and she was going to follow up on it.“I mentioned it to Ronnie and he told me he had never been aware of it but he was delighted and even though he is , he is sprightly and lives in.“I know there’s a bit of work to do to make this happen but I said to the Mayor, I will bring Ronnie up to Strabane and we might be able to get Sebastian Coe to come too because he is good friends with Ronnie.” and greets Olympic Flame carriers Ronnie Delany and Bridget Taylor outside Government Buildings in Dublin city centre on June , .

He mistakenly played the sash at the end of mass. Fr Jimmy apologises by saying âsorry I picked the wrong one, sorry about that, itâs a bit early for that isnât itâ. pic JDrFqZNK— Brendan MarshallMay , He continued: I always say, being biasedhim being my uncle, he#s a great modern day priest. He#s so connected to the community, so down to earth when it comes to situations like this.He didn#t expect it to go viral, but it#s happened and that#s why we#re here.Asked why Fr McPhillips was still keeping a low profile during his new found celebrity, Mr McPhillips said: I#ll not forgive him for that one. He gets all the hits every weekend during his sermon so he felt like he#s had enough of publicity, so he thought he#d send the nephew off to do his dirty work.Read More Fermanagh priest left red-faced after The Sash played during Mass He added: I#m more than happy to do it because it#s spreading that positive message - and why not It#s not just church-goers who have found the humour in the unlikely clip, with a number of Orange lodges even singing the priest#s praises.Locals also brushed off the musical faux pas as welcome entertainment after two months of lockdown.One man told UTV: I didn#t see any madness or any harm in it.

Councillors on Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council were asked to attend the meeting using video conferencing software after the cancellation of meetings during April and March. Cllr Kathleen McGurk said it was important that the council were in a position to adapt to the circumstances of the pandemic. She said: “It is vital that democratic accountability and protection for ratepayers continues during the pandemic. “This is a crucial period for our ratepayers, families, businesses, employees and they will be depending on council to continue to provide service delivery and assist our community to get through this crisis. googletag.cmd.push “Council meetings are a vital part of that and I would expect them and other meetings to be held online now for the foreseeable future.” While there were some minor technical issues, the meeting mostly passed off successfully and there is hope that the public and press will be able to attend future meetings. Cllr McGurk said: “I would hope that this will ensure future meetings will be even more open and transparent. “This may even encourage greater access with members of the public who would never normally have attended a council meeting able to view meetings online from the comfort of their home. googletag.cmd.push “This can only be a good thing for democracy and allow the public a greater insight into the workings of decision-making bodies. “Tuesday’s online meeting of council is proof that we can adapt to work around some of the problems presented by coronavirus. “This crisis has pushed all sections of society to find technological solutions to the way we work and I firmly believe that the lessons learned from this will have a long term impact on how we continue to work after the pandemic has passed.” Details of future meetings to be held remotely will be published on the council’s website.

Concerns have centred around access to the pound, grant, the pound, grant and also the support for those who are self-employed. Mid Ulster MLA, Emma Sheerin, has called on Economy Minister Diane Dodds to make improvements to the scheme. She said: “One of the biggest challenges we first encountered was that manufacturing and engineering firms, who avail of industrial derating, were excluded from the relief package. “Thankfully, this was addressed by the minister following quite an amount of pressure, but there are still a number of business models that have been excluded. googletag.cmd.push “Businesses who rent their premises were initially unable to apply, having been told to wait for a second phase of help which became available on April th. “The criteria that came with this second phase only caters for sole tenants, meaning that anyone who rents a unit in a premises with multiple businesses, or rents a part of a business space, has been excluded. I cannot see the logic in this, and feel this discriminates against small business owners who never could have foreseen these circumstances. “A business does not see their running costs diminish just because they have a neighbouring business above or below them who happens to rent off the same landlord.” googletag.cmd.push The Mid Ulster MLA, who sits on Stormont’s Audit Committee, said she welcomed a new ‘microbusiness’ package to be introduced next week, but also voiced concerns about dferences from the original scheme. “The minister has announced a microbusiness package which will become available next week, which is certainly much welcomed news,” she said. “However, I am worried that this is unlikely to be worth the same poundk award as the initial scheme, with the provision grants up to poundk outlined in the criteria suggesting that it might depend on uptake. “Given that there was no requirement on any business to prove turnover or ongoing costs to avail of the first grants, which I understand happened for expediency reasons, it is unfair to expect similarly sized businesses, with similar operating costs, to settle for lower grant awards due to a technicality. I have written to Minister Dodds again this week communicating that all renting businesses should be included in the first scheme, andnot, the microbusiness package must guarantee poundk awards for all successful applicants.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The scheme, launched yesterday, hopes to replicate the support available to employees who have been furloughed. Grants will be calculated at % of average monthly profit over a period of up to three years and cash should be paid into applicants’ accounts within six days of applying. Applicants must fill out an online application form that includes an ID verication check, but the site does not accept an Irish passport or Northern Ireland driving licence. googletag.cmd.push Mid Ulster MP Francie Molloy has written to HMRC after many self-employed workers were unable to use the online application as they do not hold a British passport or driving licence. He said: “It is absolutely unacceptable that these people are excluded at present from accessing the HMRC online application. “The number of Irish passport holders in the North is over , and there are also ious other nationalities that make up our self-employed workforce. “It is absolutely unacceptable that these people are excluded at present from accessing the HMRC online application. I have written to the HMRC asking that the matter be resolved immediately andalso contacted the Finance Minister to ask that he raise this matter with the British Treasury. googletag.cmd.push “This is a time of immense economic uncertainty and financial hardship many self-employed people are feeling the financial strain of this pandemic. “Self-employed workers have had to wait several weeks for applications for this scheme to open, this itself has caused immense concern and anxiety. “There must not be additional stress placed upon these workers due to issues around identity verication. This must be resolved without a moment‘s delay.” A HMRC spokesperson said: “We want to reassure those in Northern Ireland that they will not be excluded from the scheme. “Anyone can check their eligibility for the scheme using our eligibility checker, andthey meet the criteria, can apply.” “Anyone who has engaged with us online before, to file theirfor example, shouldbe able to use their existing credentials to claim online,” she said. “Anyone going online with us for the first time can use the multiple-choice questions option to attempt to very their identity,” they said. “If they are unable to very, they are still able to claim their grant using our telephone helplines.” HMRC’s Covid- helpline can be contacted by calling   .

The move means the decision will be revisited by the council after unionist councillors initially blocked a Sinn Feacutein motion on the issue. Cllr Leanne Peacock topping up the wages was the right thing to do. When the furlough scheme was introduced there was an appeal from government for employers to top up the full wages of their employees by adding the additional %, she said. That is the right thing to do and that is why we proposed that as a responsible public sector employer that the Causeway Coast and Glens Council should certainly ensure their staff are paid % of their wages. googletag.cmd.push Unfortunately at the meeting when this was decided Unionist councillors turned their backs on council staff and voted against our proposal. “However, in the hours and days following the meeting it became clear that Councillors had not been provided with all the information required to make an informed decision on this issue. Sinn Feacutein have engaged with Trade Unions, staff and council officers and it became clear that Councillors had once again been asked to make a decision with only part of the information on the issue. Trade Unions had not been meaningfully consulted prior to this decision and discussions with council on the furlough of staff are still ongoing.” googletag.cmd.push “We are disappointed that the full information was not available to elected members prior to the decision been taken and potential agreement with Trade Unions had not been fully explored- we felt given these facts that it was essential to ‘call-in’ the decision. Councillors were not given an opportunity to arrive at a decision giving consideration to all of the relevant information and facts which erodes the democratic process and is by the very definition, the purpose of the ‘call-in’ mechanism.” NIPSAs Alan Law reiterated its call for the council to ensure its workers receive % of normal pay. He said: NIPSA reiterates it’s call on Causeway Coast and Glens BC to enter into constructive negotiations to agree a process for the furlough of staff which will ensure that Council can maximise funding available to it from the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. We continue to insist that our members terms and conditions of employment are respected and that staff who are furloughed receive % of normal pay.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Derry  Strabane People Before Profit Cllrs Eamonn McCann and Shaun Harkin said: People Before Profit joins other parties in welcoming the announcement that the Stormont Executive has approved a graduate-entry Medical School at Magee.We take this as a down-payment on the first instalment of what Stormont owes to the working-class people of the North West.Every place in the proposed medical school will be a boost for Derry - and will whet Derry’s appetite for delivery of the rest of what’s been promised.However, we mustn’t allow approval of the medical school to ert attention from the target agreed by all parties of , extra full-time student places. Approval of the medical school cannot be a substitute for expansion of third-level education generally. We wont be settling for  additional students a year when the numbers have been cut by hundreds in recent years.The embarrassing scramble for political credit for getting the medical school approved is in full swing. The fact is that every party in the North West with elected representatives has fully supported the medical school. The task now is not to demand a share of success but to recognise how far short this falls from what Derry has demanded down through the years.And we must keep in mind that all that we have so far is the promise. It is not cynical, particularly not in Derry, to say that we’ll fully believe it when we clearly see it. googletag.cmd.push And questions still remain about who will deliver third-level education provision here. The institution with that responsibility doesnt have the trust of those whove witnessed its deliberate policy of downgrading Derry for decades.It was possible to believe for  years that the reason Derry had been cheated of third-level education was that sectarian unionism didn’t want proper development of gerrymandered Derry. But that explanation won’t wash now.In the last  years, Derry has had Deputy First Ministers, Ministers for Finance, Ministers for Education etc. - all from a nationalist background. Those establishment parties have systematically let the people of Derry and the North West down and delivery of the medical school wont make up for their failures.We shouldn’t stop to savour this interim success, but rather take it as encouragement to push on towards full delivery of Derry’s entitlement. We will continue on our present path, working with other parties and campaign groups, including trades unions and student unions, to bring this saga to success at last. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It comes just days after Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that the long-awaited Derry medical school had been agreed by the Executive and said she expects students to enrol in September . Speaking at yesterday’s economy committee meeting, deputy chair and SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said: “It would be remiss of me not to thank you in relation to the Executive announcement regarding Magee, and I know there’s still work to be done but there is an imminent deadline and obviously the first intake of students is September  according to the announcement. googletag.cmd.push “We’re delighted about that and the whole city is definitely celebrating that good news story. Hopefully whatever work has to be done in the next few weeks, everything will go through.” In response DUP Minister Diane Dodds highlighted ‘signicant work’ that has to be done and said additional papers will be presented to the Executive. She commented: “The announcement on the Magee Medical School was a good announcement for the Executive to make, a good announcement for the city, but more importantly just a good announcement for the whole of Northern Ireland. “It is quite clear that we need more doctors and we want more of our young people to be able to train and re-train.” googletag.cmd.push However, she added: “I’m not pretending that the path ahead is easy, there is a signicant amount of work to do in relation to the issues around capacity of Ulster University and the financial position of Ulster University. And there is a signicant amount of work to do about that. “But we have set ourselves on a pathway and we are working quite hard on that. There will be further papers to the Executive on that in due course.” In February the Department of Finance confirmed that a poundm loan had been agreed in the form of an ‘addendum to the business case’ for Ulster University’s vastly over-budget Belfast campus. The Department for the Economy will be responsible for overall approval. The relocation of Jordanstown to Belfast city centre was initially expected to cost poundm but swelled to around poundm. FURTHER WORK On Monday, May , Deputy First Minister revealed that the medical school had been given the go-ahead. But, a short time later, the department responsible for its delivery said further work is needed to guarantee student intake next year. An Executive Office spokesperson stated: “The Executive has reaffirmed its commitment to establish a Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee, as set out in New Decade, New Approach. “Further work is being undertaken to secure a sustainable outcome for the project within the fastest possible timescales. “Plans are being progressed that would allow an initial student intake of  in September  and the Executive will consider this issue again next month.” To begin with the school will train  doctors within existing buildings on the Magee campus. Supported by City Deal money, a new Medical School facility is expected to be built along the riverfront but that is likely to lie some years ahead. When fully operational with  students in   it will cost poundm to run per year, according to UU. Speaking at Monday’s press conference Michelle O’Neill said plans are being progressed that ‘will allow the first student intake of  in September ’. She added: “This is a hugely important investment decision for the North West and it adds to the Executives recent announcement on the Derry and Strabane City Deal and Inclusive Future Fund. It will prove to be instrumental in the regeneration of the region and will help to support our health service who we much rely on at this point and into the future. ‘GUARANTEE’ SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has asked for more detail and said a ‘guarantee’ was needed that students will start in . He believes student intake in  is ‘far from certain’ and there are a number of issues to be addressed, including the matter of recurring funding from the Executive. “People don’t have to be put through the hoops that we’ve been put through to get something for Derry but it is largely down to the need for recurring funding. “It’s hopeful, it’s positive, it’s good, but I do think we need to ask questions about how certain this is and I think we’re right to do that given all that we’ve been through.” In terms of long-term goals for expansion, the Foyle MP added: “We need to keep our eye on the big prize and that is , students.” While welcoming the news DUP MLA Gary Middleton said he ‘hoped’ the Magee Medical School would be delivered in . Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Derry University Group , which is campaigning for an independent university in the city, said it is proposing that all future Higher Educationdevelopment in the North West be led and managed under the auspices of an independent university. He added: “UU has neither the finance, capacity nor political will to deliver for Derry. “To that end Derry and Donegal Councils should immediately establish their own HE Development and Scrutiny Committee.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

For many couples, Slaughtneil was more than just an exercise in adolescent revelry. It became the starting point for the rest of their romantic lives. The County Derry Post caught up with four couples for whom Slaughtneil will always be a special place. Sarah and Eamonn Darragh  “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really.”  Kilrea man Eamonn Darragh his we, Bellaghy woman Sarah have an age-old Slaughtneil ritual to thank for fate bringing them together back in . googletag.cmd.push In this case, fate had a name. “Whenever I was at primary school, I was friendly with a fella called Shay Quinn,” said Sarah. “I played with him on the boys’ football team. He was the year above me and when I got to St Pat’s the year after, him and Eamonn were friends. “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really. I saw him on nights out at Slaughtneil and in school, and that was how things started.” The disco holds special signicance for Sarah and Eamonn, whose relationship grew as the hills of south Derry reverberated to the incoherent sounds of Mark McCabe. googletag.cmd.push “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil,” she said. “You’d have been checking the Mid Ulster Observer every week to checkit was going to be a late night, orit was a foam party. “Then you had to be good to your parents all week and put the feelers out on a Wednesday or Thursday to seeyou could go. “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil. Eamonn got the bus up from Kilrea and I would get it from Bellaghy on a Friday night, and we continued our relationship from there. “If we both weren’t there, we wouldn’t have met each other, we wouldn’t have been married and having a babyI hadn’t met him through Shay at the disco.” Enda and Laura Heron  “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me!”  For many involved with the GAA, the word ‘lap’ doesn’t conjure up many positive thoughts, butyou ask anyone who crossed the door of Slaughtneil disco, it’s a dferent story. Laura Heron was embarking on a lap of the hall when she bumped into the man who would later become her husband, but they were lucky to be there at all. “We met around the Millennium, when we thought the world was going to end,” she said. “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me! “We had a wee kiss that night, but we met a year later, when we were  or so, going to the Elk and the sparks flew from then on.” Even the soundtrack to the encounter belied its good fortune, as the pair met to the unmistakable sound of ‘Toca’s Miracle’ by ‘Fragma’. Memories of going to the disco are still fresh in her mind. “You were always excited to go, you couldn’t wait until Friday night came,” she said. “We always got DCs Coaches from Bellaghy. That was part of the fun too, heading up on the bus for that opportunity to have fun with your friends at the weekend, after school was over. “When you’re that age, going to Slaughtneil when you’re in fourth year or whatever, you think you’re an adult, that you know everything. You don’t realise that you were still a child. “We got married in  and were going out for about  years or so. We went to Australia for a year and came home and settled down from that point, but it all began in Slaughtneil hall.” Jenna Mulhern and David Donnelly  “If he was driving about, we’d always meet at Slaughtneil and we started going steady when we were .”  When Dungiven woman Jenna Mulhern met her husband-to-be David, from Ballinascreen, his time at Slaughtneil disco had been brought to a premature end. “He was actually known in Slaughtneil as ‘Davy Bash’, because he was always in rows,” said Jenna. “He couldn’t come in because he was barred from the place for fighting – that’s why he had to drive about outside. “We got talking, and then the following week, I met him again and we had our first curt.” Jenna remembers her uncle leaving her and her friends over to the disco and having to suffer their excited, and quite vocal anticipation. “My uncle used to leave us over and God love him, he had to listen to the biggest pile of rubbish in that car,” she recalled. “Once we landed it was brilliant, meeting up with everybody and then sneaking out halfway through the night to meet Davy. “Young ones now will never experience anything like it. We couldn’t wait to get dressed up on a Friday night and have a wee blue WKD on the way over. “I know a lot who would have went to Slaughtneil and are still with the same people. I’d say a lot of people have met their first loves there.” Kieran and Paula Tully  “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes!”  There are dozens of women who can look back at Slaughtneil as the place where they met and their future husbands, but a much lesser number who were proposed to there. Paula Tully’s husband Kieran, overcome by the intoxicating mix of perfume and freshly cut turf, popped the question after the couple left the hall for some air back in . “That particular night we came out to be on our own on the bus. I could nearly point out where it was sitting,” said Paula. “We weren’t saying the Rosary now, but we weren’t doing anything bad either! That’s when Kieran asked me to marry him.” “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes. We went steady until just after I was . When you think about it now, it’s crazy how young we were.” With Kieran from Ballerin and Paula from Glenullin, their story has a Romeo and Juliet feel, with love prospering amid the pitched battles going on around them. “I remember one of my friends fell out with me for a month when I started going with Kieran, because he was from Ballerin and I was from the Glen! “At that time, you had the gang of boys from the Glen that fought with the gang of boys from Ballerin. She thought I was being a complete traitor.” The couple continued the Slaughtneil theme throughout their relationship, with DJ Terry McIl, who played on the very first night of the disco, performing at their wedding. “Our weans think it’s hilarious, that it’s crazy,” laughed Paula. “We had brilliant memories, I don’t regret a second of it. We’ll be  years married this August. If I was to do it all again, I would not change a thing.” See also: SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: Spinning the soundtrack to a timless era SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: The goose that laid the golden egg.

Those days seem positively idyllic now, but alas, like the car journeys of her childhood, we’re not nearly there yet. The Covid story fills our daily lives, with a relentless stream of media coverage of illness and death, with graphs distorted so as to frighten and confuse, with front page pictures of the victims. Everywhere is the constant reiteration of the now disproven narrative that the lock up is saving lives. Our politicians vie with one another to virtue signal their intent to prolong the misery and impoverishment of our people, and of future generations. googletag.cmd.push Our elderly are told they are being kept alive, but denied all of the simple pleasures which make le worth living-family, friends, society and their religious practices. Meanwhile, the entire healthy population is under house arrest, policed by the state, but more worryingly by their neighbours in a social media shamefest. Those who “follow the science” know that this foul disease is behaving as many such seasonal viral illnesses have done for millions of years. They travel through communities, and wreak havoc on the elderly and infirm. In Ireland, the median age of death is  years. % of those dying have other, often multiple medical problems, like cancer heart disease and strokes. googletag.cmd.push In most of the community, viral illnesses cause illness and misery to many, but most have a mild illness, recover completely and are conferred with immunity to further infection. Each death is a personal loss for those left behind, but death is a necessary and inevitable part of the human condition. Many older people do not fear it. The science also suggests that this virus was in Europe much earlier than previously thought-possibly in December and January, that the peak of deaths was on th April, which given an incubation period of - days, meant the lockup came too late to influence outcomes. The evidence for this timeline is growing daily, but doesn’t seem to have reached the politicians who are deciding the fate and future of our very civilization.  The dire predictions of tens, even hundreds of thousands of deaths in the UK alone were based on computer models which have been heavily criticized by independent statisticians and mathematicians. The original aim of protecting the NHS, and flattening the curve has been achieved. But now we see the narrative changing, with dread warnings of second waves and the new normal, indeed noto an open society until there is a vaccine. The rules around social distancing, plucked from the ether, without any evidence base are internalized by the population. The media, which is essentially an arm of government, eagerly reinforces the narrative. We should realise that the search for a vaccine for HIV AIDS is now entering its fourth decade. Also safety trials for any vaccine historically take years, and rightly so, given the exposure of entire populations to potential harm. It is clear, as I pointed out in a previous article for this paper about a month ago, that countries who have imposed lockdowns have outcomes comparable to those who took more moderate steps to protect their people. Also, since around half of the fatalities occur in the care home sector, the total failure to protect these facilities with whatever resources were available has cost many lives. It is also clear that the lockup policy is causing at least half of the excess mortality we are seeing, and that this proportion is likely to increase signicantly as people are being denied treatment and diagnostics in the other areas. Heart disease, strokes, cancer and mental health problems haven’t gone away, but their recognition and treatment have. I’ve been working in the NHS throughout this period. On my one sht in the GP Covid assessment centre, I counted fteen staff, including three doctors and many highly skilled nurses, who in a four-hour sht saw three patients, none of whom has Covid. Hospitals are half empty, highly skilled staff idle. There are no elective surgical lists, nor routine outpatient appointments, so people wait in pain for surgery or in anxiety and stress for tests to find outthey have serious illnesses such as cancer. Meantime in the out-of-hours GP service, we see people in mental health crises, deal with people isolated and displaced, those suffering from a relapse of addictions under control for years, and an elderly population terried and reluctant to seek help, because they have been repeatedly told that their NHS is in danger of being overwhelmed, and because they dread separation from loved ones. The distress of those families with children with behavioural or learning dficulties, or additional physical needs is truly heartbreaking. Discussion of the economic consequences of all of this are beyond my remit, but experts say there is not a linear, but exponential effect on the crash which is certainly coming as a result of the almost total cessation of economic activity. In other words, a four-month lockup isn’t twice as bad as a two month one, but many, many times worse. Here in the developed world we are unlikely to starve, although there will be widespread austerity the likes of which we have not seen in generations. But in the global south, where millions live on subsistence wages, the abrupt loss of economic activity and markets for produce will cause catastrophic starvation and cost the lives of millions. Disease is a constant challenge to societies and governments. But the unprecedented response to this one takes us to uncharted and very dangerous waters. There is no evidence that the political decision makers have done any intelligent cost benefit analysis, looking at the big picture of the physical, mental, social and economic outcomes for those whose lives they are entrusted to improve. They are either inept beyond imagining, or willfully colluding in the destruction of society, especially for future generations.

A former art teacher, Christines weekly schedule involved the school runs and looking after her grandchildren, while playing golf and helping around at Lavey club. When ‘lockdown’ began eight weeks ago, my day-to-day le changed, Christine said. The club gates were locked up and I missed calling in there every day. My husband, Paddy, is Chairman of the Club and could always have found an excuse to call in and attend to something or other. In her new routine, she has been updating all the family photo albums. After being inspired by Mary K Burkes photo of her son Damian in action for Lavey against Greenlough last season, she decided to paint this masterpiece, which called‘Love Our Club, Love Lavey’. googletag.cmd.push I took some photographs of our clubhouse and top pitch to help with the overall composition. I was trying to capture the colour, excitement and special atmosphere of match days. The only part of the painting that is from an actual game is the high catch at midfield the rest of the players and supporters are imagined, although I did model two of the younger supporters on Eimear and Aodhan, my grandchildren, who are under-age players and keen fans.

Sean McLaughlin, the owner of Georges Bar in Bishop Street, had organised a night of live music to celebrate the le of Shenda McKenna on her first anniversary on April . Due to the coronavirus the gig was cancelled, but undeterredthe the singers moved online where they played on Facebook Live streaming service. Music lover Shenda was just  when she passed away. We wanted to mark the anniversary of our beautul friend Shenda, said Mr McLaughlin. We would have loved for nothing more than celebrating her le in the bar, however, the musicians agreed to go online and the event was able to go ahead and raised pound,. googletag.cmd.push Georges Bar is well known for its live music and craic and the regulars regard each otheras family. We call it the Georges family, said Mr McLaughlin, who has owned the bar for seven years. We have a long tradition of charity fundraisingand we would raise a lot of money for the Playtrail, so this seemed like the perfect way to remember Shenda. She was in here every weekend and she loved music. Last week, Georges Bar held another fundraiser in aidof the late Pat ODonnell, known affectionately as Wee Pat, who passed away last Christmas Day aged . Pat was a stalwart of Georges and was part of the furniture here for a number of years, said Mr McLaughlin. googletag.cmd.push Sadly, we lost Pat on Christmas Day , and that void has never, and will never, be filled. Pat had travelled the world and worked looking after garment factories in the likes of Madagascar and Mauritius. His stories were legendary and he lived a really full and interesting le. He was like a piece of the furniture in here and he was in almost every night when he lived in Mountjoy Street and later Abbey House. He was the oldest person in the bar and he had a real love of music. He used to always ask Sean McCafferty to play The Lakesof Pontchartrain for him but we never knew why and then when Sean played it on Thursday a cousin of Pats messaged from Canada to say he lived just a few blocks from Lake Pontchartrain, so now we know! The night in aid of Wee Pat took place on Thursday, May , and raised a further pound for the Foyle Food Bank, bringing the total raised to pound,. Its been really nice to raise this moneyeven though the bar cant open and Im sure its badly needed at this time, added Mr McLaughlin.

South Derry film fans’ closest venues under the initial plan would have been Derry city, Portrush and Antrim, but plans are currently underway to bring the tour to Cookstown and Dungannon. Conor Moran, from The Big Drive Inn, told the County Derry Post that they hope to show four dferent screenings per day. He said: “We use an LED screen and the brightness is a lot sharper than a projector. Our movies can run from  o’clock in the day til  o’clock at night. googletag.cmd.push “In the afternoon, at pm and pm, we will be showing more family-orientated films. At pm, we’ll show a classic film and at pm a blockbuster. “The plan is to do this as a tour of Northern Ireland and keep it going as long as Covid- lasts.” The company had already begun to tour in the Republic of Ireland before it was placed into lockdown, with shows in Dundalk and Cavan, and are now resuming plans to move north. In keeping with strict hygiene guidelines, the organisers say they will be taking all necessary precautions and implementing social distancing. “We encourage arriving in, staying in and leaving in your car so it’s complete family isolation,” said Conor. googletag.cmd.push “Toilets will be provided, we provide portaloos. Your temperature is taken on entering the toilet by an automated temperature taker. “If your temperature is too high you wouldn’t be able to enter the toilet. All toilets are sanitised and there is state-of-the-art technology checking temperatures. “All toilets are sanitised after each use. There will be sanitisers on site as well and we’ll be encouraging people to sanitise. “We have a host of other processes in place to protect against Covid-. All transactions are cashless, so you buy your ticket online. “We won’t be offering any food yet, until the lockdown eases. If that’s during the tour, we’ll look at doing some food, but for the first few events, we’ll be encouraging people to bring their own. “All our staff members have undergone safety training to ensure we promote and enforce a safe event for all.” If the tour proves to be a success, the organisers have said they may look at continuing the service after the Covid- restrictions have been eased. “We hope to continue with it after the lockdown. It will be almost a funfair operation, staying in each venue for two days. “All of our screens are on trailers and we have four smaller trailers that are shown throughout the car park.” Conor does not foresee any issues in having to enforce social distancing but have insisted that they have a security team in place to deal with those who aren’t complying. “We did it just before the lockdown in the south and to be honest, people don’t want to leave their cars,” he said. “We had hundreds of cars and had no hassle. People are excited to see the film. If they do, we’ll ask them to leave the car park and we have staff in place for that.” More details can be found on the Big Drive-Inn Facebook page.

The groups’ online presence through Facebook groups and pages has given many of those who are isolating a much-needed focus during a stressful time. Stephen McCracken, who runs the Limavady Past and Present Facebook group along with Matthew Harron, says people are using their time to reminisce. “During the lockdown this has provided an absolutely vital service to the greater Limavady Area,” he said. “People laugh, reminisce and learn from the daily posts. This has helped so many people with their mental health, of which is often a part of all of us unseen or covered up. googletag.cmd.push “We as admins are playing our small role in the current situation and are delighted that so many are using it. It has now over ,  members of which many are participants.” Stephen’s colleague Matthew Harron took over the page after the previous owner took his own le and the duo have been encouraged by comments of how it has helped others. “I love reading about Limavady of old,” commented one user. “There were so many characters that made up an interesting town  so much knowledge in this group that every day I learn something new about a town I havent lived in for  years.” googletag.cmd.push Another page helping its local community is the ‘Le on Slieve Gallion Braes, its people and its history’, which is based in Derry’s Slieve Gallion area. Page member Johnny McCallion said the page had been a ‘massive help’ for him during lockdown. He said: “It has made it possible for me to keep in contact with family and indeed friends over the mountain and further afield, because I cant travel from Derry to visit themat the moment. “The banter, the craic and the obvious support from all the members has added a new dimension of caring and supportive care to the group.” Fellow user Brenda Murray added: “This page has created a great and informative history on past and present events, community, and iniduals. “It shows so many dferent aspects of the beautul area we live in. It has reached out to so many in this dficult time from people living in the area to people with ancestral connections. “It has helped me and many others through lockdown just by reading the updates and seeing the beautul pictures.” The appetite for local history and news has been further strengthened as the Covid- restrictions have given people more time to learn about their surroundings. Roisin Cuskeran, admin of the Slieve Gallion page, says the communication it provides at this time is ‘vital’. “I think the page brings people together, gives them a forum for communication that’s vital especially in the current situation,” she said. “It gives them that sense of community and the security in knowing they are not going through this alone. “It’s helping to distract people from the topic of Covid also therefore helping their mental health and bringing together people from all over the world. “They all have a common connection- links to the Slieve Gallion Area - and because of this the members are helping each other cope with the reality of what is going on around us.” Jonathan Hudson, admin of the Magherafelt Facebook group, says he is amazed at the interest in local history. Im always amazed at peoples reactions to local history, just shows how little we were told in school, he said. Since lockdown, the numbers shot up over another  which was to be expected I suppose. However, people really embraced anything we did. I decided to do a musical tribute to the NHS, key workers and carers. It went brilliantly, dozens of local musicians and singers all sent in phone footage of two songs, including both local semi-finalists in this years The Voice, Brooke Scullion and Jonny Brooks. The video has just hit , views across social media so that tells its own story about how popular the page is. People are genuinely interested in how the town became what it is today. I tend to post the good and the bad, its all history and the one thing we can all learn from is our history.

It was a tough week for the stars, who lost the league cup final to Draperstown Celtic the previous Friday. Oxford dominated play for signicant periods of the game, they failed to capitalise on any chances which came their way and the Sky Blues were worthy winners, retaining the cup in the process. Magherafelt were appearing in the final for the fourth year in a row and made the better start. googletag.cmd.push Oxford had the best of the opening  minutes with Logue pulling most of the strings in the centre of midfield. However, despite the impressive approach play from the city side, the end product was lacking in quality. Magherafelt had a bit more success in the final third, with Walker having to react quickly to smother the ball at the feet of Dermot Larkin as the centre forward lined up a shot on the on the six yard line. Things were looking ominous for Stars as Magherafelt gradually took control of the game. Sky Blues deservedly took the lead in the  minute when Chris Brady sent an excellent low curling cross in from the left wing. Keeper Walker managed to get a hand to the ball but this played it into the path of an incoming Michael Collins who was able to stab the ball into the net. googletag.cmd.push With only seconds to half-time, James Bateson doubled their lead. In the th minute, Oxford centre forward Paul Doran had the chance to bring his side back into the game when the ball landed perfectly at his feet following a flicked-on head from a throw-in. However, his shot went high and wide. Frustration seemed to be getting the better of some Oxford players and midfielder Brian Rainey was sent off in the th minute for dissent. Magherafelt put the final nail in the coffin with two minutes to go when Dermot Larkin curled a superb shot from the edge of the box into the right hand corner of the Oxford goal. In the dying seconds Oxford managed to get a consolation goal when a free-kick but it was only a temporary blip for Magherafelt who made their way home over the Glenshane Pass with the cup.

As part of the Marathon Potential  cohort, I attended a two week training camp near Torre-Vieja, Spain, organised jointly by Athletics Northern Ireland and Athletics Ireland.I had the honour of going toe-to-toe with then NI marathon record holder, Paul Pollock, on the track.I also had the opportunity to spend time with Paul off-track, alongside Kevin Seaward, learning from two powerhouses of Irish marathon running and building on the advice we received from Stephen Scullion, in Belfast in early December.Most importantly, I made lasting friendships with my fellow Marathon Potential  athletes. The sense of community allowed me to really embrace the project.Setting a goal of putting two of us on the start line of the  Paris Olympics is very ambitious. As a younger athlete, I always felt like an underdog.This feeling, which I once perceived as a negative, has become one of my chief strengths. The goal of becoming an Olympian, which I have chased mdash still chasing mdash from an early age, has, at times seemed unattainable.However, as time has passed, I have grown to love the chase. I look forward to the next stage on this journey, in the company of the Marathon Potential  athletes and support staff, under the stewardship of my coach and mentor of  years, Richard Rodgers, and the band of local training partners.Our way of le has changed dramatically in the space of four months due to COVID-. I remember reading the news in January and having the unnerving feeling that it would not be the last time that I would do so.When I recorded a : personal best over the half marathon in Barcelona in mid-February, the virus was relatively undocumented in Europe. By mid March, I understood that I would not be racing for a long time.My biggest mdash and somewhat selfish mdash fear was that there would be a blanket ban on exercise. Nonetheless, the sanctions under which we are all living have forced me to reconsider the spirit in which I run.To those friends and family in the health service, who have been tackling the virus over the past six weeks, I am amazed beyond words. Thank you for what you are doing.As a PhD student I do not consider myself a key worker. I decided that I would follow lockdown protocol as strictly as possible to do my part. Double runs mdash two runs a day mdash have always been a staple part of my training, allowing me to hit the high mileage required to prepare for the marathon.Completing the same mileage across the week off one daily training session was initially challenging. However, I eventually adapted after two weeks of attrition. In the process, I learned that I benefit from the extra recovery time between runs. This pleasant surprise helped me come to terms with what seems like a more or less empty race calendar in .Athletes are creatures of habit. We are conditioned to race on a monthly or two-monthly basis. Having the options restricted has enabled me to focus on the process of training without looking too far ahead. It has reminded me that, despite thriving off pushing to my limits in races, I love the journey, equally as much.Yes, it is all about achieving in races, but also, to get there a long time is spent training mdash  years and counting. So we have to love the training too. A consequence of this has been that I have begun to pay attention to the finer details in training.When doing a hard workout, I set high standards for each and every repetition, be it focusing on my running form, my cadence or my composure in a strong headwind. I have been trying out new drills and core routines to break up the days.Beyond training itself, I have found myself looking after my kit better than I may have done in the past. This, strangely enough, has been one of the most fulfilling aspects of my day.Given the recent stint of unusually sunny and warmer April weather, I have been leaving my shoes to dry in the sun after runs. A friend recently told me that this is a standard practice in Japan, harnessing the heat of the sun to kill off microbes.It has become a bit of a ritual for me. My shoes fairly pound the roads, so I guess they deserve some respect for what they allow me to do. Seeing them propped against the wall lts my spirits.I can understand that many of you will be disappointed not to have run the Deep RiverRock Belfast City Marathon, but your chance to do so will come around again in September or the future.Anyone who is brave enough to step on the start line of a marathon is a special type of person, irrespective of fitness.More so those who run to raise money for a cause. It takes courage to do this. Bank that courage and build on it over the coming months. It is directly transferable to enduring the current crisis.I remember passing the -mile mark in the  Dublin Marathon. I was in a world of pain mdash itrsquos worth it when yoursquore on track for : mdash when I passed a sign that read lsquoWhat wall rsquoI knew then that I would be coming back to this distance time and again. Right now, I have to wait. We all have to wait. Runners are resilient. Focus on whatever training you can do right now and enjoy the journey..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 Dundrum.jpg","title":"Dundrum chef stars in Great British Menu final  ","story":"CHEF Alex Greene narrowly missed out on being crowned Champion of Champions at the Great British Menu banquet to honour  years of childrenrsquos literature.The Dundrum man admitted he was ldquogutted at not securing the final accolade for the best dish at the event ndash despite becoming the second chef to have got two dishes through to the final and the only Northern Ireland finalist ever to have done it.He lost out to double Michelin-starred chef Niall Keating whose fish dish was voted the best by the  diners, who included Alexrsquos mother, Glynis, his employer, Michael Deane, and Michaelrsquos we, former UTV presenter Kate Smith.However, he was being feted by local fans and well-wishers after the show came to an end on BBC on Friday night.The highly competitive  year-old wowed judges and guests with his starter and desert dishes - a potato and cheese sauce based dish inspired by CS Lewisrsquo book, The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe and a coconut and chocolate ganache dessert with edible rice pages and covers presented as a book inspired by Oliver Jeffersrsquo book, The Incredible Book Eating Boy.The event was held in early February, so Alex, who started his career off in the Buckrsquos Head restaurant in his home village, has had some time to reflect on his success.ldquoIrsquove been overwhelmed by the response Irsquove had from people on social media itrsquos been just mental, he said.ldquoItrsquos another achievement for me and itrsquos something I wanted to do for a long time. To get one dish is big, to get two dishes to the banquet is major as itrsquos only happened twice before and never for someone from Northern Ireland.ldquoAlthough I think everyone was shocked that I didnrsquot get Champion of Champions. A producer came afterwards to ask me how I felt about it and even Niall didnrsquot think he would get it.ldquoI was gutted to be honest. It couldnrsquot have been any closer and I did feel it after all the hard work I put into it. While I enjoyed the whole experience, I do regret not getting Champion of Champions. To me, not to get the whole thing, particularly after coming so far, was tough and hard to stomach. Itrsquos hard when I know the amount of effort I put in and then to get so close. But I know that I couldnrsquot had done anymore.Alex revealed that he worked seven days a week on perfecting his menu dishes for four months while maintaining his demanding job as chef at the Michelin-starred EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, the fine dining experience of the Michael Deane group, where he has worked for the last three years.ldquoWe started filming last November and I was working in the kitchen at Deanes every day, and even on Sundays when Irsquom normally off. The guys at work and Michael were absolutely amazing with their support as well as the local guys who produced the props for me, said Alex.Viewers saw that all the chefs were up against it at the banquet as they had to do all their own food preparation with the work being doubled for AlexldquoIt was a hard couple of days and it wasnrsquot all fun and games. We had to do all our own prep, there was a delay in starting as guests arrived late due to Storm Ciara and there was a lot of things that went wrong, like the power going off, that wasnrsquot shown, said Alex.ldquoI joked with the other two guys you can just put the effort into one dish and can make sure its absolutely perfect but Irsquove got two to doldquoThe profile of the programme and the scale of the guests and how well known they were made it feel more pressurised.Ten years ago, Alex moved on to Deanes in Belfast after the Bucks Head, where he was working when they first received the Michelin star under Derek Creagh. He later moved to work with Gordon Ramsay at Claridgersquos, followed by Petrus in London, then had a spell in New Zealand before moving closer to home to the Clf House Hotel in Waterford.There are great expectations on what Alex will do next in his career but he doesnrsquot feel that a change will happen so soon considering the impact of the coronavirus lockdown has had on restaurants.ldquoA lot of people have said to me that I should open my own restaurant, but the industry is in dire straits at the moment so itrsquos hard to know what will happen, said Alex. ldquoOf course, I have ideas of what I would like to do, but Michael gives me a  for what I want to do which I appreciate.

He also raised concern that a commitment to pay staff for the days they went on strike last December has not been delivered.In a detailed response mdash issued after last weekrsquos production deadline had passed ndash the South Eastern Trust said while the Covid- outbreak appeared to have reached a plateau within its hospitals, ldquothe incidents and challenges within the care sector continue to increase and the organisation is currently some distance from being able toto business as usual.The statement continues: ldquoWe are now considering a recovery plan for our elective, cancer and all other key services. This will include the services we can safely restore and by when.ldquoThere is also a global supply issue regarding anaesthetic, opioid and other medications.The shortage of these medications, amongst others, will have an impact on what services we can restore and how quickly.ldquoRoyal College guidelines for surgical specialities and endoscopy currently advise risk assessment and only performing very urgent procedures. This is due to the risk to the staff and also the patient attending hospital.ldquoThis is signicantly limiting the level of endoscopy we can carry out at this time. There are no plans to cease the reprocessing and maintenance of the endoscopy equipment in the Downe day procedure unit.The health trust insists that it is required to agree any recovery plan regionally to ensure equitable provision, explaining the bowel screening programme Mr Hazzard refers to has been suspended across Northern Ireland.ldquoOur priority will continue to be the safety of our patients and staff whilst we do this, said the health trust.ldquoThere is an ongoing requirement for additional staffing from across the organisation within the emergency departments at the Ulster and Lagan Valley hospitals which continue to have signicant and rising numbers of patients attending.ldquoBoth EDs have been separated into Covid- and non-Covid- spaces. The safe separation of patients requires the support of more staff, helping to reduce the likelihood of cross infection and facilitates the requirement for social distancing.The health trust says there is also a requirement to separate inpatient wards into Covid- and non-Covid- spaces at the Ulster, Lagan Valley and Downe hospitals which requires the support of more staff.ldquoUnfortunately, the Trust is also experiencing signicant numbers of staff absences at present. The reasons include self-isolation due to symptoms and shielding of vulnerable persons. This includes a high number of staff who work in the day procedure unit in the Downe Hospital, the statement continues.ldquoIn addition, we continue to work with colleagues in primary care, including the independent sector where there is an ongoing high level of pressure as a result of the virus.ldquoIn some cases, our staff have been providing care and support to the nursing and residential homes in the locality where the need is most acute. Supporting our colleagues within the care sector and the most vulnerable in our society is an absolute priority.The health trust insists that a commitment to pay staff travel time between the Downe and Ulster hospitals has not been rescinded and that eligible staff will receive a payment in lieu of travel time.In relation to strike pay, the Trust said Stormont health minister Robin Swann gave a commitment that pay deducted as a result of industrial action would be reinstated, with payments from the Business Services Organisation delayed as a result of Covid-.

It seems there is no scope for overlap in his framework. Letter to the editor : Johnston Press Resell \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...That said I really cannot discern where Rev Kirkland places himself in this labelling process.Despite his sweeping analysis, at the heart of any decision to close church buildings was a genuine desire to ensure that no congregational gathering could become a medium of transmission for Covid-.This is not rocket science. It is God-given common sense.Regrettable indeedRev Kirkland feels that such a measure was somehow ungodly. In my view it represents a wholly necessary and essential pastoral approach.Comparing us with the US is not overly helpful, given the immensity of their own situation. Rev Kirkland’s closing gambit is conjecture of the finest quality . I dare say God has plenty to say on the whole matter, but I would safely contend that promoting foolhardiness is not amongst it.Many churches, my own included, have resorted to online gospel witness during lockdown, with, it would seem, an engagement above and beyond that of any conventional attendance at church services. Granted, coming together again in our sacred spaces will be a great and wonderful blessing, butthis period has taught us anything it is that the Lord Christ has and will continue to use trials and testing for His glory. Not wholly spiritual, but nonetheless true ...you don’t realise what you take for granted until it’s not there.I have learned much under God about new ways of compassion and practical care of the flock in these dferent times ... ways that speak of Jesus without resort to mere bellowing for  minutes from a pulpit. Mind you a full gospel sermon is always non-negotiable!As to the work of solitary prayer not being an evangelical practice. Who decided that  Some elaboration is needed...as is a modicum of grace on the whole.My apologiesat any stage I have misunderstood any part of Rev Kirkland’s angst or postulation.Rev Mark W J Loney, The Rectory, Church of Ireland, Dungiven"},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/resources/images/11395154.jpg","title":"news","story":"Get involved with the news in your community Send your stories and photos now Residents’ concerns over anti-social bikers on Sully sports fields  d  document.getElementsByClassName.style.display  blockLoading...Most popular         ,Get the Morning Briefing newsletterView all newslettersPromoted Stories       Most popularCommentedLoading...Read more Contact UsNewslettersPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

total of £. million to NorthernIreland’s  councils by way of an “immediate intervention”.Speaking after the announcement was made, ABC Lord Mayor, Councillor Mealla Campbell said: “As a Council it is our priority during this crisis to protect and ensure the delivery of our basic services but like many other councils at this time, the future of these essential services such as bin collections, burials and street cleansing are threatened by loss of income“I therefore welcome this announcement of funding, which will provide some interim assistance from now until the end of June.”Editorial Image. : Other rd PartyCommunities Minister, Deirdre Hargey MLA said: “Despite the current COVID- pandemic, councils continue to play an essential role in deliveringpublic services, such as waste collection and disposal, community support, and provision of registration and cemeteryservices.“The restrictions that have been introduced, with the clear purpose of protecting le and ensuring out health service has not been overwhelmed, have created a severe financial challenge for our  councils as they have lost practically all of their self-generated income through the closure of council facilities.“This funding will help assist councils with their cash flow and support them in the delivery of the vital services they are providing to the community at this time.“It will also help ensure that they are ready to play their key role in our post-pandemic recovery and limit the financial impact on ratepayers going forward.”While the additional funding is welcomed, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council’s Lord Mayor said more will need to be done to ensure council’s can help communities to recover.“It is a first step but it is clear that further investment in local government will be required to ensure that Council are not only in a position to provide continuity of service to our ratepayers but that we are able to help our communities recover,” said the Lord Mayor.“The executive must look at longer term investment to support the financial resilience of our councils so that we are resourced to deliver on strategies for bespoke economic recovery and community support.“Councils will be in the frontline of transformation post COVID- and it is a priority that we are equipped to deal with the signicant body of work ahead.“Meanwhile a spokesperson for Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council said Council will continue to ensure vital public services are protected.“Council welcomes the announcement by Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey,
