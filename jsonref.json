With grateful hearts, we remember the many ways in which his long life has been a blessing to us. We have been inspired by his unwavering loyalty to our Queen, by his service to the Nation and the Commonwealth, by his courage, fortitude and faith. Our lives have been enriched through the challenges that he has set us, the encouragement that he has given us, his kindness, humour and humanity.

By his mighty power the clouds are piled up and the hailstones broken small. The crash of his thunder makes the earth writhe, and, when he appears, an earthquake shakes the hills. At his will the south wind blows, the squall from the north and the hurricane. He scatters the snow-flakes like birds alighting they settle like a swarm of locusts. The eye is dazzled by their beautiful whiteness, and as they fall the mind is entranced. He spreads frost on the earth like salt, and icicles form like pointed stakes. A cold blast from the north, and ice grows hard on the water, settling on every pool, as though the water were putting on a breastplate. He consumes the hills, scorches the wilderness, and withers the grass like fire. Cloudy weather quickly puts all to rights, and dew brings welcome relief after heat. By the power of his thought he tamed the deep and planted it with islands.

We spoke to the experts to find out. Q: If I’m displaying symptoms, do I still need to isolate?“The most important thing is to follow the law, so if you’ve got symptoms you have to self-isolate for 10 days in your home and it’s really important people continue to do this,” says Dr Shaun Fitzgerald, director of the Centre for Climate Repair at the University of Cambridge and a member of the UK government Science Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE). “There may perhaps be people who think: ‘Well, why can’t I go for a walk outside in the countryside if I’m not going to see anybody?’, and I completely understand that argument. But there are millions of people living in apartments and if they were to venture outside, they’d be sharing corridors and stairwells and touching multiple surfaces. We can’t have one rule for one and another rule for others. It’s about the risks to the wider society and my personal view is that the rules are proportionate and very reasonable. Especially when you compare 10 days of isolation with the lockdowns we’ve already been in – it’s a small ask comparatively.” Q: Is it really safe to socialise outside?“When we are outdoors, thinking about the airborne route of transmission, the level of concentration of any virus in our vicinity is much lower and so the risk is lower too,” says Fitzgerald, who also specialises in airflow research. “The amount of outdoor air that’s sweeping away any virus being emanated from a person is enormous, and we can’t begin to practically replicate that kind of environment within an indoor environment.” Q: Won’t opening the windows have the same effect?“Opening the windows is great if you’re indoors but it’s nowhere near as good as being outdoors,” says Fitzgerald. “Think about it, when you’re stood outside, it’s very rare that it’s perfectly still – there’s usually a very small wind and when you run the numbers and figure out the volume flux of air passing you that’s not virus-laden, it’s enormous. When you’re outside, there are fewer surfaces for you to touch which, for example, somebody might have coughed on. Surface touching risks are also lower outdoors because things such as the rain and ultraviolet light from the sun can deactivate the virus more easily than in a dark, indoor environment.” Q: How safe is outdoor swimming or group sports?“Outdoor sports are relatively low risk but I would encourage people to also think about their overall wellbeing, including mental health, when it comes to the risks you’re exposing yourself to as you enter into society,” says Fitzgerald. She adds: “This isn’t purely about the virus – we also need to think about the wider impacts of isolation, loneliness and a lack of socialisation. It’s about balancing those risks.” Q: How can we keep safe as we start to socialise in larger groups?“One of the challenges as we start seeing friends and family is that it’s incredibly difficult for people to maintain a social distance from loved ones,” says Rogers. “And if you have young children it’s very difficult to explain to them why they’re not allowed to crawl over everyone or play with the other children. If you’re meeting up with another household or group, try to plan it in an environment that is as safe as possible. Have those honest conversations now – people are more willing and likely to stick to plans that are made in advance.” Q: If we’ve had the vaccine, do the rules still apply?“The vaccines are amazing and one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs of a generation, but they’re not a silver bullet,” says Rogers. “Think about somebody who has had bypass surgery because their diet and exercise were poor. They can have that medical fix, but if they don’t change their behaviours, they’ll never realise their full potential. I see vaccines in the same way – they’re a powerful weapon we can deploy against the virus but they’re only going to reach their full potential if we wrap these other behavioural elements around them.” Q: How can we make our homes safer for visitors when they’re allowed to pass through to gardens?“Keep the windows open and if you’ve got two bathrooms, have one toilet for guests and one for the household,” suggests Fitzgerald. “If not, can you provide two towels – one for guests, one for others? Ventilating the house before and after your guests have arrived is key – ventilating before they arrive is helpful in case you happen to have an infectious person in your vicinity, therefore reducing the risk to your guests. Ventilating after guests have left is important because if one of them happens to be infectious, this will reduce the risk to your own household.” And remember, it’s not permitted for people to meet indoors until 17 May – when six people or two households will be able to come together. Q: Is there anything else we should remember?“While we’re still in this reasonably precarious state, the most important thing is to think: ‘It’s not about me, it’s about others,’” says Fitzgerald. “It’s about the wider community. Certainly in the first lockdown, we got the sense of real selflessness in society and we need to try to remember these measures aren’t just in place to protect you as an inidual, it’s about thinking of others. Particularly as we emerge from lockdown – since, the more compliant we are now, the quicker the incident rate is going to come down and the sooner society can start functioning again. So it’s really about trying to get out of this as quickly as we can, which means complying with the rules as much as possible.” This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

I didn’t think about the terroir of grape-growing, the nose of whisky or what wine to pair with raw tilapia. On sunny days, I just thought about the most enjoyable way to quench my thirst. Now, the clank of a metal bottle opener and the hiss of a cold Thatchers Cider opening is enough to bring me back to the Meadows in Edinburgh, for a post-lecture picnic with friends. Stretched out on the grass as the rays warm my skin, the air is filled with the smoky smell of barbecue. Summer walks have been made all the sweeter with a sip of cider at the end. Arriving at a sweep of beach, blanket at the ready, or settling at the end of a pier as the sun sets. The cool fizz of cider tickling down my throat while the sky streaks violet and hazy pink is an unbeatable feeling. On an emotional level, clinking bottles with a friend at the end of the day is the perfect reward. On a practical level, a couple of bottles of ice-cold Thatchers in your rucksack on the way to the sea cools your back – ideal. Cider is the taste of a barbecue with my family – the only way we were allowed to see each other in summer 2020. My dad cooked venison burgers for the first time, an attempt to impress me, the “food and drink writer”, making jokes about not wanting a bad review. Despite the burger buns being a bit frozen in the middle, I gave it 1010. The sun was shining, family was gathered, the cider was flowing and for a brief second it felt like normality again. The epitome of the “better times” we’re all looking forward to. I can’t always suppress the drinks writer in me and did have to note that the iron-y tang of venison burgers goes particularly well with the light sweetness of Thatchers Katy. On the slopes of the Mendip Hills, Thatchers grows 458 different varieties of apple in perfect conditions – more than 25 varieties of them are used for ciders. The autumnal rain, summer sun and lack of winter frost combine to create juicy, flavour-filled apples. They have a cider for every taste bud: sharp and cloudy, sweet and pink. As a drinks writer, I’ve sampled more ciders than I care to remember. Thatchers Katy is the choice for sunny days and balmy nights. While Thatchers’ other ciders are made from a combination of different types of apple, Thatchers Katy is made from just one type. Red as a fairytale apple and sweet as strawberries, Katy apples are the pride of the crop and first to be run through the mill. It’s what you want to be drinking to get that real thirst-quenching moment, with only a hint of sweetness that doesn’t overpower. It sits between sweet and dry, with a crisp finish, so it’s incredibly drinkable. Being an apple-based drink, it goes best with anything pork. But its lightness also carries well with salads and summer food. Think charcuterie boards laden with spicy salami, salty prosciutto, and garlicky mortadella. The slight sweetness to Thatchers Katy cuts through the saltiness of prosciutto beautifully. Hand-held picnic food – scotch eggs, sausage rolls, and pork pies – tends to be savoury-heavy, so goes down a treat with a sweet cider, paired best with a sunset view, of course. But it also mixes well with fruity dishes – a salad sprinkled with glistening pomegranate seeds and topped with ripe avocado. The delicate fizz works particularly well with the creamy squish of avocado. Meat and salad, barbecues and picnic food it’s as though Thatchers Katy was designed for summer. So, it’s no wonder cider is the British summer drink of choice it pairs naturally with grilled meat and fruity salads, it’s easy to drink, and that hit of sweet apple sings of good times. For me, cider evokes memories of barbecues with friends and family, sunsets over the sea and picnics in the park, and Thatchers Katy is my cider of choice this summer, for its strawberry sweetness and crisp finish. If you need me, I’ll be sipping a cold cider in the park, or on my way to the shore, two bottles clinking away and cooling my back. To better times.

If he has a better career than his doppelganger Ian Ronald Bell, I’ll be a happy man. He’s got time and talent on his side, so anything’s possible.”Essex lead reaches 132 - Allison 43 not out, Cook 21 not out. But does this mean batting is suddenly easy? Shall we spin it as good news for Durham? And Steven Croft reaches fifty, off 99 balls, five fours and a hand in a couple of run-outs. “Hello, Sorry about the terrible pun, but Yorkshire’s opener is enjoying a Lyth-ly (works as lively or lovely) start to the season as the top run scorer so far and with an impressive strike rate of 70.  “Is he trying to put in a Chris Rogers style late career bid to get back into the test team, or gunning for the 1000 runs before the end of May, or both? Either way, an opener with a bit more dash might compliment Sibley in the test side and scoring quickly now might negate missed opportunities due to bad spring weather in his stab for 1000 runs before June!” Just checking, before I press send, and Lyth is definitely till there 79 not out (Yorks lead over Kent 239).Wow, Ian Holland has got a hurry on, 143 not out, while Sam Northeast, who beat him to 100, is 118 not out.

It’s nice to have it trending on Twitter after the winter I’ve had but it’s nice just to play cricket.” Round the grounds, we’re expecting a result at the Rose Bowl after Sam Northeast and Ian Holland ground salt into the wound opened by Mohammad Abbass’s (un)believable 6-11 against Middlesex. Lancs are very on top against Northants, the Yorkies slept happy against Kent, Sussex batting out of their skins against Glamorgan, even stevens at Taunton and hundreds a-waiting to be collected by Pope and Foakes at Surrey, and Hameed and Clarke at Trent Bridge as Notts stare down that rare beast victory.

Since then, over 200,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,000 people have died.Globally, over 100 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 64 different vaccines in clinical development, with another 173 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva. 325,243 had received their second dose.Some 192,095 of these vaccines had gone to people in long term residential care facilities, while 347,313 had gone to frontline healthcare workers and 478,879 had gone to people over the age of 70. Some\u0026nbsp76,331 people in Cohort 4 - those\u0026nbspaged between 16 and 69 at very high risk of severe Covid-19 disease - received a dose.\u0026nbspGlobally, over 800 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have been administered.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine. \u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?In December the HSE published the provisional order in which people in Ireland will be vaccinated against Covid-19. After over-65s in care homes and frontline health workers, people aged 70 and older and other healthcare workers are next in line to receive the vaccine.\u0026nbspPeople aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions will then be\u0026nbspthe fourth cohort to be vaccinated.On March 30th, the Cabinet agreed to change the National Vaccination Programme to an age-based system, once those aged 70 years and older, people considered vulnerable and those with underlying conditions are immunised. The original programme involved 15 cohorts of people based on age and profession, with key workers prioritised.The vaccination of people aged over 85 began on Monday, February 15th. Those in the 70-84 age bracket began to receive their first dose on March 8th, alongside people aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions.The HSE has said everyone over the age of 70 should have received their second dose by mid-May.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"hse cautions against switching vaccine focus to younger groups","story":"HSE boss Paul Reid says all the medical and scientific advice is to administer the Covid-19 vaccine based on age. Photograph: Leon FarrellPhotocall IrelandHSE director general Paul Reid has said he was unaware of any proposal to change the vaccination priority list and stressed that the HSE was continuing to work on the list that focuses on older cohorts and medically vulnerable groups.Senior officials at the Health Service Executive (HSE) have stressed that prioritising Covid-19 vaccinations for people based on their age remains the best approach if the aim of the inoculation programme is “harm reduction”.“That is where the highest risk is,” said Mr Reid. “That is the plan we are working through right now.” He said that if the Government changed tack, then the HSE would change its plans accordingly but added that “all the medical and scientific advice… is to administer it based on age”.Both Mr Reid and HSE chief clinical officer Colin Reid said the programme was continuing to be rolled out as planned with older people first in line followed by younger age groups. Mr Donnelly said he had asked officials to examine the possibility of revising the order of age cohorts scheduled to receive the vaccine so that younger people in the 18-30 age group would get their shots once those in their 60s are vaccinated.Some senior officials fear a spike in cases among younger people once society begins to reopen, as under-30s are more likely than other age groups to socialise together in large numbers. “I’ve asked the department to assess the case for vaccinating younger cohorts earlier, on the basis of reducing overall transmission as quickly as possible,” Mr Donnelly told The .“The risk for someone in their 60s or even 50s is substantially greater,” than for people in their 20s or he told Saturday with Katie Hannon. On Saturday morning a spokesman for the Minister said that “issues like this are constantly being reviewed to ensure the vaccination programme is as effective as possible, just like with dose intervals, distribution channels and so forth.” He said that any change “would require a Government decision and no such memo is currently being prepared. Specifically regarding sequencing by age, Niac stated on March 29th that evidence on transmission is limited. Reduced transmission would be the primary rationale for moving to those in their late teens and early 20s.”Ireland’s 14-day incidence of the disease now stands at 119 cases per 100,000 people nationally.A further 11 deaths of Covid-19 patients were reported by the National Public Health Emergency Team on Friday.

This will include non-essential retail and personal services.Taoiseach Micheál Martin has indicated that the month of June could see the reopening of hotels and guesthouses. Sources said a plan for the resumption of outdoor hospitality is currently being worked on before indoor hospitality returns, but firm dates have not yet been set.Intensive discussions are taking place about further changes to the vaccination programme. Though it is understood there is significant resistance to the move from some public health doctors and vaccination experts, there is a push from the political side of Government to extend the interval between doses of the vaccine.This would enable more people to benefit from the protection offered by a first shot of the vaccine, an approach that has helped the United Kingdom reach huge numbers of people with an initial dose. The Department of Health is currently carrying out an impact analysis of widening the interval beyond the current four weeks.Meanwhile, amid ongoing frustration over the political and practical difficulties associated with mandatory hotel quarantine, some senior Government figures believe exemptions to the system may grow to include issues such as family bereavement, surrogacy, family illness and essential work, and that increased testing will go hand in hand with a greater role for home quarantine and less reliance on the hotel system.The Government is understood to be considering plans to recognise vaccine certificates from other jurisdictions as grounds for exemption from hotel quarantine – but only for vaccines approved by the European Medicines Agency.Earlier on Friday, it was announced by the department that the Red Cow Moran Hotel has been added to the locations to be used for the mandatory hotel quarantine.Hotel quarantineMeanwhile, the European Commission has given Ireland 10 days to respond to a letter outlining “concerns” about mandatory hotel quarantine.It comes after Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy and France were added to the so-called “red list”, provoking a furious reaction from ambassadors.The commission has asked for clarification on how countries are selected for the red list, as the five are not the areas with the highest infection rates in the European Union.In a statement on Friday, the department said that the expert travel advisory group takes into account countries with outbreaks involving known variants of concern, countries with a very high 14-day incidence and countries with a high 14-day incidence.Ireland’s 14-day incidence of the disease now stands at 119 cases per 100,000 people nationally.A further 11 deaths of Covid-19 patients were reported by the National Public Health Emergency Team on Friday.

Brussels, London and Dublin agreed to work together towards solutions following unrest in Northern Ireland.The agreement was reached in a series of meetings on Thursday aimed at putting relations on a “constructive” footing after a difficult start for the North’s post-Brexit arrangements.European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic and his British counterpart Lord David Frost held a dinner meeting in Brussels intended to provide “a political steer for follow-up discussions that will take place between both teams”, said a commission spokesman.It came as the British and Irish governments agreed to a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC) in the coming months to discuss issues of concern in Northern Ireland.“We haven’t agreed a date yet but certainly I think the governments are in agreement that there should be a BIIGC meeting and I think we’ll continue to talk about the appropriate time for that,” Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney told The . Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis earlier this week dismissed the idea that the intergovernmental conference should meet to discuss recent unrest in the North, on the grounds that policing is among the powers devolved to Stormont. The intergovernmental conference was established under the Belfast Agreement as a forum for co-operation between the two governments on Northern Ireland. It has not met since Boris Johnson became British prime minister.Mr Coveney was in London holding meetings with key political figures including Lord Frost, in what Mr Coveney described as “a very good meeting . . . on a personal level” and “a good, honest engagement that explored in some detail some of the issues in terms of what’s possible and what’s not”.Brussels and London remain far apart on some issues, with Britain seeking flexibility while the commission has said pragmatic solutions can be found only if the Northern Ireland protocol is implemented fully. The European Parliament has yet to ratify the EU-UK trade deal, which is in place provisionally until the end of the month.

Showing support for terrorist organisations is not acceptable and if you do that, you should expect to be investigated by us.”Chief Inspector Jon Carter, from Sussex Police, added: “This case shows the importance of thorough investigation of any use of the Internet to spread hate and dangerous material. “The public can be reassured that there are systems in place to follow up all such reports, but it is also important to reassure local people that this was a very isolated matter for this area, and that however obnoxious Powell’s language was, there was no reference to or threat to the local community.”   Powell is due to be sentenced at Portsmouth Crown Court on 14 May. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"loathing english unites alba snp ahistorical self pity","story":"The Alba Party released its first party political advertisement this week. And it was as enjoyable as you would have expected. For in it Alex Salmond’s new party showed its desire to go forward into the 21st century by going back to the 14th. The whole advert focused on Robert the Bruce. Indeed, to a background of pipe-music and soaring images of the Scottish mountain-scape, it pretended that the broadcast was actually delivered by Robert the Bruce, who has been summoned back from the dead to do voice-over work.But then the script writers seemed to lose themselves in the detail. Facing another defeat we are told that King Robert ordered his “camp followers” to go away to Gillies Hill. Why? Were they getting on his nerves? We are then told of The Bruce delivering a “fresh demonstration of people power by the small folk of Scotland”. A decent editor would have pointed out that this summons up images not of a mighty army crashing down on their opponents but rather of the king cruelly sending his most diminutive followers into battle first. Something from The Hobbit at best.What this tale inevitably builds up to is the tall claim that this early demonstration of people power ended up being “the straw which broke the spine of English superiority”. The English commander ended up fleeing “south”. A word almost spat out by the Bruce impersonator. We then have a few more soaring images of King Robert’s statue, are told by him that “I was there” and then informed that “Alba will unite the clans”. Which is why you should vote for the Alba party if you are lucky enough to have a vote in Scotland on May 6th.Of course the ethno-nationalism of this claim has quite a number of flaws. But all such potential trouble is avoided by the detail being as portentous and vague as possible. Alex Salmond is digging as deep as he can dig in order to rally the Scottish public to his side. His fallout with the SNP was as sordid and degrading as it is possible to be. Now he will rouse himself – and, he hopes, his followers – by appealing to the grandiose and the historic. No more talk of who groped whose knee after which ceilidh. From now it will be Bannockburn all over again, with the portly, sweaty, unlikely figure of Alex Salmond erecting himself to lead the charge.As is usually the case with ethno-nationalists, all this is at once ridiculous, bathetic and sinister. The most crucial component, as in all Scots nationalism, is self-pity. It is all about the Scottish people somehow being held down. As though the English with their “superior” attitudes somehow keep down the little folk of Scotland, and that if only the English could be sent packing then the little folks would again be free to do unbelievably great things. What are these things? Are they things that keep the Scots within the bounds of their traditions (kilt-weaving, sword-dancing, haggis-making?) or are they things that allow the Scots to roam the world and leave a great impression wherever they go? It is not clear. All that is clear is that the Scots can neither breathe out nor breathe in because of the presence of the English. And that as long as any Scotsman or woman feels remotely unhappy in this life, they can blame it on the haughty English coming up here with their fancy ways.It would be nice if this ugly terrain were being fought over only by Salmond and his small-band of renegades. But of course Salmond is only reaching for the same bogus historical endorsements as his one-time friend and protégé Nicola Sturgeon. The SNP indulges in the same pseudo-historical nonsense whenever it can. Sturgeon rejoices in presenting herself as one of the little people having to battle the mighty English forever rallying at their camp in Westminster. And while Sturgeon herself is motivated by nothing but hatred of the English, she and her party love to present themselves as actually being the party of all things lovely and progressive. Indeed among the claims made in the SNP’s manifesto for next month’s election is that the party aims to create a Scotland of “compassion, equality and love”, as if that is in the gift of any government.There are a hundred things that the SNP needs to do and could do. For instance they could sort out poverty in the East End of Glasgow or address Scotland’s declining education standards. But like Alba they will do no such thing. Why would they when they have the easier option of bloviating about “the year of our Lord 1314” now and until the end of time?Douglas Murray is the author of ‘The Madness of Crowds’More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph weekly news quiz royal described duke edinburgh legend","story":"In the week that Britain mourned the passing of the Duke of Edinburgh, the \u0027s weekly news quiz is here to find out how closely you have been paying attention to this week\u0027s headlines.As tributes from around the world came pouring in for Prince Philip, which of his grandchildren described the Duke as a legend of banter?In the House of Commons, an MP told how, upon receiving his gold Duke of Edinburgh’s Award from the man himself, he told Prince Philip he had learned to drive as part of the course, to which the Duke inquired: “Four horses or six?” Which MP shared the touching story? If you\u0027ve been reading this week\u0027s  Front Page newsletters you will have come across all of the answers to the quiz.

What’s perhaps less appreciated, though, is how much he enjoyed a gentle joke at his own expense.I discovered this for myself 15 years ago. In my role as the ’s front page cartoonist for the last 30-odd years, occasionally the subjects of my jokes will get in touch and ask for the original artwork. I’ve sent cartoons to prime ministers, celebrities and all manner of other public figures, but until April 2006, never to Buckingham Palace.That month, the Queen turned 80, and received some 20,000 birthday cards. I don’t often draw cartoons about the Royal family, but it felt appropriate to mark the occasion. And so I did, with this cartoon depicting two footmen perusing cards displayed on a mantelpiece in the Palace:I didn’t think much of it, though a reader got in touch to lightly admonish me for being disgracefully disrespectful in joking about the Queen’s age. Not long afterwards, however, I received a letter from the Palace, stating that they loved the cartoon and someone – I think the subtext was “someone very senior” – had requested I send the original. Enjoyably, I was able to tell the disgruntled reader that I was sorry they’d been offended, but if it was any comfort, the butt of the joke clearly felt otherwise…That moment was a thrill, but a while later I was invited to lunch at Buckingham Palace. It was me, five or six other people, the Duke and the Queen. I was petrified, as anyone in that position might be, but the nerves only lasted while we waited for their arrival. When they entered the room, the tension seemed to dissipate. I expect that’s the effect they have on a lot of people – in anticipation, they’re terrifying in reality, their great skill is putting a room instantly at ease.I was seated next to Prince Philip, who was exactly as you might imagine: funny, charming, relaxed, mildly cantankerous. Everybody else was served wine but, as was often his wont at lunchtime, he had a beer. I was a little jealous – I quite fancied a beer, too, but changing my order probably wouldn’t have been the done thing.Funnily enough, there was a boat stuck on a sandbank outside of Portsmouth that week – not unlike the recent Suez Canal logjam. The Duke, with all his naval expertise, was explaining at length just what the crew had done wrong, putting them straight on this and that, and generally proving that, even in his mid-80s, his maritime knowledge was undimmed.I also recall a wonderful rant about all the banquets he’s had to attend around the world. In some places, the Duke told me, the staff would even move his cutlery for him, and he found that infuriating. “I’m perfectly capable of moving my own fork when I want it,” he huffed. In a way, it would have been disappointing to lunch with Prince Philip and not hear him bluster.When lunch came to an end, I was asked if I would have coffee with the Queen. (I say asked at those sorts of events, who you speak to is largely based on instruction from staff.)In another room, as I gingerly drank a cup of black coffee, the Queen told me how the geese were ruining her lawn at Sandringham. I suggested she have William and Harry shoot them, which made her laugh. At the time, I hadn’t yet moved to Norfolk, which is a shame, as then I could have said: “We must have you to ours next…”The Queen later remembered my grandfather, VS Pritchett, to whom she awarded membership to the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1992, and seemed thrilled to have worked out that connection. I have been on a high ever since that day. I think I floated back to the office afterwards, but do remember bumping into a colleague in the street who asked if I’d been out to lunch. Had I ever…Throughout his life, Prince Philip was an enthusiastic supporter of cartoons. In 1949, he and the young Princess Elizabeth attended the Royal Society of Arts and listened to a speech by HM Bateman, the great Punch cartoonist, as he called for a national museum of cartoons. It must have left an impression since the Duke later opened the Cartoon Museum’s first permanent site in 2006, and was patron for over 20 years.He really did. He was a  reader, and while I made several jokes at his expense over the years – one, after he retired from public duties in 2017, was simply a plaque reading, “UNVEIL YOUR OWN DAMN PLAQUE” another, after his minor car crash the following year, showing a scrap metal dealer selling “Royal souvenirs” – he always seemed to like my cartoons.In 2018, when I celebrated my 30th anniversary on the paper, he even sent a short tribute.“Successful cartoonists do not only need to be able to draw, they have to think of subjects to illustrate,” he wrote. “Matt has shown that he has a genius for both, as well as the ability to think of wonderfully appropriate swipes at the idiocies of contemporary life.”It was already an amazing day, and I was already a big fan of the Duke, but the shock and honour of having him suggest he was even slightly a fan of mine left me a little lost for words. He was a man who knew the value of good humour, both to puncture the tension of a room and as a way of diluting the serious business of life, and he was a fine exponent of it.The country is far poorer for the Duke’s passing, but one way we might carry on his legacy is to keep on having a good laugh. He wouldn’t have wanted us to stay sombre for long.To own your own Matt print, visit telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178As told to Guy KellyMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uk universities must pick side britain beijing","story":"In 2017, when Chris Heaton-Harris, then a Government whip, wrote to universities with an anodyne request for information about the content of teaching on Brexit, his letter was described as “sinister” and “McCarthyite”. But though British universities like to make a noisy fuss about accepting any interference from the democratically elected British Government - that, incidentally, funds and regulates them - they are perfectly happy to accept the most chilling interference from one dictatorial regime abroad.   Already, more than a dozen British universities have established Chinese-funded Confucius Institutes, where they agree not to participate in activities that are inconsistent with the Chinese state’s missions. And a 2019 report from the Foreign Affairs Committee found evidence of academics being pressured into cancelling events critical of China.    But China is no longer satisfied with mere silence from Western institutions.   Angered by the chorus of global condemnation for its genocide in Xinjiang, and other human rights abuses, the CCP has set to work extracting statements of support for its activities in the province. In recent weeks it has secured them - both from German fashion brand Hugo Boss, and the Japanese retailer Muji.  Meanwhile those that have not praised cotton forcibly produced by Uyghurs have seen their businesses in China crushed.  It seems impossible that British universities, which are just as financially dependent on China as these fashion brands, will be immune from such requests to act as propagandists for the CCP.   Indeed, some already seem to have acquiesced. In 2020, Jesus College Cambridge produced a report, funded by Huawei, calling for reforms to the global governance of telecommunications standards. And it is not only free speech that is jeopardised by our universities’ dependency on China. So too, is our national security.   Last month, the  reported that Chinese academics – including those with ties to the Peoples’ Liberation Army – have conducted research on behalf of MI5, the real-life Q-Branch, and the Ministry of Defence’s R\u0026ampD ision.  Likewise, we know British universities – including Oxford and Cambridge – have partnered with the Chinese armed forces on research into the most sensitive of military technology. Despite the damning indictment of such incidents, despite the countless column inches of bad publicity, so far university administrators seem unwilling to act.The UK government needs to do more to make sure that universities are spending their funds in line with British interests, not Beijing’s. The Government has at last taken some steps, such as increasing screening for Chinese academics in sensitive areas through the ATAS programme, and beefing up the responsibilities of the Office for Students. But it is not enough. Boris Johnson and his ministers need to set out unequivocally that universities are not free to dance to the tune of China while receiving British taxpayers’ money. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"crumbling faith no10s covid policies turning public conspiracy","story":"So which is it? Is the UK vaccine rollout a stunning, world-beating success – resulting in the radical reduction of cases, hospital admissions and deaths which can be seen clearly in the daily recorded figures? Or is it largely irrelevant to what progress has been made in defeating the spread of the virus? Is it actually the case (verbatim from the Prime Minister): “that the reduction in hospitalisations and in deaths and in infections has not been achieved by the new vaccination programme”? It depends on whether you listen to Boris Johnson before or after the middle of last week.Until Black Tuesday, when the Prime Minister, for reasons known only to himself and presumably the person (or people) who told him to say it, decided to trash his own Government’s greatest triumph – thus not only committing a bizarre act of political self-harm but, more seriously, attempting to undermine public morale and national pride – the British vaccine programme was seen as a modern miracle.It was an unprecedented achievement not just of scientific research, but of the dedication of medical staff, the public-spirited voluntary efforts of thousands of ordinary people, and the willing cooperation of the great majority of the population who made the rational, responsible decision to accept vaccination. Not only was what Mr Johnson said on that last fateful Tuesday damaging to confidence in this most crucially important Government policy, but it was factually wrong – as any number of public health officials and medical experts queued up immediately to make clear.What on earth was he thinking? And since he does not make pronouncements of this kind without consultation – what on earth were the motives of those presumed “experts” who must have advised him to make it? (Who were obviously not the ones who leapt into the arena to contradict him.) The context is important: the Prime Minister was comparing the impact of the vaccination programme with that of lockdown, claiming that the former was negligible (indeed, virtually non-existent) by comparison with the latter.Maybe this is the key. He was trying to rescue the viability of lockdown which might otherwise have lost its force in the great vaccine rollout exultation. That argument might have been convincing if he had said that, in the legitimate national celebration over vaccinations, we must not lose sight of the need to maintain those lockdown restrictions which are still necessary at present...blah-blah. But he didn’t say that.What he did say seemed to imply that no vaccination programme – however comprehensive – could provide a solution to the problem and a return to genuine (not “new”) normal life. And that is a direct contradiction to what was popularly understood to be the promise from the medical and scientific experts who told us – way back in the era when our lives were first taken away – that the only ultimate answer to this dilemma lay in finding a vaccine.Now we have not just “a vaccine” but a quiverful of them, all of which seem to be remarkably effective – more so than most of the vaccines used against other diseases (even though the broadcast media insist that every new variant may, just possibly, prove resistant, etc etc). Could this be part of the problem? Were the experts taken by surprise when this sudden avalanche of vaccines arrived on the scene so quickly that they felt in danger of losing control of the discourse – and their ability to hold down public expectations?The most charitable explanation of Mr Johnson’s comment, and presumably the advice that drove it, is that some of the people in charge believed there was a real risk that the optimism would get out of hand and the whole apparatus of regulation would collapse. In their panic, they urged him to say something that was misleading, illogical and self-defeating: in effect, encouraging vaccine scepticism and undermining the Government’s own “get the jab” campaign.But in the longer term, this unfortunate and gratuitous intervention could do greater damage than any immediate effect it might have on vaccine take-up. (In fact, this appears to be negligible: people are just as eager for the jabs as ever, partly because they have been told they might not be able to travel or get into the pub without them.)In the last week, I have heard more people express serious suspicion about the Government’s authoritarian motives than at any time since this whole crisis began. Because the Prime Minister himself seemed to fling the whole question of vaccine efficacy out of the window – when it had once been presented as the be-all and end-all of pandemic solutions – there is now grave disquiet among sensible, thinking parts of the population about where this is all going and what is driving it.What would once have been thought the stuff of cult paranoia is now commonplace conversation in socially enlightened circles. The most common refrain is to the effect that either the Government and its experts were lying then, or they are lying now: that there is something sinister about their desire to maintain a pretext for totalitarian measures.For what it is worth, I personally do not believe that there is a cabal of Maoists at the top level of the Government who wish to maintain repressive social controls forever. But I am finding it harder and harder to argue with the people who do. There is now a real sense that frightening the population into obedience is more important than telling the truth, and that faith in the Government’s promises – even in a crisis – is for mugs.There is one possible explanation which is less diabolical but equally destructive: that the Government has taken account of the fear that still prevails in the country and wants to address it. To those who tell the opinion polls that they do not want to be set free yet, reassurance is being offered.But anxiety is a natural (indeed, essential) part of the human apparatus. It cannot be extirpated but it can be inflamed to levels which eventually destroy the prospect of social well-being. Cancelling optimism is a dangerous game.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"time end sleaze says woman bidding become first female mayor","story":"With a mix of shock and indignation, New Yorkers have watched on as an ever-expanding sex scandal has threatened to bring down some of its highest-profile politicians. Woman after woman has come forward in recent weeks with torrid allegations of harassment and abuse - not only against the three-term governor Andrew Cuomo, but a host of others too.Enter Maya Wiley, who has positioned herself as an antidote to the toxic male politics and hopes the current charged climate will pave the way for the first woman mayor in New York\u0027s history when the city goes to the polls in the coming weeks.“RIght now we are at an inflection point and it’s time for a shakeup,” Ms Wiley, a black civil rights attorney who is currently leading the pack, told The Sunday  from the campaign trial. “I’m unapologetically running as a woman and I’m unapologetically going to say it is our time. “I’m going to call this out and say why it matters that we be seen as leaders,” said 57-year-old Ms Wiley.The allegations have shocked some. The women have accused the 63-year-old governor of inappropriate touching, of showering them with unwanted affection, and of creating a generally uncomfortable working environment for female employees. Mr Cuomo, who is facing an investigation, has denied the claims.A recent New York Times article, meanwhile, described the state capitol as having a college campus atmosphere”, a veritable hotbed of sexual impropriety.A top official is said to have projected a photograph of a female colleague in a bikini during a meeting she was attending. One young aide accused an older senator of telling her she looked like a “Bond girl” as they sat together in the chamber.  For many others - particularly those who have been deeply entrenched in New York politics over the years - they came as no surprise. “This really is about something wider, it’s about an old male guard holding on to power rather than understanding what this country is today and who is in it,” said Ms Wiley, who has been one of a handful of the 15 or so declared Democratic candidates to publicly call for Mr Cuomo’s resignation. “I know what it’s like to sit across the table from a boss who asks you if you believe in monogamy,” she said recently, sharing a MeToo story of her own with her tens of thousands of followers on Instagram. “So many have been in the shoes of these women. I promise you now, I will never fail to call it out when I see it.”New York has had 109 mayors but never a woman - and only one black man - making it an anomaly among the US’s more progressive cities. Chicago, Washington DC, Seattle, San Francisco, Atlanta and Las Vegas are currently all run by women. Some of them elected their first female mayors as far back as the Seventies.New York pundits have their own theories about why it is so challenging for women running for office. “I’m not sure we’re as progressive in New York as we like to think we are,” said Dianne Morales, another mayoral hopeful. Ms Wiley agreed.The city, with its some nine million residents living cheek-by-jowl, is known for its competitive, sharp-elbows culture, and politicians like Mr Cuomo (whose slogan is “New York Tough”), have long played to that masochism. “It is hard because we\u0027ve got a long history of not seeing women and women of all races and colours as leaders,” Ms Wiley said. 2021 is their time to come forward and shine.Ms Wiley, who has raised the most money of all the female candidates, has been polling behind the current frontrunner, Andrew Yang - a tech millionaire who made a short-lived run for president in 2020.Mr Yang, 46, is also hoping to stomp new ground by becoming the first Asian mayor, at a time when anti-Asian sentiment has never been higher in the city. He has focused on economic revival, pushing for “vaccine passports” to get businesses reopened and commuters back to offices.Opponents have accused him of being a fair-weather New Yorker, however, after he admitted to abandoning his family\u0027s “small” two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan for Upstate during the worst of the pandemic.Ms Wiley’s team believes his early lead has more to do with name recognition - half the battle in US politics - than it has to do with the success of his campaign.With the Democratic primaries weeks away in June and over 50 per cent of voters still undecided, the race is still wide open. Whoever wins the nomination can be confident they will go on to win the election in November. While an upset is possible, there have been only four Republican mayors in the last 100 years.Ms Wiley, a mother of two daughters, is among the more liberal of the candidates and her five-year plan to create 100,000 jobs in the wake of the Covid crisis has helped her win the support of New York’s biggest unions. The Brooklyn-based daughter of two civil rights activists began her career with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) Legal Defense Fund in 1992 before joining the civil rights ision at the office of the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York. She gained prominence, and a large social media following, later as a legal analyst on MSNBC. Ms Wiley, who marched alongside the Black Lives Matter protesters last summer, told The  she did not think the recent police funding cuts went far enough.“We need to recognise that what demonstrators, rightly and smartly, were calling for was investment in communities that had not received their due and what they deserve, like better schools, better mental health services, more jobs,” she said.She said she supports a truth and reconciliation commission to come to terms with the US\u0027s “long history of racism”, as well as what she calls a justice fund, which would allocate millions of dollars to communities with high gun violence rates.With a plethora of strong female contenders it has never been more likely that New York will elect a woman mayor. But experts say it will still be an uphill battle at the ballot box.In the 2013 race, then-candidate Christine Quinn lost to Mayor Bill de Blasio in the primary after voters said they found her “unlikable,” an epithet often used for female politicians but rarely ever for male ones. And while women tend to have greater grassroots support, it rarely translates to major donor money.“All you can do is be authentic.

Indeed, with the continent still in the grip of a deadly third wave and fresh health concerns over the new Johnson\u0026ampJohnson jab as well as new variants, the EU is struggling to make headway against the pandemic.Yet undoubtedly there are encouraging indicators.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen announced this week that the EU administered 100m doses, “a milestone we can be proud of!”. More than a quarter are second shots, meaning more than 27m Europeans are fully vaccinated.“We are also accelerating the delivery of vaccinations,” she insisted.The EC chief has set a target of inoculating 75 per cent of the adult population by the end of summer.  EU leaders have also declared that the bloc will soon become the world’s number one producer of vaccines.With the EU’s nose still out of joint over AstraZeneca delays and its run-in with the UK, Mrs von der Leyen confirmed the bloc would receive 250m doses of Pfizer in the second quarter - some 50m more than expected. Negotiations have begun for a contract of 1.8bn doses over 2021-2023 with all production and raw materials being based on the continent.Some countries are bounding ahead with jabs. In the Netherlands, the number of daily doses per 100 people shot above the UK rate of 0.64 to reach 0.77 on April 11. With 4m doses administered, the country has now given 21.6 per cent of the adult population a first dose, with 6.1 per cent of the population fully vaccinated.Lampooned for its early vaccination efforts, France has passed some positive milestones of late.It is consistently hitting more than 450,000 vaccinations a day after opening the first of 40 mass vaccine centres across the country last week, including at the stade de France, the national stadium. On Friday, it surpassed 12 million first doses - two million higher than its mid-April target - and is easily on track to reach 20 million by mid-May and 30 million the following month.Some 17.8 per cent of the French population, (and 22.8 per cent of adults), had received one jab with more than six per cent having received two. That is still way behind the UK, which has surpassed 32 million first doses (61.4pc of the population) and eight million second jabs (15.5pc).To speed things up, France has increased the gap between the two doses of the mRNA jabs, making the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine available to anyone over 55, and rolled out the first 200,000 doses of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson product a week early - also available for this age bracket.Not all milestones are welcome, however. France this week became the eighth country whose death toll surpassed the 100,000-mark. With an average of roughly 300 deaths a day and almost 6,000 people in intensive care - the highest figure since April last year - government spokesman Gabriel Attal warned that “the third wave is not behind us”, nor is its peak.There are also growing fears about the possible impact of the Brazilian variant, which along with the South African mutation accounts for 4.2 per cent of French cases and prompted it to suspend flights from Brazil this week.Given such headwinds, it is too early to say whether Mr Macron, who is up for election in 12 months time, can claim to have been right to refuse to lock the country for a third time in January, despite calls from his own scientific advisors.Germany, where vaccine roll-out has accelerated dramatically since Easter, is in a similar race against time and its ability to get a handle on the virus could also prove key for Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU party.On Wednesday, the country set a new national record with 738.501 jabs in a day, compared with 547,465 in the UK on the same day. Some 18.5 per cent of Germans have now had their first jab, compared to just 12 per cent on April 1. Some 6.4 per cent are fully vaccinated.While bigger deliveries of vaccines have played a role, the decision to involve GPs in the jab campaign has also been key to the newfound speed.Doctors administered more than 1.1m in their first week alone and are expected to ramp up even further as dose quantities increase. The gear change could see the entire adult population receive a first jab by July 18, two months early and be fully vaccinated by August 8, according to the German Institute for Public Health Insurance (ZI).A shadow on the horizon is the concern the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine may cause blood clots. Germany has factored the vaccine heavily into its plans — it is expecting an order of 10m jabs — and any decision to limit its use could slow the country’s roll-out.Meanwhile, in Italy, daily inoculations are hovering above 200,000 new doses administered per day since late last month. Some 9.7m first doses have been administered and 4.1m second ones. Officials have expressed optimism restrictions could be eased soon if the pace of immunisation continues to pick up. That may be premature. On Wednesday, Italy reported another 16,000 new cases in 24 hours and 469 more deaths.Indeed, the persistently high infection and death rates and hospitalisations threaten to jeopardise plans to relax rules in the coming weeks as Europeans eye Britain’s lockdown exit with envy.Keen to cajole a country under nationwide semi-confinement and a 7pm to 6am curfew, Mr Macron held talks with the French government on Thursday night on an exit roadmap and his aides hinted that he aimed to progressive reopen cafes and restaurants, along with cultural venues by mid-May. ““We need some quick wins to raise morale,” fretted junior social economy minister Olivia Grégoire. “(Reopening) terraces is a small victory to brighten our daily lives.”But ministers have already warned that this is still only “hypothetical”. Mr Macron will address the nation by the end of the month.With intensive care beds filling up in Germany, Angela Merkel is struggling to push a new law through parliament to take control of lockdown measures out of the hands of the country’s 16 regional governments and impose tough national restrictions for the first time, including night-time curfews for the worst-hit areas. She has already met fierce political resistance from the regions some of who want to go the other way.As summer beckons, EU countries, including Germany, France and Italy, remain closed to tourism for now.But some are forging ahead with holiday plans regardless.  Greece intends to open borders on 14 May for all travellers who have been vaccinated or provide a negative coronavirus test. Croatia says it is opening up those who can prove they have had a second doses at least two weeks previously.Meanwhile, EU governments have reached a common position on plans for digital vaccination certificates, which could eventually pave the way to a vaccine passport system open to Britons hoping to travel to Europe. The EU-only plans must be agreed with MEPs before they can become law, which could be before the end of June.Mass vaccinations are key to getting European economies back on track.Last month, the OECD said it expected the UK economy to grow by 5.1 per cent this year and 4.7 per cent in 2022 - a significant increase on its December 2020 estimate. Its EU growth forecast was also increased to 3.9 per cent for 2021 — however, this was a much smaller uplift than elsewhere due to its slow vaccine rollout.“Reflecting the periodic infection waves and the pace of vaccinations, the economic recovery in Europe is still halting and uneven, said Alfred Kammer, director of the International Monetary Fund\u0027s European department.We are suggesting an extra push, and an extra effort to limit permanent damage to the region\u0027s productivity.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"another epidemic clueless beens clinging","story":"NewsopinionAnother epidemic of clueless has-beens clinging on to powerBrian Reade on the scourge of the Old Boys Network who believe the world would be a poorer place without themmirrorShareCommentsByBrian Reade:,  APR Newsopinionthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video meghan-markle-reveals-kate-made-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:MWomTa,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Despite it being only .am in Washington he demanded to know why the US President hadn’t made public his sadness, claiming “Biden and the Democrats do not like the UK”. When, soon after, Biden offered his fulsome condolences he switched his anger to Harry and Meghan, claiming their tribute to the Duke showed “contempt” for the monarchy before telling them they would not be welcome in Britain for the funeral. After renting his gob to an American right-wing news channel on the back of this grief-judging, the next day he switched back to whipping up hatred of migrants. Meanwhile in Windsor, Prince Andrew came out of hiding to do a long TV interview thanking the nation for the support his family were receiving.Imagine the gratitude families of girls sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein would feelhe would agree to be interviewed by the FBI  Feeling secure back in the open again, the gormless golf-trolley then demanded his mum let him dress up as an admiral for his dad’s funeral to show the world what a Very Important Person he still is. Thankfully she told him to naff orf.  The most insulting part of David Cameron’s defence of his shameless lobbying of ministers for a scandal-hit money firm was his justication for meeting Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince: “I took the opportunity to raise concerns about human rights.” I doubt he did, because the only human he was concerned with was himself. When he was texting the Chancellor, drinking with ministers and camping with monsters, he still saw himself as a major global player, demanding the rewards that go with such status. Is there a sadder sight known to humanity than ageing men who have had a whf of power refusing to let it go  Look at Vladimir Putin passing a law that allows him to stay Russian leader until he’s . Or his Russia Today stooge, Alex Salmond, who’s rebranded himself as the new Robert The Bruce and formed a Scottish independence party despite there already being one. Everyone would like to see him retire, preferably after finally showing contrition over his admitted “inappropriate” behaviour to women, but the deluded fool thinks we’re all desperate to see his greasy mug back on Newsnight. He reminds me of Labour firebrands like Neil Kinnock and John Prescott who, after decades of calling for the Lords to be abolished, couldn’t wait to dress up and sit there.

They called on the school, run by Future Academies, to reverse changes to the unorm policy and history curriculum. Hairstyles that block the views of others and colourful hijabs are banned at the secondary school, whose former pupils include Cha star Tammy Abraham and Top Boy actor Ashley Walters. Was your child involved in the protest at Pimlico Academy  Email webnews@mirror. Students also claim there was no recognition of Black Lives Matter or Black History Month, and concerns about the placement of the Union Jack flag were repeatedly ignored. Days after the protest, headteacher Daniel Smith said the Union Jack will not be flown outside the school while it undertakes a review into the matter. The head has also agreed to look at updating the PSHE curriculum and he said aspects of the academy’s unorm policy had been revised following concerns.But children who organised the protest have been told to attend a disciplinary meeting on Monday, the first day of term after the Easter break, thereported last night. Mr Smith sent an email to some parents telling them they would need to attend a disciplinary meeting with their child, warning that pupils could be expelled, it was reported. The email stated: “Following [child’s name] disruptive behaviour on the last day of term, she is required to attend a disciplinary meeting. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the nature of [child’s name] disruptive behaviour on the last day of term and to give [child’s name] the opportunity to reflect on their actions. Mr Smith wrote that the the schoolaposs leadership would approach the meeting from a “reconciliatory perspective” and was hoping to avoid permanent exclusion.

In a letter to parents, Future Academies chair Lord Nash warned pupils would face disciplinary actionthey staged any further protests.The school is facing mass staff resignations and a vote of no confidence in Mr Smith due to changes imposed after he took over last summer, thereported previously.National Education Unionmembers from the school “overwhelmingly passed a motion of no confidence in the headteacher and to move towards a ballot for industrial action”. An indicative ballot is scheduled to be held after the Easter break, which could lead to strikes. Last September, a Union Jack flag erected outside the school was ripped down and set alight by pupils. In March, the walls of the academy were vandalised with graffiti, with messages including “ain’t no black in the Union Jack”. In an earlier statement, Mr Smith said: “The right to protest is a civil liberty which, in the United Kingdom, we all enjoy, one that was hard-fought for and which not everyone in the world is fortunate to have. “Our students are bright, courageous, intelligent young people, passionate about the things that matter to them and acutely attuned to injustice.  “I admire them hugely for this though I regret that it came to this.” He added: “The issue of the flying of the Union flag was discussed at . We acknowledge that this symbol is a powerful one which evokes often intense reactions. “We have listened to the concerns of students, parents and the wider community about it. “After Easter, we will conduct a review of this and, as part of that, consult with all the academy’s stakeholders to elicit their feedback. “In the meantime, and until that review is concluded, the Union flag will not be flown at the academy.”  On the school unorm, he added: “Sixth form student representatives raised concerns about certain aspects of the academy’s unorm policy. “I was able to reassure students that their previous representations on these points had been the motivation for reflection which, in turn, resulted in revision to the relevant polices taking place.” The redrafted unorm policy says hair must be maintained “in a conventional style”, but there is no mention of styles that “block the view of others”. It adds that headscarves and turbans must be black or navy blue, but there is no mention of “colourful”. In the statement following the protests, Mr Smith added: “Students were vocal in their concerns about how they felt the PSHE curriculum was delivered.

Kimberley, , said: Until this happened I didnapost even know children could have strokes, theyaposre always something I only associated with older people. Every single person who I tell reacts in the same shocked way, they tell me they didnapost have any idea either. The mum of two, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, claims doctors are baffled by the strokes and is warning other parents. She added: Suffering the strokes was bad enough but now we are in a situation where no one can say whataposs wrong with Sebastian. The doctors are baffled and so is everyone , which is why I want to talk about whataposs happened. I think there needs to be much more awareness of strokes in children so that we can start to learn about the condition and understand why it happens. Kimberley and her -year-old partner David OaposBrien are sometimes woken by Sebastianaposs strokes, the first of which happened at around am last September.  He was kind of trying to get down from the top bunk of their bed but his arm was clinging on to the ladder, Kimberley continued. To see my son in that position was terrying, I didnapost know what to do, I just knew something was really wrong. I was crying but also trying to tell Sebastian that he was going to be okay, it was horrible. Kimberley called  on this occasion but alleges paramedics didnapost entertain a stroke as being a possibility for a child Sebastianaposs age.  He was kept in hospital though and had a CT scan, as doctors suspected he had epilepsy. But nothing was diagnosed and, in October last year, Sebastian had another stroke. Kimberley, who has filmed some of the attacks, said: We were at the table having breakfast when he just dropped his spoon into the bowl and he began to fall off his chair. It was that moment of terror all over again. Iaposll never get over the guilt of recording my son while he was having a stroke. I know it was what I was told to do but it felt wrong at the time and it still does now.  With hindsight we were recording his strokes and we could have recorded his last moments. We didnapost know it could be a stroke. Itaposs taken my six months to pluck up the courage to even try to watch them again - itaposs so hard. One sentence could save a le. I could have potentially been filming his last moments, and it was only because of luck I wasnapost. And thataposs terrying to think about. Doctors eventually said epilepsy was unlikely but still donapost know what is causing the terrors.

The design reflected an unwavering love of innovation throughout the Royalaposs le – a devotion which even earned him the moniker gadget man to Royal observers.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeIt was a word many heard on BBC hit Line of Duty but didn’t understand – “cuckooing” sounds quaint but it hides horric stories of terried people becoming prisoners in their homes. Organised crime gangs take over that person’s property – whether they are elderly, have learning dficulties or drug or alcohol dependency – and use their home for criminal activity. Just like with Line of Duty’s Terry Boyle. Now a Mirror investigation has uncovered a catalogue of cases across the nation and victims of cuckooing have bravely shared their stories. Our probe even found the names and addresses vulnerable people – potential cuckooing victims – are being used as a form of currency, bought and sold by criminals, often in jails. “You will find that prisoners are selling information for drugs on the inside about a vulnerable property in their area,” says Darren Burton, head of housing consultancy services for Forbes Solicitors, who works with the police and other agencies to prevent cuckooing and help victims escape. Cuckooing can have lasting effects on the victims – as well as having a devastating impact on the wider community. Darren explains: “They can feel suicidal, feeling like they have nowhere to turn. We have seen examples where they are having their money and benefits taken, withholding food, threats of or actual physical violence, destroying their belongings and the properties. “People don’t want to live there, there is a culture of silence, people don’t want to speak out, there can be a tense atmosphere particularlypeople live next door or on the same landing.” Mark – whose name we have changed for his own safety – was a victim of cuckooing in Oxford.  He had fallen into drug abuse and at first thought his dealers were his friends when they wanted to come to his flat. But he soon realised they had an ulterior motive – they wanted to deal drugs. He says: “It soon became apparent thatthings didn’t go their way what would happen.” Mark’s case worker from Oxford Council, Monica Walton, says that victims of cuckooing like Mark often don’t know where to turn for help. And that the practice isn’t always about using a property for drugs. She explains: “It is not just properties, it is people. There is a group of women that tend to go round and use older men for sexual pleasure to get money. I think the last time I went and did some visits it was connected to about  dferent addresses and these men are in their s.’ “These people don’t realise they are being cuckooed – and therefore their plight may go under the radar for years.” Liz Jones, Oxford City Council’s domestic and sexual abuse coordinator, explains: “I would say at the moment there are probably about  or so properties in Oxford at the moment where we suspect they are being cuckooed. “Sometimes people are cuckooing to get a bed for a number of nights. They have got vulnerabilities but they are exploiting an elderly person.” Police organised crime units have identied four dferent types. Parasitic cuckooing is taking over addresses by force and quasi cuckooing is exploitation of a person based on their vulnerability, often by drug users. Coupling is forming a sexual relationship to take over properties.  There is also local cuckooing which refers to local offenders who take over an address in the proximity of their home or their community where exploitation, violence and drug dealing can take place. It is a practice closely linked with county lines operations where gangs travel to dferent parts of the country to sell drugs, often using vulnerable youngsters as mules and dealers. There are around , dferent county lines operating across the country with each one making an estimated annual profit of around £, – a staggering £million. The gangs also use other forms of exploitation including coercion, trafficking, child sexual exploitation, gun and kne crime.  Mark became a victim of cuckooing after he fell into heroin and crack cocaine use. At first he thought the dealers were his friends and invited them in when they asked to come to his flat in Oxford to deliver his drugs. By the time he realised they wanted his flat as a base to deal drugs from, it was too late - Mark was in debt to them and trapped. He says: “All I cared about at that time was drugs. When I went to score they would always say can we come to your flat  It soon became apparent thatthings didn’t go their way what would happen. Sometimes there would be  lads in my flat. If any of their dealers got robbed they would come down with metal strips, hammers, knives, it was really intimidating. “They didn’t physically threaten me but I knew what would happenI didn’t do as they said. “They had made themselves comfortable in the flat and they would sit there all day. “I didn’t feel like I was a vulnerable person at the time. I just thought I was another drug user who was doing what he had to do to get through the day. I felt part of it although in reality I was being used.” Mark was only able to escape when a neighbour called police due to noise coming from the flat. Police and the council realised that Mark was being cuckooed and offered him the support he needed to get help. Mark says: “My case workers Monica from the council and Rob from the police were amazing. They didn’t want to throw me in jail.They offered me help and support. By that time I had had enough and I wanted to do anything to escape.They used to check on me everyday to check that the dealers weren’t coming back. Monica introduced me to the drugs service and got me into rehab.I did four months in rehab and then went to supported housing. I have been clean for two and half years, I’ve got a new flat and full time work. “If anyone  is in my position please reach out to the police or the council. There is help out there and it has changed my le.”  DI Mark Catney from Yorkshire and Humber Regional Organised Crime Unit says: “We recognise cuckooing and county lines crime as very serious threats. “Targeting vulnerable people is unacceptable. One place you are supposed to feel safe is in your own home.” Cuckooed houses are also used as places for gangs to carry out violence. In one case DI Mark Catney worked on in , a man who was involved in a dispute over drugs with a gang was taken to an apparently cuckooed address. He was stripped naked, had boiling water poured over his genitals and forced to sing and dance to Whitney Houston songs purely for his vile attackers’ amusement. The victim had previously been tortured in his own home and a kne was held to the stomach of his heavily pregnant girlfriend. Aimee’s home in London’s Camden was taken over by a gang after a man who she thought was a friend started inviting his friends over. But soon things spiralled out of Aimee’s control and her house was being used to deal drugs. On a video released by the politan Police, she says: “One of them became a really good friend of mine he was a really nice young man.But his friends started coming along and then more friends started coming along and they just started taking over the house and it just got worse. “I just started having a mental breakdown, started crying all the time. I mostly just stayed in the other room an they would come in and take over the rest of the house. They brought friends and would be drinking and ordering food all the time and getting people to wrap up drugs and started selling drugs and things like that from my home which I never allowed and never wanted but I just could never do anything about it and it got worse after that and they started getting worse towards me, being abusive towards me. “They’re not your friends they just want to use your home.

Royals have today gathered at Windsor to pay their respects to the Duke of Edinburgh, who died last week aged . Large crowds lined the streets outside Windsor Castle, where he passed away peacefully on April , just two months short of his th birthday.His funeral will be held at pm, with just  mourners permitted to attend because of coronavirus restrictions.A polished dark green carriage that the Duke of Edinburghaposs designed himself will make an appearance alongside ponies at the service in Windsor. The four-wheeled carriage, accompanied by two of Philipaposs grooms, will stand in the Quadrangle of Windsor Castle as the dukeaposs coffin is carried past in a procession on a Land Rover hearse. It was Philipaposs most recent carriage, which he began using at the age of  for riding around Windsor and other royal estates. With the aluminium and steel carriage will be the dukeaposs two black Fell ponies - Balmoral Nevis and Notlaw Storm - who were both were born in . Balmoral Nevis was bred by the Queen, with Fell ponies being an endangered breed. Philip had been designing driving carriages since the s and this one was was built to the dukeaposs specications eight years ago.  The design draws on his knowledge of FEIdriving and can seat four people at maximum capacity and harness up to eight horses. It has two padded black leather seats and a clock mounted on brass at the front, which features an inscription commemorating the gt of the timepiece. The clock was presented to Philip by the Queenaposs Royal Irish Hussars on October   to mark his  years as their Colonel-in-Chief. Philip, who died a week ago aged , was synonymous with carriage-driving. He loved nothing more than to go haring through the countryside at high speed, whip in hand, in a horse-drawn wheeled carriage. I am getting old, my reactions are getting slower, and my memory is unreliable, but I have never lost the sheer pleasure of driving a team through the British countryside, he explained in the book he wrote about the sport.  Even when he was an octogenarian he continued to compete in demanding carriage-driving competitions. He was forced to give up polo at the age of  in  due what he called his dodgy arthritic wrist, and decided to find a new sport to concentrate on. I suppose I could have left it at that, but I have never felt comfortable as a spectator, he admitted. Tennis, golf and squash were no good for his wrist and sailing would have taken him away from home at weekends. It then suddenly occurred to me that this carriage-driving might be just the sport, Philip said. The duke, as president of the International Equestrian Federation, had initiated drafting the first international rules for carriage-driving in , which sparked an interest in the sport.

And he was behind the wheel of one of the firmaposs vehicles when he had an accident aged , shortly before he announced he was giving up his driving license. The royal family have used Land Rovers for decades and the company has produced four state ceremonial vehicles for the Queen. The first time the Queen used a Land Rover for an official visit was during a six-month tour of Australia in  when she used a specially converted Land Rover, known as State IV, which had a viewing  on the back allowing her and Philip to stand up and wave to the crowds while being driven. Delivered into the Royal household in  by a team of engineers, including Arthur Goddard, Land Roveraposs first engineer, it had a top speed of mph, no registration plates and was painted in the royal claret used for all the Queenaposs state vehicles.

The then Princess Elizabeth arrived in Dartmouth in  and spent the next few days with the then -year-old Philip, of Greece and Denmark. At that time he was a young naval cadet. Princess Elizabeth and her future husband are pictured at the Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth over the few days they spent together there, and one snap shows them playing croquet. While neither would have known what was ahead for them, the photo is now a signicant symbol as a beginning to what would one day turn into a romantic relationship. Dr Jane Harrold, curator at the Britannia Royal Naval College, said: “It can be seen as quite a sweet photograph of the two of them. “Meeting and getting to know each other properly really for the first time.” It was actually a coincidence Philip was at the naval college when the Princess visited as he should have been at sea. However, with war on the horizon, his class was at Dartmouth.  Dr Jane said: “Even though we have regular royal visits at the college, it is extremely unusual to have the whole royal family there at once. The five-year age gap between the Princess and Philip would have felt like a lot at their young age, so it wasnapost until a few more years had passed that they became closer. Jennie Bond, a royal commentator, told ITV: “The Queen thought he was drop-dead gorgeous quite frankly. “It was a relationship based absolutely on love. The Duke himself said that it had been a partnership. The couple got married eight years after that first meeting, in . Their marriage meant Philip had to give up his naval career as he was to become the future Queenaposs consort.

Writing in his column in Daily Mail, royal reporter Richard Kay said: Although she has spoken to her children and grandchildren this week, she has spent much of the time alone.But this has been her choice and it has allowed her to have moments of prayer in the private chapel, barely a minuteaposs walk down the Green Corridor from her rooms, where Philipaposs coffin has rested. In time there will be activity in the suite of rooms which adjoins her as an inventory is compiled of her husbandaposs property, unorms and clothes.  Due to the pandemic, the Queen and Prince Philip had to retreat from public le for long periods shielding at Windsor with a small staff known as HMS Bubble.Instead, Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall carried out the first royal engagement this year, visiting a hospital named after his mother.

The area is clearly a favourite spot for the Queen as she has named a corgi puppy, recently gted to the monarch, Muick and it has a dorgi puppy playmate called Fergus – another Scottish name.

Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  A royal source said: “The cherished photograph is one of the Queen’s favourites and evokes many happy memories at one of their favourite places in the world. She will miss her beloved Philip forever.” Her Majesty last month named a new corgi puppy Muick after the beauty spot where she spent many happy times with Philip, who died peacefully aged  on April . His funeral will take place at St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle at pm. The duke’s children will walk behind a specially-modied military green Land Rover hearse he helped to design. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby yesterday appealed to the nation to offer prayers and condolences to the monarch.  He said it would be a “profound” chance for her to say farewell to her husband of  years. Justin Welby said: “We really have to avoid judging from anything external. “She is the Queen. She will behave with the extraordinary dignity and extraordinary courage that she always does. “And at the same time she is saying farewell to someone to whom she was married for  years. “I think that must be a very, very profound thing in anybody’s le and I hope the whole nation,they believe in that, they pray for her, andthey don’t, they sympathise in their hearts, offer their condolences to her and they hope for her to find strength in what must be an anguished moment.” The monarch, , was yesterday seen for the first time since Philip’s death and was said to be “bearing up well”. She drove a green Jaguar out of Windsor Castle to take her dogs for a walk at around pm.  Typically, she later ed to duty, taking condolence calls from the Governor General of Australia David Hurley and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. And as final preparations were made last night, details of the Order of Service chosen by the duke himself were revealed. He picked the hymn Eternal Father, Strong To Save, a stirring sailors’ anthem sung at the funeral of his uncle Lord Mountbatten. Philip’s mentor had a huge influence on his le before he was murdered by the IRA in . A bugler from the Royal Marines will sound the call of Action Stations at the duke’s personal request. The wartime alert, a tradition associated with naval funerals, is typically announced on warships. It will honour Philip’s distinguished Royal Navy service in the Second World War, when he was mentioned in dispatches.  A royal source said: “The personal choice of hymn also shows how important the Navy was to him. “If he hadn’t met the Queen he would have continued as a naval officer and was tipped to rise to the very top. “He sacriced that for duty – but naval le remained close to his heart as did the lessons his beloved uncle taught him.” Philip’s “unwavering loyalty” to the Queen and “courage, fortitude and faith” will also be hailed as he is laid to rest. The Russian Kontakion of the Departed will also be sung. The chant, with its origins in the Russian Orthodox sacrament, was added to signy Philip’s roots in the Orthodox church and his Greek origins. Crowds are being urged to stay away from Windsor and just  mourners will attend the service.Prime Minister Boris Johnson will watch on television from his country residence Chequers, in Buckinghamshire, Number  said.He will observe the national minute’s silence at pm to mark the start of the funeral. Heathrow Airport said no planes will land or take off for six minutes. Prince Edward and Sophie, Countess of Wessex, were yesterday touched by “sweet” tributes left at Windsor Castle. The couple, who were joined by their daughter Lady Louise Windsor, , spent time looking at hundreds of flowers and wreaths outside St George’s Chapel, including from Johnson, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and the Royal Navy. The Wessexes, along with other members of the Royal Family, have been supporting the Queen since Philip’s death. When the clock strikes three and the nation is called to fall silent, the Queen should look back with pride at a job well done. Long held plans ravaged by the coronavirus crisis, tortured decisions on who should attend and the pressures of by the minute details will all be over. No doubt she will wonder what this new dawn which has been thrust upon her will look like. But one hopes, bolstered by the unity her family has shown in recent days, the burden will be eased. Controversies within her family will still rage, just as they have always done, but the central force must be towards togetherness to herald a new age after their patriarch has departed. The senior members of The Firm have a duty to the Queen to not only help her through, but to heed her call to contribute to healing the country after more than a year of turmoil. When the eyes of the world are upon us, with celebrations of births and marriages in this family, there is cause for celebration. But perhaps today we could all pause for a moment of reflection to honour the le of a man who devoted his le to service and the woman forced to say her final goodbyes."},{"url":null,"title":"queens quick response prince philip","story":"NewsThe Queens quick response when Prince Philip snapped Oh, do shut up, you silly womanIt was a \"sweet\" moment as the Queen and Prince Philip bickered with one another while shielding at Windsor Castle during the Covid pandemic, an aide claimsmirrorShareCommentsByChris KitchingSenior News Reporter:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video queen-prince-philip-giggle-announce-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:ZcNWVfGY,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Mr White pauses to check on the girl as she lay on the floor, and the blade-wielding assailants catch up to him as he tries to take refuge inside the store. Theo Momodu, , and Taylar Isaac, , closed in on him in a pincer movement with David Kerrigan, , close behind.Momodu then stabbed Mr White three times in the back with a ft-long red-tinted Zombie sword.And Isaac delivered a fatal wound to the chest with a large kne, jurors heard. politan Police detectives believed Mr White - described by his mother as a kind, loving, happy and caring son - was attacked at random.Minutes later, the three alleged young Stokey gang members targeted a second man who survived after being stabbed multiple times as he tried to flee. That man was with his partner and young child, and the attackers recognised him from a local estate. It was claimed they carried out the carefully thought-through expedition after Momodu received a text message from a senior gang member. In it, he was instructed to get some notches on your blade and new ygsto get someone down or be de-recruited. Mr White was not believed to have been specically targeted in the ride-out as he had no gang affiliations and was about to start a job as a train driver. Following an Old Bailey trial, Isaac and Kerrigan were found guilty of murder, a charge which Momodu had admitted to.

All three men, from Hackney, were also convicted of wounding the second victim with intent.A fourth defendant, Harley McGivern, , also from Hackney, was found guilty of perverting the course of justice.Following the verdicts, Mr Whiteaposs mother Trisha Sargusingh described her son as kind, loving, happy and caring, a loyal friend and sensitive and humble man. She said: Coming to court has been so dficult, physically, emotionally and spiritually and although there is no punishment severe enough that can alleviate the horric manner of Joshuaaposs death we are hopeful that a strong sentence for those convicted may be a deterrent so that other families may never know a pain like ours. Father Leigh White added: I hope that todayaposs verdict will have lasting consequences for those who committed such a heartless and shameful killing and stands as a lesson to others who are considering carrying knives which could result in the loss of other innocent lives. The court had heard how the attack on Mr White happened on the afternoon of April   outside Frampton Foods. The attackers were driven by an unidentied man in a stolen white SUV and, armed with knives and swords and wearing balaclavas, they confronted the occupants of a grey Mercedes. The Mercedes made off and was pursued by the gang.  Seconds later, CCTV showed the three men chasing Mr White on foot, still brandishing their weapons.He ran towards the shop, where he crashed into the six-year-old girl on roller skates. The girl, who was unhurt in the incident, had been waiting for her father inside the shop. After being stabbed, Mr White collapsed inside the shop and died in hospital later that day. Police had been alerted by members of the public as the attackers made off in a white Ford SUV. Minutes later, Rikkardo Butler was targeted as he walked with his partner, pushing a baby in a pram nearby, juror heard. He ran away, having suffered superficial stab wounds, the court heard. The attackersapos car was driven off at high speed, pursued by an armed police vehicle.  The Ford was caught on police dashcam footage crashing into parked vehicles before the men made off on foot, with Kerrigan and Isaac still holding knives. Two more Zombie blades were recovered from the wreckage. Momodu was apprehended by police, while the others made their way to McGivernaposs home, where they changed their clothes. The court heard that McGivern had allowed his flat to be used as a base for the gang and that he helped to dispose of clothing and other evidence. Kerrigan and Isaac both denied being members of a gang.Giving evidence, Kerrigan admitted being at the scene of Mr Whiteaposs killing. But he said he had been going to buy drugs and knew nothing of the attack plan. Momoduaposs defence dismissed Kerriganaposs claim, saying it was a gang-related ride-out. Kerrigan had a previous conviction for a public order offence in  in which he was heard to threaten to stab someone.

The  year long relationship Philip maintained with the shoes was revealed by the Confederation of British Industry president Lord Karan Bilimoria. He told me once that he was wearing the shoes from the day that he got married, he said. We were next to each other and tying up our laces when he told me that those were the same shoes from his wedding day. It was amazing. The touching tribute was made the day before Philipaposs funeral. The duke will be interred at St Georgeaposs Chapel in Windsor in a ceremony which begins at pm tomorrow which will be broadcast live. This evening an Order of Service for the funeral was published which shows a string of musical pieces with deep personal connections to the royal. Music chosen by Philip, who served in the navy, includes the hymn Eternal Father, Strong to Save - traditionally associated with seafarers and the maritime armed services.  Written in  by William Whiting, it was inspired by the dangers of the sea described in Psalm . Prince Philip sang the extra verse at the funeral of the man who taught him to fly while he was a Royal Navy officer.It was also sung at the funeral of Philipaposs beloved uncle, Earl Mountbatten of Burma, who was murdered by the IRA in , as well as at the departing services of George Bush Snr and John F Kennedy. Rhosymedre by Vaughn Williams will also form a part of the deeply religious service. The sweeping and highly emotional rendering of a traditional British folk song was also played at Princess Dianaaposs funeral and the weddings of Prince Harry and Prince William.A Jubilate which was written for St Georgeaposs Chapel, Windsor Castle, at Philipaposs request and a psalm which he requested should be set to music and which was first sung in honour of his th birthday will also form part of the service. It also reveals key themes that will sit at the heart of the service, including the Dukeaposs unwavering loyalty to the Queen and his courage, fortitude and faith.

Hancock is also embroiled in the lobbying scandal involving David Cameron and banker Lex Greensill. That’s not all though. The former landlord of Mr Hancock’s local pub was awarded a Covid contract, so the minister has even more explaining to do. His boss Boris Johnson is a prime minister without morals, a cynical liar whose personal and public actions raise concerns about probity at the highest levels of government. The Government should govern in the national interest, not for their own gain. Biden is rightWithdrawing the  remaining UK troops from Afghanistan is a welcome move, triggered by US President Joe Biden pulling out America’s military.After  British deaths, many more le-changing injuries and billions spent over  years, the Government in Kabul must do a deal with the Taliban or fight the war on its own. General Sir Nick Carter is disappointed in the decision but he may have overlooked the fact that an endless military entanglement is not in the interests of the UK or the US.

Anti-terror “hostile vehicle mitigation” barriers have been placed around the town. The concrete blocks are designed to stop a lorry attack similar to the Bastille Day terror killings in Nice in . Undercover officers, search teams, mounted units and snfer dogs will also be used to protect the royal family today. Road signs in the area warned: Avoid all non essential travel and do not gather at royal residences. A few members of the public visited briefly to lay flowers.  Jack Carson, , who lives locally, placed a bunch near Windsor Castle and said: Iaposm going to watch the funeral service from home but I thought it would be nice to come down this morning to lay some flowers down. Philip was a fantastic public servant and will be missed by the people in this town. Dai Davies, former head of royal protection for the Met Police, said: “Police are there in support of the royal family and to protect the military who will be there in ceremonial roles. “The terror threat is still at ‘substantial’ and given the notoriety of some of the , or so on the terrorist watch list I would not underestimate the threat.  Meanwhile, a Kill the Bill protest is planned today in central London, near Buckingham Palace. Activists protesting against the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill are set to gather from about pm, two hours before the funeral is expected to start around  miles away.Deputy Assistant Commissioner Jane Connors, who is leading the Met’s policing this weekend, told The Times : “We will continue to operate a bespoke policing plan in place around Buckingham Palace and Westminster, to keep people safe and to disrupt criminality.“We will also be deploying a number of officers ahead of a demonstration in central London. I must stress that we remain in a public health crisis and gathering in large numbers presents a real risk of transmitting Covid-.” "},{"url":null,"title":"puppy swallows owners airpods whole","story":"NewsPuppy swallows owners AirPods whole - and baffles vet as they still workA dog owners \"heart sank\" after her golden retriever had to have surgery to remove the Apple Airpods he ate after the case fell out of her pocket.

Rachel Hick was forced to rush her golden retriever Jimmy to the vets after she realised heaposd eaten her headphone case.The -year-old from Hull said her heart sank after Jimmy swallowed the case whole when the headphones fell out of her pocket, reports Hull Live.Miraculously, the surgeon at Vets Now in Hull, East Yorkshire, managed to retrieve the case after performing surgery - and they even still work.She said: It was Easter Sunday and Jimmy has his own Instagram account, so I was taking photos of him getting his first dog Easter egg to use on Instagram. He was jumping up and running around going crazy, he was so hyped up and excited.As he jumped, he knocked my AirPods out of my pocket and they fell on the floor, and before I even realised theyaposd dropped on the floor, heaposd eaten them whole. He looked up at me straight after and gave me a look asto say aposthat wasnapost the treat, was it apos My heart sank. Rachel rushed to an out-of-hours pet emergency service, where the case showed up in a scan.  Susana Jauregui, the senior vet at the Hull-based practice, explained: Our vet on duty that evening, Steven, X-rayed Jimmy and the radiograph images clearly showed the AirPods case still intact in his digestive system. There was a risk of it causing an obstruction and, with it being a charging case, Steven was also concerned about battery acid leaking so, after discussing the situation with Jimmyaposs owners, he agreed to operate. Jimmy’s a beautul dog and he’s lucky his owners acted so promptly. Battery acid is highly dangerous to dogs as are large foreign objects, especiallythey’re allowed to pass into the intestine.  To Stevenaposs surprise, the case was completely intact - not a bite mark or scratch insight - and the charging light was still on. After a successful operation, Jimmy spent the night at the vets. He ed home the next day feeling a bit sorry for himself.

Fregon, in the countryaposs Outback, was thrust into the spotlight when a nurse was brutally raped and murdered in . The body of Gayle Woodford, , was found in a shallow grave three days after she disappeared. A coroner has now submitted a damning report criticising the town following an inquest into the mum-of-twoaposs death. Ms Woodford was killed by Dudley Davey, who pleaded guilty to her murder in . South Australia Deputy Coroner Anthony Schapel painted a shocking picture of Fregon with his findings, which were released on Thursday. He recommended that a local police presence be established to deal with the lawlessness of the town. The evidence of those witnesses who were called and who expressed a view about police presence in the Fregon community having regard to the level of lawlessness within it, would suggest that a permanent police presence would be essential, Mr Schapelaposs reports said. The proposition that a community in which certain of its members need to be protected by cages does not require an immediate police presence within that community would, I think, strike the ordinary man or woman in the street as perverse. Mr Schapel added that it was hard to determine whether a police presence in the town would have prevented Ms Woodfordaposs death.  But he said it would act as deterrent for other crimes. Ms Woodfordaposs death shocked Australia, after it emerged she was lured into a trap, abducted, raped and murdered. It also led to a number of questions being asked about Fregon, an Aboriginal community located in Anangu Pitjantjatjara YankunytjatjaraLands. According to reports, police have a presence in other locations in the APY Lands - but often take around an hour and a half to reach Fregon.

Ms Woodford covered the APY Lands as part of her patch for nearly five years before she was brutally killed, attending many callouts. Davey is currently serving a sentence of at least  years for his crimes, which also included the theft of Ms Woodfordaposs ambulance. A court heard during his trial how he had assaulted another nurse in Fregon back in .  The coroneraposs report adds: The violence in Fregon was described by a medical practitioner of several years’ standing in remote communities such as these as aposongoingapos and aposcontinualapos, and thatthere was no violence in the Fregon community on a given day it was a aposgood dayapos, circumstances not helped in her opinion by the lack of a police presence in the community. The practitioner described Fregon as aposcompletely lawlessapos and the most violent place in which she had resided and worked while employed by the NHC in the APY Lands, to the point where she believed that serious consideration needed to be given to the withdrawal of services from this particular community so as to bring it to its closure.

Up to  branches of Semichem will close.John Brodie, chief executive of Scotmid, addressed the Tayside closures as the co-operative’s annual results were announced.He told The Courier: “It’s always a dficult decision and a last resort – our aim is to keep stores open.“But sometimes we have to face into tough decisions.“It was based on the fact there were structural changes happening on high streets before the pandemic hit. The pandemic has accelerated some of those changes.“Some footfall driving stores in high streets, in shopping centres, they just don’t exist anymore.“We had a look at the locations we are in and assessthey are viable for the future.“Then we tried to make arrangements with landlords to help rental costs. We explored every opportunity before we took the tough decision that a store would have to close.”Mr Brodie said staff would be offered positions in other parts of the Scotmid group, which includes convenience stores, funerals and property.“There is a normal level of staff turnover in Scotmid food stores,” he added.“We anticipate that will create some opportunities for us to accommodate as many people as possible.”He said the company was satisfied that its other Semichem shops would continue to trade profitably.Scotmid Co-op Society delivered a £. million trading profit for the  weeks ended January  compared to £.m last year. Turnover increased by £m to £m.Mr Brodie said that while food sales increased as more customers shopped locally, there were also higher costs.There was also more demand for funeral services, but profitability was down partly due to social distancing restrictions.Meanwhile the company’s property arm saw some tenants default on payments.“This was a year dominated by the pandemic and the signicant but ying impact it has had on our dferent businesses,# Mr Brodie said.“Changes in consumer behaviour during the pandemic resulted in an increase in local essential shopping in Scotmid’s food convenience stores.“Customers visited less frequently, spent more each visit but the costs of operation were signicantly more than usual.“Like many other non-food retailers, Semichem was signicantly impacted by the pandemic due to low footfall on high streets and a long period of closure in the first wave.”“Scotmid Funerals conducted more funerals but at a reduced income per funeral due to safety and social distancing restrictions.”Mr Brodie said that even as the vaccine rollout continues apace, there was “considerable uncertainty” looking forward.He said management would adopt a “flexible approach” and focus on matters under its control.“We are an organisation that’s been around for  years and we will continue to follow our core purpose of continuing to serve our communities and improving people’s every day lives.“I’d also like to praise our society members for the fantastic work they have done in the past year.“They are unsung heroes for keeping going in uncertain circumstances.”Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.56328756-1-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.56328756-1-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.56328756-1-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.56328756-1-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"dundee announce departure of defender jordon forster","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remDefender Jordon Forster has left Dundee after almost two years at Dens Park, the club have announced.The former Hibs man played  times for the Dark Blues after signing in the summer of .His last appearance came as a second-half substitute against Arbroath on January  and he made just one league start this season.A broken foot suffered in the -

logging specialist READ Cased Hole has confirmed the demerger of its ANSA data analytics business.This has resulted in the formation of a new, fully independent, and separately run company trading as “ANSA”.ANSA # a global team of independent log analysis experts # delivers services for well integrity, production logging and reservoir evaluation within the oilfield sector, from its data hubs in Aberdeen, Houston and Doha.ANSA is now expanding its portfolio with the development of advanced software-based data analysis solutions applicable for a broader range of energy projects.As a result of the demerger, READ and ANSA now operate as two discrete business entities, each with its own organisational structure, resources, financing, and leadership.READ will continue to provide downhole technologies and services for cased hole logging to the global oil and gas market.The new independent ANSA business will deliver a comprehensive suite of data processing, analysis, and interpretation solutions to help clients overcome energy-related challenges around the world. However, ANSA#s services will not be limited to the oil and gas market.Both ANSA and READ are majority-owned by Norwegian private equity firm Norvestor.Tor Erling Gunnerød, Norvestor Equity Partner and chairman of READ said: “As a fully independent company, ANSA has the freedom to be more entrepreneurial and focus on its core competency of delivering ironclad data analysis solutions to clients around the world.“Our strategic goal is for ANSA to further develop its range of specialist services, accelerate the expansion of its client base, and create increased value andon investment for its shareholders.”Bruce Melvin will continue in the role of CEO of both READ and ANSA in the interim until a new figurehead for each business has been put in place.Bruce said: “This is a transformational moment for both companies.#Each has a tremendous opportunity to streamline its operations and ultimately focus on what it does best.#Clearly, change of this magnitude brings challenges, given the interconnectedness of the two business lines over the last  years. But it also brings huge opportunities that both READ and ANSA now have the potential to capitalise on.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/03/PJ-KT-230718-03-016_26379163-scaled-1-846x564.jpg ","title":"aberdeen lifeboat station offers safety refresher for swimmers","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remRNLI Aberdeen Leboat Station is organising a safety event for swimmers later this month.The online presentation, ‘Swim Safe This Summer’, is geared towards helping swimmers keep safe in open waters.Swimmers of all abilities can attend the free online event which is scheduled for April  at pm.Participants are required to register at https:bit.ly QtY to receive a link for the presentation broadcast.RNLI Aberdeen Leboat spokesman Jamee Kirkpatrick said: “We#re running these presentations because we have seen an uptake in those entering the sea or taking up water sports both locally and further afield, and as the charity that saves lives at sea, we feel a duty to ensure that everyone is safe and equipped with the knowledge they need before doing so.“These short presentations aim to provide the public with all the key safety advice and information that they require before entering cold water.“Cold water includes the sea, rivers and lochs.

Please help us raise awareness and raise funds. Whilst we are all fighting coronavirus, Target Oian Cancer is putting the needs of women with oian cancer before all .In  my mother, the actress Marjie Lawrence, was diagnosed with oian cancer just three weeks before she died. Had we and her doctors been aware of the symptoms, Marjie might be alive today. If diagnosed at the earliest stage, nine in  women will survive. But two thirds of women are diagnosed late, when the cancer is harder to treat.This March, for Oian Cancer Awareness Month, I’m writing to ask your readers to take just two minutes of their time to learn the symptoms and spread the word to their families and friends.The main symptoms of oian cancer are: persistent bloating, feeling full or having dficulty eating, tummy pain, and needing to wee more often or more urgently.If you believe in a future where every woman diagnosed with oian cancer has the best chance of survival, please show your support and visit www.targetoiancancer.org.uk MarchSarah Greene, Target Oian Cancer PatronSir,We welcome the latest announcement from the Scottish Government that communal worship can potentially resume from March  with the possibility of up to  people in attendance, assuming physical distancing of two metres can be in place.Christians are Easter people we live with hope in all circumstances, and the church will be providing guidance to congregations to help them ensure that buildings are re-opened in a safe and responsible manner.While some congregations will adopt a cautious approach regarding the reopening of our buildings # and others won#t have the practical means to do so # everyone will be very glad at this news and will already be looking forward to how most appropriately to celebrate Easter .In whatever we do, we#ll be remembering that the God who raised Jesus from the grave has been faithful to us throughout the whole of this last year.Rt Rev Dr Martin Fair, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of ScotlandSir,The first Citizens’ Assembly of Scotland has submitted its final report to the Scottish Parliament, with its  powerful democratic recommendations aimed at improving the wellbeing of Scotland#s people and governance.I personally would have loved to be a participant in this new democratic exercise, meeting and sharing with, speaking and listening to, a wide range of our people, many very unlike me and with very dferent perspectives, opinions and lived experience.To be informed by a range of expert, evidence-based perspectives, to explore and discuss implications and reservations, and to move towards a rough consensus on a range of key questions that will affect ourselves, our children and grandchildren, and that will shape the future of our country – that’s the exemplar of the active, responsible citizen of st century Scotland.There#s a climate assembly also currently working towards its conclusions, and I await its recommendations with interest and anticipation.Recommendation six of the first assembly is: #That in order to ensure that citizens can make informed decisions in relation to rebuilding their communities the Scottish government and parliament should: establish community-based citizens# assemblies to assess what is happening in our communities , identy gaps and recommend actions, including through digital technology, that can bring people together and make our communities more inclusive.#We have a Scottish election coming up in May, and I hope to see a good turnout as a good majority of Scotland’s electorate, from age  upwards, make sure to vote in this most critical exercise of our moment of power and responsibility.Subsequently, I hope to very soon look forward to a renewed interest in local democracy, as an Argyll and Bute Citizens# Assembly debates and decide the shape of Argyll and Bute#s future for the coming decisive decade.Perhaps that future will include enhanced interest and participation in some version of our current powerless and voiceless community councils.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"longing for a rest","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is mainly due to massive insecticide use and habitat loss caused by intensication of agriculture.Up to  per cent of flowering plants and  per cent of commercial crops require insects for pollination, with honeybees and hoverflies most often doing the job.But with declining numbers of these species, farmers may employ hives of bees to prevent crop yields falling.Wild honeybees forage within three miles of their nest, and onthey perform the #waggle dance# that advertises the location of productive foraging sites to other bees. Also, odours from scented flowers picked up inside the nest while unloading pollen act as cues to guide nest-mates to specic flowers.Now scientists have articially imprinted bees with flower odours in an attempt to improve crop yields*.In trying to establish long-term memory for flower odours, the scientists offered bees in three separate groups of hives alternative odours:  sucrose solution scented with synthetic sunflower odours,  sucrose solution scented with jasmine odours,  sucrose solution alone. They then relocated the hives to a sunflower plantation and compared the foraging activities of bees exposed to the three solutions.First, scientists decoded waggle dances to identy sunflower-specic dances. Using this information, they observed bees from hives fed with sunflower odours performing sunflower dances one hour after hive relocation.Contrastingly, the control bees fed jasmine odours took - hours and control sucrose-fed bees took  hours to perform sunflower dances.This resulted in the sunflower odour-imprinted bees performing signicantly more sunflower-specic waggle dances during the first day of relocation, peaking at  per cent increase over control hives preferentially visiting sunflowers and bringing in more sunflower pollen loads than the control bees.The scientists then measured the all-important crop yields in five plots containing dferent sunflower hybrid plants pollinated by sunflower odour-imprinted compared to control bees.Seed yields in all five plots were highest when pollinated by sunflower odour-fed bees, with increased production up to  per cent above control bees.They conclude that providing bees pre-programmed to forage on specic crops could circumvent wild pollinator shortages and signicantly increase crop yields.*Current Biology , -.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tons of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m stated by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast-track decision making.John Gurr  Sir,I heard that there was work going on in Lochgilphead town centre, and that some people were complaining, about mess and upheaval. No change there then!When I observed the work, I was so surprised at the dference this will make to the town and to the moaners I say #you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs#.When I spoke to them, the workforce were polite and commented that they were looking forward to the end result.For too long now Lochgilphead has been the Cinderella of Argyll and Bute now it seems she will go to the Ball.From a very satisfied resident.Name and address suppliedSir,Just ahead of WWF’S Earth Hour last year, the country was put into lockdown due to the Covid- pandemic. As we look ahead to this year’s event on Saturday March  at .pm, many of us are reflecting on the future, as we emerge from the latest, and hopefully last #stay at home# period.With that in mind, we are asking people to use Earth Hour by helping us to create the #Great Scottish Canvas#. Switch off your lights and by candlelight or torchlight, use the hour to paint a picture, craft a poem, doodle or write something which illustrates the future Scotland you want to live in.With so many eyes on Scotland this year, due to Scottish Parliament elections in May and the vital COP climate talks in November, we want to show the world the vision of the Scottish people, for a greener and fairer society for us all.

While saving in some areas of expenditure, it has incurred extra costs in tackling the pandemic and faces an uncertain funding future while the national economy tries to recover. The drive to save money in services where bringing in a little more through, for example, parking fees and fines, is understandable up to a point.But when the economy is on le support after a pandemic, surely the relatively paltry sums to be made are not worth the potential damage to Inveraray#s recovery, as seems to be the view of locals Perhaps councillors could look at this a little dferently. If they are determined to push this through for control traffic purposes, why not donate the proceeds, which would be a by-product of well-behaved traffic, to the town  The pier fund could certainly use it. Both the community council and Inspire Inveraray would no doubt welcome the cash and find many uses for public benefit.Just a thought.Congratulations to Cameron on his award. This is a huge achievement among a group of young people who each work hard for others.It is also  a great achievement for MacLeod Construction to be shortlisted for a national award.

However, on further reading, this was yet another unsurprising disappointment. The preferred corridor through Glen Croe is still to be announced and there is still no timetable for completion.Landslips at the Rest and be Thankful have frequently seen much of Argyll isolated from central Scotland, or journeys delayed by endless roadworks or convoys along the old military road. Most of these problems have occurred during the SNP’s  years in government and the continued failure to provide a permanent solution is yet more proof of how little the SNP cares about or understand the needs of people and businesses outside the central belt.It was clear long ago that patchwork schemes were not a solution but, rather than provide a new corridor which would have resulted in major capital expenditure, tens of millions of pounds have instead been wasted on years of ineffective schemes which nature evades in next to no time.In the meantime, the SNP has had no dficulty finding money to prop up central belt vanity projects like the Edinburgh trams.Mike Russell, SNP MSP for Argyll and Bute, has been far more concerned with Indyref and Brexit than the day to day concerns of his constituents and has done nothing to ensure that providing a reliable road connection to Argyll is a top priority for Michael Matheson, the Cabinet Secretary for Transport.The Holyrood elections on May  are an ideal opportunity for the residents and business owners in Argyll, whose daily lives are affected by such an unreliable road, to voice their dissatisfaction and vote for anyone other than the SNP or the Greens who oppose any road building on principle.A dferent government might not guarantee a speedy resolution, but after  years of failed sticking-plaster attempts to patch up the existing road, it certainly couldn’t be worse.Donald McCallum, Strathaven.Sir,Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signage.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples. In my opinion in the future Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs.Road signs help to regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important previews, especially during night-time conditions.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I write further to correspondence on Lochgilphead#s expensive new pavements.When they are finally finished, could somebody seethey have a bucket or two of tarry stones left over that could be chucked into the tank trap that passes for a roundabout, next to the Tesco garage David Hay, MinardSir,I have immense pleasure in communicating to your readers our new address following our successful relocation of our main office premises.Our email, website and telephone numbers remain the same as before.Email: info@abcab.org.uk and phone  .We have had no break in service and continue to provide advice and support to clients across Argyll and Bute, with our advisers all working from home under current government guidance.We are also available to provide advice to those who find themselves in a vulnerable position and require face-to-face advice by appointment in our Helensburgh and Lochgilphead offices.We commence our second volunteer adviser training programme next month and look forward to welcoming our new trainees.Jen Broadhurst, Bureau Manager, Argyll and Bute Citizens Advice BureauSir,Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year. Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.James O’Connell, Unite regional officer for Scotland.Sir,I work for a TV company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who are wanting to live a simpler le. The filming will take place over a number of months this year in rural Britain.The idea behind the series is about saying goodbye to smartphones, Zoom calls, social media # all the distractions and pressures of normal le # to go and live a simpler le, experience the #good le# fantasy and think about what our modern le and its multitude of choices has really given us.

When we hear of something that is dficult to believe, we want the evidence of our own eyes.Jesus#s disciple Thomas was like that. It was the week after the crucixion had destroyed their dreams. The disciples were huddled indoors in fear of their lives when suddenly the resurrected Jesus was there among them.Thomas hadn#t been with the others when it happened. He just could not bring himself to believe without seeing him for himself. Thomas gets a bad press because of this.We often react to this wee excerpt from Thomas#s story aswe would have been less reluctant to believe. We carry our willingness to believe as a badge of faith. Poor old Doubting Thomas.But is doubt a weakness  Or is it simply an opportunity, a space, a fertile ground in which faith might grow and ultimately blossom A week later, the disciples were gathered again in the same house where they had last seen Jesus. This time, Thomas was with them. Once again, Jesus came and stood among them. He greeted them again, #Peace be with you,# before turning and addressing Thomas directly.He said to him: #Put your finger here and see my hands. Put your hand in my side. Do not doubt but believe.#Jesus#s words are aimed not only at Thomas, but at everyone who encounters this story, and struggles to believe that God is capable of doing the very thing that God has promised — call our world into new and unending, resurrected le.#Do not doubt but believe.#"},{"url":null,"title":"american dream continues for bob","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

You can also plant the first early potatoes, weather dependent.For beginners, some of the easiest fruits to grow are berries. Strawberries and blueberries love containers or open ground and both will crop heavily once established.A simple garden solution for April is to create your very own veg patch. Mark out the area well, prepare the soil, dig in compost and then sow a iety of seeds that will provide you with veg all year round.It’s a common misconception that you need a lot of space to be able to grow vegetables. You can still achieve real success with container grown plants. Tomatoes will thrive in pots and grow bags and can also be grown in the ground.Another plant that loves container leis Lavender – and it’s the perfect time to plant it so that you can enjoy it throughout the summer. It’s a favourite with gardeners not just for its beautul form and fragrance but also because it attracts essential pollinators such as bees and butterflies.It’s considered a romantic flower that most gardeners get the urge to plant in their garden sooner or later and can add real value with its scent and shades of purple flowers and silver leaf backdrop. To successfully grow lavender, it needs to be planted in a warm, well drained soil with full sun. It is often planted as an edging plant with roses or grown as an informal hedge. However, lavender does not like ‘wet feet’ as it promotes root rot and dampness is often the reason that it doesn’t perform well. It’s a tough plant though and once established only requires regular pruning after flowering has finished in the autumn.April not only sees the start of National Gardening Week , but it really kicks off the gardening season.Top April tips from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 9 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of .  The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we’re delighted this funding means they can continue. Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet. This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le. It’s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans’ community give each other, helping each other through dficult time. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we’d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.Brian Sloan, Age Scotland chief executive "},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures april 9 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It underlines the fact that it is communities who know best what is best for them.Argyll and Bute Council was at the centre of ensuring our resilience teams got support and Scottish Government funding dispersed quickly and efficiently.That is why I find the decision of the Tory Lib Dem Independent ruling administration to remove the recycling service from Kintyre Recycling Ltdand taking it in-house as short-sighted. And giving them only six months notice is disgraceful.KRL has provided a reliable service for the community since  and given employment opportunities to people with barriers to work. It has a committed board and management team who have ersied the projects it does to ensure sustainability. But this decision leaves a gaping hole in its business plan and a workforce unsurethey will still have jobs.There is a projected increase in cost of £, to supply recycling bins across Kintyre. But this does not take account of the possible social and welfare cost of the impact on the workforce. This is yet another blow to the community already hammered by unemployment.I urge the council to work closely with KRL to find a solution that ensures that all of the KRL employees at risk of redundancy are found suitable employment and that this valuable organisation can continue to employ vulnerable people providing services from which everyone benefits.In , the SNP published a coloured map showing options for the route of the A at the Rest and Be Thankful. Nine years later, all they have done is colour in the map slightly dferently. We are no further forward.Whoever is in government after the election must stump up the money needed to construct a road protected from landslides. This must be done a lot quicker than the  years the SNP say it will take them.Without urgent action, many businesses in Argyll will not survive.Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signs.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside of Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples.In my opinion, in the future, Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs. Road signs help regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important preview especially during night-time conditions.I will continue to campaign for more frequent road sign maintenance for every corner of my ward.Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason, Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year.Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.I work for a television company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who want to live a simpler le. The filming will take place over a number of months this year in rural Britain.The idea behind the series is about saying goodbye to smartphones, Zoom calls, social media # all the distractions and pressures of normal le # to go and live a simpler le, experience the #good le# fantasy and think about what our modern le and its multitude of choices has really given us. We will explore the idea of whether, in fact, less is more.We are looking for people of all ages to apply families, couples, single people # to take time out from their normal le and step into a dferent way of living.If any of your readers are interested in finding out more, they should email simplele@fivemilefilms, telling us briefly why you would like to live a simpler le.Since the UK was first officially plunged into lockdown, we have lived through what is probably the most extraordinary year in most people#s letimes.Blind and partially sighted people have had to adjust like everyone  to the daily challenges this has created. Thankfully, there#s now light at the end of the tunnel. But some ongoing measures could continue to be barriers to their independence and confidence.People with sight-loss can sometimes find it dficult to judge space, so we#re asking everyone to maintain their own distance, be patient and be helpful.Just getting out and about can be more hazardous for those without sight. The government#s #Spaces for People# initiative has already transformed many of our streets and thoroughfares.We must take care that this doesn#t inadvertently create new obstacles for those with disabilities.The Covid crisis has given all of us a sense of uncertainty and vulnerability, of what it#s like to depend more on others. So let#s make one positive legacy of this crisis a resolve to make sure we re-emerge as a society in which no one is left at the margins.Following publication of his poem #On Distant Shore# in last week#s Courier, Jim McRobert, originally from Campbeltown but now living in Musselburgh, has sent in another one of his self-penned verses.

It is not depression it is more subtle and has spiritual overtones – I would say it is most profoundly a spiritual phenomenon.Looking into it, I clearly identied aspects of it in myself today! It appears to be the most #underdiagnosed# and unacknowledged spiritual illness of this age.I found that Pope Francis also came across it. Commenting in the context of healing the paralytic by the pool, he said the #first illness# is the one afflicting the paralysed man. He had #resigned himself to it,# the Pope said, #perhaps saying to himself: #Le is unfair, others are more fortunate than I am#. There is a plaintive tone in this way of speaking # there is resignation but there is also bitterness.#He added that it is an attitude reminiscent of #many [Christians] who lack enthusiasm and who are bitter#, who repeatedly say to themselves: #I go to [church] every Sunday but it is better not to become involved! I believe for my own sake, but I don#t feel the need to give it to others: each one peacefully at his own home.#These people, the Pope added, also take the attitude that # you do something well in le, they#ll reprove you: so, it#s better not to take the risk#.Good Friday, Easter Sunday # excellent days to take the risk and resolve to do something well in le, to set sensible goals to be better than I am now. But really, any day is a good day to do that."},{"url":null,"title":"vice presidents team takes the honours in tarbert opener","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In summary, the society was to promote the study of the archaeology of Kintyre and adjacent islands, to investigate the history and antiquities of the area and to preserve and publish relevant records and documents.The office-bearers were: President, Macdonald of Largie Vice-presidents, Sherf Macmaster Campbell, Colonel Mactaggart and Thomas Lindsay Galloway Hon secretary and treasurer, Duncan Colville Council, Mrs T L Galloway , Latimer MacInnes, Dean of Guild Neil McArthur, Major W Macalister Hall of Torrisdale, Mrs Macneal of Lossit , Archibald Dunlop Armour and Rev Norman Mackenzie.Of these, Macmaster Campbell, Mactaggart, MacInnes and Colville would power the research engine of the society in the early decades of its existence with studies on archaeology, history, place-names and local dialect.The scholarly talents of two of the founder-members, Macdonald of Largie and Lindsay Galloway, were almost immediately annulled by the time of the society#s first annual general meeting on November  , both were dead.Macdonald, a product of Eton and Oxford, was the author of a three-volume History of France, and Galloway, a distinguished mining engineer and protégé of Lord Kelvin, in  graduated MA at Glasgow University with first class honours in mathematics and natural philosophy, #a very rare distinction#."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Sadly we have all heard of someone who has been affected by stroke and many people like me have tragically lost someone too.Almost five years ago, my wonderful mum, Diana, suffered a severe stroke. She died four weeks later. My mum was the most active, #full of le# person I knew. She LOVED le. She was my best friend and I miss her every day. That#s why I want to ask your readers to take part in the Stroke Association#s A Walk to Remember.This wonderful event is a special way to celebrate the le of your loved one whilst raising money in their memory.Simply pick a special place that is filled with memories, create your route, and on June  take part in your own walk to remember to raise funds for the Stroke Association.Stroke strikes every five minutes in the UK, and there are around , survivors in Scotland living with its devastating effects who really need our help.Like so many charities, the pandemic has drastically affected the Stroke Association#s income.However the charity has still been supporting stroke survivors as much as they can with support and advice, while continuing to fund vital research into the condition.Please join me and do something amazing in your loved one#s memory by taking part in A Walk to Remember.It#s bound to be an emotional but amazing day for all of us that have lost someone to stroke. Walk in their memory and raise funds to rebuild more lives after stroke.To sign up, please visit https:www.stroke.org.uk fundraising a-walk-to-rememberChildren#s lives have been turned upside over the last year due to challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, with many spending extended periods of time out of school and behind closed doors.The NSPCC#s Childline service has heard from thousands of children who have found this time really challenging.Some have felt overwhelmed with home schooling and struggled to access their learning due to a lack of technology, whilst others have missed their friends and family and many have seen their mental health deteriorate.The NSPCC and Childline adapted during the pandemic so our frontline staff could continue to be here as a vital source of support for those children who felt like they had nowhere  to turn.Even though many children in Scotland are now back at school, it remains vital that we are still here to support those who are struggling with the impact that the pandemic has had on them.To help us be here for children and to remind them that Childline is a source of support they can turn to, we are encouraging schools across the country to get involved in the NSPCC#s Number Day.This annual fundraising day, which is based around fun maths activities, will take place in primary and secondary schools across the country on May  in aid of the children#s charity.As part of the day, schools can sign up to enjoy puzzles, games and challenges to raise vital funds.There are a range of activities for dferent age groups and teachers will also be provided with resources including information on supporting their school#s safeguarding.It#s now more essential than ever that children aren#t left alone, isolated and unsupported with their worries, and the money raised from Number Day will help the NSPCC in its mission to make  a better year for children.To sign up, visit the NSPCC#s website and search for Number Day and fill in your school#s details using the registration form.Age Scotland has won a £, grant for an innovative telephone friendship service which links older members of the ex-services community.Our Comradeship Circles service has helped to connect hundreds of older veterans for regular group calls since the pilot scheme was launched six months ago.The funding from the Armed Forces Covenant Fund Trust#s Tackling Loneliness Programme will enable our service to expand and continue until autumn , reaching even more older people. We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of . The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we#re delighted this funding means they can continue.Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet.This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le.It#s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans# community gives each other, helping each other through dficult times. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we#d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.I have been contacted by many of my constituents about the concerning condition of Ballymartin road on Islay.It has gradually been getting worse over the years but is now as bad as it has ever been and is getting to the stage that it#s nearly not passable for a small car without risking damage.I have raised this with our roads department and although funds are stretched, this road is clearly in need of some desperate repairs and,left unmaintained for any longer, will only end up costing the hard-pressed council taxpayer more to fix in the long-run."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The disciples were huddled indoors in fear of their lives when suddenly the resurrected Jesus was there among them.Thomas hadn#t been with the others when it happened. He just could not bring himself to believe without seeing him for himself. Thomas gets a bad press because of this.We often react to this wee excerpt from Thomas#s story aswe would have been less reluctant to believe. We carry our willingness to believe as a badge of faith. Poor old Doubting Thomas.But is doubt a weakness  Or is it simply an opportunity, a space, a fertile ground in which faith might grow and ultimately blossom A week later, the disciples were gathered again in the same house where they had last seen Jesus. This time, Thomas was with them. Once again, Jesus came and stood among them. He greeted them again, #Peace be with you,# before turning and addressing Thomas directly.He said to him: #Put your finger here and see my hands. Put your hand in my side. Do not doubt but believe.#Jesus#s words are aimed not only at Thomas, but at everyone who encounters this story, and struggles to believe that God is capable of doing the very thing that God has promised — call our world into new and unending, resurrected le.#Do not doubt but believe.#"},{"url":null,"title":"two pairs triumph at dunaverty","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

These devices have blocked an estimated , calls, of which , will have been scam phone calls prevented at least  scams and saved vulnerable households an estimated £, in NHS and health and social care costs.PC Laura Evans of Argyll and Dunbartonshire Policing Division said: #The most common types of scams at the moment are telephone and internet scams whereby the caller or person emailing, pretends to be someone , for example, someone from your bank, BT, Amazon or Sky.#We have a large number of telephone frauds where the caller is told their bank has set up a new account for them and has asked them to transfer their money to this new account. Your bank will never ask you to do this and I would encourage people to simply hang up the telephoneyou think you are being scammed or,you are concerned about someone  receiving scam calls, then consider a call-blocker device.#The most common calls being blocked by trueCall units are misleading sales of insurance for white goods, appliances or Sky equipment and attempts to sell cover for domestic home repairs.As more people signed up to streaming services during lockdown, there was an increase in scam calls purportedly from Amazon Prime, where cold callers said that the recipient#s subscription was due for renewal or that their account had been hacked.Another type of nuisance call which emerged towards the end of  was the sale of timeshares, possibly in response to widespread issues with travel and accommodation during the pandemic.An Argyll and Bute Council spokesperson said: #Scammers are unscrupulous with the sole intention of identying and exploiting the most vulnerable in our communities by obtaining people#s personal data and to encourage them to give the caller their bank details. This is often achieved by implying that urgent action is required – a tactic which particularly targets elderly and more vulnerable people.#The trueCall call-blocking unit can give our residents peace of mind, knowing thatthe phone rings it will be someone they want to talk to.#If you are being pestered by nuisance calls or you know a family member or friend that could benefit from having a call-blocker, please contact Argyll and Bute Trading Standards on    or tradingstandards.office@argyll-bute.gov.uk to apply for a free device.#"},{"url":null,"title":"announcements april 16 2021","story":"ProductionUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

There was mention the flat had not been used much for the purpose of respite for islanders.However, a report before IJB members said the lack of consultation over it closing had caused community concern. The meeting was told there had been #a mix up# over communicating what was happening with islanders.Councillor Mulvaney said he did not feel the flat merited still being in the budget. #We should have saved this [the money] a number of years ago,# he said.Councillor Currie said: #The flat has been used, not much, but it has been used. Everyone is accepting it could have been advertised better.#It was Mid Argyll councillor Sandy Taylor who asked for the service level agreement for the advocacy service to be spared from the savings option list as #a contribution to mental health.#MID ARGYLL AND ISLAY:People across Mid Argyll and Islay have had their mental health boosted thanks to the innovative #Take  Challenge# which began in Kintyre.Inspired by Campbeltown Tesco manager David Brown#s personal K-a-day challenge in , mental health network ACUMEN, in conjunction with Kintyre Link Club, organised the initiative encouraging more people to #take five# each day –  five minutes of walking, five deep breaths of fresh air or a five-kilometre walk or run – with the aim of boosting wellbeing.After success in Kintyre, ACUMEN mental health development worker Sarah McFadzean rolled the challenge out across Mid Argyll and Islay, where people are encouraged to support one another in their challenges by way of a dedicated Facebook group.Where possible, people have been able to meet in twos and, as restrictions change, it is hoped opportunities for groups to Take  together will increase as the initiative moves to the Oban, Lorn and the Isles area in June.Sarah said: #Being involved and enjoying the challenge is as important as the activities themselves.#I would like to thank everyone who supported and got involved in Take  for their enthusiasm and assistance.#We are in the process of developing a Mental Health Forum and Lived Experience Group in the Mid Argyll, Kintyre and the Isles, the purpose of which will be to gather thoughts on current service provision, listen to others# experiences and inform future planning, along with providing information from a range of services and peer support.#For more information contact sarah.mcfadzean@acumennetwork"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Meantime, however, with the exception of the magazine, all society activities remain in a state of suspension."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And now, more than a week later and despite updates in the interim about the reopening of schools, they#re still waiting – and it#s not acceptable.Like everyone , islanders are desperate to know when they can reconnect with family and friends. Island businesses are equally frantic to know when and how they can make plans for the weeks ahead.But, unlike everyone , our islands are at a complete disadvantage. They still don#t know what is happening, or when. They deserve better. The Scottish Government needs to respond to our islands# call for clarity and let them, like the rest of the country, start to think and plan ahead.Now in its nd year, the Big Garden Birdwatch is a chance for people of all ages to count the number of birds that visit their garden helping the Royal Society for the Protection of Birdsto build up a picture of how they are doing.This year, more than a million people across the UK, including more than , in Scotland, took part, counting  million birds.The event, held over the last weekend in January, revealed the house sparrow held on to its number one spot. But  out of the top  bird species showed declines in average numbers in Scotland compared to last year.Starlings remained in second place, but numbers were down  per cent compared to . Goldfinches saw the greatest decline in Scotland’s top , falling four places from sixth position last year, with reported numbers  per cent fewer than .I am absolutely delighted with the number of people who have taken part, making it the biggest year ever for RSPB Scotland.This has generated a massive amount of data which will help our scientists with important conservation work, but it also shows how many of us have turned to nature after what has been a dficult  months.We need every voice raised to stand up for nature. The wildle that brings us so much interest and solace is now just a fraction of what should be there.Big Garden Birdwatch has shown that people across Scotland have a real passion for their wildle. We now need government to take the global leadership, policy and legislative opportunities open to it this year to reverse the decline and restore nature.It#s no exaggeration to say that when a dog goes missing or is stolen, it is heart-breaking.Dogs for Good has put together some tips to reduce the likelihood of your dog being taken.If the unthinkable happens and your dog is taken, remember, you are not alone. There are plenty online groups and pages offering guidance and support. DogLost is an excellent charity which provides a free lost and found service.You should also noty police, dog wardens, vets and local rescue centres.Tables for Dementia UK#s annual cake and tea event, Time for a Cuppa, have been reset.Dementia UK is the only charity dedicated to supporting the whole family through dementia specialist Admiral Nurses.The charity#s annual fundraising event takes place between May  and May .Since its launch, it has raised more than £ million with the support of fundraisers, Dementia UK staff and celebrities.One of the highlights of last year#s event was celebrity supporters dressing up as much-loved characters to recreate tea party scenes from the world of film. Phyllis Logan was Mary Poppins, music producer Naughty Boy was Jay Gatsby, Emma Barton was Holly Golightly and Jess and Natalya Wright were Alice in Wonderland and the Queen of Hearts.Families with dementia have been adversely affected by lockdown for just over a year now. Care home visiting restrictions, the closure of support and respite services and the resulting social isolation and loneliness have disproportionately affected people living with dementia and their family carers.Whilst Time for a Cuppa will be slightly dferent this year, we know dementia support is needed more than ever. We are so grateful to all our fundraisers who will be whipping up treats, enthusiasm, funds and who are giving their time for others – in a socially distanced way of course – in what will be a special and important Time for a Cuppa.For more information about Time for a Cuppa and how to host your own tea party with our free fundraising pack, visit the dementiauk.org timeforacuppa webpage."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We have celebrated birthdays, weddings, Christmases, Easters and any day we can! There has been laughter and sadness, fun, hope and joy.It was  when the seeds were planted at the South Kintyre Fit Communities about the need to develop a shopping service to help older people on discharge from hospital, no longer able to drive or to carry heavy bags.Since then, we have provided not just a shopping service but a number of social activities and housekeeping throughout Kintyre. We have developed the #Making Kintyre Dementia Friendly# project to help all parts of the community to have an understanding of dementia and how it can be managed. We have worked with children of all ages, meeting and helping the older generation and look forward to doing so again.Covid- has changed all our lives and we have had to adapt to dferent ways of keeping in touch and keeping busy. Phone Buddies was set up and we had a monthly virtual tea.However, our plans – started last year – to celebrate our th anniversary with parties has had to be cancelled but we are marking the occasion with a specially made mug by Simon Rochford of Campbeltown Pottery.Thanks to everyone who has been involved in any way with Shopper-Aide – it has been and, I hope, will continue to be, a help to the older generations in Kintyre.So here is to the next  years."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In our desire to understand it, we have created starry patterns in our minds like the Plough, the Bull and so on, however, the signs of the Zodiac were already known to the Babylonians in  BC so that is not something new.Today, constellations like Aries, Gemini and others continue to fascinate followers of both astronomy and astrology.One of the most interesting star formations is the Pleiades, better known as the Seven Sisters. Positioned a little to the right of Taurus, they are an unmistakable sight in the winter sky.Even a modest pair of binoculars will reveal that there are many more stars in that cluster than the naked eye can discern. The Pleiades along with Orion, are even mentioned in the bible, in the Book of Job, chapter ..With the aid of binoculars these stars are a truly dazzling sight.The bible is a collection of books coming from the pens of many dferent authors over a long period of time. These books contain fascinating stories, many with moral teaching in them to guide us along the way of le.Alas, although the bible has sold millions of copies down the ages, it often remains unread and not consulted.Just as binoculars can enrich our vision of the #starry, starry night# so we can enrich our lives by a careful exploration of the bible and discover what it can teach us, so, let#s look at it more closely and take time to enjoy what it has to offer."},{"url":null,"title":"former-ross-high-pupil-ruari-paton-aiming-scottish-cup-glory","story":"Ruari Paton will be hoping to line up for Stranraer todaywhen they make the long journey north to face Brora Rangers, who stunned Hearts in the previous round.The frontman attended the Tranent secondary school after signing for Hibernian as a teenager and making the move from Dublin.Many had expected Stranraer to be travelling to Tynecastle this weekend but Brora caused one of the biggest shocks in the competitionrsquos history when they won - last Tuesday.Paton was part of the Stranraer team taking on Brechin City at the same time and said that his reaction was much the same as football fans up and down the country when he heard the result.He said: ldquoI would not like to take anything away from Brora but you donrsquot really hear of a Championship team getting beaten by a Highland League or a Lowland League team ever.ldquoIt was a shock, it was a big shock, but fair play to them.ldquoWhat an achievement it is and it is an amazing challenge to overcome.ldquoYou cannot take anything away from them.Stranraer have enjoyed an impressive start to the campaign, with just one defeat since the beginning of November, as they look toto League One.Paton, who now lives in Bothwell, South Lanarkshire, has been at the heart of that form, scoring eight goals in all competitions, with strikes against Spartans and a last-minute penalty winner against Kelty Hearts in the previous round.He has also found the net for Gala Fairydean Rovers, while on loan from Hibs, and for East Kilbride in the competition last year.Now, attention has turned to the trip to Brora and Paton said: ldquoTherersquos nothing better in the world than scoring.

Both of them made it very easy in terms of putting you at ease.ldquoHe was particularly interested in the history, not just of the racecourse, but also of the golf course. I think he had anticipated coming for just a race day, but we had gathered a lot of historical information about the racecourse and the golf course and he was very interested in both.ldquoThe impression I got was that he was a keen sportsman, but perhaps racing was not his first love, it was The Queenrsquos, and he was more interested in talking to people.ldquoHe did enjoy it ndash The Queen had a runner, and I got a bit carried away when we thought her horse was going to win.

Liberal Democrats have been highlighting the shocking state of mental health services across Scotland.Right now, adults can wait up to two years for necessary treatments.Even prior to the pandemic, waiting times for these vital community services were getting worse.Earlier this year, Lib Dems in the Scottish Parliament finally persuaded the Scottish Government to declare this awful situation a

First Aid courses were allowed to continue.During the recent budget negotiations, my party was able to secure pound million for community services and we need to see much more going towards these early help services.The impact on our families, communities and economy of failing to take this crisis seriously cannot be overstated.Under the current SNP Government, it is not just mental health services which have suffered.Nicola Sturgeon has broken her waiting times guarantee, failing , patients, meaning they have to wait longer than  weeks for vital services.The mismanagement of hospital construction has meant that the new Sick Kids building in Edinburgh has opened  years after it was promised.Now she is threatening closure of the vital Eye Pavilion, which has provided such fantastic treatment for so many across the Lothians.It appears that her Government wishes to move the service to St Johnrsquos in Livingston, making it extremely dficult for many communities across East

reflects local peoplersquos priorities too.We must do more to support our young people who have been devastated by the effects of Covid-.In East Lothian, the pupil-to-teacher ratio ranks alongside Edinburgh as the worst in Scotland.The SNP have failed to deliver on their promise of reducing class sizes and pupils are suffering restricted subject choice.Thatrsquos why the Scottish Conservatives are committed to delivering , extra teachers nationally.The SNP have made only limited progress in closing the attainment gap in our schools ndash despite saying it was their defining mission.Alongside the local Labour council administration, the SNP are failing pupils from the poorest backgrounds in East Lothian.Our countyrsquos attainment gap grew by three per cent between  and .It is unacceptable that the SNP Government have excluded local schools from receiving attainment challenge funding to address this.If elected as your MSP, I will press the case for more investment

Sturgeon recently set out her aims to ldquobring on stream underused theatre capacity in community and general hospitals to treat more patients as day cases... including in East Lothian Community Hospital in Haddington.That is an immediate benefit, on our doorstep.Wersquore helping children to learn by ensuring they donrsquot go hungry at school and investing in social housing and fair rents in the private sector.Meeting housing needs must be guided by principles of social justice, equality and human rights: everyone is entitled to a home that supports health, wellbeing, job prospects and le chances.The SNPrsquos lsquoHousing to rsquo plan was initiated before the pandemic.Having consulted widely across Scotland, it is delivering a housing strategy putting people and communities first, with , affordable homes by  , including  per cent for social housing.The construction industry can benefit the economy and good-quality housing can transform lives.I believe voters trust the SNP to build the post-Covid recovery of public services.They have already rejected Boris Johnsonrsquos Brexit shambles and its  promise to spend billions more on the NHS.I believe East Lothian voters will similarly reject the Labour and Tory recent support of stockpiling even more nuclear weapons, rather than spending those billions on health, housing and education.Broken promises undermine public trust, and trust is fundamental in this election.Which leader do you trust to form a government that represents your values and prioritises public services meeting your communityrsquos needs

a mark of respect for HM The Queen and the Royal Family.Prince Philip was a remarkable public servant and we will again suspend campaigning on Saturday for his funeral to reflect on his contribution to public le.Before campaigning was suspended, Scottish Labour unveiled its recovery plan for the economy and jobs.At its heart is a pound. billion jobs recovery plan, the biggest job creation scheme in the history of devolution.This recognises the scale of the looming jobs crisis the country faces.It includes guaranteeing a job or training for every under-, as well as those over- who are long-term unemployed, , new apprenticeships and a skills revolution.The party also launched plans for an ambitious climate recovery, something Scottish Labour believes should go hand in hand with our economic recovery.This includes investing in green transport, safer walking and cycling routes, free bus travel for under-s, making all homes energy efficient to reduce living costs, create jobs and help to reduce our carbon emissions.These innovative national plans will translate well to a local level, providing a framework to support East Lothianrsquos recovery.However, Irsquom very clear that our local recovery, while backed by national guidance and funding, must be designed and delivered locally, not by ministers and civil servants in Edinburgh.Over the last year, our communities have demonstrated how they can come together in times of need and look after each other.Local communities, businesses and organisations should be empowered to show the same drive and determination in recovering from Covid- that they have shown throughout the crisis.Finally, on a more personal note, I have pledged my support for several important campaigns and initiatives so far during the campaign.Among them are the Teach the Future pledge on making the climate emergency part of the curriculum the More for Scotlandrsquos Animals pledge on animal welfare the Walk, Wheel, Cycle, Vote

has been there for us ndash sometimes at great personal cost.I believe that offering our NHS staff an inflation-busting four per cent pay rise is well deserved, although I wish it could be more.South of the Border, one per cent is being imposed.This is simply an insult.There is a perception that our NHS is lsquobrokenrsquo in some way.I do not believe this, but I do see a huge organisation which now needs to re-invent itself, not for the first time, into an efficient, modern support for us all.However, our NHS is genuinely under threat.Privatisation is not just a scare word.The Transatlantic Trade Deal being negotiated with the USA leaves our NHS vulnerable and available for sale.Our SNP MPs proposed an amendment which would have ensured that our NHS remained in the public ownership.The Westminster Government rejected that safeguard.Since GP surgeries are independent contractors, not run by the NHS, they are vulnerable to being sold to the highest bidder.This is how the system was set up in .It may have made sense at the time but no longer.We must review the deal with doctors and ensure that creeping privatisation cannot take place.In Scotland, we have control over our NHS.However, the UK Government passed the Internal Markets Act, which allows UK Government ministers to arbitrarily enforce a lsquolevelling outrsquo of regulations and dferences between the nations of the UK.This would allow London to make NHS Scotland available for sale regardless of our wishes.I will fight to prevent the loss of our NHS and the best way to be sure of that is to take back control of our own affairs.Please give me an opportunity on May  to continue to serve our community and to protect our NHS.Stevie Curran IrsquoD LIKE to begin by expressing my sadness at the passing of the Duke of Edinburgh ndash a dedicated public servant.I send my condolences to Her Majesty The Queen and her family.The quality of our social care system should be a key issue at this election.The speed with which the failings of our social care system were exposed last spring was ghastly.The Covid crisis didnrsquot bring about the crisis in social care, it was already there.It simply brought it to the top of the agenda.The challenge of Covid- has made the crisis in care even more acute.The movement of people from hospital settings, without consultation and without being tested, into care homes to accommodate Covid patients was a human rights scandal.This contributed to the devastating reality of care homes becoming the epicentre of the pandemic and almost a third of deaths across the country being people from care homes.Scotlandrsquos social care workers have also been on the frontline in the fight against Covid.Their commitment, alongside all our other frontline workers, to help keep us safe during this public health emergency has been heroic.Scottish Labour has been calling for a National Care Service for some years now, a service that will include local governmentrsquos social care staff as partners in the service delivery.It will put the dignity of iniduals and the quality of services before profit.We must address the inequalities in the sector as it deals with the shortcomings highlighted in the recent Feeley Report, which I donrsquot think goes far enough.Scotland urgently needs a plan to transform social care. Scottish Labour knows that urgent reform and investment is needed and thatrsquos why we are working with the public to make our vision for a National Care Service a reality.We donrsquot want to just talk about the problems, we want a plan for how things could be better.Charles Dundas A QUESTION which I keep being asked during this campaign is what will the Scottish Liberal Democrats do for those in our communities who are struggling to make ends meet, especially those with children I know that all parties are committed to reducing child poverty, but here is what I want to do about it.Willie Rennie and the Scottish Liberal Democrats will commit to doubling the Scottish Child Payment.This is currently available at pound per week to eligible children under six.This will rise to take in under-s in the next few years and we will pay pound per week.We are also keen to listen to campaigners who want to extend the payments to include disabled children or those with disabled parents.It was Liberal Democrats who reintroduced free school meals and targeted extra money to schools who needed it most in England, and in Scotland we will extend free school meals to cover all primary school pupils all through the year, including school holidays.This will also help these children with their education since a hungry child finds it dficult to focus and learn.The Scottish Lib Dems also pledge to increase the amount of free childcare Scotland offers, increasing it to a full , hours for every two-year-old.At the moment only some twoyear-olds are eligible, and takeup of the places is very low.By expanding the scheme, wersquod hope it would be more useful to more and more working parents, helping them get back to work and all the benefits that brings to society and the economy.We will also extend the number of summer clubs on offer to eligible children to help parents on low incomes with the costs of childcare during the school holidays.Plus, our manesto pledge on fuel poverty will also help us with child poverty.Warm homes with lower heating costs undoubtedly help the families who need it most, and I think that Midlothian North and Musselburgh would benefit from more Liberal Democrat policies like these in place after the election.Iain Whyte AS PART of my campaign, I have been highlighting the need for more local policing and ato locally based crime prevention across the constituency.This should be backed by visible local police patrols in our neighbourhoods to deter and detect crime.So, it was disappointing to read news articles this week highlighting police advice to Musselburgh householders about securing their garden sheds due to a spate of breakins.The crimes seem to have been concentrated in the Stoneybank area but the advice is valuable for everyone.Police say you should make sure your shed is secure and should fit an alarmthere is anything valuable inside.The alarms can be provided free to elderly and vulnerable residents: email MusselburghWestCPT@scotland.pnn.police.ukSince Police Scotland was formed, there has been a centralisation of our policing that I want to see reversed.During that time, public awareness of police patrols fell from  to  per cent.I know from my time as chair of Lothian and Borders Police Board that locally based crime prevention had a really positive impact.Crime fell and communities felt far more connected to their local officers, who they knew were working on their priorities.Thatrsquos why I want to see beefed-up neighbourhood policing teams and theirin the parts of the constituency where they have been reduced or removed.These teams work well on a preventative agenda.They solve problem issues and work with the community sorting things like housebreaking sprees and anti-social behaviour.I also strongly support the wider Scottish Conservative campaign to introduce a Local Policing Act to boost local police patrols and increase community engagement with policing decisions.This goes alongside our plan to tackle more serious crime by introducing a Victims Law to end the SNPrsquos soft-touch justice system.This would give judges the ability to put the very worst criminals behind bars for le.It would also end automatic early release, so that criminals must earn parole.Musselburgh residents need to see a more visible, local and responsive police service.That would be my aimyou elect me as your MSP."},{"url":null,"title":"boxing-world-champion-josh-taylor-vows-visit-aidan-hogg","story":"Josh will step into the ring with Jose Ramirez for the most important

It was again all too good to be true. As has become the depressing norm throughout this pandemic, once the Big Brother ldquonewspeak of the First Ministers briefing had been fully digested, it became very clear that there was to be no light at the end of this business-destroying tunnel, certainly not this side of the summer or possibly even autumn.I had perked up when the First Minister said that she knows \"many people that want to see venues, like, nightclubs, open again\" and that she was more optimistic and hopeful that all of that would be possible over the summer period. I wanted to believe this was true, share her optimism, but the cold and brutal reality was that this hollow announcement had changed nothing. There would be no ldquoFreedom Friday\" for any of these struggling sectors today, tomorrow, or for months to come,at all.And, with my hopes again cynically and cruelly crushed by a government to which I had once given my full support, believing in my naivety that they actually cared about Scotlandrsquos live music and night time economies, I trundled home feeling as let down and deflated as my worn tyres.I wasnrsquot alone. A spokesman for the NTIA, which represents nightclubs and entertainment venues, was equally disappointed at the vague talk of loosening restrictions sometime in the future and said, ldquountil there is a complete end to all legal restrictions on capacity, activity and operating hours, our sector simply cannot trade viably.They say the devil is in the detail.

When it become clear he hadnrsquot, we all relaxed and enjoyed the sideshow.Then, after a bit more thought, she added: ldquoOn the whole Irsquod say Alba has removed some of the more embarrassing trouble-makers in a way that is not unpleasing.Some SNP activists have been transfixed by Alba, like motorists rubbernecking a car crash. But a few more cynical souls are starting to see more than a spectacle, they scent an opportunity for the national movement to finally jettison its more chauvinistic and counter-productive fringe.How Burdiehouse has been revealed as ground zero for a rediscovery of Scots lsquoexonymsrsquoIt is still not really clear what kind of party Mr Salmond is building: he has attracted several dferent clans of contrarians of social conservatives of leftists, of nationalists who are more flaggy than civic and, bluntly, of online conspiracists. Itrsquos quite the eclectic mix.It would be unfair to portray Alba purely as a problematically nationalistic project. Its membership is ied ndash as are the reasons why they have become disillusioned by the SNP. But there are signs some of its candidates and supporters feel, well, disinhibited.One campaign video this week starred the actor, Angus MacFadyen, who played Robert the Bruce in the s patriotic shlock gorefest Braveheart. Narrating pictures of saltire-waving protestors, he talked of ldquobreaking the spine of English superiorityrsquorsquo. Sturgeon backers winced, but almost gleefully. Itrsquos like the party has had a political enema and feels the better for it.But how,at all, will the SNP change without those members ndash and handful of politicians ndash who quit for Alba Not by much, insist those loyal to leader Nicola Sturgeon. Why  Because Mr Salmondrsquos backers had already been routed after trying to stage an insurrection inside the party. They left, in short, because they had lost.Even before the SNP civil war, Salmond supporters were already marginal, according to this line of thinking. ldquoThere are no lsquowharsquos like usrsquo nationalists in the leadership and not many in the membership either, said one party figure, talking about national chauvinists.But such nationalists, eventhey are a minority, do exist. And they can certainly make themselves visible. Some of them have proved incredibly off-putting to wavering indy-curious voters, especially on social media.Could Alba help detox the SNP of such ldquocybernats  Has Mr Salmond, like a pied piper, played a tune to march all of them away from the political front line James Mitchell is not sure. The professor of public policy at Edinburgh University has spent much of his career studying the anatomy of Scottish nationalism.ldquoDetoxication is just rhetoric politicians use when people previously seen as valued members leave, he said. ldquoThere may have been some desire to see some of Albarsquos people go but most of them were previously more than welcome.Mr Mitchell also stressed how hard it is to pigeonhole the kind of people who have defected to Alba and those who have stayed behind.Blair McDougall echoes this. A Labour strategist who led the pro-UK Better Together campaign ahead of the  independence referendum, he smells hypocrisy. ldquoThe same people who told us a few days ago that the aggressive, abusive ethnic nationalist minority didnrsquot exist in their party are now telling us that fringe has left, he said. ldquoSome have, some havenrsquot.Inside the SNP there is another answer to whether their movement, their party can detox: it depends on how well Mr Salmondrsquos party does.Alba, for them, could be the bin lorry that takes the SNPrsquos trash to the tip, to be forgotten forever. Or it could deliver the old rubbish right in to the chamber of the Scottish Parliament.Would that put a smell on the entire independence project  Maybe. Mainstream nationalist sources hope Ms Sturgeon could wave her hand under her nose and point towards Mr Salmond. It is not her stench, after all.Her former mentor was once also a part of the great sht of the SNP away from being unelectable eccentrics to what appears, for the time being at least, to be the natural party of devolved government. But that was before Mr Salmond lost the  indyref, lashed out at the media and wound up fronting a chat show on Vladimir Putinrsquos premier western mouthpiece, RT.It does not look like Ms Sturgeonrsquos opponents will let her forget Mr Salmondhe was lurking on the back benches. But would the SNP have to look and sound more impatient about independence to shore up its more nationalist flank Mr McDougall senses that Ms Sturgeon is already being dragged away from the constitutional centre ground to try and protect her more nationalist flank.ldquoThe cautiousness on timing of attempting another vote has been replaced by an urgency that isnrsquot shared by the swing voters who are much more lsquonot never, but certainly not nowrsquo, he said.SNP sources, on the contrary, expect their leader to be pragmatic and to put as much clear, saltire-blue sea between her and Mr Salmond as possible.Right now it is hard to know how Alba will perform next month. Most pollsters suggest the start-up is dead-on-arrival, not least because of the personal approval ratings of its leader.However, two surveys, by the same firm, give Alba just enough votes to deliver some MSPs and, potentially, cost the SNP its overall majority.Leading Scots fishing skipper facing fines of pound, for illegal dredgingDefeat means less exposure, especially on TV.

A UK trial of this vaccine on children has been halted as a precaution.Johnson and Johnson delayed the rollout of its vaccine in Europe after US health agencies called for a pause there while they investigate blood clot incidents. Also in the US, the National Institutes of Health is investigating why some people have had allergic reactions, including severe anaphylactic shock, after receiving the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.By the th of March, the UK had recorded, under the government Yellow Card scheme, a not insignicant number of suspected adverse reactions to Covid vaccines reported by members of the public or health professionals: , for the Pfizer vaccine, and , for the AstraZeneca one. Many of these adverse reactions were trivial. Others were not. They included cases where the person died shortly after vaccination:  and  reports for the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines respectively.Meanwhile, Covid virus fatality statistics have been collated on an entirely dferent basis. Any death within  days of a positive Covid test has been recorded as a Covid fatality, eventhe person in question died in a road accident, or had a heart attack.And now, guess what  Another U-turn. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal that % of registered coronavirus deaths are people who have died ldquowith the virus rather than ldquofrom it. In other words, although they tested positive for Covid, that was not the primary cause of their death.So it appears that UK Covid death statistics have been inflated either by accident, or by intention. We may yet see these latest mortality figures revised downwards as government death recording guidance is scrutinised further. As it stands, a truer tally appears to be around , deaths, not the oft-quoted ,.Observe how supposedly reliable ldquofacts and figures underpinning Johnsonrsquos Covid narrative donrsquot add up. But the efficacy of lockdown, his currently preferred strategy, is surely incontrovertible Not according to Simon Wood, a professor of statistics at the University of Edinburgh. He has run the figures for the last three lockdowns. They show that fatal Covid infections were falling before each lockdown was imposed. Sweden also saw its daily infection rate starting to decline only a day or two after the UK, he points out, even though that country didnrsquot lock down. Indeed, the pattern of deaths in Sweden is strikingly similar to that in the UK. The dference is that Swedenrsquos economy isnrsquot wrecked as ours is. Professor Tim Spector, creator of the Zoe Covid app, also agrees that lockdown is not the main reason for plummeting cases.Farmers and food-lovers will pay the price of ill-advised rush to fake meatStringent lockdowns do not reduce casualties, as Perursquos quasi-military lockdown yet high Covid death rate shows. And as you read this, millions of Americans in the states of Florida, Texas, Georgia, South Dakota, South Carolina and Mississippi, are going about their daily business, hugging their loved ones, enjoying a baseball game, socialising in crowds, mainly unmasked. These states have no lockdown restrictions, yet their Covid numbers have dropped dramatically.Professor Wood asks: \"If lockdowns were not essential to turning the tides of the epidemic, the question remains whether they were worth the collateral damage. The answer is no. Of the non-pharmaceutical tools we have to fight respiratory viruses, lockdowns are blunt, and of questionable utility. Yet in the hands of tinpot despots like Boris Johnson, and Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel, who jump to the ldquoGreat Reset tune of their corporate masters at the World Economic Forum, they become frighteningly destructive weapons to oppress us.

At the back. Hello Eventually the coast is clear and, after giving up on the phone, thereby defying collection orders and simply knocking on the door, the exchange is completed in the now-normal perfunctory and completely warmth-free way and I cross the river in the usual nose-to-tail lockdown traffic with dinner in its box, in the boot.Honestly  It can be challenging, this meal-in-a-box gig. At least Monadh is staying true to its Michelin Bib Gourmand status and keeping things simple: no seeds to plant, videos to watch or playlist to turn on and thankfully absolutely nothing that we have to cook from scratch ourselves.A plump and crisped smoked haddock fishcake is sprung from the oven after  minutes while the dauphinoise spuds that are to go with the main course bubble along contentedly and a ballotine of corn-fed chicken simmers in its pot, for tickety-tock  minutes and counting down on Alexa.The fish cake is of the conversation-stopping iety.Yeah, I know, itrsquos just mash and haddock, but somehow the proportions of this conspire to make us nod and poke and hold up herby bits and tangible chunks, and sigh when itrsquos all eaten.Potato and spinach soup is spooned up next, its instructions being no more complex than: reheat to boil then split into bowls.Decent enough. This meal all sashays together pretty smoothly, as though someone actually tested this in a home kitchen instead of a commercial one, with its mystical heating times and magical searing abilities.Read more:https:www.heraldscotland news .bad-seeds-edinburgh-ron-mackennas-eating-review True, therersquos a little bit of microwave action involved in zapping the roast celeriac and then its puree too, a red wine jus gets to boil like a loony for a mo before it too joins the rest of the gang on the plates on the breakfast bar.We love this dauphinoise, signicantly better than Markies, and you canrsquot say that every day, while the asparagus stuffing the ballotine is still crisp and fresh. If there are any complaints itrsquos no more than a hand raised at the back over the slightly waxy texture of the chicken.Frankly  I liked it. And then Monadh Kitchen does what pretty much nobody, not even the Michelin-starred gods, has achieved in a year or so of meals in a box: it produces a delicious dessert.ldquoYou liked that, Debs says as I all but lick the last remnants from the sideplate and scan hers to seetherersquos any left.

Which in a way is pretty much the whole ethos behind the Michelin Guidersquos Bib Gourmand. Chapeau! ndash as those cunning Frenchies say.Well, almost Chapeau! ndash there was supposed to be fig bread with basil pesto to start. The pesto was there and was so good I ate most of it with a teaspoon but of the fig bread there was no sign, and rather rudely no explanation for its absence either, simply an apology of a focaccia which had the taste and texture of a cross between a failed scone and a place-mat.Ho hum, but hardly denting the overall positive impression of this otherwise very good box meal. Lockdown meals are definitely improving.At Home With MonadhMonadh Kitchen,BearsdenGlasgow  .Menu: Revolving menu of locally sourced Scottish dishes including, smoked haddock fishcakes, ballotine of chicken with asparagusand all with a Michelin Bib Gourmand twist.

Seriously, Ms Sturgeon was making a pertinent point. Which is that a staged fight over who is the most avid for independence might momentarily amuse the zealous, as they formed a ring, chanting ldquofight, fight, fight.She noted, however, that it would do nothing to impress those who remain unpersuaded by the merits of independence in the first place. They might simply turn away, faintly nauseated.Which is why the leitmot of Ms Sturgeonrsquos launch was continuity. As it has been for the entire campaign thus far.That seems to me particularly apt this week. Today brings the funeral service for the Duke of Edinburgh. The arrangements are, inevitably and rightly, suppressed by Covid.But, still, the gathering at Windsor offers a visible reminder of the core constitutional continuity presented by the Royal Family, alongside the collective desire to give thanks for a le of long and devoted service.Events occasionally conspire, Oprah Winfrey et al, to make many of us contemplate the Royal Family asthey were stars in a soap opera, a source of innocent merriment or exaggerated empathy.They are, of course, much more. They are ldquothe firm. They are the much-altered but still salient Royal prerogative. They are the palpable core of the United Kingdom.When party leaders at Holyrood paid tribute this week, it was left to Patrick Harvie of the Greens to note, en passant, that support for the institution of Monarchy was not universal in Scotland. However, he subsumed this Republican thought beneath personal sympathy for the Queen and her family.:Coronavirus: From Indias double mutant to vaccine hesitancy and the supply slowdownNicola Sturgeon sounded a genuine, personal note as she evinced admiration for the wit and intellect of the Duke, whom she met frequently at Balmoral and where. They shared, she disclosed, an intense interest in books.But her general theme was, again, one of continuity. The Dukersquos role as a constant companion to the Queen, the cherry trees they planted in the grounds of Canongate Kirk, which she hoped would thrive and bloom for many years.Of all the sundry institutions which comprise the UK State, it has long struck me that the Palace gets devolution best. Perhaps alongside the Foreign and Commonwealth Office which, as one mandarin once told me with a wry grin, is well used to dealing with troublesome colonies.The Palace appreciates the need to work with the UKrsquos devolved apparatus. For example, the Sovereign regularly travels to her palace of Holyroodhouse to welcome new First Ministers from over the road, rather than obliging them to sojourn to London.While representing continuity, the Palace is adaptable. Within limits, it moves with the times, often cajoled down the decades by the Duke of Edinburgh. The Queenrsquos own speeches to the Scottish Parliament constantly endorse devolved governance.However, the Queen has also been known, very occasionally, to express disquiet at potential constitutional change.In , as Scottish devolution was under active discourse, the Sovereign said she could readily understand such aspirations but could not forget that she was ldquocrowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.More recently, in , days before the independence referendum, the Queen was also in contemplative mood, perhaps prompted by advisers. Asked about the ballot by a by-stander outside Crathie Kirk, she said that she hoped people would think very carefully about the future.Nicola Sturgeon thoroughly understands this nuanced approach by the wary Palace to the malleable UK constitution.She studiously avoids placing any question marks against the Regal Union of . She is not about to pick a fight, arm wrestling or otherwise, with the Monarchy.However, she does maintain a standing challenge to the Parliamentary Union of . She does want, in the word of the moment, to affect transformational change there.Yet she also understands that, right now, the people of Scotland remain deeply, deeply apprehensive and unsure about their future.:Kevin McKenna: Recover from the virus and a referendum  We can do bothThey contemplate the pandemic, this hideous plague, and they fret. They also cast their minds back to the banking crisis of , from which we have yet to recover. They consider too the disruption of Brexit, which may or may not resolve itself.Folk need reassurance. Which is precisely what Nicola Sturgeon was attempting to offer this week, most notably with regard to indyref but also in her policies on income tax.Ms Sturgeon declared that tackling Covid must come first, with indyref on hold until the middle of the new Parliament. She opts for popular pragmatism. She calculates that there is little to be gained from evoking the spirit of William Wallace, or even Robert the Bruce.Once more, it is easy to understand why this might exasperate the most eager adherents of the independence cause. Incidentally, it also irks the Conservatives who yearn for constitutional wrestling arms, feet, whatever.This week, also, there was some passing interest in a poll which suggested that fewer than one in five of the Scottish population ranked independence as among the most important issues at this election.That did not surprise me. Constitutional questions, even independence, are generally second order matters, unless a population is actively experiencing oppression, either physical or spiritual.By ldquosecond order, I do not remotely intend to say that such matters are unimportant. Merely that they are dferent, that they are regarded by the people as conduits towards the issues which dominate their thoughts, such as employment, health and security.That is the error the Tories previously made when they used to say that devolution was never raised on the doorsteps. They needed to ask a second question: how best might you address the concerns you have raised Nicola Sturgeon gets that distinction. She understands the yearning for stability in a time of turmoil. That is why her offer, for the most enthusiastic fans of independence, is Paradise Deferred.Our columns are s for writers to express their opinions.They do not necessarily represent the views of The Herald"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-view-voters-right-put-manifestos-close-scrutimy","story":"Nowadays, itrsquos the other way around. The manesto, for modern political parties, resembles a catalogue of things they would like to see.

The voters are therefore entitled to regard it, and the offerings of the other parties, as a shopping list and, like all shopping lists, assess whether they would like those particular items, and ask how much theyrsquoll cost.Whatrsquos more, cynical though it may seem, since no political party of any sort ever elected anywhere has delivered every single manesto promise ndash it would be fairer to the parties, and more honest, to call them ldquoambitions ndash voters are entitled to take a sceptical approach when considering whether proposed measures are a desirable b affordable c likely to happen.All parties offer policies they think will gain them support: when it comes to something like Brexit or independence, or even issues such as voting reform or nationalisation, voters may already have firm views on which they favour, or be open to persuasion. Party positions are likely to be clear.When it comes to spending priorities, manesto claims are more likely to be both blatantly populist and challenged by political opponents on the grounds of affordability and credibility. The more of them there are, the easier it is to present them as unrealistic.The SNPrsquos proposals ndash which supporters will no doubt characterise as ambitious and offering real improvements ndash are certainly wide-ranging enough to have been greeted with incredulity by opposition parties. To promise a  per cent rise in NHS spending over the parliament, free dentistry, pilot schemes on universal basic income and a four-day week, free laptops and bicycles for schoolchildren, increased education, mental health and other public spending, while at the same time ruling out any rise in income tax, is to invite the question of where the money is coming from.Other parties will have similarly ambitious and superficially attractive policies that deserve equally close scrutiny: the Tories, as well as spending with abandon across the UK, are promising , more teachers and extravagant transport projects Labour aims to guarantee a job for every young Scot, as do the LibDems the Greens want to spend pound. billion and create , jobs. Any or all of these plans may well be judged undesirable, costly or unrealistic.Nor are they votersrsquo sole criteria: the drubbing Labour received at the last General Election may have been due to people thinking its manesto expensive and fancul, but other factors, such as Brexit and Jeremy Corbynrsquos personal qualities, may have been more important. Inidual members of the electorate may prioritise independence or the Union, a partyrsquos general stance on, for example, the economy, or their judgment of its leadersrsquo competence and integrity.But the fact that the SNP has been in government for  years is bound to place its manesto plans under closer scrutiny. Any partyrsquos record in government should be a consideration: has it delivered on previous promises  Have matters, in any given sphere, improved or deteriorated According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Holyrood is already spending pound. for every pound of public spending in England and Wales, almost all of it provided by the Barnett formula. If a still more expansive and expensive range of policies is now desirable and possible, why havenrsquot they already been introduced andthere is a good reason why, what has changed  Voters may not decide on these issues alone, but they deserve to hear an honest assessment of them."},{"url":null,"title":"old-firm-now-got-attention-talk-sport","story":"The slogan was a throwaway sight gag  years ago, but anyone who has worked in sport across Scotland will recognise its bait-and-switch spirit is alive and well in our mediarsquos output, especially this weekend...Scroll through the sport section of any national newspaper website in Scotland and yoursquoll iniably have to st through mounds of creaking Old Firm content before uncovering how Robert MacIntyre played at Augusta the night before.Coverage of minority sports and even other football teams is almost apologetic in its presentation.

The majority of children were deficient in basic, parental care..It was agreed that a new system of ldquoneeds not deeds was required whereall but the most serious cases would be taken out of the courts and handled by a  of highly trained, volunteers.This is an enduring system of  yearsThe first childrenrsquos hearings took place  years ago this week on April   and while the system has evolved and changed over the decades and poverty and the complexity of cases has increased, the ethos remains the same - the protection of the child.:Nicola Sturgeon accused of record of shame over child povertyLord Kilbrandondied at his home near Oban, aged  in . As well as overseeing the legal reform for the treatment of young offenders, he was also author of the report which proposed a Scottish Assembly.Today, offences make up a small proportion of the cases that are heard in local authority offices. Most involve neglect or abuse in a pattern that is often repeated through generations and tends to be rooted in poverty and deprivation.Of the , children and young people who were receiving support from local authorities in March , % had only every been referred on care and protection grounds.In , an act was passed by the Scottish Government raising the age of criminal responsibility from eight to  but child protection leaders believes this doesnrsquot go far enough.ldquoChildrenrsquos Hearings Scotland are on record as supporting up to , says Elliott Jackson, National Convenor and CEO of Childrenrsquos Hearings Scotland.ldquoThere is a lot of work going on with the Scottish Government and I think there is an inevitability about moving it forward in incremental steps from  to .ldquoThere are many arguments that a young person is a young person until they turn .ldquoDecriminalising children is absolutely critical and aligned with making sure Scotland is the most important place to grow up in.\"But I think there is another element here in terms of public accountability, in terms of the victims of crime. They need to feel supported. If someone commits a serious crime, they will be filtered out and dealt with by the courts.An Independent Care Review set up by Scotlandrsquos First Minister recommended that help for families must be delivered much earlier and the hearing system must plan to ldquoshrink and specialise,ldquoEveryone in the hearings system welcomes this, ldquo says the CEO.ldquoWe have always argued for is that those children and their families who are referred by social workers, police etc should get support much earlier.ldquoThey are looking to really invest in family support with the Scottish Government which means there is enough resources that we have agencies who can parachute in to work with that family before they get to a crisis point.ldquoWe handle , hearings a year and have got , children and young people on our books so evengot half that, , children across Scotland are getting their needs met, further upstream than having to come into the hearings system.Over  , , Childrenrsquos Hearings were held for , children and young people.There are around , volunteers, who contribute to the system, filling six roles. Each hearing is lsquostaffedrsquo by three  members who decide the best course of action of vulnerable children after careful consideration of reports and the advice of social workers, child psychologists, teachers and reporters, who oversee the entire process.: Orkney child protection scandals still casts a shadow,  years onldquoWhen we look back at Kilbrandon, this is an enduring system of  years. Childrenrsquos  members go through an incredible amount of training. They receive a professional development award, which is SQA approved and they have a commitment for ongoing training.ldquoFor any new piece of legislation that comes into force, we have to make sure that  members are aware of how this impacts on their practice. They have to be trauma informed, which they are. ldquoMr Jackson said he would like to see an end to male female gender split quotas which he said results in appointees having to turn down ldquoexcellent female candidates, while % should come from a care experienced background and this yearrsquos intake has achieved %.The views of the child are central to the process but  members must balance this with the protection and welfare of the young person.The majority will be placed under a Compulsory Supervision Orderwhich results in a network of local authority support being put in place for the child, which can be as straightforward as assistance to get to school, curfews or mental health support.Minimum intervention and keeping children in the family home,it is safe to do so, is a cornerstone of the system as research shows it results in better outcomes.Mr Jackson suggests CSOrsquos may in future apply to the whole family and not just the child because, there has been accusations that it is seen as a punitive rather than protective measure.The Childrenrsquos Hearing System is unique to Scotland, although a similar system was adopted in Guernsey. Why does Mr Jackson believe it has not been replicated south of the border ldquoI was a  member in the late s and I remember that on two or three occasions, someone from Whitehall would attend a hearing to look at the system.ldquoEngland is a huge slumbering giant of a country and I donrsquot knowit was too complex in terms of changing it.\"They moved to a model of family courts, so they have adopted some elements of the system. \"I think the principle of keeping children out of court is hugely important and they have gone some way through family mediation and family mediation court models etc. I sense that from their perspective they have gone as far as they could but they have just announced a care review in England so who knows - they may revisit it.The national convenor said the pandemic had taken a huge toll on the hearings system. Local authorities were tasked with prioritising the most serious cases and he believes it may take until January  to deal with the huge backlog of cases.ldquoCovid has impacted enormously on the system, said the CEO.ldquoWe had to flick the system completely from face-to-face to online.ldquoWe managed to do that successfully and the government brought in emergency legislation, which allowed our colleagues at SCRA  to make powers such as extending legal orders, which was really helpful to protect those children who were most vulnerable.ldquoAs each element of the restrictions kicked in we had to respond pretty quickly. Face-to-face hearings were only held in exceptional circumstances but the wearing of masks changes the dynamic.ldquoCertainly itrsquos been a bit of a challenge.\"The combination of  members, reporters, social workers have all done extremely well in really, really dficult circumstances.Added to the backlog of cases, the child protection sector is expected to experience a surge in referrals in the coming months. With services restricted and school closures children have been less visible through the pandemic.ldquoThey talk about hidden harm such as domestic abuse and there is the mental health aspect.

Theymay find the experience traumatic and repeat hearings impinges on education. However, it can result in the views of the child - which are central to the entire process - being missed.ldquoWhat we have done in the move to a digital  is cram  years of change into one year.ldquoWhat we are seeing indicatively, through some initial research is that some children are actually feeling the benefit of contributing to a hearing from their home or somewhere  and not being in the hearing room.ldquoSo those children who might not have spoken out, or might not have attended their hearing have opportunities and we now have a proven concept for doing this.ldquoYoung people often talk about the stigma of being taken out of school to go to their hearing. There is nothing to preclude the school putting in a private room and for that young person to come in digitally from their school and provide their insight.ldquoOne of the other things we are looking at are video statements. At the moment children fill in a form for recording their views and itrsquos dated.\"How about this, where a young person can log in to a system using their phone and can securely give the  members a five-minute contribution into their lives.ldquoWhat we have got now, is a real sense of opportunity."},{"url":null,"title":"headline","story":"With Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh running as a candidate for Alex Salmondrsquos new Alba Party, former colleagues in the SNP have been reminiscing about her unique contribution to the indy cause. ldquoTasmina used to walk round SNP conference with a Yes clipboard full of blank paper so that she looked important and in charge of stuff, one told Unspun. ldquoShe was a real joy to have on the Yes Scotland advisory board.Blarney StoneGreen co-leader Patrick Harvie grabbed headlines with his republican-flavoured Ciao! to Prince Philip at Holyrood on Monday, but there were other, er, memorable speakers that day.

It was this thought, along with the desire to do something to help, that led to the creation of Art in Mind.\"Thankfully, today, many public figures are talking about their own mental health challenges, which undoubtedly encourages more open discussion in the general population. This, in turn, helps to reduce stigma, thereby making it easier for people to seek help when they need it.\"The current pandemic, however, has caused a dramatic increase in mental health problems, and funding for the mental health charities which provide support to sufferers is needed more urgently now than ever.\"Self-taught artist Ross Muir, whose Van Gogh in Adidas track suit, Square Gogh, hit the headlines, has designed a vase. He has previously spoken about his struggle with addiction.Ms Carey, who began her art education in the s at Glasgow School of Art, added: ldquoThe response from Scotlands artists has been amazing and we could have invited many more. So far all of the vases are intact for transporting to the exhibition and it has been some operation to gather them in from all over the country. There are many more people I would have loved to have asked so I am hoping we can make this a biennial event.\"Cindy Cosgrove, Community Fundraiser at SAMH, said: ldquoWe are delighted that Art in Mind is supporting SAMH and Scotlandrsquos mental health. It has never been more important that we do everything we can to ensure people experiencing mental health problems receive the help they need, and have their voices heard. In the dficult times that we are all living through, the Art in Mind project is sure to act as a comfort and inspiration to many ndash while the funds raised will help ensure SAMH can continue to be there for anyone who needs us. A heartfelt thank you to the artists and all those involved in Art in Mind.John Mackechnie, director of Glasgow Print Studio, said they too were incredibly supportive of the chosen charity, adding: \"Mental Health is such an important cause, perhaps now more so than ever and we were more than happy to show our support by offering the GPS gallery as a venue. We are really impressed by the quality of work and range of artists including many of whom we have had the pleasure of working with over the years at Glasgow Print Studio. This is a wonderful opportunity to see the works in the flesh before they are snapped up by lucky buyers.\"The vases will never again be seen together as a group and I for one cannot wait to see them in our beautul gallery alongside the works of John Byrne.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12505690.jpg?type=article-full","title":"analysis-indias-double-variant-vaccine-supply-bump-slow-lockdown-exit","story":"On Thursday we reached the milestone when everyone over  - plus unpaid carers, key workers, and younger people with health conditions - should have at least been offered a first Covid vaccine dose.Uptake has been unexpectedly high: as a whole, an astonishing . per cent of Scots aged  or over have had at least one inoculation, with the  to -year-olds who are still coming forward for appointments not far behind on .% to date.: Spike in Covid hospital admissions among under-s - Just because youre younger doesnt mean youre not vulnerableSo far, so good, particularly as priority groups one to nine have accounted for % of Covid deaths during the pandemic.But we know that no vaccine can offer complete protection and there are still . million people in Scotland - nearly half the total population - who have had no jag.The majority of under s have yet to be vaccinated and modelling has indicated that second doses for older adults will have to be prioritised until JuneWith growing evidence that the vaccines are curbing infections and transmission we need as many people as possible to be immunised to stop the virus spreading and reaching those iniduals who either cannot be vaccinated, or whose immune system has responded weakly to it.As we move to inoculating the under-s there is plenty to feel positive about , but we should also be alert to some possible clouds on the horizon.Firstly, there have been anecdotal reports from vaccinators of increasing no-shows or people cancelling appointments.As the Scottish Government does not publish data on attendance it is impossible to gauge how much of an issue this really is,any.: Four cases of double mutant Indian Covid strain found in ScotlandYounger age groups tend to be more vaccine hesitant, partly because their inidual risk is low and they are more likely to engage with antivax conspiracy theories online.Reluctance may have increased amid publicity surrounding AstraZeneca blood clots, but also -ironically - by the success of the vaccination programme itself.Cases and deaths are a fraction of what they were back in January, which can send a misleading signal that the crisis is \"over\".Complacency is a danger.As the Herald highlighted, weekly hospital admissions for Covid have nearly doubled recently among under-s, with more under-s than over-s hospitalised at the beginning of April.Beer garden are expected to open from Monday April Over the next seven weeks, up to early June, we should see ious restrictions ease: travel limits between areas have already been scrapped, and in just over a week gyms, shops, beauty salons, spas, beer gardens and restaurants should reopen - albeit without alcoholyou are dining indoors.From mid-May, pubs can serve customers again indoors, cinemas and music venues can resume, and small groups of up to four people can meet in one anothers homes - rising to group of six by early June.These relaxations are desperately needed - economically and mentally - but they raise unavoidable risks which may be exacerbated by a vaccine squeeze.: Covid vaccines are safe - but damages need to be fair for the few harmedThis is the second potential cloud: supplies.On April , modelling produced forUK Sage forecast that a shortfall of the AstraZeneca supplies, compared to what was expected to be delivered, was going to leave little surplus for first doses until millions of those in the priority groups were given their second booster shots.Professor Christina Pagel, a healthcare mathematician and member of the independent Sage expert group, noted that this meant that under-s \"wont be getting their first doses in any big numbers until June and July\", leaving a higher proportion of them than anticipated exposed as indoor mixing and recreation resumes.Although the vaccine supply modelling was specic to England, supplies are acquired by the UK Government and distributed to the devolved nations according to population - meaning that they will experience equivalent shortfallsIt would be safer, she said, to maintain restrictions at April or May levels for longer while delaying the full reopening of the economy planned for England on June until August instead, when all adults will have had at least one dose.Doing so would \"prevent much of the summer surge\" of -, Covid deaths predicted by Sage, added Prof Pagel.A third cloud could be iants.While numbers remain extremely low in Scotland , England is seeing an increase.\" alt\"HeraldScotland: The South African iant responds less well to vaccines \" class\"editor-image\"The South African iant responds less well to vaccines Cases of the South Africaniant have gone from  in early February to  now, despite efforts to contain it through sequencing and self-isolation.Clinical trials suggest the AstraZeneca vaccine is only about % effective at preventing mild to moderate infections from the South African iant, which has also shown evidence of being able to escape the Pfizer vaccine.On the upside, scientists believe it can spread less easily than the UKs own Kent iant and that vaccines should still guard against more severe disease.Another iant to watch, however, is Indias new \"double mutant\" strain- so-called because it has two potentially worrying changes in the spike protein which have not been found together in any other type - which is now responsible for  cases in England and four in Scotland.This is all the more concerning because the UK has a large South Asian population with ties to the subcontinent, and India is not on the red list for travel.India has gone from fewer than , confirmed cases per day earlier this year, when the virus was wrongly thought to have \"disappeared\", to over , a day now - the highest in the world.Hospitals are so full that some patients are sharing beds.To date, .% of people in India have had at least one Covid vaccine dose compared to .% of people in the UKNearly two thirds of cases analysed in India between January and March were caused by this new iant, which is feared to be both more infectious and able to evade antibodies.How well vaccines can protect against it is unknownbut the fact that there are nearly  cases here already should be a red flag that international travel and unsupervised home-quarantine will be our weakest link as the economy reopens."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-chance-charles-rennie-mackintosh-chairs-fetch-30-000-auction","story":"Two pairs of stained oak dining chairs, specially designed by Mackintosh for his friend William Douglas, are to be auctioned live online.

The most striking feature is the patch of white at their rump. Males are slightly smaller and pale grey with black wingtips. Both have a round, owl-like face.Hen harriers are the UK#s most persecuted bird of prey relative to its population size. Their Scottish population is of global importance, yet it remains far from stable largely as a result of illegal killing by humans.The RSPB’s Jenni Burrell said: “We are calling on the public to email our Hen Harrier Hotlinethey believe they’ve seen a hen harrier. This helps us build a picture of where these birds are. Please don’t hesitate to contact usyou see them # we welcome any sightings and appreciate your time.“Hen harriers are beautul and elusive raptors and, unlike peregrines and kestrels, they are rarely seen in urban environments. Soit’s perched on your fence, it’s probably a sparrowhawk,it’s in a tree by the roadside, it’s probably a kestrel or a buzzard… butit’s over rough pasture or moorland, and matches the description above, then you might have seen a hen harrier.“Sadly hen harriers are a long way from reaching a healthy, self-sustaining population, and this is largely down to persecution by humans. Particularly where land is managed for the purpose of driven grouse shooting, natural predators like hen harriers can be viewed as pests and, despite being legally protected, the shooting, trapping and poisoning of hen harriers is a serious and ongoing problem.”If you think you’ve seen a hen harrier, you are asked to email henharriers@rspb.org.uk and to include the date, time, location grid reference and a description of the bird.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He locked the door and deprived her of access to a key.Donald pinned her against a wall and grabbed her throat. On a number of occasions he repeatedly punched her head and body, all to her injury.Exerting control over her, he destroyed her mobile phone and her passport, repeatedly calling her abusive and degrading names, threatening her with violence. He forced entry into a locked bathroom where she was hiding, and repeatedly monitored and controlled her communications with family and friends.In  Donald became abusive to another partner.As well as regulating the communication she had with others, he also controlled the amount of money she had access to.He was abusive to her, calling her degrading names, and ly accused her of infidelity.Then, in September of that year, he repeatedly struck her body with a kne, causing injury. On rd September he repeatedly thrust a kne at her. She sustained injury after grabbing the blade in an attempt to protect herself.Last year he embarked on a similar course of conduct with a third woman.On th May, he shouted and swore at her and threatened her with violence.

If we want to slow rising global temperatures we need to stop burning these fuels their combustion, and subsequent release of greenhouse gases, is the main driver behind global warming.In , the Scottish Government pledged to end the use of all fossil fuels by  in order to reach their zero net emissions target.

Naturally occurring hydrogen is obtained by passing electricity through waterthis electricity is renewably sourced the gas is labelled as ‘green’ hydrogen, as opposed to ‘grey’. Once extracted it can be used in existing gas pipelines to heat and power homes, fuel vehicles and drive heavy machinery.And unlike traditional gas, when burned it produces no harmful emissions, only water.Keith Masson, climate change and energy team manager at Highland Council, said: “We’re in the process of recruiting a project manager to lead on the delivery of new hydrogen and low carbon heat strategies, to ensure that the council and the wider Highland region benefits from the energy-systems transformation that these technologies will bring.”In Highland region, plans are underway for a ‘hydrogen hub’ in the Cromarty Firth. Electricity generated from wind turbines in the area will be used to produce hydrogen gas for use in local industries.But progress towards the net zero emissions target is also happening even closer to home. In the last few months plans have been confirmed for two community hydro developments in Skye and Lochalsh.Construction of a community owned kW micro hydro development in Sleat is due to begin this month. Electricity produced will be sold to the national grid with over £, expected to be generated in the first  years. All money generated will be used to fund sustainable projects in the local community.Kenny Nicolson, project officer for Sleat Community Hydro, said: “Despite the Gàidhealtachd being a huge exporter of renewable energy, we pay the highest prices for electricity with some of the worst rates of fuel poverty in the UK. On Skye we have issues with inequality, young people unable to find secure employment and housing, and a dying language and culture.“Community-owned renewable energy projects are not just a means for reducing carbon emissions, there is a massive potential to create community wealth and address some of these underlying issues.”We as iniduals can also take steps towards installing renewable energy sources. The process may seem complicated or costly but thanks to an initiative launched by the Scottish Government, homeowners can apply for  per cent cashback, up to £,, for a renewable heating system. Small and medium sized businesses are also eligible for a similar cashback grant scheme. And the options for renewable heating systems are vast, from biomassboilers to solar  and ground source heat pumps.Iain Stewart and Shelagh Parlane have a ground source heat pump which sits just below the surface in their garden in Edinbane, extracting warmth from the ground to heat their radiators, underfloor heating and water. Shelagh said: “I would absolutely recommend it. It is certainly a very efficient system. If you were trying to heat water in a standard way I think it would be much more expensive.”Renewable heating systems can also be a source of income with the UK government’s Renewable Heat Initiative scheme. If you install, or have installed in the last year, an eligible system you could receive quarterly cash payments over seven years.Of course, no energy source is completely harmless. Whether it is birds flying into wind turbines or the destruction of fish spawning grounds with a hydro scheme, everything has a cost. Butwe want to continue using electricity, fossil fuels are not the way forward.No birds or fish will be able to survive at allwe continue to exacerbate the greenhouse gas effect by burning coal, oil and gas.Green alternatives are no longer trials for the future of energy production, they are the future."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MV-Glenachulish2.jpg","title":"glenelg ferry back in service in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine• Bittersweetafter death of founding directorFerry company directors took the decision not to operate the service for the  season in the interests of public and crew safety during the Covid pandemic.The vessel, MV Glenachulish, which normally runs from Easter to mid-October, has been tied up at the Kishorn boat yard since the autumn of .This week, general manager Jo Crawford from Glenelg said the boat was undergoing final checks and it was hoped to resume the service on Saturday st May.“It was a big miss last year, for locals and visitors alike,” said Ms Crawford.“We have put in additional measures to comply with Covid regulations including sanitising stations at both slipways and all the crew have been issued with PPE.“We have secured some grant assistance for opening up again and the ferry’s  employees will be taken out of furlough. We will have a few days of crew training and then the ferry will be back in service after a gap of a year and a half. It will be a boost for everyone.“For people in Glenelg the ferry makes a big dference. If you want to go to the supermarket in Kyle it’s a -mile round trip, compared to  miles to Broadford when the ferry’s running. It changes the experience of living in this corner of the west Highlands, particularly when there’s snow on the hill.”But Ms Crawford said there would be a poignancy when the ferry sailed again this season.Former Glenelg innkeeper Chris Main, who was a founding director of the Isle of Skye Ferry Community Interest Company, passed away in January.Ms Crawford said: “We all felt Chris’s death really keenly here. He was the ferry’s most fervent supporter and would be down most days to get the craic with the crew.”Mr Main’s children, Poppy and Joss, launched a crowdfunder on online fundraising  JustGiving in their father’s memory to raise £, to help maintain MV Glenachulish. To date almost £, has been raised for the Glenachulish Preservation Trust with donations pouring in from all over.Ms Crawford added: “We’re really grateful to them for that support. It’s wonderful. The Glenachulish is the last manually operated turntable ferry in Scotland and at  years old is always needing work done on it.”The ferry will run seven days a week, am to pm, and to pm in June, July and August."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/thumbnail_IMG_0001.jpg","title":"scottish radios voice of sport with his roots in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAlastair Alexander of BBC Scotland was one of the names and iconic voices which dominated the Scottish airwaves for a signicant generation. What is not as well-known about Alastair though, is that he had strong family connections with Skye, which he never forgot.Alastair MacPherson Alexander, to give him his full name, was born on th November , in Parklea, Port Glasgow. He died on Sunday th March, aged .Alastair was intensely proud of his home area of the Port and wider Inverclyde but was also acutely aware of his roots in Skye. He is one of a long list of people in that area who could trace his lineage to the island and the remarkable tale of serendipity and genealogy which eventually saw him commentate on Skye Camanachd’s greatest day in  bears further examination.Alastair’s maternal grandmother Jessie MacPherson was born in Skye in . His mother, Marion Smith, was born in Skye and lived at Tarskavaig in Sleat where her father was a shepherd. Following a well-trodden path, they moved to Kilmacolm in Renfrewshire for work.And it was farming and work on the land which brought Alastair’s parents together. Walter Alexander’s family had Bogston Farm in Greenock and eventually Marion and Walter met and married. Walter was to live with sight and hearing loss and they were, understandably, huge influences –clearly demonstrated in Alastair’s subsequent voluntary work with the Rex Blind Parties, while he developed a remarkable affection for shinty through his connection with Skye.Incidentally, Marion’s father moved to Renton, won the football pools, bought the show house in Dumbuck Crescent, Dumbarton and called it Tarskavaig. It was there that Alastair’s grandmother Jessie died in  when he was seven years old. Her sister Annie MacPherson , whom Alastair Alexander visited in Skye, was known locally as ‘Annag Alasdair’ denoting her father’s identity, and was single all her le. She lived at No. Tarskavaig, and is well remembered by people in the area today.Alastair met his family circumstances head on with a resilience and fortitude, marking him out as a thoroughly decent human inidual, as well as a consummate professional in more than one area of le.He went to the Glasgow School of Art to train as an architect and pursued a career in the building industry, while maintaining his other interests – moving seamlessly in all his dferent spheres of activity.Forty years of Alastair’s le were spent commentating on more than , football matches and describing bowls, hockey at the Kelvin Hall, and athletics for BBC Scotland, as well as the shinty. He first started commentating for people with vision loss at Love Street, Paisley in .Six years later he asked the BBC for an audition and was on television the following week.It was a great privilege to share commentary duties with the great man in my own early days as a commentator, beginning in  in Oban on a blisteringly hot day. I learned a great deal from him over the next few years and he was fantastic to work with.Technology, or more accurately a digger, failed us together one famous day in  when Fort William scored a goal in less than ten seconds and went on to win the Camanachd Cup -. Few in Fort William were aware of the outcome until much later in the day —there were no mobile phones — as a digger had uprooted the cable which connected Old Anniesland to the BBC studios at Queen Margaret Drive. Alastair and I blethered away for the whole match not knowing that only a few minutes had been broadcast and Tiger Tim had filled the rest of the afternoon with records.One of Alastair’s cousins, Ann McCarron, recalled: “My brother and Alastair spent a lot of their youth together on the Skye holidays and at Gran and Grandpa Smith’s in Dumbuck Crescent. Apparently my brother Alistair had a Subbuteo football game and when they played he [Alastair] used to do the commentating, so he must have had the commentating in his blood!”Such was the family’s affection for Skye that Ann’s brother Alistair’s ashes were scattered on Skye following his death a few years ago.Tributes have been fulsome and sincere. The plaudits and anecdotes could fill Hampden. Alastair was a “gentleman and a true professional” according to Ken MacQuarrie who made the formal presentation to him on behalf of the BBC in .It was singularly appropriate that he commentated on Skye’s greatest triumph in . In that famous final Alastair described Skye’s Calum Murchison on the radio as “leaping around like a salmon”. That of course meant an awful lot more to anyone knowing the shape and size of Calum and also his family’srelationship with the local salmon fishing river in Bernisdale.Alastair was a great man and is a huge loss to our collective knowledge of our history, sport and broadcasting. Meticulous in his presentation and fastidious when it came to detail, he was a total professional. The BBC bid him farewell with the traditional microphone presentation in October  when he retired.We shall not see his like again and we know that Alastair will of course be most sorely missed by his daughters Shirley, Susan and Joyce, her husband Mark, granddaughter Alex and grandson Callum."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/POT-HOLES-KYLE-1-scaled.jpg","title":"kyle womans petition targets","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIona MacLachlan says people are being forced to drive in the opposite carriageway in Kyle’s Main Street to avoid huge potholes and believes a bad accident is waiting to happen.Ms MacLachlan, of Heathmount, is asking people to sign her petition on the change.org online petitions , urging Highland Council to improve the roads in the busy village.The health and social care frontline worker said: “I’ve raised this petition because of an experience I had at the weekend as an L-driver.“I was driving down to the village and I was confronted with this car in the middle of the road. I nearly hit it. I understand why the car was there – the driver was trying to avoid the massive potholes all along the street. I was able to avoid the vehicle but it gave me a scare and this situation could easily result in a bad accident.”Ms MacLachlan has reported the potholes in the road to Highland Council on multiple occasions.She said: “All you get is for the potholes to be filled with gravel and with the bad weather we’ve had over the past few months that lasts only two or three days and then they’re as bad as ever. The road needs to be properly repaired.“I’ve had to replace coil springs and tyres on my car because of the state of the roads in Kyle and I’m fed up with it. I hope as many people as possible will sign the petition to send a strong message to the council.”Ms MacLachlan’s petition is on the change.org site and calls for “All B roads in Kyle of Lochalsh to be repaired”.Local Highland councillor Biz Campbell said she was aware of the petition and agreed the road was in a poor state.“I don’t blame people,” said Councillor Campbell. “The roads are horrendous. We fight for funds for roads all the time and make the case when the budget comes up, but council doesn’t have the money.”However, she said councillors in Ward  — Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh — had been allocated an extra £, for local projects and members had discussed buying a “hot box” tar machine.She explained: “Currently the potholes in this ward are filled with cold tar and it’s a complete waste of money because the tar is simply washed out and the repair doesn’t last.“This machine would allow hot tar repairs to be made to potholes and it would last longer. We have discussed it at a meeting and I think this could achieve better road repairs which would help road users at least in the short term.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3746987.jpg--.jpg?1618485362000\n","title":"martinstown post office temporary closure for modernisation work","story":"Martinstown Post Office will temporarily close for modernisation.

Worth poundm, the low emission diesel buses will be destined for the streets of Hong Kong and Japan. It marks a signicant move for the Ballymena-based business, owned by green entrepreneur Jo Bamford, which sees the orders as an opportunity to grow the profile of the Wrightbus brand as far afield as Australia. Chief Executive Buta Atwal said the news was proof that Wrightbus was leading the way in bus technology regardless of the fuel. “Whether it’s our world-first hydrogen bus, our near-zero emission diesel or our single-deck electric, the Wrightbus name stands for excellence in the bus world,” he explained. “Although we have endured a complicated year like so many manufacturers across the world, these orders will help us emerge from the pandemic with confidence.” Wrightbus, which launched the world’s first zero-emission hydrogen double decker bus in , recently announced the creation of  new jobs in preparation for increasing production of the vehicle this year to assist global net zero ambitions and support the PM’s pledge for at least , new Zero Emission Buses to be produced during this parliament.The recruitment drive will welcome new members of production and office staff, including coachbuilders, spray painters, welders, electrical engineers, technicians, accountants, sales staff and a project manager. Nineteen of the positions will be apprenticeships, giving a boost to opportunities for young people in the region. And an international project engineer role has also been created as the firm looks to increase sales around the world.Nathan Hodge, who heads the Wrightbus international ision, said there was growing global optimism. “While it hasn’t got to the tender stage yet, we are having some really good discussions in Australia about hydrogen buses,” he said. “While Australia is seen by many to be among the leaders of hydrogen technology, there is only one hydrogen bus in the country so there’s a huge amount of potential. “Countries like Malaysia, which exports oil, will always find the cost of hydrogen or electric buses prohibitive, yet that’s where our near-zero diesel comes in.” Mr Hodge explained that the ASEAN free-trade agreement signed last year would ensure tarf-free movement of goods from the Wrightbus factory in Malaysia. “Naturally having a factory in the Far East enables us to be part of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnershipwhich provides tarf-free trade to the Southeast Asian Nations as well as Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1618581284924.jpg--covid_19___fri_16th_apr_figures.jpg?1618581284000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20210416newscovid 19 fri 16th apr figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows One further coronavirus related death and  new positive test results.

Thankfully, retail, close contact services, hospitality, leisure and tourism businesses now have clear reopening dates that are signicantly better than those mooted in the media yesterday morning. They can now plan and prepare for trading again in just a few weeks# time.We welcome the Executive#s decision and the fact that Ministers have listened to and responded positively to the concerns expressed by businesses and the genuine fears they had about their futures and the jobs of their staff. We now look forward to working with departments and the council to deliver a safe reopening of our city#s economy.Simon Hamilton is chief executive of Belfast ChamberNo, says Conor BrowneI do not have a problem with outdoor activities being increased in Northern Ireland. There is no issue with outdoor table service in bars or restaurants, as long as social distancing is maintained.However, the Executive announced an indicative date for eating and drinking indoors on May .We have known for a long time in the biosecurity community that the single most dangerous place and activity that you can engage in, is groups of people inside and not wearing masks. That indicative date is a little bit too close. Whenever you release restrictions from a lockdown, you should do it in a slow manner.If you make a big change like opening close contact services and outdoor hospitality, what you want to do is wait and see what that does to the number of people who get infected with the virus and also to the number of hospital admissions.I want the economy back but my concern is thatwe move too quickly on everything, then we run the risk of infection rates spiking again and we end up going back into another lockdown of some description.I do not want to go back into another lockdown and neither does the business community but, for me, the big issue is hospitality indoors. I would like to see a little bit more time passing before we start thinking about getting people indoors.We are doing exceptionally well with our vaccination programme but the problem is there are some iants of the virus - in particular the South African iant.The vast majority of people going out will be young people, who will be unvaccinated, and could potentially lead to a spread of the South African iant in Northern Ireland.Conor Browne is a biosecurity consultant specialising in Covid- business continuity, forecasting, and analysisBelfast Most ReadNoah Donohoe inquest: PSNI may not have probed Dr Jordan Peterson line of inquiry to its #satisfaction#, coroner toldWatch: Video tour of £.m Dromore property that’s sparked online frenzyBad blood still lingers after republican gun murders as IRA vows revengeMichelle O#Neill#s Facebook page no longer run from SerbiaPeaky Blinders star Helen McCrory has died aged Top VideosPlayCanadian MP caught naked on camera reprimanded in ParliamentPlayPrince Philip’s personalised Land Rover hearse is unveiledPlay#Landmark day# for Northern Ireland as coronavirus restrictions easedLatest CoronavirusMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageNorthern Ireland businesses will welcome southern customersrules are followedNI councils in the dark over extension of law on virtual meetings Quarantine #packages# for those arriving into Northern Ireland from #red list# countries now liveLisa SmythOpinionOfficial line on #vaccine passports# remains vague... but they will help get lives back on trackLatest from Belfast #We#ve got our mojo back#: Larne coach Tim McCann hails side after five-goal win at WarrenpointSt George’s Chapel: The setting for a Covid-secure royal funeral like no otherThe Crown’s Tobias Menzies on Philip’s ‘great ingenuity and great energy’Smoke bomb interrupts minute’s silence at Luton’s match against WatfordNation falls silent in memory of Duke of Edinburgh,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is understood officials are scrambling to get clarity on whether there is time, orit is possible, to extend it and what will happenthe date passes with no resolution.Under the Executive#s plans for exiting lockdown, by this date there will still be signicant restrictions on indoor gatherings.Stormont#s Department for Communitiesis responsible for supporting local councils.Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong, deputy chair of the Communities Committee, said her party supports extending the legislation, but the situation is unclear. Belfast Beat Newsletter Receive the big stories from across Belfast directly to your inbox  Enter email address   This field is required  Sign Up      The department recently stated at the Communities Committee that it may be able to progress through a UK legislative vehicle but this remains uncertain, she said.It could be done via an amendment to the Local Government Amendment Bill, which would go through via accelerated passage, which I would encourage the department to look at.Most councils are without meeting rooms which can accommodate socially distanced councillors, staff and others. We must ensure we do all we can to ensure they follow the Executive#s guidance, which remains work from homepossible.DfC said the action needed to extend this legislation is currently being progressed.Belfast City Council-Northern Ireland#s largest council - said: The option to extend the legislation is currently being considered by the Department for Communities. Council is considering options for other arrangements during the interim period should the updated legislation be delayed.The situation also applies to councils in England. Westminster junior local government minister Luke Hall, however, wrote to councils# local authorities there last month making it clear that the ministry will not seek to extend the powers.Donal Lyons, SDLP group leader on BCC, told the Belfast : While we#re in a much better position now than in comparison to recent months but that#s no reason for pretending like the last year didn#t happen and rushing back to business as usual. We need to follow the public health advice, keep social distancing and find the right balance as we come out of lockdown. Remote meetings are certainly going to be part of that balance.The Executive have been taking a dferent approach from London for a while now so it#s reasonable to have expected the Department for Communities to have made preparations for this. There#s certainly no rationale that I can see for the fact that a few weeks out we have no timeframe or even assurances. Somebody#s dropped the ball on this.He added that issues that will need to be addressed as people start moving about more and the weather improves can already be anticipated.Overcrowding in parks, retail and trading hours, antisocial behaviour like in the Holyland, these are all issues we#re going to see re-emerge and we need to be able to respond quickly as a council.We can#t address these effectivelythere#s basic questions outstanding about how decisions are to be taken.Belfast Most ReadNoah Donohoe inquest: PSNI may not have probed Dr Jordan Peterson line of inquiry to its #satisfaction#, coroner toldWatch: Video tour of £.m Dromore property that’s sparked online frenzyMichelle O#Neill#s Facebook page no longer run from SerbiaBad blood still lingers after republican gun murders as IRA vows revengePeaky Blinders star Helen McCrory has died aged Top VideosPlayCanadian MP caught naked on camera reprimanded in ParliamentPlayPrince Philip’s personalised Land Rover hearse is unveiledPlay#Landmark day# for Northern Ireland as coronavirus restrictions easedLatest Northern IrelandMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageDUP#s Alderman Bill Keery apologises for #ill-judged# Prince Philip comment during Duke of Edinburgh tribute meetingHotel quarantine QA: Everything you need to knowDerry City legend Owen Da Gama honoured in new song by Strength NIAHornets# nest stirred up by Kevin McGuigan and Gerard Davison shootings leaves many stings behindLatest from Belfast #We#ve got our mojo back#: Larne coach Tim McCann hails side after five-goal win at WarrenpointSt George’s Chapel: The setting for a Covid-secure royal funeral like no otherThe Crown’s Tobias Menzies on Philip’s ‘great ingenuity and great energy’Smoke bomb interrupts minute’s silence at Luton’s match against WatfordNation falls silent in memory of Duke of Edinburgh,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The party ignored Press queries yesterday after the Tanaiste Leo Varadkar called on party president Mary Lou McDonald to answer questions about its secret database.The Republic#s Data Protection Commissioner sent the party a list of questions after the Irish Independent reported that Abu, a password-protected website, gave party members access to a database which included the names, addresses and predicted voting intentions of millions of voters.The website directing members to the database was shut down as a precautionary security measure after the party received questions from the commissioner.Dublin#s Minister of State for Local Government Peter Burke said that it is not acceptable that the party has not addressed legitimate concerns about who created the database.Sinn Fein has claimed it is fully compliant with GDPR requirements, so why was the system shut down after the Data Protection Commissioner wrote to the party this week seeking information it is holding on millions of Irish voters  he asked.Speaking on RTE#s Today with Claire Byrne, the deputy leader of Sinn Fein Pearse Doherty said that it is nonsense to suggest the party is scanning Facebook to determine how users may vote. The idea that Sinn Fein is scanning Facebook for people#s comments, that#s not what this is, as I said, and that#s absolutely nonsense, there is no data harvesting in relation to that going on, said Mr Doherty.Abu also showed how Sinn Fein believed people previously voted in elections.Internal Sinn Fein documents also reveal party members are told to elicit information from Facebook users which can be cross-referenced with the Abú system to identy where they live.Mr Doherty said that Abu is the party#s Electoral Register. When somebody tells you that they#re going to vote for the party then it can be recorded in relation to that.He said that the database helps Sinn Fein organise lts for voters to the voting station,they need them.Some person may say that they#ll need a lt to the polling station, and therefore you organise a lt for that person and that#s what happens in Sinn Fein. It happens in other areas as I said in other parties, he said.However, Minister Burke asked why the website was shut down.If Pearse and his colleagues are so confident that there has been no wrongdoing, why was the database shut down this week He called on Ms McDonald to end her silence.Belfast Most ReadNoah Donohoe inquest: PSNI may not have probed Dr Jordan Peterson line of inquiry to its #satisfaction#, coroner toldWatch: Video tour of £.m Dromore property that’s sparked online frenzyBad blood still lingers after republican gun murders as IRA vows revengeMichelle O#Neill#s Facebook page no longer run from SerbiaPeaky Blinders star Helen McCrory has died aged Top VideosPlayCanadian MP caught naked on camera reprimanded in ParliamentPlayPrince Philip’s personalised Land Rover hearse is unveiledPlay#Landmark day# for Northern Ireland as coronavirus restrictions easedLatest Republic of IrelandGovernment: No change to vaccination rollout plan‘Alarming’ KBC decision intensies need for banking forum to be establishedEU chiefs call on Irish Government to use ‘less restrictive’ quarantine measuresNolan sisters open up about double cancer battle Latest from Belfast Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Two deaths and  new cases of Covid- Government: No change to vaccination rollout planHundreds in Windsor join minute’s silence#We#ve got our mojo back#: Larne coach Tim McCann hails side after five-goal win at WarrenpointSt George’s Chapel: The setting for a Covid-secure royal funeral like no other,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Communications between Foyle MLA Sinead McLaughlin and the Health and Finance Ministers demonstrates that even those heading government departments have been confused about what Covid restrictions were in force and when. Localised restrictions were put in place in Derry and Strabane on October  following a surge in positive Covid cases. As part of those restrictions no indoor gatherings were permitted between people from dferent households. That specic restriction prevented barbers and hairdressers from working. In an Assembly response Health Minister Robin Swann acknowledged that fact saying close contact services were not permitted to open from October  because of the restriction on indoor gatherings. googletag.cmd.push But, he states, official regulations were only in effect between October  to November , November  to December  and those from December  are ongoing. The Localised Restrictions Support Schemeopened to businesses in Derry and Strabane council area on October , . However, SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin has questioned why some of her constituents have been left unable to access support for the period between October -. She also asked Finance Minister Conor Murphy why his department is ‘recovering’ money from Derry workers who had received support. Sinead McLaughlin said: It has been dficult for businesses in Derry to understand the restrictions which govern when they were allowed to trade, and when they werent. googletag.cmd.push “What we have now learnt as a result of my questions in the Assembly to the ministers is that it has also been dficult for the departments that issue the regulations to understand them. The result is that close contact businesses such as hairdressers and barbers in Derry and Strabane which believed they were unable to trade between the th and the th October now find they are not entitled to financial support for that period from the Localised Restrictions Support Scheme, operated by minister Conor Murphy and his Department of Finance. “Some of these businesses were initially given this financial support and are now having it recovered through reductions in ongoing support payments.”     She added: The minister for health initially told me that close contact businesses in Derry and Strabane were not able to trade between th and th October because of the lockdown restrictions, but that the regulations had not been in place that confirmed this. “Now a revised Assembly answer from the minister says they were able to trade between those dates. To explain six months later that close contact businesses in Derry and Strabane could, after all, have traded in early October is absolutely no good at all. “I am appalled that businesses here are now suffering additional hardship because of the lack of clarity and co-operation between the health and finance departments in the setting of Covid regulations. “It is up to Conor Murphy to resolve this and I am very unhappy that, to date, he has failed to do this. The Finance Minister stands over his department’s decision saying that Covid regulations imposed by the Department of Health on October  did not require hairdressers and other close contact services to close during the period to October . He added: “As the Localised Restrictions Support Scheme was introduced to provide financial assistance for businesses directly restricted by the Health Protection Regulations, I am unable to extend support to any close contact service for that period. “The criteria for the Localised Restrictions Support Schemeis directly linked to the Health Protection Regulations and there is no need to review the criteria.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Amongst easements announced this week, there were changes to the number of people allowed to play sport outdoors. From Monday, groups of up to  people, were permitted to train and play sports together. Speaking to the Derry News, Patrick Simpson of Bay Road Soccer said the past year has been ‘tough’ mentally as well as financially. Like many businesses, uncertainty hung over every decision as lockdowns were put in place and then lted again. The ‘next generation’ outdoor soccer centre on the Bay Road reopened over the summer to the delight of service users but was forced to close a few months later. googletag.cmd.push Mr Simpson hopes lockdowns have now been resigned to the past and that people can get back to some form of normality. People of all ages use the facility for recreation. Coaches make use of the all-weather G pitches to train young football teams such as the Oxford Bulls and it hosts soccer camps during the summer. Mr Simpson said: “Every time we’ve opened there has been a great appetite for people to get back outside and to play football again. “A lot of people are saying it’s like Christmas again for them, some people are there three or four days a week. That is their hour of exercise and the hobby they enjoy.” googletag.cmd.push He added: “I hope this is the last lockdown because it really is having a detrimental affect on people’s mind when they can’t get outdoors to take part in activities that really give them a lt. “It’s about children as much as adults. “People are delighted to be back now. There’s a big smile on their faces.” Regular user of the facility, Kevin McGowan , has missed playing badly. It’s rumoured that Bay Road has a special video archive containing the Derry man’s best finishes.  Kevin, who works as a Peer Support Volunteer at ARC Fitness, is an untiring advocate of the physical and mental health benefits of playing football.     He explained: “The Bay Road to me is like meditation. Its a place where you can forget about everything  going on for an hour where its just you, your mates, two nets and a ball. “It is a great way to get rid of stress and after one session Im already reacting to things in a calmer way. “Its great to be back at it and the usual slagging has already started with the football WhatsApp group. “I forgot how much I missed that. Everything just seems easier to handle when you can have that hour away at the glorious Bay.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There are smiles on the faces of the few people who are moving up and down the pavements. Approaching midday, the sun,not quite splitting the stones, is definitely causing them some discomfort. Traffic is almost constant. It comes through at a steady pace, the roar of passing lorries reverberating off Dungivens roadside shops and houses. A green and white ice cream van emblazoned with Super Mario rolls through the town. I can almost hear the theme tune in my head. googletag.cmd.push Dungiven Main Street curving down the hill. As I make my way up the hill, there is construction work going on in a few of the estates off Main Street. One man carefully removes paving stones in front of a set of flats. Further on, McReynolds Bar sits in forlorn darkness, mourning the loss of another sunny day in the beer garden. The towns other Covid-abandoned pubs would no doubt concur. The ornate gates of Gaelcholaacuteiste Dhoire are closed for Easter, but the sun illuminates the castle like a scene from a postcard. Across the street, the Kevin Lynch memorial has been spruced up, with Easter just around the corner. Political posters adorn street corners as parties jostle at the starting line ahead of next years Assembly election. googletag.cmd.push At the top of the town, traffic grinds to a halt, stled by road works that have created a narrow corridor of cones and warning signs. Heading back towards the town, I spot two people on a narrow laneway, seemingly in heated discussion. Both have puffy coats and woolly hats on, despite the strong sun, and there is a lot of finger-pointing. I decide to give them a wide berth. Passing through the town again, I notice the door to Inner Beauty is open. A glance in on the way past reveals a woman sitting cross-legged on the floor, with products strewn around her.     I have to go back. Road works at the top of the town are currently causing disruption. Claire McGill, who runs the skincare specialist salon, tells me she is preparing goodie bags to leave outside the salon for local children in place of their usual Easter celebrations. “Every Easter Saturday, we usually do an Easter egg hunt through the town, but Ive been closed since Christmas Eve,” she explains. “My customers are really running out of products now. Ive been doing deliveries, but to be honest, there is no profit in it, between time, effort and road works. “I did a delivery yesterday that was just to the top of the town and it took me over an hour. I only spoke to her for about two seconds at her front door too. Its a nightmare. “My phone hasnt stopped with people askingIm open today, because Ive had the shutter up doing this.” Claire says the latest period of lockdown has been a hard pull. Forced to seek the help of a local councillor in accessing government grant support, it still took a number of months. “I didnt get any grants because I dont have a rates bill in my name, so he got it all sorted. It took months, I only got my first one there in the middle of February, from October. ” she says. “I know everybody thinks getting pound a week when closed is fantastic, but firstly, its all taxable, so its only pound a week. “I have girls furloughed, so theres nothing left. My landlord is so decent, which is just as well, otherwise wed all be closed by now. “Were very lucky in the town that were in that everybody is very close,” she adds. Karen Groogan is looking forward to welcoming customers back in store. In an example of that close-knit community, Claire sends me across the street to meet Karen Groogan. Karen runs Groogans, a boutique clothes and fashion shop on the towns Main Street, and agrees with Claire that community support has been vital during this time. “In the run-up to Christmas, this year more than any other year, the town really got behind shopping local and it was brilliant,” she says. “Ive found this one has been harder for several dferent reasons. The weather has been a real downer and regarding shopping, I think people have been better prepared this year. “Last time I was able to help them out and ersy, selling things I wouldnt normally sell, whereas this time round, theyve had a houseful of stuff for their kids already.” Finvola keeps a watchful eye on Dungivens Main Street. As well as the dficulties associated with Covid, Karen is in two minds about the effect the new bypass will have on trade in the town. “I really dont know how its going to affect us. A lot of locals think its going to be a great thing for the town and encourage people to shop local,” she tells me. “I hope thats the way, but is there enough for them to shop local  We could really do with a good bakery, a good fruit and veg shop, but all those shops have closed because of the high rates. “Now were going to make the road to Derry even shorter. There is a feeling that when the town quietens down it will make people shop local, and I really hope thats true. “I do really well from passing trade though professional women going between Derry and Belfast for their work. They dont have the time to go shopping at the weekend and nor do they want to. “Whenever they come here, they know theyre going to get what they want. The girls that have come over the past four years know Im here, but its going to be hard to get any more girls like that. “Thats what I really worry about losing the passing trade. I really enjoy the company of them as well, so Im on the fence about whether or not it will be a good thing for the town.” Karens online trade has been good, but it doesnt replace the rapport she builds with her customers. “We do have a website, but I prefer to be open and able to sell things to people,” he says. “My shop is the kind of shop that you come in for one thing and you come out with more. Its a treasure trove. “Its got all sorts of dferent things school wear, home wear, childrens and ladies clothes, whereas it can be a bit limiting online.” The Roe sparkling in the March sun. Moving past the empty shop fronts at the bottom half of the town, your reward is the sight of the sun shimmering on the clear waters of the Roe. A young couple appear along its banks, ing from a ramble in the nearby fields. Throughout lockdown, people have rediscovered the beauty of their immediate surroundings. While the fine weather intensies dreams of normalitys , many will be hoping ambivalence to local nature spots will notwith it. In Dungiven, the community has pulled together, and they will look to harness that spirit of regeneration after Covids bitter chapter is finally drawn to a close.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A quiet Swatragh last Friday afternoon. The Drumbane Road climbs towards the North Sperrins Scenic Route away to my right as I make my way up the hill past an empty St Johns Primary School, closed for the Easter holidays.

A pink Fiat brings a splash of colour to the street as grey clouds swell overhead. Outside McGuigans Garage, Kieran McGuigan says the pandemic has taken on a personal edge for him and his family.     “I had Covid myself, and so did my family, but we have all recovered. Its been a strange time. Once you get that [positive] result back, you just dont know whats in front of you.” he tells me. “Other families havent, and its been a tough time for everybody. Business-wise, were just tipping away and doing what we can. “Covid affects dferent people in dferent ways. I was off my feet, in bed for a week with the fatigue and no energy or appetite. “My we and the kids had it too, and my mother-in-law had to go into hospital with it for ten days, but thankfully shes okay now.” McGuigans garage has adapted to the restrictions as they have been introduced. Kieran pauses to wave a customer around the one-way system introduced with the onset of the pandemic. McGuigans have had to adapt like everyone . “Its all one-way and its appointment only now,” he says. “Its easier managed, you dont want too many people on the premises at the same time. Ive a routine every morning and evening where I wipe everything down. “You have your signs up, you do what you can and you bring as little people inside as possible. Were managing it and doing what we can. “The car sales will be open on Monday morning again. Vans and pick-ups have been very busy, but its going to be great to get opened up to do test drives again and meeting people face-to-face. “People enjoy the process, its part and parcel of the business. When theyre spending that amount of money, its a big step and you cant take them for granted.” Kieran admits not being able to physically meet up with friends has been tough, but says last years lockdown had a galvanising effect on the community. “There are boys I havent seen since the bars shut. Youd be texting boys, but its not the same having the craic in a WhatsApp group,” he says. “Having the banter over a beer or even getting to a football match is missed. Last year, Swatragh had five games and I was at every one of them. “The year before, I was only at a few of them, but it was just the fact you could get out, so you made a point of going to them. “The local GAA club did a lot for the community throughout the  months. They were offering to pick up groceries for people that were isolated and delivered meals. “My mum is  years of age and got it a few times, and that was done by Davitts. Its the heart of the community. Everything revolves around it and it brings everybody together.”  Sineacutead McErlean and Fran OKane from SM Filling Station on the Kilrea Road. After indulging in the glamour of being a reporter on the road and conducting a Zoom interview in the car, I head down Kilrea Road to SM Filling Station. A few minutes of to-and-fro with Sineacutead and a phone call with Sean and Im chatting to Fran OKane, who tells me the ongoing vaccination programme is lting peoples spirits. “I think people are more hopeful now because of the jab, theyre more upbeat as its been rolled out,” she says. “I have had the first one. It was a bit of a relief, but itll be better when I get the second one. Youre meeting so many people in here all the time.” The busy service station found itself with the responsibility of being essential retail, but Fran says the extra regulations quickly became part and parcel of doing business. “Its busier now again than it had been. It was very quiet early on in January but things have really picked up now and were a lot busier,” she says. “You always had that bit of nervousness and were very aware not to stand too near, or to sanitise your hands, especially with handling money and everything. “It was dficult, but as time went on it just became matter-of-fact and you just do it now every time you serve somebody. You adapt and get used to it. “Even outside, youre still inclined to pull back. Id say % of customers are wearing the masks, but you do get that odd one that doesnt wear it.” Daffodils signal Spring is well underway in Swatragh. Fran has noticed an upturn in people out walking, but is already turning her attention to more trivial matters as normality draws nearer. “I would walk the dog anyway, and you used to meet nobody out, but now youre meeting people a lot more,” she says. “Im looking forward to getting back to normal,there ever is such a thing, but Im most looking forward to getting my hair done. “I need a trim and a colour done,” she adds. The stay at home message has now officially been discontinued by the NI Executive, but it has been moot for weeks. Ato group training will come as a welcomed relief to sportspeople throughout the county, and summer feels a lot closer now than it did last week. At the weekend, the Department of Health announced over one million vaccines had been administered, between first and second doses. As Kieran McGuigan shows customers around the garage courtyard this week, Swatragh will be one small step closer to the end of the pandemic. It might feel like one giant leap.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Fran has noticed an upturn in people out walking, but is already turning her attention to more trivial matters as normality draws nearer. “I would walk the dog anyway, and you used to meet nobody out, but now youre meeting people a lot more,” she says. “Im looking forward to getting back to normal,there ever is such a thing, but Im most looking forward to getting my hair done. “I need a trim and a colour done,” she adds.

It might feel like one giant leap.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Planning permission was this week granted for the conversion of the former Officers Mess building at Ebrington, known as Building , into offices. However, SDLP councillor John Boyle questioned whether offices were the best use for the fascinating building which was built in . Planning permission was also granted at a meeting this week of Derry City and Strabane District Councils Planning Committee on Monday for another historic building on the Ebrington site base to be turned into office accommodation. googletag.cmd.push The former guard house building, known at Building , will be remodelled and extended. The works will provide new office accommodation incorporating meeting rooms and other associated facilities. Building  is a Grade  listed building, located along the southern side ofEbringtonSquare. Building  will undergo internal alterations with the addition of a lt shaft and a flat roof extension, transforming the building into a modern office space. Cllr Boyle told the meeting that he supported planning permission being granted for the respective plans for the two Ebrington buildings. However, in relation to Building , he said he believed the building could have been put to better use. googletag.cmd.push “Sometimes I do consider that buildings like this as office space, perhaps that is not the ideal use,” he said. “I actually know this building and some years ago a friend of mine was carrying out some remediation work inside it and I happened to call over and have a look around it. “It is a fascinating building, it really is a first class quality building and I just regret a little more imagination around what this building could have been used for has not been applied in this particular instance. “But office space can be useful and provides for employment opportunities and jobs and progression of local people and the economy here locally but we are where we are.     “I am also conscious of the fact that something can obviously then be reconverted back into something  as well.” Sinn Fein councillor Christopher Jackson, chair of the councils Planning Committee, said he could understand Cllr Boyles comments in relation to a perceived lack of imagination. However, Cllr Jackson said many of the Ebrington buildings had been unoccupied for too long and he said the new office accommodation was a major step for the site. “We are starting to see businesses whatever their nature having the confidence to invest in Ebrington Square and relocating to Ebrington Square and inevitably it will lead to an increased footfall and along with that we hope to see the real ambition for Ebrington Square fulfilled.” In response, Cllr Boyle agreed that many of the Ebrington buildings had been unoccupied for too long and he welcomed the new plans for the Building  and Building . This weeks meeting was told that a local company, GLA Surveyors, had indicated that they plan to move into Building . A planning officer told this weeks meeting that he did not knowthere were prospective tenants for Building . Cllr Jackson said he was delighted to see work continue to progress at the site. This is just the latest step in the complete transformation of the site atEbringtonSquare and the journey towards achieving its potential as a hugely important business and cultural hub for the city. “The site is unique in bringing together both Derrys past and future stories. During the pandemic, people have really been making use of the space with its beautul panoramic views of the city and open walkways and recreational areas. “As the work continues and more businesses choose to locate to the site,Ebringtonwill become the vibrant, attractive and buzzing heart of the Waterside community. “I look forward to seeing this area continue to develop and improve over the coming months,” added the local councillor.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The upgrade of the Buncrana Road was first mooted some  years ago. Hopes that work would commence in the near future rose this week after it emerged that traffic lights are to be erected at the Springtown Road junction of Buncrana Road. However, Dfi has quashed those hopes by stating the new lights were being put in place to facilitate an expectant increase in traffic due to the construction of a new Lidl supermarket due to open in  weeks time. googletag.cmd.push In a statement to the Derry News, a Dfi spokesperson said: “Planning permission was granted for a new Lidl store on the Buncrana Road which includes for the upgrade of the Springtown Road Buncrana Road junction to a signal controlled junction prior to the opening of the new store. “This measure is to assist the mitigation of the impact of traffic generated by the new retail outlet in the interests of road safety and traffic progression and will incorporate a pedestrian phase.” The spokesperson added: “In June , Minster Mallon announced her commitment to fund the continued development of a number of Strategic Road Improvement schemes including the A Buncrana Road, as part of her plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation while addressing regional imbalance. googletag.cmd.push “Consistent with wider priorities, Minister Mallon is committed to ensuring that this scheme is future-proofed to help stimulate green recovery. “The Department is continuing to progress the A Buncrana Road scheme in line with the objectives which include improving transport links, road safety, traffic progression and contributing to the regeneration of the area. The spokesperson concluded: “Officials will continue discussions with all affected landowners and other stakeholders over the coming months and to progress scheme development.” Sinn Fein Foyle MLA Martina Anderson said it was vitally important the upgrade took place as soon as possible. “The full upgrade of this road is crucial to ensure that it is fit for purpose as a main gateway into our Donegal hinterland and feature in any future expansion of the Fort George site.     “And it is also vitally important to make sure that happens as soon as possible for all the residents and businesses along its entirety as it’s estimated that over , vehicles use itdaily.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Offices of Mid Ulster District Council in Cookstown were vandalised in the attack, with the words Fly the Flag spray painted on the wall. The grafitti is thought to be in reference to an earlier decision by the council to reject a motion calling for the Union flag to be flown at half-mast to mark the passing of the Duke of Edinburgh. DUP leader on the council, Paul McLean had called on council Chair Cathal Mallaghan to explain to Mid Ulsters constituents why the flag would not be flown. googletag.cmd.push We requested that the Union Flag be flown at half-mast to mark the passing of the Duke of Edinburgh but the Council Chairman has declined that request, he said. We disagree with the decision and have requisitioned a meeting for the Chairman to explain to those in Mid Ulster who want to show their respect for the Duke of Edinburgh why this position has been taken. The chairman has seven days to grant the meeting.Unionists may only make up  of the  members but we have a right to be heard and to receive an explanation. It is extraordinary that the Sinn Fein Speaker in the Northern Ireland Assembly can have the Union Flag flying at half-mast on Parliament Buildings but here in Michelle O’Neill’s constituency another Sinn Fein councillor has refused to fly the Union Flag at half-mast as a mark of respect.” googletag.cmd.push Council Chair Cathal Mallaghan condemned the grafitti, saying it was completely unacceptable. These are civic offices where we our residents come to register births, deaths, marriages, he said. Its where we provide crucial public services, from building control to economic development and from where we also operate our local bin collection services. “To see the offices defaced in this way is completely unacceptable. This should be a safe, shared space for our residents and for our staff and such vandalism is an attack on local public services, as well as local democracy. “I condemn it and I call on all elected representatives to do likewise”.     SDLP councillor Malachy Quinn said the vandalism was pathetic. MUDC has since the very start held a no flags policy to stop them becoming an issue, he said. All our staff have the right to come to work free from harassment and will continue to make that the case. Sadly we have sad inidulas who are out their trying to whip up sectarian hatred through defacing public buildings, violence on our streets and wrecking their own towns and trying to drag a new generation down with them. They wont succeed. John Hume always said You cant eat a flag and unionism should take heed and tackle the real issues in our society instead of talking flags.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

After  years in Asia,  of which have been in Thailand, John is now nearing  years of age and is finally taking a step back from an adulthood that has revolved wholeheartedly around the growth of gaelic football in Bangkok and beyond. The magnitude of the Asian GAA community cannot be underestimated. The Asian Games are massive in this part of the world, with over  teams involved – men and women, and over  people coming together in friendship and competition. There are  clubs in Asia and the popularity of the sport, amongst Irish exiles and locals is growing year on year. googletag.cmd.push At the heart of this growth was, and is, Derry native John who founded Thailand GAA in . Since then, John has slowly but surely built something lasting, ever since agreeing to a request from the Asian County Board to set up a gaelic football team in Thailand. That set in motion a chain of events that has resulted in a thriving club – Thai GAA – but also a gaelic community that extends far beyond the limitations of the game itself. With three South Asia Championships to their name, Thai GAA is not just there to make up the numbers – it has ambition, not just for growth, but for success, and winning the men’s section of the Asian Gaelic Games remains the ultimate goal. googletag.cmd.push It is a far cry from kicking a ball about with Oxford United back in the late s. “I would never have thought  years ago when I was in Derry that I would end up in Thailand,” John admits. “I had one of those fork in the road moments. I was working for two years in England and was itching to get back home. I wasn’t that satisfied with my career and wanted to do something dferent. It was in July ’ that my boss rang me and asked ‘How do you fancy going to Thailand next week ’. The very same day I got a job offer back in Derry. I thoughtThailand didn’t happen, I would take the job in Derry. A week later I was in Thailand. That taste in travel, it opens your eyes to the world and I have never looked back.”     John left St. Columb’s in  and was accepted into Loughborough University for a degree in Chemical Engineering. Loughborough’s fine sporting pedigree was a key factor behind his choice but that side of it didn’t work out as he hoped and it wasn’t until his final year that he kicked a ball regularly again. He started playing gaelic – not his strong suit – in Leicester, before moving to Reading where there was a strong Irish community, and plenty in the way of soccer and gaelic. His job took him all around the world, but a trip to Taiwan in  ultimately changed his path and his le, completely. Now married to Jessie, with children Shannen, Cara and Caolan, John remembers when he discovered just how popular gaelic was in Asia. “I went to Taiwan in  on a project and discovered gaelic football team there,” he recalls. “They were competing in Asian Gaelic Games. It was just amazing to see  Irish people playing Gaelic football in China. “I had the opportunity to meet with Micheal OMuircheartaigh who was the honorary President of the Asian County Board. He comes over year and commentates on the games pitch-side. I didn’t watch a lot of gaelic growing up but I always watched the All-Ireland final. His voice was legendary and to actually meet the guy and have dinner with him and get to know him, was inspiring. “I ed to Thailand in , the County Board asked Johnhe could set up a team in Thailand. I managed to get a few Irish people and a few non-Irish people together and we got a team together and we played in our first Asian Games in Singapore in . In our first match we were lined up against Singapore Rugby team and I was in midfield and was lined up against a guy called Phil Green, who used to be a hooker for the England rugby team. “That was our first participation as Thailand GAA. Since then, every year, except , we have entered a team into the Asian Gaelic Games.”  Responsibility For a man who preferred soccer, and even a bit of golf, John was suddenly thrust into a position of responsibility, and, admittedly stubborn, he was not about to give his new role anything other than %. It was not easy however, and a lot of dficult days passed for a club which started out with five showing up for training to a club and city which has now hosted the Asian Games on three occasions, in ,  and  as well as hosting the South Asia Games on four occasions. “It was very dficult to be honest,” he admits. “The first thing I did was put an ad in the Bangkok Post and I got maybe four or five replies. The first training session had four or five people with a few girlfriends watching on. Because of my background with Oxford United, fitness came first so I told the guys they wouldn’t see a ball until they were fit, and I think because they had a dferent background from me, they thought this wasn’t for them. I probably scared people away. “Near tournaments it’s easy to get people to commit, but during the year and you’re running training once a week – I have a -hour commute to get out to training – you’re not sure what numbers you’re going to get. It’s very frustrating and the number of times I questioned myself ‘Why am I doing this ’ It was dficult, but I’m quite stubborn as well, and when I start something, it takes a lot for me to drop it because I want to make it a success. I persevered and I persevered and in  it really started changing.” The foundations of Thai GAA really started to take hold thanks to a talented group of girls, who came to the club, not just wanting to play, but to compete at the highest level. As defining moments go, this was signicant for John and his hopes of what Thai GAA could ultimately be. “I got a batch of girls in who were all natural athletes,” he explains. “Only two of them were Irish, one from the North and one from the South and neither of them had played gaelic before. One of them had played soccer for Northern Ireland but had no background in gaelic football. I had this group of girls for six weeks – all teachers from international schools before the  Asian Games in Malaysia, trying to get the basics. “In the first games they were asking ‘Where do I stand  Where do I go ’ They won six out of six at that tournament and won their ision. That was unbelievable success. Their hardest game was actually the semi-final against the Japanese Ladies. We beat them on Sudden Death Golden Goal. The same bunch of girls came back the next year in  and they won their title again that year. The following year they lost in the Upper Division, but that set the basis. This group of girls was committed, they loved their sport and we were giving them an opening to play competitively. “ was when we really bedded in as a club and that was on the back of our girls’ team. In , my girls won the South Asia Championship, so that was a regional tournament involving Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan and Shanghai. That was quite an achievement.”  Sustained success On the back of the girls’ success, the club got this influx of Irish men in  and that has since helped sustain the club over the last  years. The first men’s trophy soon followed – the Plate at the South Asia Games, and from there the club has gone from strength to strength. Better quality players joined – some with county experience, and fresh ideas and new energy began running through Thai GAA. “I was trying to remember things I learned playing with Doire Colmcille  or  years ago, but then these guys come in with fresh ideas and I was happy to let them coach,” John laughs. “The club is in a really strong place right now. We probably have about  members. What’s important is that there is a really good social side to the club as well. Most of the players would be late ’s, and early to late s, but there is room for everyone and it’s just a home away from home for a lot of people. It’s a good social network as well and you’re giving people a chance to play competitive sport as well as keeping fit. “Something I’ve picked up from the last  years of playing gaelic in Asia is what gaelic football means to people as a community. Most major cities in Asia have a gaelic team and it really is a home away from home from Irish and Northern Irish people, and people from both sides of the community in Ireland.” Only recently, John gave up the Chairmanship at the club, as he finally takes a back step from the day to day running of Thai GAA. It has been a labour of passion for the Carnhill man for  years, and he is proud of what it has become. He is not about to drt away into the sunset however. He might be turning  but he wants to keep playing, and doing whatever he can to ensure longevity and success for the club in the future. “I am very proud of what we’ve achieved in Thailand,” he says. “It’s also helped me stay connected to Ireland to be honest. This connection with gaelic football has given me more of an identity and a connection with Ireland being overseas. I have been able to meet a lot of people through gaelic football. The GAA certainly connects people and you can see the impact it has overseas. “I’m realizing that Father Time is marching on. I still want to be involved with the club, but I have work and family commitments. I used to be very heavily involved in making all the decisions but I have got a good bunch of people in there now who can share the load. “The next tournament maybe in Bangkok next year as it will host the South Asia Games and then at the end of  for the Asia Games, so maybe I can have a final swansong at those. There are guys older than me still playing so there’s a level for everyone. I’ll still be involved.”  Home away from home John s to Derry every summer with his family but for now, and for the past  years, his real home has been over , miles away, where he has helped build not just a team, but a club, a community and a legacy that will last long into the future. “It makes you realise the world is a small place and that the opportunities are out there,” he reflects. “It wasn’t something I sought out. I am proud of what I have achieved and what the club has achieved, but there has been a lot of good work that other people have done out in Asia around gaelic football. “It’s not just about gaelic football, it’s about Irish people and how we fit in around the world. We have no real baggage, we are able to adapt and fit into the communities we find ourselves in, and make a positive impact with our culture and with the welcome that we can bring to other people. When you are a teenager you have no idea where the future is going to take you. I had no great expectations or any great career plan. It was all by chance and by opportunity and here I am, sitting in Thailand.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Candystripes are one of just two teams without a victory so far this season, with Tuesday night’s - defeat to Shamrock Rovers the latest disappointment for Declan Devine and his players. There is now signicant pressure on City to get a result against Drogheda United at the Brandywell tonight to avoid the club’s worst start in their League of Ireland history. Victory however, could see them climb a few places, and Coll believes that a win would be huge for the club in a number of aspects. googletag.cmd.push “There’s a wee bit of pressure coming into it,” he admitted. “It’s not nice coming into a game under pressure so we have to try and take it away, and, on our home patch, start making it our patch. There are a few faces looking over the walls looking in watching us and we have to put a smile on their faces again. Hopefully Drogheda comes thick and fast and we can get the three points and get up and running.” Despite the defeat to Rovers, Coll saw a number of positives, particularly the performances of youngsters Ronan Boyce and Brendan Barr, who started Tuesday’s game. In all, six players who came through the Academy represented the club against the champions. googletag.cmd.push “They deserve their minutes,” he said. “If you look at Caoimhim Porter coming on, and Ronan Boyce, Brendan Barr, Caolan McLaughlin and Dixie Ferry, these players deserve their chance, because in pre-season they have stepped up to the mark and they know that Declan, Paddy, Conor and Mark will give them a chance. That’s exactly what they’ve done and hopefully they can keep driving on. “It’s hard to take and it’s four from four but there were some positives from the game. We conceded two disappointing goals, butyou look, we had Brendan Barr coming into the team and Ronan Boyce, and then the other young lads who came in. They were all brilliant and they are a credit to themselves. They were very good but the rest of the team have to step up to the same mark they are trying to reach.”     ‘Stick with us’ Coll has urged the fans not to fret despite the poor start to the season, promising that the players will turn it around soon. City have home games against Drogheda and Dundalk coming up in the next five days and a goodof points could change everything according to the experienced full-back. “Don’t be panicking too much because it’s a long season and we’re only four games in,” he insisted. “We have experience in this team look at Will Patching and Eoin Toal and others, we will be able to turn this around. Hopefully that’s on Friday night. We just have to regroup and that’s what we have to do. It’s our job. Tonight is another game so hopefully we can turn it around.” “You see the boys coming in after games and there’s nearly tears in their eyes. It’s not that we’re used to winning every single game or anything like that. Shamrock Rovers haven’t lost a game in the last year. We just want to get three points on the board and get off the bottom of the table because this club does not belong where we’re at, at the minute.” Defender Danny Lupano is set tofrom suspension after missing the Shamrock Rovers game due to his red card at St. Patrick’s Athletic last week, while Darren Cole should be fit after a recent injury.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is imperative that this report is published and consulted upon so that we can see the stark reality of what key strategists in health here are thinking.ldquoAre we to take the threat of having the Downe and Daisy Hill in Newry reduced to dferent grades of urgent care centres  If we are, then we need to maintain solidarity as a district and not allow this to happento either of our two beloved hospitals.Cllr Savage said the local authority could not get into a ldquoide and conquer approach that saw ldquoone end of the district get more crumbs from the health service table than the other.ldquoWe need to fight to protect and enhance the services at both hospitals. We want services retained and enhanced for our people, he said.The Newry councillor pointed to the -year community campaign for a new Downe Hospital, suggesting that since its foundation stone was laid ldquoit has been a constant battle to retain services, commending the Down Community Health Committee for its work in fighting to retain local services.ldquoWe in this district should not have to constantly look over our shoulder in fear of the centralising grim reapers within the Department of Health attempting to swing the axe again at our cherished local hospitals to enhance services within a cluster of hospitals within the greater Belfast area, declared Cllr Savage.ldquoElected representatives have an obligation to speak up for our people and ensure that we are not treated as second class citizens when it comes to access to local hospital services and first class health care.ldquoThe Department of Health should be looking to enhance local hospitals and a strategy needs to be looked at regionally with the emphasis on fair access to local health services.Highlighting the need to fight to protect the health rights of rural communities across the district, Cllr Savage called for a ldquofair share of specialist services across all hospitals, suggesting thatthe Downe is good enough to provide cataract surgery, it is good enough to provide other services.Cllr Savage added: ldquoWe need to look at the challenges we face in health and ask ourselves are the current engagement structures we have capable of holding decision makers within health to account into the future and could they withstand the body blow of a potential decision to halve the number of current hospitals ldquoWe need to review those structures and a good place to start would be enhanced engagement with the Down Community Health Committee and Daisy Hill Pathfinder Group, inviting these groups to meet with us to discuss their concerns for the future of our local hospitals in a post-Covid world.Cllr Savage said local people required an ldquounequivocal statement from the health minister that there are no plans to reduce the number of hospitals and a ldquocast iron guarantee that there are no plans to downgrade the Downe HospitalHe added: Only when we get a response will we know  the rumours are just rumours.

The post-Christmas lockdown presented yet another challenge to the council and the DfC to target help where it was most needed.The County Down Rural Community Network , Newry Confederation of Community groups and others were asked to set up three brand new distribution centres and allocated over pound, worth of food and essential hygiene and household goods to the area.The Journey Church stepped up to assist in the Downpatrick area and week after week, dozens of their volunteers received the supplies from Lynas Foods, which they made into the ious orders and dispatching them to the ious groups in need. Down Community Transport helped with the bulkier loads.The Clanrye Group were tasked with coordinating the scheme and Kilkeel Development Association looked after the Mournes area. Clanrye collated orders for food and supplies each week and Lynas foods delivered pallets of supplies to this part of the world.Orders were placed each week by local food banks, the St Vincent de Paul Society, Home-Start, Sure Start and other organisations.Nicholas McCrickard, manager of CDRCN, said: ldquoOn behalf of the strategic stakeholder forum, I want to thank Journey Church and all the other groups involved in this gigantic effort.ldquoThe general public may never fully grasp the scale of the operation to keep our foodbanks and SVP stocked and able to answer the great need which has been brought on by the pandemic.ldquoWhile many of us have seen our lives as relatively unaffected, thousands of people have seen their normal weekly incomes and their day to day struggles take a turn for the worse.ldquoThis food pallet scheme and other financial and food security systems have been a leline for many. I want to thank the Maria Keenan from the Clanrye Group in particular and my colleague Daniella McCarry for going well beyond their normal jobs to help people most in need.Daniella said: ldquoWe could not have done this without the volunteers from the Journey Church in Downpatrick. They selflessly gave up days of their own time and rallied to the warehouse to get the vital supplies out to those that needed it most.ldquoThe foodbanks, SVP and our other partners are also to be commended for getting their orders in every week and for getting food and nappies and other products quickly out to local families.Thomas Leavy, from the Journey Churchrsquos leadership team, was the person who co-ordinated the local effort.He said that the church volunteers represented all generations distributed food to Downpatrickrsquos Fountain food bank, St Vincent De Paul in Strangford and Killough, Newcastle and Ballynahinch food bank.ldquoThis is the second time we have partnered with County Down Rural Community Network, he explained.ldquoIn the first lockdown we delivered food parcels, this time we delivered straight to agencies so that they could get the supplies out.ldquoDown Community Transport assisted with the use of several of their buses to deliver supplies furthest away while we did more local deliveries.The church hired the former Down Sports Centre premises in order to have room to break down the thousands of pounds worth of food which came each week on pallets..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/14Apr2021-Backing.jpg","title":"Council backing ban on conversion therapy  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has called for a ban on so-called conversion therapy and increased protection for those in the LGBT+ community.The decision was taken at last weekrsquos monthly meeting of the local authority with the debate including a powerful and moving contribution from Slieve Gullion councillor Pete Byrne, who highlighted the issues that those in the gay community like himself face.Tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown, the motion was not agreed unanimously, with Independent Unionist Henry Reilly voting against it on the grounds that he did not know enough about the issue to make a judgement. The DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna and Kathryn Owen abstained.Cllr Brown urged the local authority to oppose the harm caused to the LGBT+ community in the past through the denial of rights and equal treatment and to recognise that discrimination still occurs today.Councillors have also supported a call to three Stormont ministers mdash Deirdre Hargey, Robin Swann and Naomi Long mdash to introduce an effective ban on conversion therapy within Northern Ireland, supported by a programme of work to help tackle these practices in all their forms.Cllr Brownrsquos motion, which urged the NI Executive and UK government to ban conversion therapy, called on the council to highlight and promote the continued support, counselling and advocacy local groups provide to members of the LGBT+ community.ldquoConversion therapy is a horric practice that has no place in todayrsquos society, Cllr Brown declared.ldquoConversion therapy is a term used to refer to ious dangerous and discredited practices aimed at changing an inidualrsquos sexual orientation or gender identity.ldquoThat could include attempting to change someonersquos sexual orientation from lesbian, gay or bisexual to straight or their gender identity from transgender or non-binary to cisgender.Cllr Brown said this disgraceful practice should not be accepted and permanently banned through legislation.Cllr Byrne mdash who is the SDLP group leader mdash said the fact that the issue was being debated in  was ldquobeyond distressing and as conversion therapy was still openly being practised.ldquoWe canrsquot look at the LGBT community and ask us to speak about it without your support, he told colleagues. ldquoWe need everyone in the chamber to support it and I hope they do.ldquoWe have heard the disappointing and weak response from the equalities minister on the conversion therapy debate in early March and we have waited almost , days since the UK government announced its intention to ban this therapy and we should not have to wait any longer.ldquoItrsquos long past time that the NI Executive stood up together to ban what I think are abusive practices in Northern Ireland and right across the UK, banning all interventions that have the intention of changing, suppressing, converting or cancelling sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.Cllr Byrne said that growing up as gay, he found it incredibly dficult, explaining to his colleagues that he could not express how dficult it had been.ldquoMentally, you torture yourself, you question yourself and you close down, block out your feelings. You literally wear a mask every single day, praying that you donrsquot say something that will give you away.ldquoYou endure enough mental anguish to last a dozen letimes so, to me, when I look back, that is you internally practising a form of conversion therapy on yourself. It is shameful, but that is how you feel growing up, suppressing your own sexual orientation and every LGBT+ person knows the damage that it does, he said, emphasising that allowing conversion therapy to be practised openly or signposting people towards it is ldquobeyond depressing.Cllr Byrne said for most of those in the gay community they ldquogenerally breathe for the first time when they let it all out and to be true to yourself, explaining that the dficulties do not stop there.ldquoYou are confronted as a gay person by many situations that challenge you mentally and while people say lsquothat is the cross you have to bearrsquo it should not be, he continued. ldquoThere is nothing about my sexuality that needs fixed, nothing about it that needs intervention.Cllr Cathy Mason, who seconded the motion, said the practice of conversion therapy sought to ldquodenormalise or completely eradicate a personrsquos sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression and was deeply rooted in ldquointolerance and bigotry.She said those who conducted the therapy regularly exploited the vulnerabilities of young people struggling with their sexuality.She described conversion therapy as a ldquodeeply harmful and regressive practice and that there must be no loopholes on the legislation governing it.Cllr Hanna said the DUP would abstain on the motion, making it clear he had no problems with anyone and takes everyone as he finds them and that conversion therapy was ldquosomething that he would not wish on anyone.Cllr Willie Clarke said no one had the right to question another personrsquos sexuality, while Cllr Reilly askedpeople were ldquoforced into conversion therapy, explaining that he did not know about the issue.However, he suggested that to ban something because ldquoyou did not like a personrsquos ideology or philosophy was the start of a dark path.He said there was a wider context to the issue and that he had a lot of respect for Cllr Byrne.

It is automatically washed down after every use to provide a hygienic convenience for its users.His designs have been discussed in the European Parliament and at a United Nations conference in Australia.Michael explained that central to his development of Changing Places was his experience of the barriers to living his le fully as someone living with a disability such as Motor Neurone Disease.ldquoUnless you are disabled or have a family member or friend who has a disability, the likelihood that you have even considered the barriers we face in daily living is nil, said Michael.ldquoI have consulted with people such as local campaigner Michaela Hollywood to find out exactly what people with complex medical and disability needs require from using a public convenience.ldquoA blind person even commented that to find a toilet where the floor was dry enough for her guide dog is rest on was nearly impossible.Michael, who has been living with his we, Jenner, and children, Georgia and Noah, in Darragh Cross since , stressed that AccessoLoo was about improving the everyday experience for disabled people while they were out and about and not about making a profit.He said: ldquoWhat is best about all of this, is that we are producing these items where quality is paramount, but the profit margin is not.

And an influential coronary care specialist based in Belfast has warned that closure of the Downersquos coronary care unit in favour of a thrombolysis initiative would signicantly reduce the quality of care available to the districtrsquos residents.The coronary care unit is seen as the cornerstone of the current hospital campaign to provide lesaving services in Downpatrick. If a way can be found to bypass the unit it is likely that all other acute services would be removed leaving the Downe as a large out-patient clinic.KILLYLEAGH ndash Killyleagh Ulster Unionist councillor Sam Osborne is quitting local politics after almost a quarter of a century.Mr Osborne confirmed last week he will not be defending his seat at the forthcoming local government elections in June.The councillor announced his decision at a party meeting in the town last week when retired businessman, Dr Eddie Rea, was selected to defend the Ulster Unionist seat.Mr Osborne joined Down Council in  taking the seat held by his father, also called Sam.

I thought he did it excellently, he had such short time but he had the room laughing and I think everyone really appreciated it.While Mr Lindsay also met him at St Jamesrsquo Palace in London, it was another Hillsborough Castle event that Prince Philip shared his robust opinion.ldquoThere was only the one time that I talked to him for about two minutes at Hillsborough gates and there was a statue there that he didnrsquot think very much of and he told me, which was quite funny, recalled Mr Lindsay.ldquoI was once lucky enough to have a short private conversation with the Queen but that was all I managed with the Duke unfortunately.Mr Lindsay commended the Duke for the positive impact and benefit his award scheme had on young people.ldquoI do strongly support the Duke of Edinburghrsquos Award scheme, as I support all groups who help develop and support young people, said Mr Lindsay. ldquoThere is no doubt about it, these groups who help young people make a huge dference as to how people develop as adult and help keep the more vulnerable children away from undesirable habits.ldquoI take my hat off to him being behind a scheme which has been an outstanding success and copied around the world as well.He revealed that previous plans for the aftermath of the Dukersquos death had advised there were to be no memorial services for  days after his death which subsequently had been changed to  days.Mr Lindsay said: ldquoAll along the Duke said that he did not want any particular arrangements and I agree.

I had been told it was good for anxiety which I have struggled with, so I thought I may try it myself, said Lorna.ldquoOnce I tried it for the first time, I was hooked. It sends sensations up your body and brings an overwhelming sense of calmness to you. Itrsquos a complete form of tranquility.Cold water swimming has been reported to help people who struggle with depression and anxiety as well as slowing down the onset of dementia and help with the effects of menopause. It also has been reported to increase happiness, give your body better circulation and to help build your immune system.Although an advocate for cold water, Lorna also stressed the importance of safe swimming, especially when the temperature s to near freezing.ldquoItrsquos a good place to be when yoursquore in the water. I think the colder it is then the more benefit you get from it, she said. ldquoHowever, you obviously have to be careful when yoursquore going in, especially during harsher weather you have to limit your time.ldquoIf you go into it and yoursquore not used to having your breathing under control, your body can go into an uncontrollable shock. Start slowly and get your body into control. Irsquove seen people walk in and run out again almost immediately, but once you get used to the process you just feel happy, calm and relaxed and you want to stay in longer.After stressing iables which must be taken into account before hitting the waters, Lorna also lists some essential tips for beginners thinking of giving it a try.ldquoAlways take someone with you in case something goes wrong. Try and find a safe beach, which I know could be more challenging as we have to stay local she said.Since lockdown, Irsquove been restricted so I would travel to the end of the quay in Killyleagh and swim down there. You have to consider the effects of rip tides as they can come close to the shore and can be a very real danger.Lorna recommends those who are thinking of giving it a try to bring a wetsuit, neoprene socks, a hat, gloves, dry robe, hot drinks and possibly a hot water bottle for afterwards.Swimmers should always aim to gradually heat their body once out of the water by adding layers to prevent going into a hypothermic shock.Also, they are advised to bring a floating aid to be seen safely and wear bright clothes.Lorna, a NHS care worker, first got involved with wild swimming after a colleague informed her of a Bangor-based group called Dash and Splash.Since then, more and more groups have took to the waters in local places such as Newcastle, Ballyhornan and Whiterock. Lornarsquos native Killyleagh have recently formed the cold water group Dippy Flipper swimmers.These groups are highly recommended to beginners as they have invaluable knowledge of the waters they are swimming in..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/14Apr2021-family.jpg","title":"McAlister family raises £3k for Marie Curie nurses  ","story":"A DRUMANESS family have helped raise over pound, for Marie Curie nurses in memory of local woman Peggy McAlister.The money was raised through a series of Easter activities including a virtual raffle and a socially distanced visit to homes in the village from the Easter bunny.Peggy, who was a well known figure in Drumaness, sadly passed away in August .

Thatrsquos been a big bonus, Irsquove played a few minutes more than I thought I would when I signed.ldquoI have settled in well, which is not always the case when you move clubs. Accrington have a great group of lads on the team and theyrsquove made the transition easy for me. Similarly with the manager, John Coleman. So far hersquos been great with me and is giving me the minutes on the pitch.The highly sought after Morgan didnrsquot take long to make his mind up on his move to Accrington, which is less than  miles away from his home, with everything falling into place at the right time.ldquoI was part-time at Southport so being full-time now with Accrington makes le a lot easier. One thing that crossed my mind about having to move clubs is that Irsquove two young children and one is at school. Itrsquos not easy for children to move so in all respects of teams that may have been interested in me, itrsquos the perfect situation not having to move home said Morgan.The midfielder also noted the dference of both training and playing level at his new club, and how he has adapted to his new surroundings on the pitch.ldquoI treated Southport as a full-time role, despite only training two times a week.

When I first arrived I was fit, but not match fit. I got thrown in at the deep end due to injuries and noticed instantly the pace of the game is a lot quicker. You donrsquot have time to take extra touches.Accrington Stanley are currently pushing for a place in the play-offs with just six games remaining before the end of the season.Morgan hopes he can help his new team gain promotion to the Championship, but he remains firmly grounded ahead of the next game.ldquoPlay-offs are the aim, every game is massive and we know that as a group. Everyone knows that is the objective for this season but we must take it one game at a time and not overlook anyone he said.Morgan is also looking forward to seeing theof fans, as he is yet to witness a crowd at his new club.ldquoOne of the big things Irsquom looking forward to seeing is the fans in the stadium. Football is not the same without the fans. You associate the two with being normal and you just want that back, he said.ldquoI want my family to experience the football league. They were constantly taking me places to help me develop as a player.

In October, firefighters fought to bring a malicious blaze under control.They were back at the plant last Saturday just before pm following reports of a fire in an industrial skip which spread to a nearby metal container.Fire crews from Downpatrick and Ballynahinch brought the blaze under control within an hour of the alarm being raised.The fire at the waste oil plant came at the end of three nights of sporadic trouble in the area, with fires started in the middle of the Killough Road which straddles the Model Farm and Flying Horse estates and missiles fired at cars.It is also understood that police on patrol in the area came across a pile of breeze blocks which were removed, fearing they would have been used as missiles to target passing cars.Cllr John Trainor mdash who was a passenger in a car targeted by petrol bombers late on Saturday night mdash has called for an end to the violence, which, he said, is being perpetrated by teenagers hellbent on causing misery for others.He believes that a partnership approach involving the local community, statutory agencies and the police is vital in getting on top of an issue which has resulted in a number of residents living in fear and others afraid to venture out at night.Just before .pm last Saturday, Cllr Trainor was approaching the Model Farm junction when a petrol bomb was hurled at the vehicle by a crowd of up to eight teenagers which included girls and boys. While the missile missed the car, it smashed on the main road and exploded.ldquoA fire had been lit on the main road and there is just no sense to this kind of activity, he declared.ldquoWhatan elderly driver had been confronted by a petrol bomb thrown at them and lost control of their vehicle  I have no doubt that last weekrsquos trouble was cleary pre-meditated.ldquoYou just donrsquot turn up at a housing area and discover petrol bombs. While what happened was clearly planned, it is not reflective of the hard working local people in the area.Cllr Trainor said there was ldquono sense to this kind of activity and questioned how the teenagers were able to get their hands on petrol bombs.He said there had been trouble at the Killough Road some years ago and that a targeted approach involving local groups and statutory agencies had made an impact.ldquoI think we need to go back to this model and there must be community buy-in. It is clear we are talking about a long term commitment as this continued trouble needs to stop. People have had enough and want to be able to live their lives free from the threat of trouble and violence, continued Cllr Trainor.ldquoWe need a strategy and action plan in tandem with an effective policing policy to deal with this issue and a pledge from partner agencies that they will make a long-term commitment. A partnership approach is vital moving forward and must include the local community.Admitting that he was not shocked nor surprised by the petrol bomb attack, Cllr Trainor said what happened could potentially have had ldquocatastrophic consequences with the behaviour witnessed over the past number of days at the Killough Road area nothing knew, insisting that it is in no way reflective of of the people who live locally.ldquoWe have a situation where people are not happy and a number are living in fear. Numerous scenarios could potentially have played out last weekend and I am thankful that they didnrsquot. The the fire in the road, the arson attack at the waste oil plant and the petrol bomb incident will be roundly condemned and rightly so. But they must not be allowed to continue, that is why a strategy to deal with the issue involving all stakeholders is vital.Cllr Trainor added: ldquoWe simply cannot have a situation where violence is prevalent in a part of Downpatrick where people are trying to get on with their lives. They do not need this. Throwing petrol bombs is not entertainment, it is criminality. Anti-social behaviour is often a symptom of other issues in peoplersquos lives which have to be tackled.Agreeing that the recent trouble is not reflective of the wider community, Cllr Oonagh Hanlon revealed that she witnessed some of the incidents including the malicious fires.She said it appeared that the blaze at the Macwaste plant was started deliberately and was ldquoextremely concerning given that the business was targeted last October.ldquoConsidering the highly flammable material stored at the Brannish Road site, it is a miracle that no one was seriously injured, she declared.ldquoCredit to our local firefighters who ensured that the fire did not spread. It is extremely frustrating that emergency services are being distracted from what could be more serious incidents and emergencies. We also had reports of petrol bombs being thrown at cars passing through the area last week.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoIt is hugely disappointing and frustrating that this type of behaviour continues in this area. Do the perpetrators of these crimes realise the impact of their actions ldquoI would appeal to anyone with information about what happened and those involved to provide it to the authorities and ask the community to continue to report suspicious behaviour as people are fed up with the actions of a small minority.

The Prince will be missed most by his family, but he has left an indelible mark and the success of his Duke of Edinburgh award scheme is unparalleled.Terry said the torch for environmental issue which was taken up Sir David Attenborough so many years ago was one once carried by Prince Philip whose care for the such an important issue has been passed to his eldest son Prince Charles.He added: ldquoPrince Philip has left his mark on this world and there are many people from Northern Ireland who have met him over the years.ldquoThey recall a man with an infectious sense of duty and one who could also be humorous at times, using this aspect of his character to put others at ease.

She spoke of `a regrettable legacy of suffering’ acknowledging that the Royal Family also were `directly impacted’ by the conflict. Alex Maskey said few would ever be able to compare with the Duke’s `record of public service’.By Sandra ChapmanSaturday, th April , : am  \"       \"  Irish patriot Maude GonneI would suggest many people were surprised to hear the `effusive tributes’ to the Duke of Edinburgh who died this week, delivered in the Assembly by the Speaker, West Belfast MLA Alex Maskey and deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill. She spoke of `a regrettable legacy of suffering’ acknowledging that the Royal Family also were `directly impacted’ by the conflict. Alex Maskey said few would ever be able to compare with the Duke’s `record of public service’.During the week I had been reading a biography of Maud Gonne, a woman born of the aristocracy but who shunned its trappings to become a passionate advocate of Irish freedom. Ireland’s leading poet of the day, William Butler Yeats,`devotedly pursued her for years’ but Maud did nothis devotion. Her greatest love was Ireland, her lelong fight was to get rid of the English whose record in the country she constantly trashed. By the time she died in , aged  she hadn’t achieved that goal and mostly today she is remembered for the battles she fought to feed the children of impoverished Ireland and her support for the rebels who didn’t succeed in making Ireland a united country. Many Irish politicians of those years regarded her as more of a nuisance. WB Yeats died loving her to the end. Today’s younger generation may never have heard of Maude Gonne but she’s a worthy historical figure.Samuel Levenson who wrote her biography mentions `the relative quiet that attended her passing’. He believed she had `lived too long’ at a time when `patriotism was in a slump’. The Irish Republican Army was again `blowing up buildings in London but no-one knew why. Emigration and poverty were continuing and people were still in jail but there was nothing new or exciting in that’ he wrote.In some respects she was the Bernadette Devlin of the day, a fighter for a united Ireland who was also hero worshipped. Where is Bernadette now  Where are all those names which filled our newspapers daily as Ulster strived to withstand its enemies who wanted to blow it into a united Ireland This is Northern Ireland’s Centenary year and already the event is being `snubbed’ by Republicans. Sinn Fein Communities Minister in the Assembly Deirdre Hargey was accused this week of `a callous snub’ when she declared her department in Stormont had no plans to mark the th anniversary of the birth of Ulster. Unionists want a centenary stone to be installed at Stormont. Ms Hargey declares it ‘reflects only one political perspective’ declaring, when criticised, `that there is nothing callous in my approach’.Yet Michelle O’Neill and Alex Maskey took a completely unexpected tone when they praised His Royal Highness for his contribution to public service. Shinners praising a Royal, even one who has passed on, is not something we are used to. And then there is the question of the stone. The Protestant community of Ulster feels it deserves a commemorative stone to be erected at Stormont in this centenary year. Go anywhere in the world and you will find commemorative stones and statues which represent achievement and give a visitor an instant history lesson of the place. By now the stone should have been erected – after all we are four months into the centenary year – but one suspects it is still on the drawing boards because it requires majority approval of the Assembly and despite the generous aknowledgements from Sinn Fein this week regarding the Duke of Edinburgh’s contribution to the world and his exemplary support of the Queen who did her bit for peace here by meeting Martin McGuinness, the stone is viewed in stony silence by nationalist politicians. I suppose you could sayMaud Gonne was around today she would be proud of them.Now I wonder what Maud would have thought of the NI Protocol the battles over which have left over  police officers injured and street riots the like of which we haven’t seen for a decade or two  Maud’s speciality was street protests to make her claims heard. I think she would have been in the thick of them.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Photo Kirsten McTernanDiscussions about the opening of an arts centre in Cardf started in  and were part of a vision for a space where artists could produce and present work, free from commercial pressures. Experimental work was seen as key to its identity, and the needs of artists were at its heart.The venue was formerly Canton High School, and the initial period of set up was a demanding time. The founders, and a gang of enthusiastic and dedicated volunteers, lovingly cleared, restored and adapted the building to make it fit for purpose as Walesrsquo first arts centre.The first official Board meeting was held on  April  and in July that year Chapter opened its doors with a temporary cinema, gallery and bar, and with former classrooms used as studios, workshops and offices.

Every year, the venue welcomes , visitors to more than  film screenings,  live performances,  visual art exhibitions and  community classes, artisan fairs and events.Mr Eagle added: ldquoChapter is many dferent things to many dferent people. For some, it will be the international gallery exhibitions and the programme of independent films.\"For others, it will be the cafeacute bar and restaurant to meet friends before a Cardf City home game, or it will be for dance and theatre classes or a cup of tea before working in the community garden.\"But at its heart itrsquos a centre for contemporary art, supporting artists and creatives from Wales and beyond to produce and present work.Chapter works with practitioners at every stage in their careers, supporting and stimulating opportunities for exciting new talent as well as promoting the work of established artists.It is a springboard for the creative community of Wales with a focus on bringing the world to Wales and Wales to the world.Chapter is home to over  of Walesrsquo most dynamic creative companies and artists, including BAFTA Cymru, Printhaus, ie ie Productions, Everyman Theatre, Beryl Productions, Cardf Music School and Taking Flight Theatre. Chapter has remained open to this creative community during the pandemic.MORE NEWS:They also offer a range of spaces in support of local artists and companies for the research and development of artistic projects, including Hijinx Theatre.Like most art and entertainment venues, the last year has been one of the most dficult times for the organisation as they were forced to close their doors.

We are an arts organisation that generates almost all of its income through ticket sales, classes, hires, cafeacute bar and other activity.\"The small remaining amount comes fromArts Council of Wales and is used to support our arts and education programme. Our capacity to earn incomeliterally stopped overnight and that was profoundly scary.Support has been generated from extremely generous public donations and from a range of funders including Arts Council Wales, Welsh Government, BFI, Art Fund, Ffilm Cymru and Admiral.Since its closure, Chapter has offered an exciting Chapter from Home programme, consisting of over  virtual film screenings, online theatre productions and art exhibitions, monthly online comedy gigs presented by Welsh comedian Robin Morgan, virtual lectures with Arts Society Cardf, as well as outdoor theatre performances with Cardf-based companies including Theatr Iolo and Kitsch  Sync.Currently showing at Chapteris internationally focussed art exhibition Artes Mundi.

Irsquom opposed to this plan. Itrsquos a loss of open countryside yet again, and the big issue of course that wersquore concerned about in Llantwit Major is the impact on local infrastructure.ldquoWe have two surgeries in Llantwit Major: one is nearly falling down. Our leisure centre is over  years old it has never really been improved upon in that time. Our traffic is chock-a-block the roads are gridlocked at peak periods.ldquoWhorsquos going to live in these homes  Wersquore building more and more homes all the time, but there are so many homes already available. Therersquos not the jobs in the area. The western Vale is becoming a concrete jungle.More NewsThousands of jobs saved at Peacocks as buyout agreedPenarth pub gardens readers said they would when restrictions easeWelsh Waters green energy plant in Dinas Powys a step closerThe plans are split across two parts: a western site of . hectares with  homes, adjacent to the B and an eastern site of . hectares with  homes, north of Bethesdarsquor Fro Church. About  per cent of the planned homes will be affordable.     Both sites would be accessed off of the Northern Access Road, also known as Fford Bro Tathan. This new road was built in  and , running from the B north of Boverton to the St Athan enterprise zone and Aston Martin factory.Planning officers responded to Cllr Johnrsquos concerns by pointing to the newly built road, as an example of new traffic infrastructure in the area and saying new residents of the proposed homes could help local shops by bringing them extra trade.A plan showing the layout of site A Picture: WYG Free to use for all LDRS partnersAn image showing the layout of the siteAnother concern was noise pollution: the eastern site is close to a firing range used by the Ministry of Defence. Councillors on the planning committee feared future residents could suffer from hearing loud gunfire. Planning officers said they could make noise complaints.David Harris, who lives in the local area, told the planning committee: ldquoThis site is located right opposite and within  metres of a live MOD firing range. This range can be used seven days a week, up to pm. Itrsquos regularly used.ldquoNo matter how much mitigation is used in the building fabric, you canrsquot reduce the exceptional noise of live gun fire when you have your windows open or when yoursquore in your garden. This fact alone makes this site totally inappropriate for residential development.Because the housing development is split into two sites, councillors voted on two separate planning applications, one for each site.The second application, for the eastern site, only narrowly passed a vote. Six councillors voted in favour of granting planning permission, and six voted against, with four abstaining. Planning officers warned refusing permission could risk a costly legal challenge.As the vote was tied, the chair of the planning committee, Cllr Jonathan Bird, used his casting vote to grant permission, effectively voting twice. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Mr Drakeford added: ldquoOn behalf of the Welsh Government and those supporting the government in this parliament, which was another huge development during his letime, I extend our sincerest sympathies at the end of an exceptional le lived.:Leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, said Philip had ldquooffered so much to so many people including through the Duke of Edinburgh Awards or the serving and former members of the Armed Forces.ldquoHis own military service saw him play a key role in the struggles of World War Two, and he never forgot the men and women he served with and the countless thousands who followed, Mr Davies said.Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said: ldquoWe are here not only to grieve but also to thank Prince Philip for his letimersquos contribution.ldquoItrsquos not a title or status or crown that is Prince Philiprsquos most important legacy that we celebrate today but the support that he provided to others.The Duke of Edinburgh last visited the Senedd while accompanying the Queen to the opening of the fth session of the-then National Assembly for Wales in .Campaigning for the May  Senedd election was postponed over the weekend following Philiprsquos death, but was set to resume for all parties following Mondayrsquos recalled parliament plenary. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They are really daunted and concerned by the move away from this method of payment.“Some elderly folk I have assisted feel overwhelmed with the terms and conditions which they must sign up to operate a current account with a card facility and some don’t have all the identity documents required. Whilst this is routine for many who are well used to signing up for ious services, elderly people can be more reticent of paper work and what it all means.”Mr Irwin explained: “I feel there could be steps that banking organisations could take to enable this process in these specic circumstances to be slightly less burdensome on the elderly. This could be around offering greater assistance one-to-one and through simplying the process, for instancethe person has limited identication documents. There is a lot of detail contained in the benefits letters that people received and I feel it would be easy for banks to quickly very a person’s identy and reason for opening an account on this specic basis with further verication provided by the Department for Communities.“The Payment Exception Service will also operate from this summer which will help through the issuing of redeemable vouchers to those pensioners who have been unable to open a bank account. However, this will be a short term measure and thus there remains a time pressure for the creation of a bank account. I will again be raising these matters with the Minister for Communities to encourage greater co-operation with banks to ensure no one is disenfranchised or greatly inconvenienced.”Horror as bags of dead lambs found during evening stroll Read full story here--Editor’s Message:Thank you for reading this article.

Named after a Hockey legend it is famed for its coffee and freshly bakedgoods – including an extensive range of home-made doughnuts.Taking councillors through a report which recommended the application was approved, a council planning officer told members the application was before them as it had receiveda high number of objections and petitions.Prominent amongst the objectors, is Peter Pan’s Neverland children’s play centre. The play centre will be a neighbour of the new drive-through and a petition collated by it contained , signatures objecting to the proposed application.Members were told the application site is currently used as a car park and there will be “no loss of retail use should the application be approved”.Members were also advised the proposed access points to the site have been heavily revised to limit the impact of potential traffic congestion in the area.Speaking about vehicular access, Alderman Gareth Wilson said the plans showed  vehicles in the queueand noted that at ious points in Portadown a build up of traffic is possible and asked what impact this proposal would have on traffic in the area.The planning officer told the meeting, as long as the proposal can accommodate vehicles it meets the policy and noted how the access is via Sandy Row, not Meadow Lane.“The access to the site has been looked at in detail and that is why access is not onto the main arterial route – the scheme was designed with that in mind,” said the planning officer.Councillor Sam Nicholson said he knows the area very well having used the area for his banking and noted how busy it can be. He then asked the engineer to provide some detail as to how they approached this design.In response, an engineer from Clyde Shanks said it had been recognised as an issue early in the design phase and had required a series of revisions before DfI Roads were satisfied.“We had five or six consultations with DfI Roads before we reached a satisfactory outcome,” said the engineer. “In that process the drive-throughincreased and was moved to the back of the site.“At present, drive-throughsare very popular and this one will be able to take about  vehicles. To address concerns about the traffic lights, the site will be accessible without going through them as customers will be able to access it via Sandy Row.”Councillor Paul Duffy noted the drive-through lanes appear to front onto the main road, like the McDonald’ssite in the vicinity and askedthere will be anything to deter pedestrians from taking a shortcut through the drive-through.He was advised a knee high rail fence will be erected to act as a barrier preventing this.Alderman Sydney Anderson also expressed some concern about the traffic flow and stated “I just hope there has been enough vision put into this to allow the traffic to build up on the premises as it can ill afford to back up on the road.“It is a busy junction most of the time and extra vehicles are to exit out onto the Sandy Row side, is everyone quite happy these plans and the road network can sustain this impact.”The planning officer answered Alderman Anderson’s question, telling the chamber it has taken a “considerable amount of time and focus”.“At present it is an existing  car, car park,” said the planning officer.“This means  cars could potentially come and go as they please at any time of day or night and we have no control over that.”An engineer from Clyde Shanks also noted the site expects to accommodate vehiclesan hour at peak times.“That is an extra vehicle every two minutes between the two roads,” said the engineer. “And that is assuming this is new traffic coming to the area but Tim Hortons are keen to come to this location becauseof the number vehicles and people in the area already.”Councillor Peter Lavery said he was “leaning towards approval” and noted the applicant has put a “number of measures” in place to address concerns about traffic build up.“They have done everything they can to mitigateour concerns and we should be noting and welcoming that,” he said.Alderman Wilson said he held the same opinion as Cllr Lavery while Councillor Duffy said he would be minded to approve as well but felt the traffic lights in the area may need some adjustment to accommodatethe extra traffic turning into this facility.Alderman Sydney Anderson said he was “encouraged by the amount of effortto look at potential traffic problems” and proposed the application was approved.This proposal was seconded by Cllr Nicholson who praisedthe application for being “very creative on what could have been a restrictive site” and the committee voiced its approval for this proposal.The development has beeen welcomed by local MLA Jonathan Buckley, who described it as ‘another great asset for our town’.  \"       \"  Most PopularLaura Gracey, a woman of substance, has diedTim Hortons set for PortadownHopes for resolution of Bannview Medical Practice problems suffer serious
