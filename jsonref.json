He also worked on Doctor Zhivago in the mid 1960s alongside David Lean, but was fired and didn\u0027t receive a creditThe director\u0027s last feature film was Puffball in 2007, a supernatural drama starring Kelly Reilly and Miranda Richardson.Mr Roeg also directed a number of TV series in the late 1980s and early 90s, including a televised adaption of Joseph Conrad\u0027s Heart Of Darkness in 1994.In 1999, the British Film Institute acknowledged Roeg\u0027s importance in the industry by naming Don\u0027t Look Now and Performance as the 8th and 48th greatest British films of all time in its Top 100 poll.Mr Roeg was awarded with a British Film Institute Fellowship in 1994 and was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2011.He has four children, Waldo, Nico, Sholto and Luc, with actress Susan Stephen, whom he orced in 1977.He also has two children with his second wife, American actress Theresa Russell.The director married Harriet Harper in 2005.BREAKING Nicholas Roeg dead: The Man Who Fell to Earth director dies aged 90 - Mirror Online"},{"url":null,"title":"Remains ancient Egyptian priest oversaw embalming pharaohs discovered","story":"    Skeletons were found in the ancient tomb in El-Asasef, Luxor, on the bank of the River Nile near the Valley of the Kings          Egyptian archaeologists move the cover of an intact sarcophagus, inside Tomb TT33 in Luxor, containing the \u0027perfectly intact\u0027 3,000-year-old womanEarlier in the day, authorities also revealed in the same area the tomb of the overseer of the mummification shrine identified as Thaw-Irkhet-if.The tomb contained five coloured masks and some 1,000 Ushabti statutes - the miniature figurine of servants to serve the dead in the afterlife.Three-hundred meters of rubble were removed over five months to uncover the tomb, which contained coloured ceiling paintings depicting the owner and his family.The tomb, which also contains mummies, skeletons and skulls, dates back to the middle-kingdom almost 4,000 years ago, but was reused during the late period.Ancient Egyptians mummified humans to preserve their bodies for the afterlife, while animal mummies were used as religious offerings.Egypt has revealed over a dozen ancient discoveries since the beginning of this year.           Egyptian archaeologists work on restoring a wall with painted murals inside the newly discovered tomb at al-Assassif Necropolis          A child mummy lies inside the newly discovered burial at al-Assassif Necropolis, in Luxor, Egypt November 24, 2018          A view inside the newly discovered tomb at al-Assassif Necropolis, in Luxor, 700km south of Egypt\u0027s capital Cairo, 24 November 2018          Egypt\u0027s Antiquities Minister Khaled el-Enany (centre) and Mostafa Waziri (right), the Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, inspect an intact sarcophagus during its opening at Al-Assasif necropolis          A skull is seen inside a newly discovered burial tomb at al-Assassif Necropolis, in Luxor, Egypt November 24, 2018          An Egyptian archaeologist brushes the top of a carved black wooden sarcophagus inlaid with gilded sheets on November 24, 2018          An Egyptian archaeologist works on restoring sarcophagi inside a tomb at al-Assassif Necropolis, in Luxor, 700km south of Cairo          Egypt\u0027s Antiquities Minister Khaled el-Enany (centre) and Mostafa Waziri (right), the Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, inspect an intact sarcophagus          The tomb  at Al-Assasif necropolis on the west bank of the Nile north of the southern Egyptian city of Luxor was discovered earlier this month by a French mission          Egyptian archaeologists work on restoring pottery including plates and vases outside the newly discovered tomb at al-Assassif Necropolis          Egyptian Minister of Antiquities Khaled El-Enany announced that the Egyptian archaeological mission uncovered a Ramesside tomb of Thaw-Rakht-If, the overseer of the mummification shrine at Mut temple          Mostafa Waziri, Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, speaks inside the tomb, which he said was discovered after removing 300 meters of debris          A close-up view of hieroglyphics carved on a black wooden sarcophagus inlaid with gilded sheets discovered by an Egyptian archaelogical mission at Al-Assasif necropolis on the west bank of the Nile          An archaeologist removes the cover of an intact sarcophagus inside the tomb TT33 in Luxor, Egypt          Archaeologists remove the cover of an intact sarcophagus inside the tomb TT33. El-Enany described the newly discovered intact sarcophagus inside the tomb as magnificent.

She is now in hiding as she has received constant death threats since her release Until now, beyond a few sketchy details, little about Asia’s persecution has been forthcoming. But last week The Mail on Sunday travelled to Ittan Wali and interviewed key witnesses, spoke to Asia’s trusted friends and unearthed court documents. What emerged was a story far more shocking than previously imagined.Our investigation can reveal that, on the day she was seized by villagers and accused of blasphemy:Asia was paraded through her village with a leather noose around her neck A baying mob beat her with sticks during a ‘court’ hearing Villagers smeared her face with black ink to humiliate her She was promised her life would be spared only if she converted to Islam Her life was saved when a schoolteacher rescued her only minutes from death.Asia’s forefathers have lived in Ittan Wali since before the formation of Pakistan in 1947. For decades, they have been the only Christians among 300 Muslim families.The village is wholly unremarkable – a collection of mud brick single-storey houses and dirt tracks skirted by open sewers – but it was home to Asia. And although she was frequently harassed and entreated to convert to Islam, she refused to budge.RAF Typhoon pilot blew up FOUR Isis trucks that were more...Share this articleShe lived with her husband, Ashiq Masih, and two stepdaughters, one stepson, and two daughters of her own in a single room mud brick house.Back in 2009, Asia’s husband was working as a labourer in a local brick kiln. But with four children to feed – the couple’s eldest daughter was married – Asia often worked as a farmhand to bring in extra money.At dawn on June 14, Asia and 25 other women went to work picking falsa berries, similar to blackcurrants, in a field owned by the village’s richest man Muhammad Idrees. She was paid 250 rupees (£1.50) a day.          Since her release from prison, Mrs Bibi has faced constant death threats from angry mobsThat morning was a Sunday, so her husband had no work. She left the house quietly, with Ashiq, now 62, and the four children fast asleep on the large bed they all shared.At midday, when the baking Punjab heat reached 110F (43C), Asia went to a nearby hand pump and returned with a bucket of water to share with her colleagues and a tin cup. Two sisters, Asma Bibi and Mafia Bibi (who aren’t related to Asia), turned on her, saying: ‘This cup was intended for Muslims, why did you take the water from it?’They said she had made the water impure, because she was ‘chura’, a derogatory term which means ‘low-caste’, used for Christians.The two sisters then urged Asia to convert to Islam, so she wouldn’t be chura any more – typical of the religious harassment she faced in Ittan Wali all her life.For once, instead of remaining meekly silent, Asia stood her ground. She said she would not convert, and asked why she, not her co-workers, should change religion.It has been claimed that she disparaged the Prophet Mohammed during the heated discussion that followed. She emphatically denies this – and insists the allegations were invented to frame her.          Her trouble started when she drew water from this hand pump near Ittan Wali village If so, it is a scenario familiar to many of the nearly three million Christians in Pakistan, out of a total population of 165 million. The blasphemy laws, it is widely acknowledged, have long been used against them, not as a system of organised persecution, but simply as a way of settling petty disputes.After the row, Asia ran back home crying and told Ashiq what had happened. He told her not to worry, and he seemed to be correct as there were no further incidents for the next five days.But on Friday, the Muslim religious day, Asia returned to work in the falsa fields, unaware that a mile away, the village imam, Qari Muhammad Salaam, was stirring up the villagers by announcing on the mosque loudspeakers that she had committed blasphemy.The first she was aware of any trouble was hearing a low rumble of voices, then the terrifying chant: ‘Kill the Christian!’She realised the men were coming for her and soon they appeared on a ridge. She had nowhere to run. In a panic, she stumbled, dizzy with fear, and a minute or so later felt hands roughly grab her arms and shoulders while another man fitted a leather noose around her neck.          Mrs Bibi lived with her family in this house in Ittan Wali village in Pakistan\u0027s Punjab regionHauled to her feet, she was paraded back to the village – led by the leather strap – and taken to a courtyard in the house of the village leader, where more than 100 people had gathered, including imams from neighbouring villages. It seemed that a makeshift sharia court was being convened.The village imam was flanked by the two sisters and Asia was flung at his feet. He told her: ‘You’ve made derogatory remarks about our Prophet. You know what happens to people who insult the Prophet. You can redeem yourself by accepting Islam.’Asia protested her innocence and said she did not want to convert. At this, the crowd became increasingly hostile and began jeering and spitting. Asia was then whipped with sticks and sandals. Then, in a form of ritual humiliation, someone smeared her face with black dye while others held her down.One of Asia’s daughters tried to intervene but was grabbed by her hair and her face smashed against a door. Another daughter, Isham, then nine, could only watch, terrified and powerless.

Top executives from both manufacturers and third partner Mitsubishi will attend mid-week operations committee meetings in Amsterdam that had been planned before Ghosn’s detention in Japan.Renault has refrained from dismissing Ghosn as chair and CEO, while demanding that Nissan share its findings from the months-long internal investigation that led to his arrest.The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said the Paris government and Renault had yet to see evidence to support Nissan’s allegations of wrongdoing.“We still have no information on the reproaches against Carlos Ghosn and on the charges that Nissan transmitted to the Japanese justice. I hope we can have these elements rapidly,” Le Maire said.Le Maire reiterated France and Japan were keen to pursue the strengthening of the alliance between the two carmakers.“The alliance is in the interest of Japanese and French and I wish for a strengthening of the alliance that would respect existing cross-shareholding,” he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af5cee5bcb69ba4def72fb6d444f9a91ff4d588e/0_0_5370_3222/master/5370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb26299489d165ebc916deea8991322c","title":"tories need to be better than tepid over uks industrial strategy","story":"The government should pick a future industry – say, green technology – and commit to itNot since Robert Donat clambered out of the Flying Scotsman to evade the police in Alfred Hitchcock’s 1935 film The 39 Steps will a crossing of the River Forth have generated as much excitement. In three years time, cameras will be in place to record the first wave of UK driverless vehicles – an autonomous bus service linking Fife with Edinburgh.News of the pilots – another is planned for taxis in London – was carefully timed. The government launched its industrial strategy a year ago and wanted to be able to show there had been progress.There is a paradox here. Theresa May stressed when she became prime minister that an industrial strategy was needed to spread prosperity across the nation and so deal with the reasons that people voted for Brexit. But Brexit has used up vast amounts of the government’s bandwidth to the extent that it has tended to crowd out everything else.Just to take one example, it was rightly seen as important that progress towards meeting the aims of the industrial strategy would be assessed independently. An industrial strategy council to do the job was promised within months: in the end it took the best part of a year before it was set up under the chairmanship of Andy Haldane, the chief economist of the Bank of England. Industry bodies wonder whether the delay suggests that the government is not as fully committed to the industrial strategy (IS) as its says it is – and they have a point.The low profile adopted by the business secretary Greg Clark hasn’t exactly helped either. Michael Gove’s proactive approach at Environment shows that it is possible – despite the noises off – for cabinet ministers to say things that draw attention to the initiatives they are interested in. But as one industrial policy expert put it: “Clark is a wallflower. He is not interested in promoting himself.”In Clark’s defence, industrial strategy is a slow burn. Once the government has listed its priorities and provided some funding (which it actually has in this case) there is inevitably quite a long delay before anything happens. Sorting out Britain’s productivity problem – the aim of the strategy – is going to be a long, hard process in which there are not that many quick wins.Few would quibble with the government’s list of issues that need to be tackled: Britain needs to innovate more, invest in people so that they can get better jobs upgrade the nation’s infrastructure create the right environment to set up a business and make sure that prosperous communities are spread right across the country.Quite clearly, the IS is a throwback to an earlier age, to the time in the early 1960s when the Macmillan government created the National Economic Development Council, a tripartite body that brought together politicians, trade unionists and employers. May’s idea that the government should build strategic partnerships with business through sector deals smacks of the corporatism that Margaret Thatcher loathed.The emphasis on sectors working at the technological frontier is unsurprising and – up to a point – sensible. If the world is on the cusp of a fourth industrial revolution, there will be big profits for the companies that move quickly. That’s why the IS is big on artificial intelligence, driverless cars and clean growth.But there are three problems here. One is that the focus on whizzy industries does very little to tackle productivity. Far more attention needs to be paid to the less glamorous sectors that make up what the IPPR thinktank called the everyday economy in its recent commission on economic justice.Gareth Stace, the director-general of the industry body UK Steel agrees. He is disappointed that the government has not done anything about energy costs, which mean British firms pay £50m a year more than they would in Germany, and is deaf to pleas that investment in new plant and machinery should not be penalised by increases in business rates. “A year on, the steel sector is still waiting to see any benefits coming from the industrial strategy,” he said.A second problem is that the new hi-tech fourth industrial revolution companies tend to be concentrated in the more prosperous parts of Britain, and that bias will become even more pronounced with the development of the Oxford to Cambridge corridor as a single knowledge-intensive cluster.Finally, there is the question of whether the government is merely paying lip service to the need to back the industries of the future. Clean energy is supposed to be a priority, but renewable sources of power were not mentioned in Philip Hammond’s recent budget and the government is proposing to remove payments for small-scale suppliers who export power to the grid. Quite clearly, it is sending out conflicting signals.Ultimately, the risk is that the IS tries to do too many things and does none of them very well. If, for example, the government wants to back an industry of the future, it should pick one – green technology – and really commit to it.The warnings about the threat of climate change have come thick and fast in the year since the industrial strategy was first published. There is a pressing need to decarbonise the economy by building more energy efficient homes, improving the insulation of the existing housing stock, improving local transport links, and accelerating the switch to renewables.Jobs would be created, skills would be upgraded, fossil fuel dependency would be lessened, and prosperity would be more evenly shared across the countryBut it will only happen if the government uses its full range of policy tools – regulation, public spending, procurement, tax, and state-funded R\u0026ampD. That requires far more commitment and focus than it has showed thus far."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b39a5ae462ce5084edecc63658ff743d68da14e5/0_342_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1f03a303ce0600fb77a32248a384089","title":"a glimpse of daily life in pyongyang in pictures","story":"North Korea’s capital is a carefully managed showcase for its dictatorship.

Lee has become a fast hero of mine, although I only learned about her recently through Cathy Newman’s brilliant book, Bloody Brilliant Women: the Pioneers, Revolutionaries and Geniuses Your History Teacher Forgot to Mention.Lee, who was born in Scotland, was a Labour MP. She was the first minister for the arts, and is still the only person to table a white paper on the arts (A Policy for the Arts, 1965). She was instrumental in widening the remit of the Arts Council of Great Britain in 1967, particularly into the regions. Lee was so popular with theatregoers that she would be applauded by audiences whenever she went to see a show, which was often. (She was also involved in establishing The Open University and, a side note, was Nye Bevan’s wife: an absolute Labour power couple.)How we need a Jennie Lee for these philistine times. This month, Jeremy Wright, the secretary of state for digital, culture, media and port (DCMS), gave us a surprising insight into his reading habits. He was unable to name a single female newspaper columnist when pressed five times (he eventually alighted on the Daily ’s Allison Pearson). He also said he does not subscribe to a single newspaper, but relies on aides to summarise their content for him. Of course, Wright is a busy man and pressed for time, but given that he is also responsible for “media ownership and mergers” and is also to lead a review into the future of journalism, it was an extraordinary admission. Wright also revealed his fondness for Lego. This was widely mocked, which was rather unfair. Because – and here’s the thing – at least it spoke of an actual interest. A real hobby outside of heckling on the green benches. Whether Lego falls under the category of culture is a different matter.Wright is just the latest in a long line of culture secretaries who appear to have no firm interest in any aspect of the brief. To be fair to the former incumbent, Jeremy Hunt, at least he is well known as a passionate lambada dancer, though he let himself down with his flakiness on BSkyB. We have now had three culture secretaries in just two years, such is the disregard for the office. Matt Hancock said he liked Ed Sheeran, and Karen Bradley apparently listened to Adele (the most mainstream, safest artists to pick, which smacks of focus groups). All several cultural isions below Jennie.Politicians are often seen as iniduals who go straight from university into the political arena, (sometimes via a brief stint in PR), and seem to have few other interests. They appear to read Hansard and little else. Jeremy Corbyn was slated for stating that Ulysses is his favourite book (people thought it pretentious), but at least it was evidence he reads for pleasure. Though he probably just read half of it, like the rest of us. One of the most excruciating mid-speech moments by David Cameron, was when he – an oft-professed fan of Aston Villa – forgot which club he ostensibly supported, and praised West Ham (who have similar club colours). Remember Gordon Brown saying his favourite band were Arctic Monkeys, who “really wake you up in the morning”, and then he couldn’t name a single one of their songs?The cultural deficit at the DCMS matters. The state of the arts in Britain does not make for good reading. The Arts Council England (ACE) budget for 2018 to 2022 has been cut by £156m. There seems to be no recognition of how powerful the arts can be in educating audiences, reflecting current events, exploring different views and opening up dialogue.In the past year alone, I have enjoyed Nicholas Hytner’s version of Julius Caesar at The Bridge, influenced by Trump’s America The Jungle’s tale of life in the Calais refugee camp Alan Bennett’s Allelujah!, a celebration of the NHS. In good news, the regions have gained support, but access is still often limited to a certain demographic: older, middle-class, affluent and white. As for sport, the 2012 Olympics were, agreed by almost everyone, a national success, but in London, grassroots sport has been cut by an average of £400,000 per borough, while youth crime increases.Lee argued that the arts should be accessible to every adult and child, ingrained in everyday life the education system local communities, almost as an extension of public health. The UK has much to be proud of in the arts – we are among the world leaders – but Lee’s vision has not come to pass, and if anything we are going backwards. Culture desperately needs a Lee, not a seemingly indifferent minister who, if recent history repeats itself, will be replaced in about a year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6acb4c05e3a73651eaa2f96b6a7613d09aa18c9/0_361_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94cdba040054af71f70325c14e790079","title":"only a fool would have bought into bitcoin late last year so guess what i did","story":"A little voice in my head told me that maybe cryptocurrency was the future, and I should have a stake in it. That voice was wrong …What follows is a morality tale for the modern age. It stars me, an idiot, and may produce strong feelings of schadenfreude in you, hopefully not an idiot. Ready? Let us begin.Once upon a time, like, a year ago, cryptocurrency was going gangbusters. (I do hope you can keep up with this technical language crypto can be complicated.) It had made the transition from being an obsession for nerdy libertarians (and the preferred currency of drug dealers) to becoming a topic of mainstream conversation. And prices were rocketing – bitcoin, the original and most well-known cryptocurrency, reached a record high of almost $20,000 (£15,500) shortly before Christmas last year. Staggering, when you remember that one bitcoin was worth about $13 five years earlier. People who had gambled on cryptocurrencies early on were getting insanely rich.Meanwhile, I was getting incredibly irritated. Dammit, I thought, as prices went up and up and up. Why hadn’t I bought bitcoin back in 2013, when I first started writing about it? I would like to say it was because of my concern about its disastrous environmental impact. (New units of bitcoin are “mined” by computers solving complex maths problems – which takes a ton of energy.) However, the honest answer is that I didn’t want to waste my money.That concern, along with all my common sense, went out of the window, as prices kept rising. While I was sure the bitcoin boom was a bubble, a little voice inside me kept asking: what if it’s not? What if the e-vangelists are right and cryptocurrency really is the future? A struggle between avarice and prudence raged within me – and avarice won I bought some bitcoin. I also bought ethereum, which is probably the second-best-known virtual currency. I won’t ulge how much I bought because my mum is probably reading this, and I don’t want her to get mad at me. Suffice to say, it was an amount I could afford to lose – but not without feeling a bit queasy.Now, if you have been keeping an eye on cryptocurrency prices, you will not be surprised to hear that I’m feeling a bit queasy. Virtual currency seems to have entered a death spiral, with prices plummeting since early November. Bitcoin, worth about $4,200 at the time of writing, lost nearly a quarter of its value in a week. Ethereum, worth more than $1,200 at the beginning of the year, is now valued at about $130.There are various reasons for crypto’s woes, including hacks and regulatory crackdowns. However, the most important factor may well be the fact that the crypto boom was never real to begin with experts reckon last year’s sky-high bitcoin prices were probably the result of manipulation rather than legitimate demand. The US Justice Department has reportedly just opened an investigation into whether traders on a cryptocurrency exchange called Bitfinex were driving up prices using various unscrupulous, and illegal, market tricks. This follows a study published in the summer by a University of Texas finance professor who specialises in financial fraud, which estimated at least half of bitcoin’s price jump last year was a result of price manipulation.While the current crypto-crash is bad news for my finances, it is better news for the environment. With bitcoin’s price plummeting, mining the currency is no longer profitable, and a number of mining operations are closing down. This isn’t to say we should expect to see the end of cryptocurrency, however. Far from it. As the visionary economist Jamiroquai once said, the future is made of virtual insanity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b40e97739de7a5ea2f06c569de2dad6708b0e3aa/0_148_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5180a6edca5479960cdb3bf389ea25fa","title":"the guardian view on mays brexit deal a sobering moment for britain","story":"Theresa May’s hard-won deal is done at last yet its undoing is all but taken for granted. Even as EU leaders gathered in Brussels to approve the draft withdrawal treaty and political agreement today, its myriad domestic foes were plotting their course past it. No one believes that the prime minister can pilot it successfully through parliament next month. The numbers look worse by the day, knighthoods notwithstanding.So the signing of the deal looks strangely beside the point after all the months of battle. But this is an important moment, sobering to all bar Brexit ideologues and those whose personal ambition precludes all thought of the country’s interests. As Mrs May observed, a new chapter in our national lives is beginning. The precise content of the coming pages is necessarily vague. We know only that they are bringing Britain closer to the unhappy and unnecessary ending of a 45-year story.The sorrow expressed at the Brussels summit was evinced entirely by the EU27 – it was a “sad day” “not a day to celebrate” even “tragic”, in Angela Merkel’s words. Politics obliged the prime minister to sound upbeat. Mrs May insisted, implausibly, that she was full of optimism about the future of the country. But the past weeks have underscored that the loss is Britain’s. Any Brexit deal is a bad deal for the country.The foreign secretary’s reassurance that Britain has been in far more challenging situations avoided mentioning that we brought this one upon ourselves, and must face up to this act of self-harm if we wish to emerge without more damage. Confronted with reality, the reaction of the Brexiters has been instead to double down on the post-imperial delusions and lies that got us here. They accuse Mrs May of selling out the nation, as if one country could simply stare down a bloc of 27. Britain is already damaged and diminished, weakened in its dealings with the other EU members – as the last minute tussle over Gibraltar showed – and with the world outside. The EU is with Spain, said the president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker. It was with it for the simple reason that Spain is with the EU. Imagine now how the UK will fare when it goes solo in negotiations with the US, China and others. Good luck with those trade deals.Mrs May pandered to the Brexiters in the vain hope of assuaging them, triggering article 50 prematurely and laying down reckless red lines. Her letter to the public looks desperate in two ways: first, as a tactic, reflecting the increasing hostility to the deal among both Tory and Labour MPs and second, in its content. She suggested the deal would clear the political space to address the burning injustices she has often pledged to resolve. If she was ever serious about tackling these – and her record to date shows little sign of it, the last budget perhaps least of all – it is clear Brexit cannot solve the problems that contributed to the vote for it it will exacerbate them. Shamefully, her letter not only echoed but amplified the bus-side lie about Brexit boosting funding for the health service the government would be able to spend British taxpayers’ money on the UK’s own priorities, “like the extra £394m per week” it was investing in the NHS.It is true that the British people mostly don’t want to spend any more time arguing about Brexit. But when leavers and remainers are united only in disliking Mrs May’s solution, that offers no way forward. Mr Juncker insisted that this is the only deal possible, though others were more cautious tweaks are possible, but not the wholesale overhaul Brexiters demand. The alternative they posit, of a “managed no deal”, just means strapping on seat belts as you head for the cliff edge. Meanwhile, remain ministers have reportedly formed a new “gang of five”, hoping to steer Mrs May towards a softer Brexit after defeat in the Commons vote. On Sunday, Arlene Foster said the DUP could back a Norway-style deal, an option attracting increasing sympathy. The campaign for a second referendum is gaining momentum among both the public and politicians. Brexit is an economic and political disaster, fuelling, not healing, isions. The extent of the folly has grown clearer with each turn of the page. But the ending is not yet written."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/498637530ad5cc8a189ea05a037e56fcb95382da/0_0_4500_2698/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a49aed94e39674a9f9024b443f00d926","title":"theresa may brexit deal meltdown","story":"Dark arts will be used to win support for the prime minister’s plan. But the key question is what happens when MPs reject itIt was a funeral masquerading as a baptism. In Brussels, Theresa May’s Brexit deal was welcomed into the world by the UK’s 27 soon-to-be-ex-partners and the priesthood of the European commission.Yet she should have been wearing black and a mantilla. The deal is, as Tony Blair told the BBC’s Andrew Marr, a “dodo”. In her open letter to the nation, the prime minister declared that the agreement “is in our national interest – one that works for our whole country and all of our people … a deal for a brighter future”.But this is an ex-deal. The only reason it is sitting on its perch is because it has been nailed there.It is dead because – barring a truly dramatic realignment of parliamentary opinion – it simply cannot survive the “meaningful vote” in the House of Commons expected on 10 December.Julian Smith, the government chief whip – who looks like a dentist who positively enjoys giving his patients insufficient Novocaine – is now May’s most important cabinet colleague by far. In the next fortnight he and his team must use every conceivable inducement and threat to reach the magic total of 320 votes: knighthoods, peerages, gongs and legislative time will be offered to waverers. Those MPs who oppose the deal will be asked whether their families would really enjoy reading about their sexual indiscretions in the newspapers. Most of this nasty work will be carried out by intermediaries (even whips need plausible deniability). But any and every tactic available to the government will be used this is life and death, and no time for political squeamishness.But I still don’t see how Smith does it. Some MPs, strapped to the dentist’s chair, will indeed give in when he holds the drill in front of their eyes and asks: “Is your vote safe?” But I have yet to be convinced that he can get from around 260 (if you assume, generously, the support for the deal of 15 Labour rebels) to 320.What really matters, then, is not the first Commons vote, but the second. Let us assume that the PM is defeated next month: the political world is then plunged into an extraordinary Christmas crisis. May could, of course, force the issue with a confidence motion – or simply resign on the spot (unlikely, given her recent pattern of behaviour). Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, conceded to Marr that it was “not possible to rule out” the wholesale collapse of the government.The PM might yet, in any case, face the more parochial challenge of a Conservative vote of confidence, threatening her position as party leader: Jacob Rees-Mogg only has the names of 26 Tory MPs in his elegantly tailored pocket, but that could easily increase to the necessary 48 if May’s deal was rejected by the Commons.The EU would also have to consider its response. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, declared that “this is the best deal possible. This is the only deal possible.” The history of diplomacy suggests that most such statements contain a footnote written in invisible ink: “Unless we have to amend it a bit.” One can still imagine a few scraps being thrown May’s way to show good faith.But the fundamental controversies etched into the deal – the Irish border “backstop”, the continued role of the European court of justice, the prospect of the UK remaining indefinitely in the customs union – are not going to be removed by Brussels in a moment of shocked epiphany. Tweaks, maybe core alterations, absolutely not.Deplorably, senior government figures are actively hoping that the markets will respond with panic to the parliamentary failure of the deal, and, to adapt Dr Johnson, focus the minds of MPs sufficiently to deliver a majority second time round. The precedent cited in this context is the Troubled Asset Relief Program (Tarp) devised by George W Bush’s administration in 2008 to prop up the financial system after the crash. After its initial rejection by Congress, the US stock market fell by seven percentage points. Congress promptly endorsed the plan.But this is a ridiculous parallel to draw. The crash was a clear and present danger. The Brexit deal is simply a damn-fool plan drawn up in response to the result of a referendum involving lies, illegality and foreign interference. The crash could not be halted by popular will: fortunately, with Brexit there is precisely that option, in the form of a people’s vote.Expect the campaign for a fresh referendum to gather in strength after the parliamentary vote. Those who have always felt that a no-deal Brexit was the cleanest and most honest option – the oxymoronic “managed” no-deal of Dominic Raab’s fantasies – will shift up a gear. Within the cabinet, a new “gang of five” (Philip Hammond, Amber Rudd, David Gauke, Greg Clark and David Lidington) are reported by the Mail on Sunday to be ready to quit if a no-deal exit becomes a serious prospect.Even as May shook hands with Jean-Claude Juncker, the political village was transforming itself into a noisy constitutional souk. At every stall, the traders offer alternative models: “Norway for now!” “Canada ++!” “Switzerland!” “Get yer article 50 extension here!” None of these alternatives, it should be emphasised, has been seriously countenanced by the EU. But they are already being offered to curious MPs at early-bird prices.What unites this cacophonous marketplace is the absolute assumption that the deal will fail in December. The 585-page agreement and its 26-page political annex are already regarded as redundant. The variables are dizzying, the stakes vertiginous. The worst news that May has ever had to confront is that the past two-and-a-half years were the easy bit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6858658695d3239f67f3e97734c154ea9b3fc2b3/0_8_3307_1985/master/3307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66d1d5ad2681ac8fbfeb2c84101c7e0e","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of sharp","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘sharp’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘sharp’ (please note that these are no longer published online).Share your photos of what sharp means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 28 November at 10am.

Stringer hopes the 65-70cm long predators will create gaps in the forest’s ecosystem for rarer species, such as red squirrels and goldcrests, which are better adapted to avoiding martens. “They are going to eat what is most common, like grey squirrels and wood pigeons,” he says.In Ireland red squirrels are starting to establish themselves in counties where martens have eradicated greys, which are native to north America.Chris Sandom from the University of Sussex, who is contributing to a book on rewilding, has identified 24 other rewilding projects across the UK, including the reintroduction of beavers in Devon and white-tailed eagles in Scotland. “Rewilding is about nature taking the lead rather than managing nature,” he says. “It is an idea that is gaining momentum.”Stringer accepts rewilding is controversial for some landowners but he sees it as vital to making our ecosystems sustainable. “Predation is a classic natural process that is missing from our landscape. That is why species reintroduction is associated with rewilding,” he says.Dogwalkers enjoying the last hours of daylight are also excited by the prospect of pine martens returning to the Forest of Dean. Debra Clough, who lives in nearby Cinderford, says: “It’s a great idea. We’ve got to learn to live with all these things. We’ve rather taken over I think.”Even gamekeepers, whose Victorian predecessors hunted pine martens to extinction in much of the country to boost gamebird numbers, back the plan. “Our attitudes have changed,” says Tim Weston from the National Gamekeepers’ Organisation. “We canvassed local gamekeepers and they’re not opposed.”But Weston adds that pine martens repeatedly targeting gamebird pens or hens on small-holdings should be culled or relocated. “If you have one inidual continually raiding a chicken house there needs to be mitigating measures,” he says.The forest has already seen the return of another emblematic animal of the British countryside this year. A pair of beavers were introduced in July by the Forestry Commission as part of a trial to establish if the dam-building mammals are able to reduce the risk of flash flooding.However other recent wild arrivals in the forest are more isive. In the late 90s wild boar were illegally released and there are now an estimated 1,600 roaming free in the forest.As a freezing mist settles over the dark tree-covered hills, rare-pig farmer Richard Vaughan checks on a pair of his prized middle white sows with their litter of piglets. He fears they could pick up African swine fever, which is spreading through Europe, from wild boar. “You’ve only got to have a wild boar eating a half-eaten sandwich made with infected meat and we’ve got African swine flu in this country,” he says.Vaughan, who has shot 46 wild boar on his 500-acre farm so far this year, says environmentalists need to be careful about releasing wild animals. “It very easy to say ‘Oh we need wild boar, we need wolves, we need lynx, now I’m going back to my nice semi in Surbiton’ but I have to live with the consequences,” he says.Locals in nearby Lydbrook also complain about boars. John Jones, at the village’s garage, says he sees cars damaged by collisions with boar every week. “I don’t know much about pine martens. But wild boar cause a lot of problems here,” he says.Nicky England, who is serving drinkers at the Jovial Colliers Inn, is still keen on bringing back pine martens. “I think it’s a good idea especially if they are native to this area,” she says. “Although they are introducing a predator, it’s still good for wildlife – it’s the circle of life.”For Stringer there are no parallels between martens, which are preyed on by foxes, and wild boar. “It is not an example of a reintroduction going wrong – it was an illegal release. If a feasibility study had been done then you would have seen there are no predators for boars – no wolves in the ecosystem.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a568dfb14112587ebd441d4a80433d6026aa2968/0_291_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7161b0a61d0755e4801c966063db96b","title":"boots riley musician director sorry to bother you interview","story":"The musician turned director discusses how firsthand experience, and having Dave Eggers as a fan, shaped his hit debut movie, Sorry to Bother YouBy the time I meet him, Boots Riley has been promoting his movie Sorry to Bother You for the best part of nine months. It dropped with a splash at the Sundance film festival in January – but the veteran rapper and political organiser, now 47, is clearly still delighted to discuss his gleefully disruptive entrance into the world of film-making. “It’s all related to things I care about,” he says.Tracking the moral dilemmas of penniless Cassius Green (Lakeith Stanfield, who gave a standout performance in Get Out) as he rises through the ranks of a shady telemarketing firm, Sorry to Bother You reflects on the challenges of being black in America and gives Riley space to argue – in freakishly satirical terms – why it’s worth taking a stand against the predations of capitalism.Born in Chicago in 1971 and moving to the city of Oakland, California, six years later, Riley was steeped in politics from an early age. His parents were social justice organisers and their son followed suit, joining the Marxist-Leninist Progressive Labor party at 15. In 1991, he formed hip-hop collective the Coup and went on to release six politically charged albums, notably 1998’s acclaimed Steal This Album.Riley, who lives in Oakland with musician Gabby La La and their child, is a genial presence. Clad in a distinctive red-and-black check suit, he delivers carefully weighed answers in a deep, measured drawl, punctuated by the occasional wry chuckle. A large plate of cheese sits between us, untouched for the duration of the interview.You must have been pretty good at it…Yeah, I’m good at listening to people and figuring out what it is that they’re really saying.In the film, Cassius hits the jackpot when he discovers his “white voice”. Was that a detail from your days in telemarketing?Yeah. Nobody ever talked about it, but you’d know what to do. You’d try to obscure the fact that you’re black, just on the very basic level of trying to make someone feel like you’re like them, and on the more racist level of someone being OK giving you their credit card information.How did you get into politics?When I was 14, a youth organiser came by my house with a van full of 14-year-old girls. They said: “Do you want to go to the beach?” I was like: “Hell yeah.” Then they said: “But first we’re going to go to the Watsonville cannery workers’ strike and support them.” I was like: “OK.” Through that, I became involved with summer projects that helped out farm workers. At the same time, I was involved with everything from sales and retail jobs to theatre to selling weed to music to throwing parties.You’ve continued to be politically engaged over the years…Yeah, when Occupy came around, I was working on the album that was to become Sorry to Bother You, the 2012 one, and I had to call up the label and say: “It’s going to be some more months, because this is what I’ve got to be doing.”You identify as a communist. What do you mean when you say you’re a communist?I think that the people should democratically control the wealth that we create with our labour. Whereas at this point, most of the value we produce is being hoarded and used as power over us. Most people will agree that we should democratically control the wealth that we create with our labour. The question is, how do we get there? How is that organised? I don’t claim to have the answers. A lot of people, especially on the left, will sit around arguing about what colour the buses should be when we have a world like that, but the real point is, that’s the world we need to be working towards. There are people who have said that they were working for that world, and some were being disingenuous, some were being sincere. All have made mistakes. Why? Because that’s what you do in life, is make mistakes. But that’s the world that we should be working for. We’re not going to get there without a struggle. It’s not going to get voted in.As corporations get ever more powerful and inequality rises, is it hard to remain optimistic?My optimism doesn’t have to do with the scoreboard, it has to do with who’s up to bat.In August, you criticised Spike Lee’s BlacKkKlansman on Twitter, calling the film, which is based on a memoir by retired black police officer Ron Stallworth, “a made-up story in which the false parts of it try to make a cop the protagonist in the fight against racist oppression”. What compelled you to speak out?I felt it was important. Spike Lee is a hero of mine, the person who compelled me to go to film school. But this film was putting out a certain idea of history in the time of Black Lives Matter and the rise of a new white supremacist movement, when the police are actually working with these white supremacist groups.Has Spike Lee responded to you directly?No. I got my information to him through Dave Chappelle, but I haven’t heard back.Has it changed much over the years?Oh, definitely. It still feels like my home, but it also feels like a ghost town to a certain extent, even though it’s more developed than it’s ever been. When everyone was urging me to go to LA, I fought to stay in Oakland because that’s what grounds my art. But I needed to fight for everybody else to stay in Oakland too. That’s why I’m behind this rent control thing that’s happening right now.Will you make more films?I have a deal with Michael Ellenberg, who brought Game of Thrones to HBO, and I’m doing my own TV series with him. I’m writing and directing an episode for Guillermo del Toro’s horror anthology series 10 After Midnight. And then I’m writing a couple of films. I’ve waited a long time, I’m 47, so I’ve got to get a lot of stuff done.Sorry to Bother You opens in the UK on 7 December"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67b19dc2dc481bbfa6b507cf61dc0f2e4bbcc8c0/16_5_982_589/master/982.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=582f646d020f52a67fc03df313bbe744","title":"copa libertadores second leg final called off again","story":"It had been dubbed the final to end all finals, but nobody has any idea if or when it will ever start. The second leg of the Copa Libertadores final between River Plate and Boca Juniors, initially scheduled for Saturday, had been rescheduled for 5pm on Sunday after an attack on the Boca team bus, but was cancelled at 2pm. There will now be a meeting in Asunción on Tuesday to decide where and when the final will be played.The Conmebol president Alejandro Domínguez said that the “equal” conditions Boca had demanded could not be guaranteed. He said he did not know “when or where” the game would be played, if it ever is. That inclusion of “where” suggested that serious consideration is being given to playing the game away from El Monumental. The “when” is pressing given the Club World Cup begins on 12 December and Conmebol needs a representative.Domínguez stated: “This is not football. It’s not what any of us want. This is not the Argentina we love, we know, it’s not the majority. This is not Argentinian society, these are misfits. We have to use this time to give a good sign to the world we can do things well.”Three Boca players had been left needing medical attention after their bus was attacked, a fusillade of missiles shattering windows and admitting tear gas, leaving a number of players feeling nauseous. How serious the injuries were remains something of a mystery. After an attempt was made to play the game at 7.30pm on Saturday, Conmebol’s medical team had insisted that none of the players were too badly affected to play. Pablo Pérez, the Boca midfielder who went to hospital with eye problems after the attack, was then included in the starting lineup before the game was postponed, but his ophthamolgist had told him today that he should not play.The statement Boca released on Sunday morning was vague, perhaps wilfully so. What, after all, are “equal conditions”? It hinted at a desire for abandonment – and as Carlos Tevez pointed out, when River players suffered the effects of a pepper spray attack in a Libertadores game at La Bombonera in 2015, Boca were disqualified – while offering wriggle room if Conmebol had been adamant the game had to be played.The announcement of the abandonment came around half an hour after the gates had been opened to admit fans to the stadium. The mood had been much more subdued on the approaches to the stadium than the previous day, with very little chanting and far less sense of excitement or expectation. There was still evidence of the violence that had broken out after the (first) scheduled kick-off, when fans had clashed with police, who fired tear gas and rubber bullets.Police had cordoned off the area where the worst of the trouble occurred and the security had been notably beefed up. When the announcement came, there were only a couple of thousand fans in the ground. They reacted with jeers and whistles and there was some obvious anger, but there was not the weight of numbers to make the protest in any sense effective.The strong possibility remains that the game will not be played at all, or that if it is, it will not be played in Buenos Aires. For Conbemol and Argentinian football, meanwhile, the inquest begins. How could what is, in terms of global exposure, probably the biggest club game in South American history, end like this?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a88e00a6ebde5849186bf22513b1b5eaa5fb7786/0_162_3913_2348/master/3913.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1c791722fc7a0f9b4b98ef974cdabe3","title":"match demanding dropped mesut ozil unai emery","story":"• Arsenal manager left German on bench at Bournemouth• Question marks over midfielder’s future at the EmiratesUnai Emery has fuelled suggestions that he maintains a difficult relationship with Mesut Özil after dropping the player for Arsenal’s 2-1 victory over Bournemouth and afterwards claiming he did so because he did not believe the player could cope with the physically demanding nature of coming up against Eddie Howe’s men.Özil was named among Arsenal’s substitutes here as Emery instead chose Alex Iwobi and Henrikh Mkhitaryan to play in inside creative roles behind Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in a 3-4-2-1 formation.Tiredness following the recent international break was not an issue given the 30-year-old retired from playing for Germany prior to the start of the season and it was noticeable how he did not even warm up during the second-half, where up until the 67th minute Arsenal found themselves level at 1-1.Asked about his decision to drop Özil, who had started each of Arsenal’s previous four Premier League games, Emery said: “We thought how we can do better in the match, a very demanding match with physicality and intensity.”Emery added that every player in his squad is important but resting Özil after a two-week break and with Arsenal’s next game being Thursday’s Europa League visit to Vorskla Poltava, when the manager is expected to rest a host of first-team players, is odd to say the least. The decision is also somewhat damning of Özil given Bournemouth are hardly the most rugged of opposition and will only reopen the debate about the playmaker’s long-term future under Arsène Wenger’s successor.Rumours of a rift between the pair first developed after Özil missed Arsenal’s 3-1 victory over West Ham in August. Emery claimed the player was ill but it was reported that his absence was down to a training ground row with the Spaniard.It will be intriguing to see if Özil is restored to Emery’s starting line-up for Sunday’s visit of Tottenham. Arsenal will at least go into that game buoyed by this win, one that extends their unbeaten run to 17 games and puts them just one point behind Chelsea in fourth.The visitors took the lead through Jefferson Lerma’s astonishing own goal on 30 minutes before being pegged back by Joshua King’s strike in first-half stoppage time. Aubameyang eventually got a winner for Arsenal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/054fad7aeeb4aad29f5dbc5f37182fb8865b79ab/0_101_3653_2192/master/3653.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93263d382d8c76b12931725a11c83876","title":"unai emery tough tactics bear fruit in victory over bournemouth","story":"This place, as Unai Emery might have it, is under new management. In perhaps the most illuminating pronouncement of his tenure so far, Arsenal’s head coach said last week that the gangster drama Peaky Blinders is enhancing his English skills. There was nothing especially brutal about their disposal of Bournemouth but it added to a growing body of work that suggests something has changed. When Arsenal were accused of having a soft underbelly in previous years, the cap invariably fitted: suddenly they are eking out results and, in the best tradition of Emery’s favoured study aid, even looking a little mean.For most who took their places at the Vitality Stadium, the reflex had been to sit back and enjoy whatever chaos unfolded. Arsenal had got themselves into all manner of pickles here in the previous two seasons, relying on a Lucas Pérez-inspired turnaround from 3-0 down in January 2017 before throwing away a winning position themselves 12 months later, losing 2-1 on an afternoon Petr Cech would rather forget. Against a chirpy Bournemouth, flavour of the month in the competition for best-of-the-rest, the potential for further scrapes appeared solid.Emery’s commitment to setting a fast tempo from the touchline led, during the first half, to an animated discussion with the fourth official about the dimensions of the technical area. It certainly did not match Emery’s specifications but his ability to transmit information was unaffected. “Hello! Hello! Hello!” he cried to Bernd Leno in tones more Basque than Brummie, arms windmilling, hoping the goalkeeper would aim a clearance out to Sead Kolasinac. Leno heard, and speared the ball out of play. At that point Arsenal had not really settled and Bournemouth, enjoying the space to either side of Emery’s new-look back three, could hope to enjoy themselves once again.Yet the entire tone of a curious first half, riddled with oddities major and minor, was one of things going awry. When Charlie Daniels and Ryan Fraser, lining up a Bournemouth free-kick in dangerous territory, contrived a lamentable fudge it seemed perfectly in keeping. Daniels backheeled the ball too far away from Fraser, who in any case was unprepared they were given a second go of things by Craig Pawson, much to Emery’s fury, but one felt the most worthwhile instruction to either set of players would simply be to slow down.Jefferson Lerma showed little appetite to do that when, tracking an invisible runner, he hared back into his own box and volleyed crisply past a bemused Asmir Begovic. Lerma is known for being a walking yellow card, and kept up appearances on that score later on, but this was an altogether more destructive contribution from a player who has, these frayed edges aside, made Bournemouth’s midfield considerably better.That was, in fact, as knockabout as things got. Josh King’s superbly-taken equaliser left questions as to the whereabouts of the left wing-back Kolasinac, who would make it into many all-star XIs if footballers were allowed only to run in straight lines, but Emery’s tactical tweak ultimately bore fruit. Kolasinac was once dubbed “a tank” by Theo Walcott and, in providing the ammunition for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s winner, showed his use in advanced areas with a second assist of the game. Arsenal were relatively comfortable thereafter, barring Lerma’s late brush with the upright, and Emery’s double fist-pump as he disappeared down the tunnel spoke of just how important it had been to grit this one out.Bournemouth will, presumably, tail off further after meetings with Manchester City and Liverpool in the next fortnight. They are a fine side although the level of excitement about their start to the season does not necessarily reflect well on a starkly stratified Premier League whose struggle for meaning below the leading pack is increasingly real.Emery, though, will be more interested in how Arsenal eventually held them at arm’s length this time. His gang – the one on the pitch, not the screen – look increasingly menacing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6085eeb4b9a4f762345535db41e1b90730dcb1a0/0_242_4513_2708/master/4513.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bea559c27a836c4dca654fc802aa1b1","title":"wolves v huddersfield premier league live","story":"Two goals from Aaron Mooy and a smothering of Wolves made it seven points from three matches and lifted Huddersfield to 14th Here’s the match report from Stuart James.

Neves can maybe make amends for his earlier foibles but then clatters it to the stands in the style of an inebriated Owen Farrell. 90+3 mins: Another corner, and Huddersfield hold it in the corner. Mooy tries a snap shot for his hat-trick but that is cleared.90 mins: There are three minutes to be added on, but the three points are heading to Huddersfield. A triple sub is made by David Wagner. Pritchard off for Mbenza, Billing off for Williams and Hogg goes off for Stankovic. They take their time over that. 89 mins: Traore gets to the byline, as he did for the video no-goal, and is clattered for his troubles. He has kept going since he came on. Can his colleagues say the same? 88 mins: Huddersfield still pushing on, with Smith and Hogg terrier-like and Mooy directing traffic. Mooy has shown Moutinho and Neves how to be a playmaker in the Premier League.86 mins: Neves is booked for a rash foul on Pritchard. The wunderkind has been poor today, and was highly culpable in that second goal. And did not control midfield as was expected. 85 mins: One talking point is the Jimenez header that didn’t cross the line. It looked in, the tech said no, but how reliable is the tech? Certain managers, perhaps one who lives in the Lowry Hotel, might question it. Let’s see if Nuno does. 84 mins: Lössl gets lucky when Jota’s shot skids in, and there is relief as he claims it at the second time of asking. 82 mins: There was talk that Wolves were the best team to ever come up from the Championship from some quarters, but it has not been borne out. They have excellent players but seem to lack the alleycats required to achieve the lofty ambitions. 80 mins: If anything, a Huddersfield goal has looked more likely than a Wolves goal. A review of the goal suggests that Neves flinched at Mooy’s free-kick Gibbs-White, to his left, did not look amused.79 mins: Another Huddersfield chance as the ball spills to Mooy, and his shot rebounds to Mounie, whose shooting boots were left somewhere in the Calderdale Valley, presumably.78 mins: Huddersfield fans sing “I Can’t Help Falling In Love With You.” This has been one of their best ever Premier League days so far. And a tactical coup for David Wagner.77 mins: Traore almost gets on the end of some uncharacteristic lax play from Huddersfield. They have excelled in clearing their lines today. Some good old-fashioned Yorkshire “get rid of it” values.75 mins: Wolves sub: Helder Costa is replaced by Diogo Jota.74 mins: There are suspicions over the wall and the goalkeeping but the credit has to go to the excellence of Mooy’s right peg. Huddersfield are on course for a fine, and deserved, win.A free-kick to Huddersfield on the left-hand side of the box, and Mooy pings it round the wall, with Patricio beaten.72 mins: A fine save from Patricio denies Pritchard after set-up play by Mooy and Billing. A warning for Wolves. 69 mins: Gibbs-White springs to life with a lovely ball to Jimenez, whose shot is again misdirected. He’s playing on the right, further wide than normal, and it is as if he can’t make the angular adjustment. 67 mins: Nuno is very angry and telling Traore to step it up. Time beginning to tick on the Wolves revival. Huddersfield clinging on, and looking to break the flow of the game with delays and niggles.65 mins: Huddersfield far less assured on the ball. Harried and hurried. Kongolo goes down and Jimenez forges on. He finds space for a shot but he does something that is neither a shot nor a cross. Shades of Andros Townsend v Manchester United yesterday, but worse. 62 mins: Doherty surges on from full-back but his cut-back is misread by Jimenez and Traore. Wolves really knocking on the door. 61 mins: Wolves have a disputed free-kick, and Neves will take it. But he cannot get it over the wall. Then a corner is forced. Wolves stepping this right up but their corner is cleared by Mounie. 59 mins: The official stats say the ball was 1.8cm from being a goal from Jimenez’s header, which is close. 58 mins: Billing’s chip to Mounie found the striker in a good position, but he is again a little lax. At least he gives Billing chance to get a shot in, which whizzes wide. 57 mins: The VR replay of how close that ball came to crossing the line shows it was about the width of a match from being a goal. You actually do not get closer to that than a goal. 56 mins: Close for Wolves! Traore gets to the byline, his ball loops to the back post, Jimenez’s header rattles off the bar and looks to crossed the line but Billing’s acrobatics get the ball clear.54 mins: Traore has been busy since he came on, which is a good sign for Wolves. He’s a great player to watch when he sets off on one of his runs. The final ball, though, is often not the best. 52 mins: Huddersfield clear the ball after Jimenez’s weaving run comes to an end. Pritchard looked to be fouled by Bennett but the referee waves away any claims. 50 mins: More Huddersfield territory, but Costa escapes on the counter before being felled. A free-kick chance for Neves, but somehow Wolves manage to play themselbes offside. Aren’t they supposed to be well coached?48 mins: Wolves need to step this up, then. And so far, have not looked much more efficient than before. 47 mins: Kári Tulinius emails: “keep hearing and reading that Wolves might challenge for European places this year, but every time I’ve seen them play this year they haven’t looked that special. Not the worst of the worst, but a team who’ll be lucky to reach 40 points. Mind you, 40 points is probably more than sufficient to stay up this year.”46 mins: We are back underway. What difference will that make? Early on, Schindler goes down heavily he has taken one to the ribs but will soldier on. Here comes a couple of much-needed changes for Wolves with two attacking substitutions. Morgan Gibbs-White on for Joao Moutinho, and Ivan Cavaleiro goes off for Adam Traore. The word is that the El Superclásico is off in Buenos Aires, so this is the big game of the day. Get your half-time reading.That was excellent from Huddersfield and atrocious from Wolves. It should be more than 1-0 to the visitors, which is the sole positive to take for those in old gold.45+2 mins: One last corner for Huddersfield. Again, Mooy finds Mounie, and Doherty clears off the line. Wolves at panic stations but get it clear, just about.45 mins: Three minutes added on in injury time. That’s enough time for some home fan rage against their players for giving the ball away. 44 mins: Mounie, whose confidence has been lifted by that headed chance, makes himself busy and forces a couple of mistakes. It does look, however, that Huddersfield want to hold what they have until half-time, but Mounie has a dig from long range. Patricio saves.42 mins: Some heavy pressing forces Wolves back and then Moutinho gives the ball away to Mooy, who he had not noticed was on his tail. That’s been the tale of the half sloppy from Wolves, energetic from Huddersfield.41 mins: David Wagner is asking his team to push for more. This could be a signature win for Huddersfield.39 mins: Poor kick from Patricio sets up another Huddersfield attack. Half-time cannot come too soon for Wolves, who are better in the second half. Twelve of their goals have come in the second half this season.37 mins: Wolves, again, are having to weather a storm. Billing’s long thrown forces another corner. Mooy plays this one back in a training ground move. The ball comes out to Kongolo for another chance on goal but again Patricio is correctly placed. 35 mins: Huddersfield force another corner. They take their time over it and Mooy’s kick is excellent. Mounie charges in, and beats Neves to the ball. The header is on goal but straight at Rui Patricio. 33 mins: Gasps from the home fans as another attack breaks down. On the sideline, Nuno is barking orders. The ball comes to Neves, a rarity so far, and he is asked to shoot by the supporters. He doesn’t. Ryan Bennett does, and his shot lands somewhere in the Solihull area. 32 mins: Wolves never able to settle into their preferred passing style. That owes much to Huddersfield’s hard work. It looks like they may have to rely on inidual skill to get back into this.

Kaku is a popular scientist. He has a knack for studying today’s trends in order to hypothesise what might come tomorrow – how we’ll live, where we’ll live, whether or not an almighty AI might soon rule over us. And he’s not the only one. Futurists have been conceptualising our potential fate for centuries, sometimes successfully. Perhaps, as we stumble through uncertain times, their work is more important now than ever. So what will the world look like in 2050? We asked Kaku and three other futurists to share their predictions.A theoretical physicist and futurist, Kaku is the author of several books of popular science, including the New York Times bestseller, The Future of the Mind: The Scientific Quest to Understand, Enhance, and Empower the Mind.By 2050 we’ll be able to send memories, emotions and feelings across the internet. Brain science will have exploded, and it will have revolutionised communication. Teenagers will love it. Instead of putting an emoticon at the end of every sentence, they’ll use an emotion: anger, happiness, excitement. This will replace entertainment movies will become obsolete. I’m talking about telepathy, really. We’ll still communicate the old-fashioned way, but communicating telepathically will reduce the obstacles between people. Our grandchildren will wonder, What is a keyboard? We will enter the age of the “brain net”.Medicine will develop exponentially, too. We will have cured certain forms of cancer, and we will have begun to treat the disease like the common cold. We’ll live with it. It will no longer be lethal. We won’t fear it like we used to. Technology will help in this respect. Smart toilets will perform liquid biopsies – which are already available – to detect cancer cells, genes and enzymes. We’ll catch tumours years or even decades before they form, when they’re just small colonies of several hundred cells circulating in the blood. Smart objects will measure our biometrics automatically. The iPhone can already calculate a pulse. In the future, our clothes will detect the beginnings of a heart attack, and advise us to seek treatment immediately.This results, naturally, in longevity. I don’t think we’ll be immortal by 2050, but we’ll be setting the foundations for immortality. We’re gradually discovering the genes that control the ageing process, and we’ll soon understand how to repair the biological damage inflicted on our bodies over the course of our lives. In this way, medicine will move past simply providing a cure, and will help move humanity closer to biological perfection. We will become gods. We’ll have the immortal body of Venus. The speed of Mercury. The power of the mind of Zeus.But what use is longevity without eternal youth? That’s where the idea of a human body shop comes in. We’ll grow organs to replace those that wear out. We can already use human cells to grow skin, cartilage, noses, ears, heart valves, bladders… In the future? We’ll grow the liver, the kidney, perhaps the pancreas. By 2050 I suspect we’ll be able to grow many of the vital organs of the body and, rather than allow the organs we’re born with to become old and decrepit, we’ll replace them. That’s all coming. And it doesn’t take much imagination to realise it.Astrophysicist and author deGrasse Tyson is the Frederick P Rose Director of the Hayden Planetarium at the Rose Center for Earth and Space in New York. His latest book is Accessory to War: The Unspoken Alliance Between Astrophysics and the Military.If you were to create a settlement on an another planet, here’s the problem. In the old days, when settlers landed in some new place, they could breathe the air. They could repair their ships with wood from trees. Fruit grew on plants. Basic life support existed. But it won’t for the new generation of settlers. You cannot breathe on Mars, so you will need to seed the soil, generate oxygen – terraform it. That’s not an inconceivable future path for us, but it is a level of geo-engineering we’ve yet to master. When you’ve terraformed a planet, OK, we can talk about moving there. But until that happens we’d be living in a habitat that’s simulating Earth. And what’s the point in doing that? Antarctica is balmier and wetter than Mars, and you don’t see developers clambering to build condos in Antarctica.By 2050, I can imagine Mars becoming a vacation site. Instead of going to the beach, people will spend money to go and hang out in space. I’d do that! But that’s a business model that has yet to be set up. There’s no infrastructure. No way to make food or fuel. How would people get back to home-base Earth?If humanity wanted to – if we had the motivation – we might be able to turn at least the near solar system into our backyard. It will be difficult. Elon Musk famously said: “How do you build a small fortune in space? Start with a big fortune.” But if we were to manage it, we’d have access to what are essentially unlimited resources. Asteroids are rich in various metallic and mineral ingredients – rare Earth elements – that are fundamental to modern civilisation: gold, silver, platinum, iridium, cadmium, osmium. Comets have unlimited supplies of water. The world’s first trillionaire will be the first person to exploit these resources. Imagine having the capacity to distribute those resources where they are most needed around the world? Something like a third of conflicts are based on the limited access to resources. If, by 2050, we had unlimited global access, would those wars still exist?This all points to the growing importance of space, particularly for commerce. The future value of space assets won’t be measured by the amount of hardware that’s orbiting the Earth, but by the amount of commerce that hardware enables. Think about Uber. Its entire business model is founded on the existence of GPS satellites. Or Tinder. Want to date someone nearby? You’re relying on GPS. Satellites generate hundreds of billions of dollars in commerce. That’s a kind of power governments might call it “soft power”. So by 2050 space will have become a hotly contested zone.If there is conflict in the future, a nation’s best move might be to take out its enemy’s space assets, bringing down its economy. But would you use space to wage war on Earth, rather than to mine its resources and grow the world economy? Wherever you have a healthy economy, people tend to live longer and be happier. For 2050, that’s a noble goal.A best-selling author and futurist, Popcorn is also the founder and CEO of BrainReserve, a future-focussed strategic consultancy established in 1974.Human doctors have a problem: they’re human. They make mistakes. They don’t show up. They get sick. So algorithms will replace them, providing patients with the function of a doctor 247. Artificial intelligence will inform us very early on in our lives what we are allergic to, what our sensitivities are, how much exercise we require, what our stress levels are.We’re already finding that AI psychologists are extremely effective. They’re able to measure a patient’s responses to questions. They understand which questions provoke stress. They measure a patient’s biometrics during sessions. Human therapists can’t do that. They can’t take all that information in.This might all have happened by 2030, let alone 2050. By that point, science fiction will have become just science. Everything will be implanted: the ability to dispense medicine (the “robo-release”), the ability to predict cancer, the ability to measure the function of our heart or lungs. Tiny chips will be implanted within our bodies at birth, around the same moment you cut the umbilical cord. We will store our medical records in our fingertips.We won’t be having babies naturally by that point. Pregnancy will have become outdated. People will grow babies in labs, or their living rooms, in what look like fish tanks. And gender will have become irrelevant.Race will become obsolete, too. I predicted in 1988 that everybody will be brown, eventually. But what won’t become obsolete, and what could become problematic, is intelligence: how smart you can become through the AI you can buy, how many drugs you can afford to micro-dose throughout the day, to make you sharper and more able.There will be many people who don’t have the money to access new kinds of medical enhancement. There will be the people with, and the people without – unless a social class develops that decides to save those without. That could happen. Hopefully.A global security futurist and an adjunct professor at Georgetown University, Washington DC, Zalman is the founder of the Strategic Narrative Institute, a futurist consultancy. Between 2014 and 2016 she was the CEO of the World Future Society.There’s a lovely phrase, attributed to the futurist Roy Amara, that goes like this: “We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.” With this in mind, let’s consider work. We’re already discussing what kinds of jobs will be affected by automation. We know that some of the losers will be those with white-collar qualifications whose work is relatively routine: accountants, much of the work of lawyers, some of the work of journalists. But by 2050 we’ll begin to see paradigmatic changes. We have all these assumptions about how work and the world is shifting. But the changes occurring now are too incipient for us to get our heads around. It’s not that automation will change work. It’s that work will change so drastically that we’ll need to give what we do an entirely different name.The winners will be those people in jobs we don’t even know about yet, at the intersection of technology and other fields. Data and criminal justice. Data and homewares. Data and medical services. Data and biotechnology. It will be an exciting time for philosophers and ethicists. We’ll quickly realise the need to understand how we treat, use, manage and live with artificial intelligence. We’ll need philosophers and ethicists to legislate ourselves into the future.If there is a significant displacement from automation, we’ll require a tweak in the social services system. We’ll send people back to school. We’ll find new ways for people to make money. There will be experiments in the universal basic income. Eventually, we’ll create new forms of work. We’re kind of an ingenious race that way.But the one thing that seems unlikely to change in the next 30 years is wealth inequality. This will reverberate across generations. Some of us will continue to become really rich some of us will continue to become very poor. Inequality won’t rise from automation alone. It will continue to develop from the kind of economic reward system we’ve already established: that money makes money. That will lead to a biological ide in society, too. There will be a class of people able to enhance not only their education, as people have been able to do for decades – you go to a private school, you get a better education – but their own bodies, through other kinds of augmentation. Genetic enhancement, let’s say. Biological augmentation and enhancements are coming – a tattoo that acts as a system that monitors the body, for example. That could be expensive, and not necessarily available to all. In the future, only some people will have access."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69bd13251b21f8a12a04f9e49537de1b3fffa857/0_828_3456_2074/master/3456.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cca9a37d9416c9f5cc868c9e916e0a0b","title":"james wong winter flowers scented fragrance camellia mimosa acacia","story":"As the days get darker, mimosa and camellia still deliver bursts of joy and colour in the gardenAs the days get ever shorter, it can feel harder and harder to get your horticultural fix. As a life-long plant obsessive who derives so much of his pleasure from seeing new leaves unfurl and flowers burst into bloom, growing up in tropical Singapore totally spoiled me. When I moved to the UK for university, where the growing season I had to work with suddenly shrank from 12 full months a year of peak development to as little as three months for some species, I desperately had to seek out species as horticultural coping strategies to keep me going. Here are some of my very favourite plants that offer flower and fragrance just when you need it most. Over the years, they have been my lifeline through the long, dark winter months.When the rest of the garden starts sliding into winter slumber, the incredibly architectural branches of Mahonia japonica burst forth with big bunches of yellow flowers from their tips. The haunting fragrance of orange blossom fills the air around them, giving you an instant flashback to summer warmth on the frostiest of mornings.For those in milder areas, the exotic ferny foliage of Acacia dealbata (mimosa) does a similar trick of cloaking itself in bright yellow, throwing up clouds of tiny fuzzy baubles, once a key ingredient in fancy French perfumes.Acacia nanodealbata is a dwarf form that will grow happily in a pot in even the smallest spaces. It’s the perfect plant to site by a doorway so that you enjoy the scent it has to offer, and the plant in turn enjoys the extra warmth the brickwork of the house has to offer. A people-plant win-win.We tend not to think about camellias as being scented, but there is a species that has a truly show-stopping perfume: Camellia lutchuensis. The original wild form can be tricky to track down but, fortunately, enterprising plant breeders have used it as a parent plant to create lots of wonderful cultivars that combine scent and colour. I love the delicate flowers of ‘Spring Mist’, whose lightly blushed pink flowers look like something off a painted silk kimono. They also have one of the longest seasons around, churning out flowers from winter to early spring.If you want something more blousy, ‘Fragrant Pink’ gives you masses of bright Barbie-pink double blooms with a fragrance just as understated. Finally, my favourite ‘Cinnamon Candy’ emits wafts of a spicy, Christmassy scent from the most elegant ivory white blooms that look like they could be made from fine porcelain.Pick one of each and you will get such a fragrance hit, along with the visual pleasure of sharp colours to brighten up these gloomy days, that you might not even mind the frosty nights to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd02961eeb01bfd1da77ed4617ee91dec010c532/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b36cc8a9d60f792fdf913af9d362a39","title":"what the woman earning 40k reveals about us eva wiseman","story":"The vitriolic response to women’s money diaries betrays ancient masculine insecuritiesLast week Grazia published an article headlined: “I Earn £40k And Live At Home, But I Still Need My Parents To Bail Me Out Each Month.” A cacophony of clicks ensued, I heard the rush from my desk, the orchestral percussion of a thousand sharpened fingers preparing to type their devastating response, the definitive smackdown of another young woman who doesn’t know she’s bloody born.The Money Diary has become a high-pitched document for our times, a column (the first and most reliably fascinating being on lifestyle site Refinery29 which claims to tackle “the last taboo”) where young women document their expenses over the course of a week, from bikini waxes to acai bowls, and the internet shuffles forward as one to judge them.For something that should be boring – we are doing little more than reading a stranger’s receipts – they are oddly mesmerising in the way they illuminate these anonymous lives, a whole autobiography told through the price an intern pays for a feta and avocado wrap, and confusion over the value of a line of coke.And for every insight they offer about the money diary’s subject, the commenters’ reactions give us 10 more about us, her readers – about our morals, our doubts, our violent reactions to the seemingly mundane, such as the purchase of an extra large latte or an extra small dog.Around 10,000 people upload a portrait and ask Google: “Am I ugly?” each month money diaries are the cash equivalent, a series of women presenting their credit card bills and asking: “Am I a bad person?” To which the regrettable answer, with few exceptions, is usually a noisy: “Oh God, Karen, yes.”Grazia’s offering was no different. “She must have a serious gambling problem,” said one commenter on Twitter. “Irresponsible” “I want to punch her in the throat” “Cocaine is too obvious a money drain… which makes me think she has a much more shameful vice, like buying hordes of creepy dolls she talks to” and “This is why people won’t talk about money…”And here is the thing. Here is the big, vulgar, sweating thing, holding money diaries up with calloused hands and the grunting weight of decades of anxiety. These lists of Uber rides and blow dries and dog food might appear to simply be another pedestal upon which women climb to have rocks thrown at them, often by their peers. Peers who, like them, were born to the lullaby that they could have it all, but grew up in a time when all opportunities for financial security had dissolved like sugar. But the real value of money diaries – and their real allure – is that they are unique in being the only place where women are allowed to talk about money.The money is not the problem – the internalised gender roles (and then, for progressive women, the inevitable guilt about her regressive values, oy) are the problem, and one that contributes both to the gender pay gap and to our shoddy relationship with cash.If money diaries can tell us anything, it’s that the internet, with all its fury and judgment, is not the best place to discuss how much you spend on a cappuccino. But their popularity exposes a real need to talk about money. We should be learning about investments at school, we should be talking about our incomes with our partners to avoid the paycheck standing for something bigger, or triggering ancient masculine insecurities, we should be talking about it at work, piercing that clingfilm that keeps colleagues separate.We should be literate enough in cash that to disclose your salary needn’t feel like exposing your self-worth. Perhaps if talking about money wasn’t such a taboo, the £40k Grazia writer wouldn’t still be asking her parents for pocket money. And, yeah, I’m going to need her receipts.I did it.

Could the answer be to put ourselves out there more? We challenged standup Tessa Coates to find outWhen asked if I’d take on a week of challenges designed to help me open up my life to others, I saw “throw a dinner party” on the list of activities and said yes without reading the fine print. That, friends, is how I found myself running with a gang of overly enthusiastic joggers to an allotment on a dark Monday night, weeding a vegetable patch, and then running back.I wanted to learn something about myself during my week of sharing challenges. Reader, I learned that, while I am too often a cynical husk of a woman, I can be rehabilitated. And if I can, you can.Challenge one was at the Castle Canteen at the Crossway Christian Centre in Elephant and Castle, where volunteers make a free lunch once a week for anyone who wants it, from donated surplus food. Unquestionably a wonderful project, I was absolutely dreading it my catering experience starts and ends at being told off for eating the canapés and being sent home for backchat, while my volunteering experience starts and ends at being told off for not listening during the safety talk – and then being sent home for backchat. I had a heavy heart.To my delight, the Castle Canteen is run by a brilliant lady named Emily, who’s a professional chef. Nobody sent me home and everyone said I did a good job chopping the mange tout. When our lunch guests started to file in, my unsociable side wanted to stay at my chopping board. If I wasn’t there as part of a challenge, I might well have. But I forced myself to go out and find a seat, wondering how to find common ground.“Hello lovely lady, you’re new, what’s your name?” was the immediate greeting. A fantastic woman called Stella had me laughing in minutes, introducing me to a teacher, a musician and an ex-jockey. Conversation flowed, everybody had a story. It pulled at my heartstrings to see people light up with someone to talk to.That evening, I met a group of 30, all running with the social fitness group GoodGym, to help out with a gardening project. You meet for a run, do half an hour’s work, and then run back. The cynic in me was wearing away, fast. Who was I to make sassy comments when there are people out there trying to do something genuinely good?Next, I put a note under my neighbours’ door asking if they’d like to come round for some wine. Not the ones downstairs – we’d had an altercation over a plant pot 18 months ago and no one’s gotten over it – but the ones above. I explained the challenge, which made things less awkward, and next minute they were all round, new baby in tow. Suddenly we’re all laughing at the kitchen table, as if we lived in some kind of Mediterranean utopia.The dinner party, to which I was supposed to invite people from different parts of my life, made me very anxious. I rarely mix friends because I am not a natural hostess, and get so nervous that people won’t have a nice time that I inevitably ensure they don’t. But I swallowed down my whirlwind of nerves, invited friends who’d never met each other, gave them a glass of wine, and listened to them talking while I tried not to burn myself in the kitchen. “Why have we never met before?” they kept shouting at me. Honestly, I don’t know.I’ve realised that it’s easier to roll your eyes at the back than it is to get involved, but not nearly as fun.

As a family, we’d eat around a little table in a room that I now cannot stand up in, heated by a peat-fired Rayburn and served next door by a composting toilet.My parents were often concerned for my nutrition, and did exceptionally considering their busy working lives. They’d manage to keep the cupboards stocked and cook warming classics from scratch – mince, steak pie, myriad brownish stews. They’d be served with potatoes, often from the garden, and at least one floppy green vegetable.My grandmother lived next door, and as well as secretly plying me with confectionery, from time to time she’d put on a roast. I still have a soft spot for vivid-green broccoli that Gran would boil with bicarbonate of soda until disintegration. Good for soaking up gravy, as well as for dentures.Since leaving the howling winds and isolation of the north for a story of my own, life still revolves around food. It has the amazing capacity to bring people together. Until very recently I was a junior doctor, and I’d unashamedly butter up my hospital colleagues with pastry. The theatre coffee room was always alight with talk of Bake Off and Masterchef, and filled with homemade cakes. It was the pressure from my wife, friends and colleagues who enjoyed my food that forced me into applying to Bake Off. We actually all watched it together, but they felt that it should be me who applied.Since Bake Off, there’s been a significant level of expectation on me when it comes to pudding. I sometimes feel like my wife and I compete in a dinner party league, in which we take turns to host friends in a disingenuous performance of informality.Not that I’d ever reveal the planning that goes into our apparently effortless cooking. But our extensive overthinking hides true incompetence. The construction of a wood-fired pizza oven in the garden over the course of a weekend was one such example. There was the obsession over the type of bricks and granite to use and the clay, which cracked and mildly exploded as soon as I lit the expensive seasoned wood I’d sourced and stacked inside. The result was, at least, only mildly ash-covered pizza.The gathering to eat transcends food, and the drink. I’ll admit that I remember flavours and smells better than I remember sounds or words or even people, but better than all is a feeling of being at ease and in the company of people you like. Following the peak of the pudding, the wine continues to flow. Colleagues and associates leave as new friends and, maybe, with a scrawled recipe or two. Scrunched in a pocket and tossed with receipts, it isn’t the recipe that matters.Makes enough to serve four very hungry Scottish peopleSalted or unsalted butter, for greasingFresh rhubarb, 600g Caster sugar, 150g1 bramley appleDried breadcrumbs, 50gFor the spongeSalted butter, 50gCaster sugar, 50g1 egg, mediumSelf-raising flour, 150g Baking powder, ½ tsp Milk, to loosenTinned custard, to serveI vividly remember standing on a stool to watch as Gran made perfect pastry with her worn hands.Baking was the intergenerational bond that we had between us, and those hours spent in her kitchen dusted in flour are still the memories that define my childhood. This charlotte recipe was one that Gran made to use up any leftovers – and the version I’ve given you here is foolproof baking.Her version wasn’t traditional – we didn’t use sliced bread to line the base and sides. We combined a simple sponge with stewed fruit and it was heaven – especially when warm. This version came about when there was too much pie filling (in retrospect, there’s no such thing as too much pie filling), or we’d overdone it on the sponge mix. It was easy to pick and stew some rhubarb, stick it in a dish and top with the leftover sponge.Gran was a big fan of stewing the rhubarb to oblivion, but this both adds an extra step and loads of washing up. I prefer slicing it thinly, and building it up layer by layer, sprinkling generously with sugar.Start by preheating your oven to 180C160C fangas mark 4. Use an ovenproof dish that isn’t going to leak. Those trendy blue and white ones are perfect. Give your dish a rub with loads of butter, all the way up the sides.Prepare your rhubarb – get rid of any leaves and the white bits towards the base of the stalk. Slice rather thinly – less than a centimetre, anyway. This helps them break down without stewing, and helps in the layering with the sugar. You can also peel and core your bramley apple, before slicing it thinly, too.\u0026nbspCover your greased dish with a layer of apple, first of all, to help absorb some of the moisture lost by the rhubarb. Sprinkle this with a thin coating of sugar, then layer up with rhubarb. Cover with more sugar, and then continue to layer until you’ve no fruit left. Finally, coat with a thin topping of breadcrumbs: this grabs any remaining moisture to stop the sponge going soggy. Set this fruity construction aside.Now, make the sponge. Into a mixing bowl, place your butter. If it isn’t already really soft, stick it in the microwave until it’s just-about-melted-but-not-quite. If you’re snobbish enough not to own a\u0026nbspmicrowave, stick the bowl of butter over a bowl of hot-not-boiling water.Once the butter is very soft, add in your sugar and give them a quick stir together with a wooden spoon. Don’t bother creaming them. Once combined, add in your egg and give the mix a beat until it’s smooth. Add in your flour (no need to sieve) and baking powder, and give the whole thing a gentle mix until there are no lumps visible. You should have a fairly gorgeous, smooth mix that ribbons as your spoon glides through it – if not, splash in a tablespoon or two of milk to loosen.Scoop the mix on top of your prepared rhubarb and carefully smooth it out with the back of your spoon. Once nearly at the edge all the way around, stick the whole thing in the oven and bake for about 30-35 minutes, or until the sponge is a deep golden brown and you can see signs of bubbling rhubarb escaping around the sides. Don’t stick a skewer in, but check the sponge’s doneness by pressing lightly with a finger. It should bounce back at you. If you leave a ot, give it another 5 minutes. It won’t be any worse for it.Best paired with …With its crisp, fresh flavours, white fruit aromas and delicate stream of bubbles, a glass of perfectly chilled Cava Brut Reserva makes an ideal accompaniment to the sharply-sweet flavours of rhubarb charlotte.Made for sharingSharing is in the vines at Campo Viejo.

But with print advertising revenues in decline and the majority of new digital advertising spend going by tech companies, we also need supporters, like you, who believe in the value of independent, investigative journalism. Your support is critical for the long-term sustainability of the .Being supported by readers means that we must focus on the stories that are most meaningful to society: serious reporting that takes time and effort, carefully uncovers the facts, holds the powerful to account, and interrogates ideas and arguments – journalism that speaks to the urgency of the moment, but lasts for more than a day.In the last few years we have experienced a dramatic undermining of the business model for serious journalism, as well as a series of political and social shocks, from the EU referendum result to the election of Donald Trump, and what many believe is an unprecedented level of disruption to our planet, our nation states, our communities, ourselves.The support of our readers has enabled us to pursue quality, investigative journalism which has resulted in huge global scoops such as the Cambridge Analytica and Facebook scandal – uncovered by Carole Cadwalladr, who writes for our sister paper the Observer – and about the use of people’s data in political campaigns.

I was gutted to stop working alongside my amazing job-share, Heather Stewart, but excited to find myself back at our headquarters in King’s Cross.The new team was placed on a bank of desks on the second floor, close to the Observer newsroom, where colleagues I’d worked with for eight years before leaving for the parliamentary lobby in 2009 are still beavering away. On our other side are (usefully!) the lawyers and the sports desk, followed by global development writers, and a strengthened environment team.Then – just two minutes around the corner – is the newsdesk, where the volume rises as editors gather around desks to make quick, collective decisions on rolling stories.Given our aim is to showcase  and Observer journalism by telling its stories in a fresh and engaging way, sitting in the middle of two newsrooms feels like the perfect location. Meanwhile, we can turn to the reporting teams in the US and Australia, foreign correspondents in Europe, Africa and Asia and some of the best opinion writers in the world.As for the podcast itself, our central aim is to provide listeners with 20 minutes every day that never scrimps on storytelling but is anchored in the news agenda.To achieve that, the  has built a team that feels unique: because it brings together radio documentary makers with news junkies like me. That mix of skills and ideas has lent itself to an incredibly creative team in which everyone is learning a huge amount.And I’ve been really pleased with the pieces that combination of strengths has resulted in already – focusing on interesting news ideas, but telling them in a narrative, audio-rich way that we hope to develop over time. The first few episodes have been well received and have already given us good ideas on what works well.The most exciting thing has been quickly realising the scale of the talent we have to draw on here at the . Having covered politics for many years, I already knew there were excellent reporters in domestic policy areas such as the ’s Patrick Butler, an expert on universal credit, and – of course – Heather and her team in Westminster, with whom we have covered the fast-moving story of Brexit. However, I had not worked with foreign correspondents such as Tom Phillips and Bethan McKernan, whose takes on the election of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil and the war in Yemen combined excellent analysis with powerful and emotional stories from the ground.The format has also allowed us to be experimental, whether that means interviews with external figures such as the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, or spending a day racing around Westminster to give a behind-the-scenes feel on a huge day for news.My co-presenter, India Rakusen, has done powerful episodes: one on poverty in Britain and another on the legacy of the Iraq war, for which Peter Beaumont was able to record for the podcast on the ground.The fact that not many others are producing similar content in the UK means that Today in Focus is inevitably a work in progress in every respect, from the subjects we choose and people we interview to the workflow we follow to get the product completed each day.The overall hope is to bring  stories, told by its reporters alongside their writing, to a wider, younger and more erse audience. And our position, at the centre of a values-based organisation whose global voice has been amplified in the face of political shocks such as the elections of Donald Trump and Brexit, make that something I believe we can achieve.Being based in the  means we can be more credible than many of the websites cheerleading for their favoured politicians, but far more spiky than the BBC.

Then there is an opinion section, where we will hear from  and Observer regulars as well as other voices from outside the building.For me, it’s a bit of a dream job, isn’t it? I get to sit in a studio day after day, discussing really interesting topics with the best journalists in the world, and working alongside some of the best young producers in the country to find new ways to present them. So far, in pilots and for real episodes, I’ve been discussing everything you can imagine, from Trump to Theresa May, the refugee crisis to Brexit, plastics to cocaine.And I’ve already experienced how differently you get to engage with your audience through a podcast. Along with Heather, I’ve been presenting Politics Weekly for the past two years, and I’ve always loved hearing from listeners who say they feel closer to my reporting when presented in that way.Today in Focus is going to be a bit experimental as we try things out with format, style and tone. In time, we will find the voice that we believe works best for us and as a platform for the .

The cost would have been a prohibitive £12,000, so she signed a deal to lease part of her roof to a solar power company, which would fit the panels for free. It would pocket the newly introduced feed-in tariffs (FITs) – subsidies paid by the government for the electricity generated. She, meanwhile, would have lower energy bills. At the end of the 25 years, the panels and the tariffs would be hers.It seemed a win-win situation until recently, when she needed to sell the house. Her buyer’s mortgage application was refused because of the lease agreement, which had effectively signed over a large part of the roof to the solar company.“A clause in the lease allowed us to buy out the panels for a fee to compensate the company for the loss of their FITs,” she says. “We were prepared to do it to be able to sell our house and move on with our lives, but the company had passed the management of the panels on to an agent, who seemed reluctant to let us proceed.”Eventually, after the Observer intervened, Griffiths was allowed to buy the panels for £20,500, an uncosted sum that she was told was non-negotiable. Not only was this nearly double the price she’d have paid to install the system herself, but she had also missed out on nearly eight years of FITs worth, around £7,300. All in all, the “free” system has left her around £16,000 out of pocket.The government introduced the generous incentives in 2010. The FITs, funded by a levy on all energy bills, have encouraged 800,000 households to go solar, but they have also spawned a multitude of startups that have exploited homeowners.Many are discovering the high price of their “free” deal as they try to sell. The 25-year leases apply to the property regardless of who owns it, and they have to find a buyer willing to take on the remaining years. And even if a buyer is happy, mortgage lenders may not be. The deal is treated as a leasehold, and contracts skewed in favour of the company are deemed risky by banks and building societies.Claire Hunt discovered that her elderly father had signed up to a leased solar installation when his roof began leaking. He had been talked into the 25-year contract in 2011, when FITs were at their peak, and the company has since ceased trading.“We were directed to another company which has apparently taken over the contract, but we’ve been unable to engage with them by phone or in writing,” says Hunt. “It is only because of the leak that I have finally had sight of the contract and I am devastated to find there isn’t even a buyout clause to end it. We are therefore arranging to remove the solar panels ourselves and will put them back when completed. A very expensive fix.”Fiona Baker is similarly trapped after agreeing to leased solar panels in 2010. “I am retired with MS and myotonic dystrophy, and need to sell my house, but the buyer won’t go ahead unless I have the panels removed,” she says. “This is apparently not possible until the lease expires at the end of the 25 years.”Meanwhile, Simon Norris is unable to remortgage because the firm that installed his leased panels appears to have breached building regulations. “The lender wanted a structural survey, which concluded that the roof should have been reinforced before the panels were fitted,” he says.Most lenders will agree a loan on a property with leased solar panels provided the contract meets certain conditions, one of them being that the installing company be accredited, the installation be approved and insured, and panels removable without penalties for missed FIT payments. Crucially, a lender’s permission needs to be obtained if an existing borrower decides to install leased panels.In the race to profit from FITs, many companies ignored these conditions. They also did not inform customers of the full value of subsidies they would be entitled to if they bought the panels outright or the implications for current or future mortgages as required by the Renewable Energy Consumer Code (RECC).Since most of the original companies have ceased trading, it can be difficult for sellers and buyers to find out who owns their panels. Jim Cowan recently bought his house without receiving the contract for the leased panels. He can’t find out who owns them since the installing company no longer exists and may find himself unable to remortgage or sell. Householders in this predicament have to submit a subject access request to energy regulator Ofgem’s FIT register team and provide proof that they are the property owners.Government subsidies on solar panels will cease at the end of next March. Miss the deadline and it would take a working household up to 70 years instead of the current 20 to recoup the average £6,500 cost.

Kremer has tirelessly championed the works of the Polish-born Soviet composer, and he was the presiding eminence at a weekend devoted to Weinberg’s music, in which the highlight was the first British performance of his last completed symphony, the 21st. The CBSO combined forces with Kremer’s own chamber orchestra Kremerata Baltica for the premiere, which was conducted by Mirga Gražinytė-Tyla, who followed it with the final symphony by Weinberg’s close friend and mentor Shostakovich, his 15th, sounding as elusive and enigmatic as ever in this finely sculpted performance.Completed in 1991, five years before his death, Weinberg’s 21st Symphony is dedicated to the victims of the Warsaw ghetto, and carries the subtitle “Kaddish”. It is not a setting of the Jewish prayer for the dead, but a 55-minute, single-movement elegy in six sections, studded with quotations from Weinberg’s own music and that of other composers. Its language recalls the expressionist Shostakovich of the 1930s. The big opening Largo is threaded through with lamenting violin solos (played here by Kremer) derived from one of Mahler’s Knaben Wunderhorn songs, and interrupted suddenly by a piano quoting the opening melody of Chopin’s G minor Ballade, which becomes a symbol of the suffering of the Polish nation.As Gražinytė-Tyla’s superbly prepared performance so vividly demonstrated, it is a work of enormous power, by turns desolate, anguished and angry. The keening emotions only find consolation in the closing pages, when wordless treble and soprano voices (Freddie Jamison and Maria Makeeva here) call to each other across the orchestra, bringing a touch of humanity to a work that remembers a world without any."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/325491e9700186b21ad16491df9cc186728f7722/0_38_5702_3421/master/5702.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d13b47df2a2d42abbd46da0998039a32","title":"phronesis supersilent review queen elizabeth hall","story":"Queen Elizabeth Hall, LondonUK-based piano trio Phronesis had some effervescent improv to offer, though the ferocious noise made by Norwegian trio Supersilent had already driven some audience members awayTwo creative but very different European trios shared Friday’s London jazz festival double-bill. The UK-based Phronesis are expert at balancing the nuanced intimacies of acoustic piano-trio jazz and rock’s percussion-driven drama, while the Norwegian electronicists Supersilent prefer improvised sound collages and raw noise. They also like turning their deliberations up to 11, as was demonstrated by a few fleeing punters with fingers in their ears, so it was a night of striking contrasts.Phronesis mostly played music from their recent We Are All album – a more rhythm-teasing, less melodically lyrical venture than formerly for them, but teeming with fast-moving improv. It is dedicated to the idea that the squabbling human race might be saved from itself – and the planet with it – if it were to cultivate the empathy that improvising musicians necessarily have – but this weighty agenda never subdued the band’s usual effervescence.Jasper Høiby’s muscular double-bass intro turned into the implacable hook for Breathless, which pianist Ivo Neame mirrored, queried in a countermelody, and then accelerated into skimming improvisation reminiscent, as his playing often is, of the late John Taylor. The remarkable drummer Anton Eger began with a metallic tingle of brushwork, then unleashed his perpetual-motion race around the kit, establishing an ever-shifting rhythmic backdrop rather than a groove. A rising piano figure over deep-humming bowed bass sounds introduced The Edge, which accelerated into a fast and percussive three-way conversation. Matrix for DA was a jittery, pattern-swapping rhythm-game, Phraternal (from 2014’s Life to Everything) the graceful opposite. Phronesis’s 10-year-old body of work continues impressively to grow. The gig’s first half belonged to Supersilent, with its original lineup of trumpeter Arve Henriksen, keys-player Ståle Storløkken and electronicist Helge Sten (AKA Deathprod). Their most ferocious electronic onslaughts of timpani-like thundering and aero-engine roars saw off some listeners, but the sonic variety was nonetheless considerable – from Henriksen’s trumpet blend of vaporous sighs and silvery jazz-phrased cascades and his mysterious, boy soprano vocals, to Storløkken’s Fender Rhodes-like underpinnings, and Sten’s percussion-mimicking soundscapes.• The EFG London jazz festival ends on 25 November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4526809d4cd204c1409d72763f3afff4cd8cd64f/0_126_1928_1157/master/1928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b38aa6d30a44020369273533eeeb82d","title":"why is steve bannon in europe today in focus podcast","story":"Donald Trump’s former strategist has been touring the continent and attempting to sign parties up to his pan-European populist project.

Many more frontbenchers are poised to support a second referendum on Britain’s exit terms if May’s draft deal is defeated in the Commons.It has now emerged that some members are preparing to demand a special party conference. A motion, seen by the Observer, is being circulated among constituency parties and Labour’s affiliated groups. It says that “the UK is facing a national crisis and the future of our country is at stake”.The only item on the meeting’s agenda would be the motion: “This conference believes that the citizens of the UK must have the final say through a people’s vote on the deal proposed by the government for leaving the European Union, with an option to remain in the EU on the ballot paper.“This conference calls on all members and our elected representatives to campaign for a people’s vote with urgency and vigour.”While the grassroots back Corbyn’s leadership, the membership is also heavily in favour of a new vote. Those interested in a special conference want to try to stop it being seen as an attempt to undermine Corbyn, by setting out clearly that it would be called only to endorse another referendum.The last special conference was held under Ed Miliband in 2014 to approve changes in the party’s leadership election rules. Such an event can be held at just 10 days’ notice. All delegates at this year’s Liverpool conference would have the right to attend.Those delegates overwhelmingly backed a policy that ensured a second vote remained an option should it prove impossible to secure a general election. Labour policy is to fight for an election before other options, such as a new poll, are supported. The party could secure an election should it gain a majority in the Commons for a vote of no confidence in the government. That still seems unlikely, although support for May is waning among the Democratic Unionist party, which is threatening to pull the plug on its support for her minority government.Disagreements within Labour are as bitter as ever, with some MPs accusing shadow cabinet members of being bigger supporters of Brexit than Tory Brexiters. However, the party leadership believes Labour must be seen to respect the referendum result.“In the parliamentary party, there’s a group who want a second referendum now, but there is another group – including frontbenchers – who think they can only get behind that publicly after May’s deal has collapsed,” said one shadow minister. “That group is substantial. They can’t shout for it now, but they can once May’s deal has been voted down by parliament. No proposal can command support, so it should go back to the people.”Christina Rees, the shadow Welsh secretary, told a local party meeting last week: “Part of me hopes we never come out, but that’s just a personal issue.” But she added that she accepted the referendum result and defended the party’s current stance.Many Labour MPs are looking for signs of a change of heart by Corbyn. Many were impressed by his performance in the Commons last week, when he dismissed May’s deal as the “blindfold Brexit we all feared”.Others, however, were disheartened by an interview in which he said he did not know how he would vote if there were a second referendum because he did not know what options would be on offer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d733bc455228c976f4d4d4dae6a65e3e25ad136a/0_71_4667_2800/master/4667.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a06d55b5d02021675a34ad15ede6a2e2","title":"denial and bargaining as theresa may grieves her brexit dreams","story":"It was press conference as tragedy as the PM clung to her draft and her delusionsMore in sorrow than in anger. There were no celebrations, nor even recriminations, as Donald Tusk, Jean-Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier gave their joint press conference at the end of the EU council meeting in Brussels that had signed off the withdrawal agreement and the draft agreement on the future trading relationship. No great sense of history being made. Just an air of resigned melancholy. That which had been needed to be done had been done. There were no winners. It was a deal that left everyone diminished.“We will remain friends till the end of days,” said Tusk. “And one day longer.” But not such close friends as we had once been. Not even friends with benefits. Juncker did see one upside to the whole negotiating process: it had brought the remaining 27 countries together. The EU was more united than before, and would be standing by Spain. Bye bye, Gibraltar.Now it was up to the UK parliament to see if it wanted to accept it, Barnier observed. Frankly, the EU had already wasted enough headspace on the UK’s existential crisis and it wasn’t going to take up more of its time trying to second-guess the outcome. As far as he was concerned, that was it. Given Theresa May’s self-imposed red lines, the deal on the table was the only one on offer.More in denial than in sorrow. At her own press conference half an hour later, the British prime minister refused to admit she was sad the UK was leaving the EU. There again, she hardly looked ecstatic at the outcome either. Rather, she appeared broken. A hunched, physically diminished figure peering out over the lectern, looking – as she so often does these days – as if she wished she was somewhere else entirely. Preferably curled up under the duvet, watching old episodes of NCIS on her laptop.Where the EU has moved on to bargaining and depression – the third and fourth stages of grief – May is stuck in the first. Denial. She cannot yet bring herself to admit that her deal is dead in the water. Unloved by everybody. Herself included. There have been no German car manufacturers rushing to her rescue, to thank her for maintaining their access to the UK market. Her dream of a good Brexit deal is dead on arrival.“What the British people want,” the prime minister said time and again, on each occasion mistaking what she herself wanted for what the British people wanted. It was she who was fed up with the whole Brexit process and wanted the whole thing over. It was she who believed it was in the national interest, when everyone could see it was actually only in hers. It was she who wanted to believe in a deal that was so obviously bad for the country, that delivered so little of what had been originally promised. A Brexit deal whose only saving grace was that it would leave everyone marginally better off than leaving the EU with no deal at all.This was press conference as tragedy. A humiliation that was all the more painful for being obvious to everyone but May, who clung desperately to the hope that somehow her “people’s letter” might head off an inevitable defeat in parliament. That, even if anyone bothered to read her delusional fantasies, they would mistake them for coherent thought and beg their MPs to accept a deal they didn’t want. That the collective unconscious would be in favour of self-harm.If MPs reject the deal, there are seven possible paths the country could go down next.May brings it back to MPsPerhaps with minor tweaks after a dash to Brussels. ​MPs knuckle under and vote it through.May resigns immediatelyIt is\u0026nbsphard to imagine her surviving for long.

Amber Rudd has said she believes parliament would stop a no deal, but it is not clear how it would do so.Come the questions from the media, there were no straight answers. There seldom are. The denial was still too great. May’s eyes deadened and her responses became ever more staccato and evasive. As if her circuit board had been mainlined with Valium. A second-rate Ayn Rand. She wasn’t going to think about what would happen if her deal was voted down because she was focused on getting her deal through parliament. She wanted to counsel against the negativity towards a deal about which she herself clearly felt so negative. The power of positive thinking. The triumph of the will, the triumph of the impossible. Yet in ruling nothing in, she was ruling nothing out. All options were still on the table.And this was all supposed to have been the easy bit. It had taken the best part of two years to reach a withdrawal agreement that no one liked and the vultures would now begin to circle round the future trade arrangements. Spain already had its eyes on Gibraltar and France had its on UK fishing rights. And those were just the easy pickings.After 10 minutes or so, May scuttled off. This was meant to be a landmark day in Britain’s history. A day when the UK had asserted its independence. An occasion to raise a toast to Blighty. So why did it feel like an anticlimax? Why was no one celebrating? Why did she feel so utterly alone? So useless. Grief could do strange things to a person.

I can’t imagine that the desire of Theresa May or her supporters is to remain for the long term in a customs union, but to define a proper future relationship which resolves this problem.”He added: “We will concentrate our efforts in order to obtain access to the British waters before the end of the transition period. And of course all of our fishermen will be protected.” Earlier in the day, at a special Brexit summit in Brussels, the leaders of the 27 member states unanimously backed the terms of the voluminous draft withdrawal treaty, covering citizens’ rights, the £39bn orce bill and the solution for the Irish border, along with a 26-page political declaration setting out the basis of the future relationship.The European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker congratulated the member states on maintaining their unity during the 18 months of talks despite “pressure from the UK”, but his focus during an end-of-summit press conference was on sending a message to the UK parliament.Juncker warned British MPs planning to send May back to Brussels by voting down her Brexit deal that it would take the EU just “seconds” to crush their hopes.In an uncompromising and direct message to Westminster, the commission president claimed the bloc had made its final offer.“I am totally convinced that this is the only deal possible,” Juncker said. “Those who think that by rejecting the deal that they would have a better deal will be disappointed in the first seconds after the rejection of this deal.”“I am inviting those who have to ratify this deal in the House of Commons to take this into consideration: this is the best deal possible for Britain, this is the best deal possible for Europe,” he added. “This is the only deal possible – the only deal possible.”If MPs reject the deal, there are seven possible paths the country could go down next.May brings it back to MPsPerhaps with minor tweaks after a dash to Brussels. ​MPs knuckle under and vote it through.May resigns immediatelyIt is\u0026nbsphard to imagine her surviving for long.

Amber Rudd has said she believes parliament would stop a no deal, but it is not clear how it would do so.The European council president, Donald Tusk, conceded that ratification of the deal in the UK parliament would be “difficult”.Such is the level of concern that a senior EU official said a number of leaders had wished May “good luck” during the hour-long meeting with the British prime minister.It is understood that some in the room had also sought to discuss how the EU would respond to May’s deal being rejected, but that it had not been encouraged. “After this long, long process I really can’t see how we could ever go there,” the official said.The chancellor of Austria, Sebastian Kurz, said: “It is a take-it-or-leave-it situation and the British negotiators know this and hopefully also the British delegates and now it is up to them to make a decision,” he said.Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, said leaders had made a “conscious decision” not to discuss an alternative to the deal, adding it was a case of “this deal or no deal”. “We don’t want to create the false impression to the UK that a better deal can be negotiated,” he said. “It can’t.”Macron and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, offered more nuanced responses when asked what the EU would do should the British parliament vote the deal down. Merkel said it was “very difficult” to respond to “speculations”.“If that were the case it would first of all be for Great Britain to make proposals, but we should be prepared for any situation,” Macron said, referring to France’s “no deal” draft legislation.Asked if there was any ergence in views within the EU, an official said Juncker’s comments had been a “very realistic assessment that after this tortuous and long negotiation that what is on the table is the only possible deal given the positions of the UK”, in a possible indication that only a major shift in the British government’s red lines could offer hope of further negotiations.On endorsing the deal, the EU had issued a statement committing to build “as close as possible a partnership” with the UK after Brexit, while warning that they would be “permanently seized” in future negotiations by the principle that countries outside the bloc cannot enjoy the same rights as those within.Brussels has rejected proposals thrashed out this summer at Chequers, the prime minister’s country retreat, to achieve “frictionless trade” in goods after Brexit.Should the withdrawal agreement be ratified in Westminster and the European parliament, it is agreed that the UK will stay in the single market and customs union, without representation in any decision-making institutions, for a 21-month transition period following withdrawal on 29 March 2019.An extension of that period of “up to one or two years” is foreseen should the negotiations over the future relationship not be completed by the end of 2020.EU officials said they believed the meaningful vote on the deal would be on 10 or 11 December, just before the next scheduled meeting of EU leaders in Brussels.The agreement had appeared at risk in the days leading up to the summit, when Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, threatened to withhold support unless Britain conceded that the British overseas territory of Gibraltar, over which Spain has a long-running territorial claim, would be covered by a future trade deal only with Madrid’s consent.The British ambassador to the EU, Sir Tim Barrow, gave that commitment in a letter on Saturday afternoon, prompting outrage across the political spectrum by what was described as a “betrayal” of Gibraltar.On Sunday, Sánchez, who has vowed to open talks on joint sovereignty of the disputed territory, described the concession as “a very significant political achievement”.“It places us in a position of strength in a central theme,” he said. “The idea of the government of Spain is to solve once and for all a conflict that has existed for more than 300 years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99823bce2e93251c8256fc89a52ec77cb11596c5/0_542_1712_1026/master/1712.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9aa8e48dfd811144b4e6637cf0388913","title":"labour plays waiting game over second brexit referendum corbyn","story":"Leadership wants to keep options open despite growing calls to back ‘people’s vote’Labour’s leadership is determined to hold out against backing a second referendum on Brexit unless all other options have been exhausted, despite growing calls for the party to tack towards remain, according to senior party sources.Jeremy Corbyn’s close allies are acutely conscious they may have to make momentous decisions at high speed if Theresa May’s deal is rejected by MPs in the meaningful vote expected to be held early next month: a scenario that looks increasingly likely.The prime minister would have to return to parliament within 21 days and set out how she intends to proceed.Labour sources say they would be likely to wait and see what she proposed before tabling a vote of no-confidence, in the hope of triggering a general election. “We’ll only get one shot at this,” one party strategist said.If the bid to trigger an election fails, “all options are on the table”, according to the motion hammered out over hours at the party’s conference in Liverpool in September.If MPs reject the deal, there are seven possible paths the country could go down next.May brings it back to MPsPerhaps with minor tweaks after a dash to Brussels. ​MPs knuckle under and vote it through.May resigns immediatelyIt is\u0026nbsphard to imagine her surviving for long.

Amber Rudd has said she believes parliament would stop a no deal, but it is not clear how it would do so.And some hold out the hope that Labour could pick up many of the leave-backing voters who feel sold out by the prime minister’s deal.“They’re available to us provided we don’t sound like remainers,” one shadow cabinet minister said, adding that the party must also guard against the risk that these voters switch to Ukip.In the run-up to the 2017 general election, Labour’s then-pollsters, BMG, suggested the party needed to sound pro-Brexit, or risk alienating voters in a swath of heartland constituencies, two senior Labour figures who saw the report have told the  – one of whom added: “We don’t think the picture’s changed that much since.”In Corbyn’s inner circle, the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, has told friends she is on a “vigil” against any move that could alienate Labour supporters in staunchly remain seats such as her constituency of Hackney North and Stoke Newington. However, the Hemsworth MP Jon Trickett is more exercised about the anxieties of northern leave voters.“This is a bad deal for the country,” said Corbyn on Sunday. “It is the result of a miserable failure of negotiation that leaves us with the worst of all worlds. It gives us less say over our future, and puts jobs and living standards at risk.“That is why Labour will oppose this deal in parliament. We will work with others to block a no-deal outcome, and ensure that Labour’s alternative plan for a sensible deal to bring the country together is on the table.”However, the majority of the public also say they want Brexit to be over and done with – a sentiment the prime minister has been keen to play on as she ramps up Downing Street’s bid to sell the deal to a wary public.Nevertheless, a growing number of frontbenchers believe Labour may need to “swerve” towards a “people’s vote”, as one put it, if public opinion swings behind the idea and the leadership will come under intense pressure from the party grassroots to do so.Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, said recently it was “more likely given the weakness of Theresa May’s position”.Abbott is among those shadow cabinet members who have publicly expressed concern about the risks of a second referendum. She told the BBC’s Nick Robinson last week: “People should be careful what they wish for, because my view is that if we had a second referendum tomorrow leave would win again and not only would leave win again but leave voters would say what didn’t you understand about leave winning the first time?”Keir Starmer, who said publicly last week he would vote remain if a second referendum were held, is keen to ensure the parliamentary Labour party is united behind any shift in policy.A general election would risk exposing the bitter tensions within the party about Brexit. The leadership is clear it would want to go into an election promising to press ahead with leaving the EU, but strike a less economically damaging deal.But a vocal cohort of Labour MPs could find it impossible to stand on a manifesto that did not state stopping Brexit as an aim. One MP campaigning vigorously for remain said: “I think it would rip the party apart, simple as that.”A small number could even seek to split from Labour and stand as “stop Brexit” independents. Some of Corbyn’s closest lieutenants are relaxed about that happening, believing official Labour candidates would beat them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3289279be62f89b3010511c5811f54ac253238b/691_304_2184_1311/master/2184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92a1967a070bb61f4c5b5fd5f6c07cea","title":"may brexit deal explained eu withdrawal agreement trade backstop citizens rights","story":"The EU has agreed on May’s 585-page withdrawal agreement. Here are the main issues• Brexit summit - latest news and reaction - live!After 524 days of negotiations, Theresa May and the EU’s other 27 heads of state and government have agreed a deal to be put in front of the UK and European parliaments for ratification ahead of Britain’s withdrawal on 29 March 2019.There is a 585-page withdrawal agreement, which will form the basis of a legally binding treaty, and a 26-page political declaration on the future relationship. The second document does not have legal force, but it politically binds both sides to some basic parameters in the future talks. Here is what has been agreed in Brussels:If MPs reject the deal, there are seven possible paths the country could go down next.May brings it back to MPsPerhaps with minor tweaks after a dash to Brussels. ​MPs knuckle under and vote it through.May resigns immediatelyIt is\u0026nbsphard to imagine her surviving for long.

If they were unable to do so, a general election would be triggered.A second referendum gathers supportThis is most likely if Labour makes a last-ditch decision to back it.\u0026nbspNo dealThe EU (Withdrawal) Act specifies 29 March 2019 as\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspday. Amber Rudd has said she believes parliament would stop a no deal, but it is not clear how it would do so.The three main issues dealt with in the withdrawal agreement are citizens rights, the £39bn orce deal and the problem of avoiding a border on the island of Ireland after Brexit.Citizens’ rightsThe deal safeguards the rights for more than 3 million EU citizens in the UK, and over 1 million UK nationals in EU countries to stay and continue their current activities in the place in which they have made their home. Theresa May had sought to limit the scope of the deal to those who arrived in the UK before 29 March 2019, but she lost out. All those arriving to live in the UK at any point up until the end of the transition period, which could last until the end of 2022 should it be extended, will enjoy the rights that EU nationals have today to make Britain their home, to live, work and study.Divorce billIt had been feared that the UK’s exit bill could scupper the negotiations. David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, told the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, early on in the talks that there was nothing in the EU’s treaties to suggest that the British government owed any money. Juncker responded that the EU was “not a golf club”, and that Britain would have to come good on the spending commitments it made as a member state. Huge figures circulated, with some totting up gross liabilities to be £100bn. That prompted the then foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, to suggest Brussels could “go whistle” for its money. An agreement was finally made last November that the UK would stump up about £39bn, to cover its contribution to the EU budget until 2020, and accumulated other outstanding commitments such as pensions for EU officials.Irish borderThis has turned out to be the thorniest issue to settle in the Brexit orce agreement and still causes the most unhappiness among Theresa May’s critics. The UK had initially proposed a technological solution but this was rebuffed by Ireland and EU officials as “magical thinking”. The EU initially proposed that Northern Ireland should in effect stay in the single market and customs union, prompting a furious response from the British prime minister. The EU moved its position. The core of the solution is the so-called backstop, an insurance plan that kicks in if future trade talks fail to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. The backstop means the whole of the UK will remain in the EU customs union, while Northern Ireland will have to follow single market rules. Brexit supporters loathe the backstop, fearing it will leave the UK “shackled” to EU rules. Wary EU countries think the plan benefits the UK, so insisted the UK respect EU social and environmental rules to to avoid undercutting their companies.The UK came into the negotiations determined to get a weighty political declaration that would easily translate into a full-blown trade deal ready to come into force soon after Brexit day. The promise of the “easiest trade deal in history” soon hit the buffers. The UK has agreed a joint paper of just 26 pages outlining the parameters of the future relationship, with the two main pillars being trade and security. The paper offers lots of ideas about what might happen, but few concrete plans.Trade and the cityThe prime minister’s central policy priority in terms of trade was to secure a commitment to frictionless trade in goods through a common rulebook, the centrepiece of the Chequers plan. By stating that the UK and the EU would be “separate markets and distinct legal orders” after Brexit, the political declaration demolished it. British access to European markets will depend on the UK respecting EU standards on competition, tax, environment, as well as social and employment protection, but it is not clear whether that involves non-regression or dynamic alignment. The political declaration says the shared customs territory in the Northern Ireland backstop will be built on and improved in a future trade deal. The UK, bafflingly, insists this does not bind the British government to a customs union. Despite British demands for a bespoke deal on financial services, the UK will be treated like any other non-EU country. Instead of “passports” that allow the City of London to operate across the EU, bankers and traders will have to rely on “equivalence”, allowing market access to be withdrawn by Brussels at 30 days’ notice. There is a commitment to complete equivalence assessments by the middle of June 2020.Foreign and security policyThe UK had hoped to not only maintain the current level of security and police cooperation but to even opt in to aspects of the EU’s structures that it had previously snubbed. That prompted Luxembourg’s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, to remark: “They were in with a load of opt-outs. Now they are out, and want a load of opt-ins.” The EU is only offering cooperation, rather than membership, of EU police agency Europol and judicial cooperation agency Eurojust. Despite its previous disdain for EU-level defence cooperation, Britain has negotiated clauses that will allow it to participate in EU joint defence projects. A major row during the Brexit negotiations was the European commission’s insistence that the UK defence industries would not be allowed to work on the most sensitive parts the EU’s £8bn Galileo satellite programme, to which British taxpayers have already paid £1bn. The UK has threatened to walk away and build its own satellite. The political declaration, in an example of its many vague clauses, limits its solution to 10 words. “The parties should consider appropriate arrangements for cooperation on space”, it says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3031a20ad210f3e4feb961d99fe6d4a4d64db85e/2_248_1869_1121/master/1869.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42174952f4bd19331fc13819beb32bd2","title":"theresa may not sad but defiant makes case for brexit deal","story":"Prime minister issues direct appeal for backing as EU leaders endorse Brexit dealTheresa May has insisted she is not sad that Britain is leaving the EU, as she made a direct appeal to the public to back her deal, saying: “The British people don’t want to spend any time arguing about Brexit.”The prime minister was speaking after EU leaders met for a special summit in Brussels and formally endorsed her Brexit deal, following a discussion lasting less than an hour.Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, said Sunday was a “sad day”.But asked if she shared the sentiment, May said, “No: but I recognise that others do I recognise that some European leaders are sad at this moment.”Despite the increasingly bleak prospects for her deal passing the House of Commons next month, in what she called “one of the most significant votes for many years”, May struck a defiant note.If MPs reject the deal, there are seven possible paths the country could go down next.May brings it back to MPsPerhaps with minor tweaks after a dash to Brussels. ​MPs knuckle under and vote it through.May resigns immediatelyIt is\u0026nbsphard to imagine her surviving for long.

Amber Rudd has said she believes parliament would stop a no deal, but it is not clear how it would do so.She said she had always rejected the “counsel of despair” from those who believed a beneficial Brexit agreement could not be struck.Despite the fact it is MPs, not voters, who hold her fate in their hands in the coming weeks, she said she wanted to “speak directly to the British people”, and would be embarking on a campaign in the next few days, to sell the deal to the public.The outlines of that campaign were clear as she described the merits of the deal on Sunday, highlighting an end to free movement “once and for all”, halting “vast annual payments” to the EU, and ending the jurisdiction of the European court of justice as the advantages of her deal.She also stressed the government’s keenness to move on to domestic priorities – a view she believes is shared by many voters. “The British people don’t want to spend any more time arguing about Brexit,” she said.May pointedly highlighted the £394m a week her government has promised to pour into the NHS. That pledge, which the prime minister has previously claimed is the result of a “Brexit idend”, echoes the £350m a week the Vote Leave campaign claimed could be erted to the the health service if Britain left the EU.In an open letter on Sunday, May promised to put her “heart and soul” into winning over MPs and voters to the merits of her deal, which she previously said she believed “with every fibre of my being” was the right one.At Sunday’s press conference, she again refused to rule out resigning if the deal was rejected by parliament next month, saying: “It’s not about me.”The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, conceded on Sunday that the odds of the deal passing were “looking challenging” and refused to rule out the risk that the government could collapse if parliament rejected it.He told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show: “It’s not possible to rule out anything, and that’s why all of us have to do is say, what do your constituents actually want in this situation, and we have to work out what’s in the national interest, and it’s all about the balance of risks. This isn’t a perfect deal for everyone, but does have a lot of what everyone wants.”May echoed the insistence by several EU leaders on Sunday that there was no possibility of reopening negotiations if parliament said no."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab7cbe748703f8a4784ec7b83986b20b43d1dd23/582_284_1974_1185/master/1974.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e774317b6c30dccb53f030e6b6a8afb","title":"brexit eu summit deal theresa may leaders meet for emergency summit to sign off uks withdrawal agreement politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the EU summit in Brussels, where Theresa May and other EU leaders agreed the Brexit withdrawal agreement and political declaration on the future relationshipThat’s all from me for today.Thanks for the comments.Concerns over fishing rights are still high on the agenda for Scottish politicians, despite Theresa May’s assurances in her letter to the nation that her Brexit deal will take the UK “out of the common fisheries policy that has failed our coastal communities”.Labour’s shadow Scotland secretary, Lesley Laird, has written to the Scotland secretary, David Mundell, insisting he clarify his position, having previously said that he could not support any extension of CFP rules past 2020. Describing the current deal as “a clear breach of your red line on fishing”, Laird says:I would therefore be grateful if you were able to clarify that you will not be voting for the deal on this basis. If that is the case, I really must ask why you have not resigned your position in the cabinet?Last week the UK government insisted May’s deal did not tie future access to British fishing waters with trade.Earlier, the Aberdeen South MP, Ross Thomson, a hard Brexiter Tory, confirmed he would vote against the deal in the Commons. Describing the fishing arrangements as “troubling” on the BBC One’s Sunday Politics Scotland, he said:It may not be called that but if it looks like the CFP and behaves like the CFP, it is the CFP.Grassroots for Europe, a network that says it represents more than 100 groups campaigning against Brexit, has delivered a letter to Donald Tusk, president of the European council, asking him not to to anything that would prevent a second referendum, and to make provision for possibly revoking article 50.Richard Wilson, one of its coordinators, from Leeds for Europe, said:Our campaigners know from talking every week to ordinary people on streets and doorsteps that public opinion is changing and people are realising the Brexit deal is nothing like what they were promised or what many of them were persuaded to vote for.We are making sure that our MPs know this, understand that the people’s will has changed, and carry out the people’s majority demand for the right to reject Brexit. With this letter we are taking the same message to the EU in Brussels, to ask, in the mutual interest of all EU citizens, for the time and cooperation to allow UK electors the chance of a democratic rethink.Here is Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, on today’s deal.This is a sad day for everyone involved the deal the EU have endorsed remains a disaster for the British people.What has been agreed is vague at best and is essentially an agreement to have an agreement. There is still no majority in parliament for it, and “no Brexit” remains the only real alternative.Nobody voted to make themselves poorer and damage the UK’s standing in the world. It is time the prime minister granted a people’s vote, with the option to remain in the EU.The BBC’s Europe editor, Katya Adler, has a useful Twitter thread on the message from the summit. It starts here.Responding to the news that the European Union has endorsed the Brexit deal, the Scottish government’s Brexit secretary, Michael Russell, has issued a statement saying May’s Brexit deal “does not work for Scotland”. He says:It takes Scotland out of the European Union against our democratic wishes, it removes us from the single market against our economic interests, and it would put us at a competitive economic disadvantage compared to Northern Ireland. The only thing it guarantees is years of damaging uncertainty.Meanwhile the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, is continuing to press the point on fishing rights: in this tweet below she challenges the Scotland secretary, David Mundell, on the link between access to waters and trade, something that the UK government insists will not be ongoing, but which many others looking at the agreement think is inevitable. Here are some highlights from Emmanuel Macron’s press conference. The French president repeated his claim that Brexiters lied during the referendum and he suggested that France would push to keep the UK in the backstop if it does now win concessions on fish. The tweets are from my colleague Jennifer Rankin, the Daily Mail’s David Churchill, the Express’s Joe Barnes, the Times’ Bruno Waterfield and the Sun’s Nick Gutteridge.At a briefing for the Irish media after the summit Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, said today’s deal was the only one available. He said:Let’s not forget what we have here. We have an agreement that took between 18 months and two years to negotiate, it is in several parts, is over 500 pages long and as of today has the support of 28 governments.Anyone can have a better deal or an alternative deal in their own minds but an agreement 500 pages long that 28 member states can sign up to nobody has that. What’s on the table is the only deal that’s on the table.He also said the “entire European Union” was of the view that the deal could not be renegotiated. What’s being put in front of EU parliament and House of Commons is a deal. Any other deal really only exists in people’s imagination.Asked whether EU leaders had discussed what they would do if the vote in the House of Commons failed, Varadkar said the EU 27 had made a “conscious decision” not to discuss what may happen in such a scenario.Here is Jeremy Corbyn on today’s Brexit deal.This is a bad deal for the country. It is the result of a miserable failure of negotiation that leaves us with the worst of all worlds. It gives us less say over our future, and puts jobs and living standards at risk.That is why Labour will oppose this deal in parliament. We will work with others to block a no-deal outcome, and ensure that Labour’s alternative plan for a sensible deal to bring the country together is on the table. That includes a permanent customs union with a UK say, a strong single-market deal and guarantees on workers’ rights, consumer and environmental protections.Here are the main points from Theresa May’s press conference:Before Christmas, MPs will vote on this deal. It will be one of the most significant votes that parliament has held for many years. On it will depend whether we move forward together to a brighter future or open the door to yet more ision and uncertainty.But May refused to endorse what Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, said this morning about a “no” vote possibly leading to the collapse of the government. (See 11.08am.) Asked about this, she said she was focused on getting the deal through – a line she used repeatedly.If people think somehow there is another negotiation to be done, that’s not the case. This is the deal. It is the result of what have been tough and difficult negotiations over a significant period of time.Cabinet ministers and EU diplomats are secretly drawing up “plan B” proposals for Brexit based on a growing assumption that Theresa May’s deal will be blocked by parliament.Senior figures on both side of the channel are urgently plotting alternatives to the agreement struck by the prime minister after 91 Conservative MPs indicated that they would oppose it in the Commons ...Sources said several senior ministers were talking up one “plan B” idea of a Norway-style relationship with Brussels, under which the UK would have a more certain “exit mechanism” from the EU’s rules but would be unable to end the free movement of workers from the continent.Under the Norway option, the UK would remain a member of the European Economic Area (EEA), without full EU membership. When asked if she would categorically rule out this option, May implied that she would – without saying so explicitly. She said she was clear that she had negotiated the best deal available.The people voted for Brexit. It’s, in a sense, a duty for their politicians, who asked them to make that choice, to then deliver on that choice. This is a deal that delivers on that because what people want to see is an end to free movement.If the UK were to stay in the single market – the Norway option – free movement would continue.There should not be that second referendum. The public would expect parliament to vote on the deal. For most people in the UK they want a deal done and want us to get on with focusing more clearly on the issues that matter to them day to day. No, but I recognise that others do. I recognise some European leaders are sad at this moment, but also some European people in the UK will be sad at this moment.Q: Has anything changed today that might make people back the deal? And what will you say to MPs to persuade them to vote for you?May says the country has a duty to deliver on Brexit. This deal does that, while protecting jobs and security. It is a deal that is good for the whole of the UK, she says.And that is it. The press conference is over. I will post a summary soon.Q: Some MPs are pushing for the Norway option as a fallback. Would you rule that out under your premiership?May says it is important to deliver on what people voted for in the referendum, including an end to free movement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92e98d54f3d411d57d0cf377abec2a4e3cccb742/0_230_6894_4136/master/6894.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28989466dcc5fb6a68b0d47795909c03","title":"tell us do you work in a food bank share your stories","story":"If you work in a food bank in the UK, we’d like to hear from you.

He produced a consummate drive at the season finale to close out 2018 on a high for Mercedes. Sebastian Vettel was in second for Ferrari and Max Verstappen third for Red Bull.After a season in which he has often dominated, Hamilton finished with another performance at Yas Marina in which he was barely threatened by his rivals. Mercedes called his strategy, with an early pit stop, perfectly and Hamilton exploited it to ensure he has completed his fifth championship-winning season with another display of control and patience once again proving he is at the very peak of his powers. He rightly celebrated with some on-track doughnuts.This is the 73rd win of his career. He won at the last round in Brazil after Verstappen’s accident but this was an emphatic victory entirely of his own. Having previously not won a race after taking the championship before the end of the season, he has closed with two, concluding a remarkable run in the final third. Since the Belgian Grand Prix he has won six of the eight remaining races.With his fourth victory at Abu Dhabi he is now the most successful driver at the circuit, with one more than Vettel. While, with 51 wins from the last 100 races he has maintained his average of 10 a season since the turbo-hybrid era began in 2014.Hamilton has said he wanted to close strongly to serve notice to his rivals of his intent to continue the form next season and he did so with a performance that reflects both his and Mercedes strengths across the season.Mercedes expected to be strong at Yas Marina, a circuit that suits their car and where they now have not been beaten since 2014 and where Ferrari have yet to win. As the season comes to a close, with the drivers’ and constructors’ championship double achieved for a record-equalling fifth time, they will take huge optimism into returning with every chance to repeat the feat next year. They have shown resilience in adversity and have proved undoubted winners of the development battle with Ferrari.Alongside Hamilton’s 11 wins Mercedes have secured 13 of 21 pole positions, while Ferrari have not taken pole since Monza. Vettel managed only five wins, not nearly enough to challenge Hamilton. Errors by both team and driver have been costly and have emphasised the gap they must overcome to their rivals.Hamilton got away cleanly holding the lead through the first lap, during which the safety car was deployed after Nico Hülkenberg was clipped by Romain Grosjean. The German’s car took a nasty barrel roll into the barriers but Hülkenberg emerged unscathed.Racing resumed on lap five but the VSC was deployed on lap seven when Kimi Raikkonen retired with a power failure and Mercedes opted to pit Hamilton who rejoined in fourth. The stop worked well with Hamilton losing only nine seconds on the leaders with the team hoping he could make it to the end on the supersoft tyres.Valtteri Bottas was then leading from Vettel, who pitted on lap 16 but it was a slow stop, the right rear wheel slow to come off. Bottas covered it a lap later and held his position. With the two Red Bulls yet to stop it left Daniel Ricciardo and Verstappen in front.Verstappen pitted on lap 18 but Red Bull went long with Ricciardo. Hamilton however was keeping well in touch with the Australian, keeping the gap to six seconds and closing to within three when Ricciardo finally pitted on lap 33.With the pit stop sequence complete, Hamilton was once again in front with a six-second advantage on Bottas. The Finn lost second to Vettel however after locking up and going wide and on lap 38 Verstappen passed him for third.The Red Bulls made a concerted charge on fresher rubber at the end but Hamilton and Mercedes had done enough. He took the flag with ease managing the gap and his rubber to the end with aplomb.Ricciardo was in fourth, with Bottas in fifth. Carlos Sainz was in sixth for Renault in front of Sauber’s Charles Leclerc and Force India’s Sergio Pérez. Grosjean was in ninth with Kevin Magnussen 10th.Fernando Alonso, meanwhile, was given an emotional send-off by his McLaren team and bowed out for the moment from his F1 career with 11th place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6961ef82fa6bfa04aefb805d072a86ccc35fb01d/0_95_2298_1379/master/2298.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d9291316558ad7ab06f6d42f854ee78","title":"doctor who recap series 37 episode 8 the witchfinders","story":"Alien mud-zombies and witch-dunking await Team Tardis in their latest historical adventureIt’s hardly controversial to say that, this year, Doctor Who’s historical episodes have been the most successful. And it wouldn’t be controversial to say The Witchfinders continues this trend. But with a crucial difference. In not treading on the culturally sensitive grounds of very recent history, this episode affords itself two qualities this series has found in shorter supply fun and camp. Not that the drowning of women is exactly a laughing or a mincing matter, but I have been waiting weeks for a romp like this.Guest writer Joy Wilkinson (best known for the BBC Dickens adaptation Nick Nickelby) makes her Who debut with a trip to 17th-century Lancashire, and the era’s notorious witch trials. In the town of Bilehurst Cragg, formidable landowner Becka Savage is presiding over another witch-dunking in her continued and determined attempts to banish Satan. It’s one of the most bitingly secular messages Doctor Who has shown us. In the wake of events, the Doctor once again wastes no time in breaking her own rules of non-interference in history. Before anyone has the chance to ask just how Becka manages to get her hair like that in rural Lancashire, the village is being overrun by alien mud-zombies and the Doctor herself is down for a dunking. The Witchfinders does well on suspense, it does even better on resolution Pendle Hill is revealed as a prison for an alien army unlocked quite by mistake because Becka chopped down the wrong tree. And in one of very few references to the Doctor’s gender this year, the line: “If only I was still a bloke, I could just get on with the job without having to constantly defend myself.”Ultimate respect to the classy Siobhan Finneran as Becka. But stealing not only the gong for guest-star-of-the-week, but probably guest-star-of-the-series is Alan Cumming as King James I (and VI). Cumming’s twinkle-eyed campery has become a genre of its own, stretching way back from in-flight sitcom The High Life to The Good Wife, earning him Bafta and Golden Globe nominations. Nevertheless, the King is quite the dream role, a heightened maverick caught between royal benevolence and murderous religious dogma.Wilkinson writes into fact the speculation that his mother (Mary Queen of Scots) had his father (Henry Stuart) murdered, along with the various attempts on his life. It all adds up to a surprisingly rounded character that gives this story backbone. But neither are there any apologies – the Doctor has no time for him whatsoever following his lack of mercy in the final act. Also, he’s totally hot for Ryan. And Ryan doesn’t especially mind. In the best description of the new Team Tardis yet, Graham describes the group as “a very flat team structure.” All well and good. And yet, Chibnall’s line in all the publicity has been that the through-arc this year has been the journies of the characters and the formation of a family. But we are still not seeing a huge amount of that. Graham and Ryan are on civil enough terms, Yaz is opening up to people about being bullied at school, but it’s hardly massive cliffhanger material from the man who gave us Broadchurch. That could still all change, but we only have two weeks to go now.This episode also helps to boost the series average of proper scary monsters! Just as you’re starting to roll your eyes (and quickly feel guilty about doing so) because the real enemy once again is going to be human prejudice, Finneran’s face morphs into the monstrous mud-zombie Morax leader and havoc is wreaked. I think the word is hooray.It’s probably no surprise the Doctor didn’t land the Tardis at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth I. The ship has a tendency to take herhim “not where you wanted to go, but where you needed to go.” But I would bet this misadventure was a little bit deliberate on her part. Let’s not forget that in the 50th anniversary special The Day of the Doctor (s)he married Bess (or possibly a Zygon replica). The union did not end well, leading to her banishing himher in 2007’s The Shakespeare Code. I still don’t have a handle on these gender pronouns.Next week!Doctor Who channels Scandi-noir with a chiller set against a Norwegian fjord in It Takes You Away."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc9b90c27bc8b82b3ce81026356cd54e36639a3a/50_0_3401_2040/master/3401.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=621553604a6e457b20db8b97de71b18d","title":"strictly come dancing week 10 live","story":"The seven remaining couples took part in a lindy hop challenge.

Last night on Strictly: my fave Paso and Waltz of the series, and a street dance from Joe that somehow gets a little bit worse with every viewing.

So, you know, mixed feelings.*I do have quite a big bum, which I am extremely fond of. So nothing wrong with her eyesight, just her manners. Tonight’s opening pro dance features dancers from Candoco Dance Company, according to my blurb. Lovely version of Life On Mars, and a dance that is all kinds of spellbinding. More of this kind of thing please.And we’re off! I went looking for a trance remix of this theme tune earlier today (look I’m home alone for the weekend and the internet is a big place). Apart from one dubious drum ‘n’ bass mashup, I couldn’t find anything good. This is a hugely untapped seam of musical happiness. DJs, what are you waiting for?Why is Alan Cumming on my telly dressed as one of Dogtanian’s Muskehounds? Quite fun watching Doctor Who with the sound off. Mrs O’Brien from Downton Abbey appears to have spent a little too long in front of the Aga. Evening all, and welcome back for this week’s Sunday Results Show! After last night’s Ballsupathon, absolutely anything could happen this evening. A FayeAshley dance off. Joe getting a detention for not putting the apparatus away after PE. Graeme not turning up because he’s run off to join the navy. Bruno being made British Ambassador to the United Nations. I’m not discounting anything at this point. I watched the Lindyhotmessathon again earlier, and it’s has so many brilliant moments. Firstly Shirley’s helpless “we’ve lost the board”, then the look on Ashley’s face when she thinks she’s got 7th place (rather than 7 points). Then Shirley calling Karen Dianne, and Craig distancing himself so far from the whole farrago that he’s got three extra stamps on his passport. The final unexpected twist is Bruno taking control of the situation and being more lucid than he’s been in fifteen years. For a minute there, you couldn’t distinguish him from the professionals. Hooray for live TV.Talking of live TV (or not), tonight we wave goodbye to another Strictly couple, so join me at 7.20pm to find out who. See you then!Thank you all for joining in and being excellent for another week – I’ll be back tomorrow at 7.20pm for the results, when we’ll send another Strictly couple home. Enjoy the rest of your Saturday, and I’ll see you then!Time for a recap! My fave this evening was definitely Faye and Giovanni’s Waltz, and Stacey and Kevin’s Paso. Can’t see how Graeme is going to survive this week – suspect he may be up against Charles and Karen in the dance off tomorrow, as the public will once again make up for Lauren and AJ’s undermarking. The Lindyhopathon made pretty much no difference to the scoreboard whatsoever, which makes that ten minutes of our lives we’re never getting back. The judges’ scoring is a hot mess but I THINK Lauren is in 7th, Graeme in 6th, Charles in 5th, Stacey in 4th, Joe in 3rd, Faye in 2nd and Ashley in first. As scoring goes, that was an absolute shambles.

The UAE foreign minister, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, will be critical to any potential decision to release Hedges, who was sentenced last week to life imprisonment for espionage. His family have described the charge as absurd, and say he was doing legitimate academic research in the UAE as part of a PhD at Durham University.There has been speculation the UAE could release Hedges on its national day, 2 December.The president, Sheikh Khalifa, ordered the release of 785 prisoners on Sunday ahead of the national day and also paid off their fines. There was no word whether Hedges was included in this group.The Hedges family had pleaded for clemency last week, and hoped Hedges would be included in the releases. He was detained at Dubai airport on 5 May and has been kept in solitary confinement for the bulk of the past six months. His wife, Daniela Tejada, has complained the Foreign Office did little to secure his release until she mounted a public campaign to highlight the treatment of her husband by one of the UK’s closest Gulf allies. She has launched an online petition to secure his release, and a growing number of universities are reviewing their links with the UAE.Hedges lodged an appeal last Wednesday and a hearing must be held within 30 days.The purpose of the nearly 800 pardons, according to the UAE state news agency, is to offer detainees the opportunity to “create a new life for themselves and alleviate the suffering of their families”. Every year, the country’s rulers pardon prisoners and order debt settlements of those jailed for financial crimes or with outstanding fines.Prisoners are selected on the basis of their good conduct. Last year, the UAE pardoned about 2,000 people.Without going into details, Hunt told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday: “I am more optimistic as we sit here now that we can find a way through this. The UAE is a very longstanding friend of the UK and I’ve had very good conversations with their foreign minister I am going to speak to him again this afternoon.”The sheikh spoke with Hunt on Friday in what was described as a positive call, but influential UAE academics continued to defend the sentence on Sunday, suggesting there is resistance to his release.Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a professor of political science, insisted on Twitter: “The case against him is crystal clear. He admitted the charges. The evidence is irrefutable and the UK government does not deny it. Now he wants clemency.”At the weekend, the UAE foreign minister made no mention of Hedges during a lengthy speech highlighting the country’s ties with the EU at the opening of an exhibition in Abu Dhabi celebrating the UAE-EU relationship.The exhibition coincided with the Formula One Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi, which was attended by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. The crown prince met with the nephew of Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post journalist killed by a Saudi Arabian hit squad in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October.Khashoggi’s nephew posted an Instagram picture at the weekend of him posing for a picture with the crown prince.Marr also asked Hunt if there were any grounds for optimism in the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation who was arrested in April 2016 in Tehran as she headed back to Britain with her daughter, now aged four, after a family visit.She was sentenced to five years in jail after being convicted of plotting to overthrow Iran’s clerical establishment, a charge denied by her family and the foundation. “I think that’s more challenging,” Hunt said. “I was in Tehran on Monday, and I asked to meet Nazanin. I wasn’t allowed to but I did meet her daughter.”Hunt said he had urged Iran to provide medical assistance to Zaghari-Ratcliffe and to another, unnamed, citizen in a similar situation. He said it was “totally and utterly unacceptable” for Iran to “start locking up innocent people as a tool of diplomatic leverage”.He asked the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, to give Zaghari-Ratcliffe a copy of Nelson Mandela’s Long Walk to Freedom, which he had taken to Tehran for her."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3709899.1543169214!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"implant files medical devices may have caused more than 1 000 health incidents last year","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘The ’ is part of a global investigation – the Implant Files – into the medical device sector which has been organised through the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).More than 1,000 adverse health episodes that might have been caused by medical devices were reported to the Irish regulator of such products last year, according to figures released to The .In the period from 2015 to the end of September of this year, 39 of the reports involved a patient death where it was initially suspected that the medical device was a contributing cause.However, a spokeswoman for the regulator, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), said that in all 22 of the 39 cases in which investigations had concluded, and based on the information available to date, “none of the incidents which involved a patient death were confirmed to be related to a device malfunction”.The remaining outstanding 17 cases involving a death, of which eight were reported this year, continue to be investigated. “The HPRA considered that it is unlikely that many, or any of these would have been caused by the device.”The  is part of a global investigation into the medical device sector which has been organised through the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), and the results of which are being published from Sunday evening. The investigation is called the Implant Files.As part of the project an online database, the International Medical Devices Database, has been developed by the ICIJ. It allows easy public access to data on adverse events linked to, or potentially linked, to medical devices.The database, which mostly involves US reports, can be searched by product name so that implant recipients can access information about their devices. However, it is not intended to be a substitute for medical advice.While there is extensive information about possible medical device failures available publicly in the US, and less so in EU member states, the Implant Files investigation has found that fewer than 20 per cent of countries globally make data available to the public on device recalls and other safety issues.In Ireland, data about safety notices and device recalls is published on the HPRA website.The investigation has raised concerns about devices that have been withdrawn in one country for safety reasons still being available in others.Orthopaedic, gastroenterological, urological and cardiovascular devices show the highest level of recalls for safety reasons in the US.An examination of millions of US adverse event reports found almost 500,000 cases where patients with implanted medical devices were getting them removed, or “explanted”.Figures given to The  by the HPRA for the period 2015-2018 show that last year there were 1,041 adverse “incidents” reported to the authority.An adverse incident is an unexpected bad medical development that may be associated with a patient’s medical device, and is different from an “adverse event” which, in HPRA terminology, involves bad health episodes that would be expected with patients using the device concerned – for example, those with very weak hearts.The adverse incident figure for 2016 was 859, while the figure for 2018 to the end of September was 838.Of the 1,041 incidents reported in 2017, investigations have been completed in 594 cases and, of these, 156 were found to have been definitively linked to the patient’s medical device.Overall, 80 per cent of the 2017 cases for which investigations have been concluded were found to be incidents which were caused, directly or partly, by the medical device, or which led to the manufacturer taking some type of corrective action. The rate was slightly less in other years.Medical device manufacturers are obliged to report adverse health outcomes that might be linked to their devices to the HPRA. Medical practitioners and others are also urged to report suspected cases.The figures supplied by the HPRA show that the bulk of the incident reports it receives come from manufacturers and that there has been a steady rise in the total number of reports over recent years, with the total in 2011 being just 112.The head of medical device regulation with the HPRA, Dr Niall MacAleenan, said the increase was mostly due to the drive to encourage better reporting. The authority conducts audits on manufacturers to ensure they are complying with their obligations.There was a spike in reports in 2012, when the total jumped to 706 from the previous year’s 408. Dr MacAleenan said this was due to the DePuy metal hip device, which has since been removed from the market.Globally DePuy, which is a subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson, is expected to pay out up to $4 billion (€3.53 billion) in damages and patient care costs arising from the withdrawn device.Ireland had the largest per capita uptake of the DePuy hip in the world and an examination of how the product came to market is published today by The . More than 1,000 people have lodged High Court proceedings against DePuy.The DePuy hip controversy, and a scandal over industrial grade silicone being used in breast implants, led to the decision to reform the EU system of medical device regulation. The new structure is likely to see increased levels of clinical trials being conducted, according to Dr MacAleenan.The reforms are also expected to lead to greater levels of information being put into the public domain.Medical devices require a different type of regulation to that of pharmaceuticals, not least because they are often designed to be inside a patient’s body for years, according to Dr MacAleenan.“Risk is inevitable with implanted devices. The question is if it is an acceptable level of risk.”The Fine Gael MEP and vice-president of the European Parliament, Mairéad McGuinness, who played an important role in the negotiation of the new EU regime, said parts of the structure that were being replaced were “not fit for purpose”.However, she said it was important that an industry that was constantly producing new products that save lives and address chronic medical conditions was not over-regulated.“Activists and NGOs criticise the close links between academia and industry but it is the only way the sector can produce what it does,” she told The .Ireland is a global hub for medical devices, which account for almost 10 per cent of its exports.Last Wednesday the Department of Health extended restrictions on the use of a medical device product, the vaginal mesh, in relation to some conditions. The mesh has caused severe complications in a number of women including damage caused by bits of the mesh breaking off and cutting through patients’ flesh. The product can be extremely difficult to explant as the body grows around and into it.Josephine Kilroy (58), from Newport, Co Mayo, who received a mesh implant in 2007 to treat a bladder problem, is hoping that it can be removed early next year by a surgeon in London.The former taxi operator said pain and other complications associated with the device had caused her to be all but confined to her home.“I went from having everything, and being happy, to losing everything, all because of the mesh. It has taken my whole life from me,” she told The .A special investigation by The  in association with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3709949.1543163055!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland second only to germany for medical device exports","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe medical devices sector employs 38,000 people in Ireland.“Tourists aside, one out of every eight people you walk past in Galway is involved in the medical device industry,” says Prof Abhay Pandit, a biomedical engineer based in Galway university.The importance of the medical devices sector to the Irish economy is not as well publicised as that of the major technology corporations such as Apple or Google, or the big pharma companies such as Pfizer, but is of a similar scale.Medical devices make up almost 10 per cent of all Irish exports and Ireland comes second only after Germany as the largest European exporter of medical devices. Total employment, in indigenous and multinational businesses, is 38,000.Four out of five of stents used worldwide are produced in Ireland. Half of the ventilators used in acute hospitals worldwide are produced here, as are a third of the world’s contact lenses. More than 30 million people with diabetes use injectable devices made in Ireland.Europe’s premier cluster of medical devices companies is based in the Galway region, according to Enterprise Ireland.Abbott, Stryker, Johnson \u0026amp Johnson, GE Healthcare, Medtronic, Shire and Boston Scientific are among the top global medical device corporations that have substantial operations here employing large numbers of skilled staff.The industry and its regulatory framework have come in for scrutiny after several companies – including some with significant Irish operations – made multimillion-dollar settlements in the United States arising from investigations into bribery and scandals linked to the promotion of their products.Last year Shire, a biopharmaceutical corporation that has its headquarters on Baggot Street in Dublin, but has its main operational base in the US, made a $350 million false claims settlement with the US authorities arising from an investigation into the payment of kickbacks.The kickback payments were linked to sales of Dermagraft, a human skin substitute approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. It was the largest ever kickback settlement involving a medical device and involved allegations that “Dermagraft salespersons unlawfully induced clinics and physicians with lavish dinners, drinks, entertainment and travel, medical equipment and supplies, unwarranted payments for purported speaking engagements and bogus case studies, and cash, credits and rebates, to induce the use of Dermagraft.” The settlement did not involve Shire admitting to any wrongdoing.Also last year Medtronic, the world’s largest manufacturer of medical devices, which has had its headquarters in Dublin since the formerly US corporation moved here in 2015, agreed to pay $12 million in the US in settlement of claims that it paid millions of dollars in consulting fees to doctors who published studies in peer-reviewed journals that downplayed the adverse effects of a Medtronic product.Medtronic said in a statement at the time that nothing in the settlement could be taken as a concession that it admitted to wrongdoing.The controversial articles concerned a bone-growth protein, Infuse, which had been approved for use in surgery for lower back pain but was used extensively for upper spine and neck repairs, sometimes leading to death and serious injury. Such off-label use is legal but cannot be promoted by the manufacturer.An investigation in 2012 by the US Senate finance committee found Medtronic had been “heavily involved” in shaping the content of published studies on Infuse.The committee said Medtronic had been “involved in drafting, editing and shaping the content of medical journal articles authored by its physician consultants who received significant amounts of money through royalties and consulting fees from Medtronic”.In Europe Infuse was marketed under the name InductOS. Its use in the European Union was suspended in 2015 because of concerns with the manufacturing process involved.Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (J\u0026ampJ), which operates a number of major plants in Ireland, entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the US authorities in 2011 and paid a $21.4 million fine arising from the bribery of doctors in Greece.The bribery involved payments to Greek hospital doctors to encourage them to use orthopaedic products produced by the J\u0026ampJ subsidiary DePuy, which has operations in Ireland. Documents published by the US department of justice (DoJ) show the bribery operation was discussed by DePuy executives who met at a conference in Dublin in 2000.DePuy orthopaedic products were sold at significant discounts to an Isle of Man intermediary in order to produce profits that could then be used for bribing the Greek doctors for implanting the devices into their patients.The US investigation concluded that between 1996 and 2006, DePuy authorised payments of about €16.4 million to Greek agents knowing that much of the money would be used to pay cash incentives to publicly-employed Greek doctors to induce them to use DePuy products in their patients.In a “deferred prosecution agreement” published in 2011, J\u0026ampJ agreed that the facts outlined were true and accurate.The contribution to humanity of the medical device sector over recent decades has been enormous, says Pandit.“A few decades ago, cardiac surgery for a person in their 70s would have been unthinkable. Now it can be done in minimally invasive ways. A heart valve put into a 60-year-old is likely to last for 20 years, but now it is possible to put in a new one.”He has faith in the medical and research journals and the tests and studies done on medical devices, despite the well-aired issue of financial links between manufacturers and the physicians and scientists who are reviewing their products.Because bodies are so complex, there is a huge range of reactions across a population to a particular implanted device. This makes it difficult to fully test a product prior to its being released to the market.“It is a risk-to-benefit ratio. We can do as much as we can to show that the thing is safe to put in the body. The way to look at it is, in the circumstances, would I put this in my mother’s body, or in my father’s eye? Would I put it in my own body?”Pandit says Ireland’s corporation tax rate is not the sole reason for its relatively enormous medtech sector. “It is just the icing on the cake. The ecosystem is the thing, and the English language. The labour force is highly trained, and the higher-education institutes are equipped for clinical trials. It’s well-rooted. I’m not saying that tax doesn’t help, but it’s more than that.”Galway is part of the constituency of the Fine Gael MEP and vice-president of the European Parliament Mairéad McGuinness, who played an important role in the negotiations on a new regulatory regime for the medical devices sector in the EU.“Activists and NGOs criticise the close links between academia and industry but it is the only way the sector can produce what it does,” she says.While it is crucial that trust is maintained in the medical device sector, the benefits to the community of successful medical devices are enormous and it is important that it is not made too difficult for companies to bring new products to market, McGuinness says.Concerns exist over the extent to which the new regime which is to be put in place by 2020 can be sufficiently resourced with skilled staff.The system involves “notified bodies” giving CE marks to new medical device products, with certification from any notified body allowing a product on to the entire EU market.One of the recognised problems with the old regime was the closeness between the industry and some of the private, commercial bodies that were charged with certifying new products for the market. Ireland’s notified body, the Irish National Standards Authority, is publicly owned and highly regarded. However, the number of extant medical devices that it has given approval for numbers in the low hundreds.That close collaboration with industry is necessary is a view shared by Dr Martin O’Halloran, a senior lecturer in medical electronics in NUIG.O’Halloran is director of the Translation Medical Device Lab, which is embedded in Galway University Hospital and is focused on Ireland’s indigenous medtech sector and the development of new products.“What we do is evaluate the commercial potential at the outset,” says O’Halloran. “It means that for anything that is developed there will be an appetite for it.”People at an early stage of their career are recruited from university and sent into hospital to “look for problems that need to be solved”. They then look for people with specialist knowledge. A specialist team of three members is often formed, with a clinical doctor, an engineer and a commercial person working together. Often these teams can end up creating a start-up company around their proposed medical device.O’Halloran works on the electrical properties of human tissue and is currently working on a microwave imaging device for breast cancer screening.A lot of contemporary work is being led by engineering, he says. “The next generation of medical devices will be electro-mechanical. It will be smart or personalised devices that don’t just treat disease but preserve the quality of life.”A special investigation by The  in association with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3709919.1543161217!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"medical devices often allowed onto market without human tests","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAs part of EU reforms now being rolled out, there is increased cross-auditing of different member states’ regulatory bodies.The regulation of medical devices in the European Union is a national competency, unlike with pharmaceuticals, which are regulated centrally by the European Medicines Agency.Each member state has a regulator, which in turn authorises notified bodies which can award CE marks. The mark indicates the product conforms with the health, safety and environmental protection standards of the European Economic Area which includes the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.The CE mark awarded by a notified body in one member state allows the product be marketed across the union. Furthermore, the awarding of a CE mark also serves to open up other markets around the globe, where many poorer countries are reliant on the EU and US regulatory regimes.In Ireland the regulator is the Health Products Regulation Agency (HPRA), which has authorised the State-owned Irish National Standards Authority to act as a notified body.Other jurisdictions have more than one notified body, and some of these notified bodies were commercial operations reliant on the fees they received from the manufacturers whose products they were able to grant or deny access to the market. It was a system that was only as strong as its weakest link.As part of the EU reforms now being rolled out, there is increased cross-auditing of different member states’ regulatory bodies and notified bodies, as well as increased oversight by the European Commission. This, and new, higher standards that are being imposed, has seen a reduction in the number of notified bodies in the EU from 81 to 56 over recent years.Fine Gael MEP Mairéad McGuinness, vice-president of the European Parliament, was actively involved in the reform process. The metal hip controversy, and the PIP breast implant scandal, caused the EU to take a closer look at a regulatory system that did not appear to be working. “The notified bodies and their relationships with industry was one of the questions raised,” says McGuinness.Officials from the commission’s directorate on health and food safety, which is based in Co Meath, went out to the member states and closed down a number of notified bodies, she says, some of which were “not fit for purpose”.Now that a more robust system is being put in place, the challenge is to get the people with the required skills. “People want less bureaucracy but more safety, but that takes more regulation and it takes resources,” says McGuinness.Brexit is not helping matters as the UK’s four notified bodies currently account for a large proportion of the new medical devices that get CE marks ever year. It is likely the UK notified bodies will open offices in other EU member states so they can continue working, but the disruption is another complication at a time when the system is undergoing reform, the number of new technologies seeking certification continues to grow, and the number of notified bodies is being reduced.“The industry is moving so fast and so furiously,” says McGuinness. “There is a need to draw people out from industry to work on regulation, as no one else would know the necessary detail.”Medical devices are often not screened by way of clinical trials before they are approved for the market, in the way new drugs are, but this is because they act in a fundamentally different way, says Dr Niall MacAleenan, head of the medical devices section at the HPRA.Innovative devices that have been developed over recent years have transformed medical services, saved and extended countless lives, and provided ways to ease the suffering of huge numbers of people with chronic conditions. Stents have transformed cardiac care, while insulin pumps, pain-management devices and improved prosthetics have brought relief to tens of millions.In part because medical technology has been so successful, the devices that are now available are often inside people’s bodies for years, if not decades. Also new, high-risk technologies introduced for people with conditions likely to cause death if not untreated sometimes become less risky as they are developed over time and surgeons become more skilled at implanting them, thereby changing the risk-benefit analysis.For these and other reasons, new devices are often allowed on to the market after serious laboratory-based and other testing, but without being tested on humans. The manufacturers are then obliged to monitor their use and to report back to regulators any apparent problems that may be coming to their notice. This is called “post-market surveillance”.The regime involves the making of “risk-benefit” estimations, says MacAleenan. With implanted devices especially, “there is always risk. The question is if it an acceptable level of risk.”Over recent years manufacturers and doctors have been reporting more than 800 adverse incidents a year to the HPRA. These are adverse medical events which would not be expected, ie a sudden failure of a device as against, for example, a patient who had a very severe cardiac condition dying of a heart attack. Many of the ensuing investigations have established either a definitive link with a medical device, or a conclusion that a device was probably or could have been a contributory factor to the adverse incident. No deaths have been definitively found to be directly attributable to a medical device over recent years, MacAleenan says.Frequently the response to such incidents is the taking of what is called a “field action”, which might be renewed or revised advice on the use of the device, or alterations to its nature.An interesting feature of the reports is that in between a fifth to a quarter of the incidents the device has not been retrieved from the person who suffered the adverse incident, and so it cannot be examined by the HPRA investigators.“Incident reports are not the be-all and end-all of what we do and are only part of the post-market surveillance,” says MacAleenan. The manufacturers are audited to ensure they are properly collecting information about their products and responding to any difficulties that may be emerging.The resolution of a lot of the problems identified is most often arrived at from dialogue between the manufacturer and the regulator, and often involves solutions suggested by the manufacturer.Medical devices are not like cars or other machines that can be withdrawn from the market without serious negative consequences if a problem is identified. Often the devices are providing crucial benefits to people who are in dire need of care, and the identified flaw feeds into a new risk-benefit analysis.“Medical technology has completely changed the treatment of so many different conditions,” says MacAleenan. “Many areas of medical care have been revolutionised.”The expectation is that the revolution is going to continue and that the medical device sector is set to involve a lot more connected technology, which will collect data from, and deliver instructions to, sophisticated medical devices. (The former US vice-president Dick Cheney had his heart device’s wireless capability switched off so it could not be hacked by terrorists anxious to kill him.)More and more devices are being managed by lay people and are being controlled outside hospital environments.The reformed EU regulatory regime for medical devices creates challenges for the sector and is likely to see an increased level of clinical screening, and increased amounts of information becoming available to the public, says MacAleenan.The challenges facing the regulatory system arise from the new improved regime, but also the changing nature of the technologies being produced by an innovative sector that shows no signs of slowing down.A special investigation by The  in association with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3709939.1543164372!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"suspect device the all metal hip replacement that caused untold hardship","story":"The DePuy ASR hip launched in 2004, was promoted as a game changer in orthopaedics, with 3,300 patients receiving the hip in Ireland.  Problems were discovered, resulting in its recall in Ireland in 2010. Video: Bryan O’Brien Report: Colm Keena\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGillian O’Sullivan: ‘He told me there was a lovely new hip on the market that could last a lifetime . . . I would never look back.’Scandals involving breast implants and all-metal hips prosthetics have raised global concerns and prompted regulatory reform in the European Union. Now the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) has conducted a major investigation into the medical device sector.The debacle that is the DePuy metal hip illuminates the ways medical devices are brought to market and the mayhem that can ensue if a product fails to live up to expectations.On a per capita basis, more of the DePuy hips were implanted in Ireland than in any other jurisdiction. In excess of 1,000 Irish patients have issued proceedings against DePuy. Hundreds have already settled.When Gillian O’Sullivan gets up from her chair to fetch some hip X-rays, you can’t but notice that one of her legs is shorter than the other.One of the difficulties with replacing hips is that the artificial implants wear out. As bone and tissue get destroyed when prosthetics are being implanted, replacing worn-out implants with new ones is not a simple matter. For this reason, the practice has been to wait until people are older, and less active, before giving them artificial hips. If you get the timing right, the patient may be dead before the hip implant has failed.But in the early 2000s, hip implant manufacturers started to market new, longer-lasting implants they said were suited to younger, active people.In 2005, when she was 40, Gillian O’Sullivan went to see the highly regarded local orthopaedic surgeon, Tadhg O’Sullivan, in the Waterford Regional Hospital. She was suffering from arthritis.“He told me there was a lovely new hip on the market that could last a lifetime . . . I would never look back.”Her surgeon was referring to a new metal product from DePuy, a subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson and a major manufacturer of orthopaedic products. The so-called ASR hip came in two variants. One was a hip resurfacing device, which covered the cup and ball of the hip socket, while the second was a total hip replacement product, which involved replacing the top of the femur with a metal device, which then sat into the metal cup.Both products differed from what was previously on the market in that both traditional hip implants used a metal ball and a polyethylene or plastic cup. The DePuy hip had a ball and cup made out of a hard-wearing cobalt chromium metal alloy.Tadhg O’Sullivan was one of six design surgeons who had worked with DePuy’s engineers to design the new product. It is standard practice for innovative new products to be developed with the assistance of clinicians.At the time he saw Gillian O’Sullivan, the Waterford surgeon was showing surgeons around the world how to implant the new product, and taking part in post-market surveillance of how the product was performing.In October 2005, Gillian O’Sullivan had a DePuy hip replacement device implanted on her left side at the Kilcreene Orthopaedic Hospital in Kilkenny. In May 2006, her second hip was replaced. She was told she now had the “hips of Brian O’Driscoll”.However, her operations were difficult and she experienced pain afterwards.“By Christmas 2006 we knew I was in trouble. I had no energy levels, I was really sick, and you could hear me coming down the stairs. There was a click, click, click, every time I moved.”Her children could hear the grinding of her metal hips.In May 2007, she went back to Tadhg O’Sullivan. “I said, I’m in trouble here. He argued with me. He said I was in better condition than I had been.”She was told that “the god of orthopaedics” had performed her hip operation and that she should wait and see.By this stage O’Sullivan had moved from the Waterford Regional Hospital to the private Whitfield Clinic, also in Waterford. “Between 2007 and 2010, I was in an awful state. I would say to myself, I think I am dying.”Gillian O’Sullivan now believes that during the years 2007 to 2011, metal ions from her hip implants were progressively damaging the flesh and bone of her hip joints.When the DePuy hip was withdrawn from the market in August 2010, Irish patients were advised that their future care would involve the monitoring of the cobalt and chromium levels in their blood.After the withdrawal, Gillian O’Sullivan got a letter for an appointment at the Whitfield and Tadhg O’Sullivan warned her that she would be hearing a lot of public debate about cobalt and chromium ion levels in the blood. He said it was “all bullshit”.“They are trying to frighten everybody.”She went to see Jimmy Sheehan at the Blackrock Clinic again and brought along her blood test results which showed very high metal ion levels. “He said, you need to get those hips out now. They’re poisoning you.”In 2011, the right hip was replaced by O’Sullivan at the Whitfield, and a year later the second hip was also replaced. The operations, which were paid for by DePuy, were difficult, she said, and left her with a left leg that was longer than her right.During her original operations and subsequent operations Gillian O’Sullivan met a number of other patients who were having DePuy hips implanted or replaced by Tadhg O’Sullivan. Among those she met was Kiera Kenneally, who had DePuy hips implanted by Tadhg O’Sullivan in 2005 and 2006, the first when she was just 16 years old.Kenneally, who now lives in Sandyford, Dublin, is originally from Hillview, Waterford, and Gillian O’Sullivan knew her family. Kenneally sued DePuy. Her case was heard over a number of days in the High Court in 2016, but the case was settled with the agreement including a confidentiality clause. However, the transcripts from the sitting days have been seen by The .In August 2005, Kenneally had a resurfacing procedure done by O’Sullivan in Kilcreene. In May of the following year, the second hip was resurfaced.The left hip implant was replaced by O’Sullivan in 2010. During the operation, substantial metal ion damage to her hip tissue was discovered and there was substantial loss of bone.Blood tests taken afterwards showed cobalt and chromium blood levels that were, respectively, 10 and four times above what would be expected, the High Court was told.Kenneally has since been advised she may in time need to have a Girdlestone procedure, which fuses the femur to the hip so that it can no longer bend. She may end up in a wheelchair.The medical records in Kenneally’s case showed that before her procedure, Tadgh O’Sullivan discussed both with her and her mother the concept of metal-on-metal hips, the possibility of failure, and the issue of debris (which in turn leads to the release of ions).Gillian O’Sullivan also sued DePuy. During her High Court action, she says, DePuy “fought me all the way”.She also enlisted Nargol as an expert witness and he told the court that 90-95 per cent of her problems were due to the DePuy implants. DePuy argued that 90-95 per cent of her difficulties were due to her congenital condition.Mr Justice Kevin Cross decided that 90 per cent of O’Sullivan’s difficulties were referable to the DePuy hips, and awarded her €740,000. DePuy said it would appeal and the matter was then settled for €520,000.Unusually for people who made settlements with DePuy, Gillian O’Sullivan did not agree to a “gagging” clause and so is free to discuss her experience.In his judgment in November 2016, Mr Justice Cross said O’Sullivan was an “honest historian” who did not consciously exaggerate, but that her difficulties prior to her hip operations were greater than she recalled.As was the case with the Kenneally trial, Tadgh O’Sullivan was not a party in the O’Sullivan case, was not called by either side, and no one criticised his surgical skills. The judge said he accepted that O’Sullivan’s relationship with her surgeon had broken down some time after the second DePuy implant operation.O’Sullivan would need future revisions and would continue to be severely disabled for the rest of her life, the judge said. “The plaintiff will also be in significant pain, probably for life.”Gillian O’Sullivan says, reflecting on what’s happened to her: “You make the most of your life. I can’t be on a beach. The balance is completely gone, and I would fall over nothing. I get pains and contractions. I was in bed for six weeks after Christmas.”She is a mix of being surprisingly upbeat, while also occasionally displaying a fierce sense of resentment towards Tadhg O’Sullivan. “I live my life. If I’m upright for the day, I’m happy.”The DePuy hip debacle may end up costing DePuy up to $4 billion (€3.53 billion) in damages. Other producers of metal hip implants are also being sued.Although figures are not available for the Republic, total damages of up to €80 million may yet be paid to Irish recipients of DePuy hips, with legal costs in addition to that. It is the largest corporate personal injuries episode to ever hit the Irish legal system.Despite the challenges a metal-on-metal product presented, a new all-metal hip resurfacing product, known as the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR) system, made by Smith \u0026amp Nephew, came on the market in the late 1990s and began to prove popular.The device was attractive for young, active people with hip problems, and Tadhg O’Sullivan was an early fan. A former GAA player himself, O’Sullivan was known for treating young athletes with joint problemsO’Sullivan told The  that it was because of his extensive use of the Birmingham hip that he was invited to work with DePuy in relation to its new product. At the time “I was probably one of the most experienced hip resurfacing surgeons in the world.”Companies developing new implants often engage surgeons to assist them. Although DePuy engineers put a huge amount of work into designing their new product, this did not including clinical trials, something that was not necessary under EU rules.Simulator tests were used, but critics say the tests did not replicate the repeated stop and start motion that is intrinsic to human joint use, and were restricted to larger model components, the sort used by larger framed people.“It would have been a very good design process if they were designing a washing machine,” says Trinity College Dublin engineering professor David Taylor. “They seem to have forgotten that it was going into a human being.”Taylor, who specialises in materials that are inserted into the body, has acted for a number of people who are suing DePuy. For him, a critical failure made by the DePuy engineers was not testing the proposed product on people prior to going to market.The head of medical device regulation in Ireland, Dr Niall MacAleenan, speaking generally, said clinical testing of medical device products was complicated by the fact that many devices were designed to be inside the body for years if not decades.Assessments as to the suitability of implanted devices involves a “risk benefit” assessment. “There is always risk. The question is if it is an acceptable level of risk.”In January 2004, DePuy got approval from a UK notified body, BSI, to market its two metal hip products throughout the EU. Approval across other, non-EU markets soon followed.For the US market, the company had to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which was considered a tougher regulatory authority than the multi-agency structure operating in the EU.English surgeon Tony Nargol was an early enthusiast for the new DePuy product. In September 2003, he travelled to Rome for the product launch, where he met Tadhg O’Sullivan and some of the other design surgeons. He agreed to become involved in a clinical study of the device to be used to seek approval for the product in the United States, and also to become an “opinion leader” for the device in the UK.Between 2004 and 2009, the Newcastle surgeon implanted about 500 of the metal devices, making him one of the highest users of the product in the world.However, by late 2006 a number of his patients were presenting with difficulties. Nargol began to study the performance of the DePuy product in his patients, working with hospital colleague Simon Jameson.Among the matters they began to examine was the role played by the “angle” of implantation of the cup. They also began to notice that it was smaller models of the device, used in smaller framed persons, that appeared to be causing the most difficulties.When he revised the DePuy hip in some of his patients, Nargol noted a “greenish grey” fluid in the hip joint while doing so. This was “tissue necrosis”, he told the courts in Australia in an affidavit in 2013.In early 2007, he asked Ian Newell, DePuy’s regional manager in the Newcastle area, if he knew of other cases involving greenish grey fluid and tissue necrosis. “Mr Newell replied that he was ‘not aware of any’,” Nargol said in his affidavit.The response he got from DePuy caused Nargol to think that the problems he was encountering were caused by his work rather than the product.At a meeting with Newell and others in a hotel in Durham in September 2007, Nargol discussed the apparent link between smaller devices and high ion levels.In response, Newell showed him the data from a DePuy study of 89 patients who had received the hips in the UK, Australia, South Africa and Germany. The study subjected them to regular blood-testing to see if their cobalt and chromium ion levels became elevated.In November 2007, two papers about the DePuy hips were presented at the American Academy of Hip and Knee Surgeons conference in Dallas, Texas, one by Nargol and one by Graham Isaac, the DePuy engineer who led the team that designed the new product. Both flagged problems with the device.Isaac’s paper was entitled Whole Blood Metal Ion Levels after Surface Replacement of the Hip the effect of Component Positioning, and the authors included Isaac, Tadgh O’Sullivan and the other design surgeons, as well as a surgeon from South Africa. The authors reported that 24 months after their procedures, the ion levels for 50 patients (40 male and 10 female) showed three female (30 per cent) and three males (7.5 per cent) had significantly higher ion levels than would be expected.These elevated levels were associated with their devices being implanted at particular angles, the conference was told.DePuy, O’Sullivan and the other authors were saying the negative outcomes were related to how the devices were implanted rather than attributable to any defects in the device.During 2008, Nargol continued to have regular contact with Isaac, Newell and other DePuy representatives. He also began to notice patients with difficulties whose implants had been put in at an angle that was at or near the “safe zone” that he and his colleagues had identified from their research.In time, Nargol came to believe that the product was at fault, not his work as a surgeon. The implants put in at particular angles tended to fail earlier than others, and so created the early impression that the angle was the source of the problem.In August 2008, Nargol stopped using the complete hip replacement product and in early 2009 he stopped using the DePuy resurfacing product also.A colleague, surgeon David Langton, had by this time noticed a new problem with the DePuy implant called “edge-loading”, which contributed to high wear and debris and was, in Langton’s view, the result of the design of the DePuy product.During a meeting with Isaac on March 11th, 2009, at DePuy’s offices in Leeds, Langton and Nargol outlined their latest findings.Nargol said there were problems with the DePuy product even when it was implanted at the recommended angle. There was a “design flaw”, especially with smaller cups.One of the DePuy representatives at the meeting said, “we’re f**ked”, Nargol said in his Australian affidavit. Isaac said the problem was “multifactorial”, with the factors involved including patient weight and activity levels.Requests submitted through DePuy for interviews with Isaac and Newell were declined.In time Nargol became one of the harshest critics globally of the DePuy product. He and Langton became involved in litigation around the world as patients sued DePuy for damages. Nargol, along with Langton, gave evidence in a lot of these cases and the surgeons are party to continuing proceedings in the US where, as designated whistleblowers, they stand to make significant amounts of money if DePuy ends up having to pay out to the US Government for implants sold to public health programmes.The judge did not have to rule on the mala fides issue because of the position adopted by DePuy in the trial, but he rejected the attack on Nargol’s evidence. He said the expert witnesses for both sides had given honest evidence. Nargol would not be interviewed by The  because of the ongoing litigation in various jurisdictions.In 2010, by way of his involvement in litigation, Nargol discovered that other surgeons had expressed concerns during the mid-2000s about the DePuy product, contrary to what he said he had been told by DePuy.The highly regarded Belfast orthopaedic surgeon, David Beverland, told Nargol he had stopped using the DePuy product in early 2007. Requests from The  to Beverland for an interview met with no response.Nargol contacted Beverland in 2010 after being told by a former DePuy employee that the Belfast surgeon had experienced problems with his patients.In his Australian affidavit, Nargol quoted a 2010 email from Beverland to Isaac: “All in all, this ASR problem has to date been the worst problem I have faced in my surgical career. It has been a real nightmare.”Nargol also said that in 2010 he was shown emails from the Dutch surgeon Paul Born to a DePuy executive, dated June 2006, in which he said he’d experienced a significant failure rate with DePuy and would no longer be using the product.Nargol said that on several occasions during 2007 and 2008 he had asked Newell, Isaac and their colleague Magnus Flett if other surgeons were noticing similar problems to him.“Mr Newell, Mr Flett, and Mr Isaac told me on several occasions that ‘no one else has had any problems with the ASR’.”The DePuy metal hip was voluntarily recalled in August 2010 after figures from the National Joint Registry for England, Wales and Northern Ireland showed it was performing badly when compared with its peers.The registry collects information on all joint replacement operations so as to measure the performance of the different implants that are on the market.In its most recent annual report, the registry said that for the 992,090 hip replacements monitored since it began collecting data in 2002, some 7.27 per cent have been replaced (or revised, as the medical term goes).The replacement rate would be lower if it were not for metal-on-metal implants which showed a replacement rate of 19-22 per cent. The most successful type of hip replacement, metal-on-polyethylene, had a replacement rate of 4.87 per cent.“Metal-on-metal resurfacings have a revision rate at 14 years of 14.76 per cent and their use, as with all metal-on-metal bearings, is now very limited.”After DePuy withdrew its product from the market, there was extensive discussion as to how it had been approved for sale in the first place.The EU and the United States are the world’s two most important bodies when it comes to the regulation of the medical devices sector. In the EU, there are multiple “notified bodies” each of which can award CE marks to proposed new medical devices, thereby allowing them be marketed across the union.In Ireland, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) is the body that licenses new medical devices, while the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has a role in monitoring the safety of devices that are on the market.The DePuy products were approved by BSI, a UK-notified body. Clinical trials were not required under EU rules, even though the products are recognised as among the higher-risk category of medical devices. Approval by an EU-certified body opened the way to the devices being marketed in other economies, including Australia and South Africa. Many of the world’s poorer nations rely on the developed world for the regulation of medical devices.In the US, the FDA decided that the DePuy hip resurfacing product was a significantly new product and required clinical testing. It allowed the marketing of the total hip replacement product.In 2009, DePuy was told confidentially by the FDA that it would not be granting approval for the hip resurfacing product after reviewing company studies that showed it had failed prematurely in “significant” numbers. In response the multinational quietly withdrew its request for approval.The DePuy hip replacement product was approved for the US market by way of a controversial pathway called “substantial equivalence”.Medical devices can be approved for the market in both the EU and the US if they can be shown to be substantially equivalent to a product already on the market, or if they can be shown to be made of parts that are substantially the same as parts already on the market.The rule applies even if the device or parts already approved have since been withdrawn, even for poor performance reasons.As a study in the New England Journal of Medicine put it in January 2013, approval by the FDA by way of substantial equivalence “does not mean that a new device is safe and effective: it means that the device is deemed no less safe and no less effective than a predicate”.The study looked at how the DePuy hip replacement device came to be approved for implantation in US citizens. It found that the lineage of the device involved 95 different devices or device parts that had operated as predicate devices or parts to which DePuy said its new product was substantially equivalent.The predicate devices included ones that were “discontinued long ago because their risk of revision was so much higher than that of other hip” products, the authors noted.The NSAI was not able to tell The  how many higher risk devices it had approved over the past decade by way of equivalence, or how many had been approved after clinical trials, even though the information was sought as far back as September 3rd last.However, MacAleenan of the HPRA points out that precisely because implanted medical devices designed to last a long time inside the body are hard to subject to pre-market clinical testing, the data that comes from devices that are already on the market is particularly valuable.There is another interesting aspect to the substantial equivalence phenomenon both here and in the US, according to a Newcastle University biomedical engineer, Tom Joyce, who has extensively studied the DePuy debacle“It happens all the time that a product comes onto market via substantial equivalence, meaning that it is supposed to be similar to a product already on the market, but it is then marketed as if it is wildly different,” said Joyce, who has worked with Nargol and Langon on behalf of Irish plaintiffs.The EU is currently introducing a new regime for the certification of medical devices that is in part a response to the DePuy hip and other high-profile failures.Tadhg O’Sullivan told The  that up to the date that the DePuy products were withdrawn, he never had a problem with any of his resurfacing patients.Despite the global controversy over the performance of DePuy hip, there is no mistaking O’Sullivan’s continuing enthusiasm for the product.During a lengthy interview in his consultation rooms in the Whitfield Clinic, O’Sullivan said the DePuy implant was an important innovation for patients with serious hip problems.Asked if in his view there was a design flaw with the DePuy hip resurfacing device, his answer was simple: “Not really. If put in properly, no.”Likewise, he said he did not believe there was a flaw with the ball and cup of the total hip replacement product, though there was a problem with the stem that attached it to the patient’s femur.He believed that DePuy, and J\u0026ampJ, were probably acting on the advice of lawyers when they decided to withdraw the product from the market. The decision, he says, was the equivalent of saying: “Sue the f**k out of us.”And that, he said, is what has happened.DePuy has “pumped an outrageous amount of money into putting this thing right. Unfortunately, the more they pump in, the more our legal profession want. They’re like an insatiable dog.”As well as assisting the DePuy engineers and attending design team meetings over a number of years, O’Sullivan was also the co-inventor of two patents registered in the name of DePuy that were associated with the hip product.Publicly available information in the US indicates that the two US design surgeons who worked with O’Sullivan on the DePuy project, Tom Schmalzried and Thomas Veil, received a number of million dollars each in royalties and other payments from the manufacturer.However, O’Sullivan says his royalty income from DePuy was “relatively small” and that if the time he had spent as a design surgeon travelling to meetings and conferences for DePuy had instead been spent working at the Whitfield Clinic he would have been equally well rewarded.He has earned more from DePuy as a result of the programme it has put in place for patients post the withdrawal of the hip product than he did while working as a design surgeon, he said.The enormous global medical legal battle that has erupted since the product was recalled has led to a great amount of misinformation coming into the public domain, the surgeon said. “We have poor people coming in here thinking they are going to die.” It is “very hard to get at the truth when there is a huge amount of money to be made from suing a company”. he added.O’Sullivan said he had not seen one paper which, read closely, showed heightened cobalt and chromium levels causing medical problems. Yet people were coming to him now, he said, with normal ageing problems such as becoming forgetful, and blaming it on their ion levels.The patient may feel fantastic, and may have no problem with their hips, but he tells them the only way to get their ion levels down is “to take out the generator”. It is their choice.Surgeons want to do what is best for their patients, he said. The DePuy project was about “trying to help people of 30 years of age who needed a hip and not be sending them home and have them not working for the next 20 years.”As matters now stand, most metal hip products have been withdrawn from the market and all major manufacturers are producing a similar ceramic ball and cup product. “They’re all giving you the basic Ford Focus.”The threat of being sued means doctors feel pressurised into doing what is safest in terms of legal exposure, rather than what is most appropriate for their patients.Surgeons know that if they put in a product that has been around for decades, but which fails, they cannot be sued, he said. And manufacturers, if they are going to fear being sued, are deterred from creating new devices.The loser in the end, he says, because of the stifling of innovation, is the patient.A special alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process has been put in place by the Irish courts such is the level of claims that have been lodged against DePuy over its metal hip product.The highest award to date has been €750,000, but the average is in the region of €100,000. If a settlement is not agreed, a claimant can take their case to court.As of July, 540 of the 1,108 sets of proceedings lodged against DePuy had been resolved. Many of the proceedings lodged do not qualify for the ADR.A spokeswoman for DePuy said she would not give a figure for total awards made in Ireland to date.“DePuy has no greater responsibility than to the patients who use our products,” she said in a statement to The . “We are committed to the wellbeing of our patients and believe the full history of the ASR system shows we have worked properly and responsibly to improve patients’ lives through innovation.“We will continue to stand by our patients.”A special investigation by The  in association with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3709748.1543162681!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu leaders have endorsed brexit deal at summit in brussels","story":"In a press conference in Brussels, President of the European Commission Donald Tusk, confirmed that the 27 EU states have ratified Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal.

Photograph: Sascha SteinbackEPA European Union leaders warned the British parliament not to wreck Theresa May’s Brexit deal, saying a package agreed with the prime minister on Sunday was the best Britain will get.“Those who think that, by rejecting the deal, they would get a better deal, will be disappointed,” European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker told reporters after the 27 other EU leaders formally endorsed a treaty setting terms for British withdrawal in March and an outline of a future EU-UK trade pact.Asked whether there was any chance Brussels would reopen the pact if an alliance of pro- and anti-Brexit forces votes it down in the House of Commons, Mr Juncker simply stressed “this is the best deal possible” – although summit chair Donald Tusk sounded more guarded, saying he did not want to consider hypotheticals.Mrs May used a post-summit news conference to make a sales pitch for her plan, telling television viewers at home that it was the “only possible deal”, offering control of UK borders and budgets while maintaining close co-operation with EU regulations that was good for business and the security of the broader region.“In any negotiation, you do not get everything you want. I think the British people understand that,” said Mrs May who arrived after the endorsement to voice hopes for continued close ties.Parliament’s vote could open the door to a “brighter future” or condemn the country to more ision, she said. “I will make the case for this deal with all my heart,” she added, declining to answer whether she would resign if parliament rejects it.The alternative to the withdrawal treaty between the EU and the UK formally signed off in Brussels on Sunday morning is “no deal and a cliff-edge Brexit”, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said after the conclusion of the summit.“It’s going to become more and more obvious that the alternative to this deal is a no deal scenario,” Mr Varadkar told reporters after EU leaders emerged from the European Council meeting.Echoing other EU leaders, Mr Varadkar said that the withdrawal treaty is the “only deal that’s on the table”.“I hear a lot of people talking about better deals and alternative deals. And anyone can have a better deal or an alternative deal in their own minds but an agreement – 500 pages long, that 28 member states can sign up to – nobody has that,” he said.Asked if he was ruling out any change to the exit mechanism from the backstop, which has emerged as a significant issue in London, the Taoiseach replied: “I am, and it’s not just me, it’s the entire European Union today was very much of the view there couldn’t be a renegotiation.“You know, it wasn’t easy to get to this point. And once you start to open up one issue, you could potentially open up other issues as well. We saw in the last couple of days the extent to which Gibraltar could become an issue. Some countries were reluctant to accept that there will be a single customs territory between the EU and the UK because they feel that gives the UK preferential access to European markets.“So you see that is the core difficulty with people who are arguing that there is a better deal on offer or a better deal can be negotiated. They don’t agree among themselves what a better deal could be, they probably wouldn’t have a majority in parliament for an alternative deal, and they certainly wouldn’t have 28 member states signed up to it,” he said.“So really what’s being put before the European Parliament and the House of Commons is a deal – any other deal really only exists in people’s imaginations,” Mr Varadkar added.“There are almost as many alternatives as there are MPs. Any one of us could in our own minds dream up a perfect deal that would be better for us, but the whole point of any of these alternatives that are being mooted is that they would not command support of 28 member states ... These are just ideas that people have,” he said.Mr Varadkar said that he understood the position of the Democratic Unionist Party, which props up Mrs May’s minority government, but he would “posit a counterview”.He said that the deal agreed between the UK and the EU was “very much in line with the principles of the Good Friday agreement”.He stressed that everyone accepted that Northern Ireland was and would remain part of the United Kingdom until such time as the people of Northern Ireland vote otherwise, but that because of its “unique history and unique geography” it had special arrangements “that on occasion make it a little different from the rest of the UK”.Mr Varadkar said he believed Mrs May’s chances of passing the vote in the House of Commons would improve “as decision day approaches”.German chancellor Angela Merkel, the bloc’s veteran guiding force, echoed that unwillingness to speculate on what she called a “historic day” that was both “tragic and sad”.But Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz, whose country chairs EU meetings until the end of the year, said there could be no more negotiations.“There is no Plan B,” said Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte. “If anyone thinks in the United Kingdom that by voting No something better would come out of it, they are wrong.”Amid praise for the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier’s team for bringing home a deal after 18 months of gruelling talks, Mr Juncker said it was “no time for champagne”, as one of Europe’s great powers walks out after its 2016 Brexit referendum. The harder work of building new relations now lies ahead, he added.The 27 leaders took barely half an hour to rubber-stamp the 600-page withdrawal treaty, aimed at an orderly exit on March 29th to be followed by two to three years of a status-quo transition period. The outline of a future trading and security partnership was just 26 pages long.Mrs May’s critics say it leaves Britain tied to EU regulations that it will no longer have a say in setting. Her foreign minister, Jeremy Hunt, said that the Brexit deal was a “staging post” towards Britain getting everything it wanted from leaving the EU, but that the arithmetic for getting the deal approved was looking “challenging”.Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said the deal was a “miserable failure of negotiation” which would put jobs at risk. Labour will oppose the package in parliament and work with MPs from other parties to block a no-deal Brexit, Mr Corbyn said.Mr Tusk said the bloc was determined to have as close as possible a partnership with Britain, which has long been sceptical about EU integration: “We will remain friends until the end of days. And one day longer,” he said.French president Emmanuel Macron said Britain’s Brexit vote showed Europe needed reform. He stressed that Paris would hold Britain to tight EU regulations, in return for giving it easy trade access. He also foreshadowed coming, fraught, negotiations by demanding access to British fishing grounds after Brexit.The pound has strengthened since the deal came together over the past 10 days, but companies and investors remain nervous.The DUP said it would try to block the deal because it binds London to many EU rules and the party fears it may weaken the province’s ties to Britain – a result of efforts to avoid a risk of a hard border on the island of Ireland.DUP leader Arlene Foster said on Sunday she would “review” the agreement to back Mrs May’s Conservative government if the Brexit orce is passed by Britain’s parliament.Wrangling over how to keep open Northern Ireland’s land border with the EU dogged much of the Brexit talks.Britain’s 300-year-old naval base in Gibraltar on Spain’s southern coast, had also threatened to derail plans. But prime minister Pedro Sanchez said he was satisfied with guarantees on Saturday of a say in Gibraltar’s future, saying on Sunday that Spain wanted to claim a share of sovereignty over “The Rock”. – Additional reporting: AgenciesDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph:  Michele Eve SandbergAFPGetty More than two weeks after the US midterm elections, a final result has yet to emerge as a handful of House races remain to be counted.But as Americans digest the results this Thanksgiving weekend, there is plenty of food for thought as the country looks ahead to 2020.While the election may have presented a split picture and a somewhat gloomy reflection on the polarisation that has become entrenched in American society, it was a good day for democracy. More people voted in the midterm elections than any non-presidential election since 1914. \u0026nbspA total of 49.2 per cent of eligible voters cast their ballot – this compares to a turnout of 36.4 per cent in the midterms of 2014. Though still low by international standards, this uptick in political participation is a positive sign.Most of this surge in voter engagement reflected a higher turnout by Democratic voters. In the House of Representatives race – where they flipped at least 39 seats – the Democrats outpaced Republicans significantly. More than 60 million people voted for Democrats in the House race. This compares to about 45 million for Republicans in 2010 when the party wrested control of the House of Representatives following a backlash against Obamacare. The level of support achieved by the Democrats is impressive – particularly as it is close to the 63 million votes Donald Trump received in the 2016 presidential election.But while the Democrats surged ahead in the popular vote once again, that did not necessarily translate into electoral wins.Democrats won reliably Democratic seats by large margins, though they failed to win House seats in conservative states such as Idaho or Montana for example. Democratic gains in Republican-leaning suburbs around the country were significant, however, and a real concern for Republicans going into 2020.On the Senate side, the picture was equally skewed – Democratic candidates garnered 12 million more votes than Republicans in Senate races though the party still managed to lose some seats. The apparent discrepancy again puts the spotlight on the Senate electoral process. Republicans continue to benefit from a structural advantage that the Senate system gives to conservative-leaning rural states. Under America’s electoral system, each of the 50 states gets two senators, regardless of population. Consequently, California, with a population of more than 40 million, has the same representation in the Senate as Wyoming, with a population of just over half a million.While defenders of the system argue that the Senate was never supposed to truly represent the popular vote, but rather give a voice to states, the political hue of the Senate has implications far beyond parliamentary democracy.In particular, the Senate plays a direct role in electing judges to the supreme court and to federal courts, a system that has resulted in a more conservative-leaning supreme court than the political dispensation of the population as a whole as indicated by the popular vote.While there appears to be little appetite within the US to change the system, Democrats have long taken solace from demographic changes which are expected to help their party in the long term.Population shifts and the increasing ersification of American society suggest that the political map is changing in their favour. The Democrats may not have been able to break the “red wall” of vast swathes of Republican-leaning rural America, but they are already making inroads into once reliably Republican states such as Arizona, Nevada and even Texas as the population of those states becomes more erse.This month’s election also delivered positive outcomes for Democrats looking to address the problem of voter representation. Several states included on their ballots proposals to change local election law. Voters in Michigan, for example, voted by two to one to loosen voter requirements, including moves to allow same-day voter registration, the expansion of absentee voting and the reintroduction of “straight” party voting, which allows voters to vote for one party for all positions by just checking one box – a long-standing process in Michigan that was abolished by the Republican-led legislature in 2015.In Florida, voters backed an amendment to allow felons to vote, with some exceptions – a move that will restore voting rights to more than one million people.In an election that was also notable for unsubstantiated allegations by President Donald Trump of voter fraud, moves to ensure that all US citizens who are entitled to vote can do so are a welcome development. Whether it will help the Democrats electorally will be a central question for the party as it heads into the next election cycle. \u0026nbspDemocrats take back the House.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

2017 | Terror attacks in the UK“We are also ensuring technology companies play their part by stopping terrorists from exploiting their platforms,” he said.In its report yesterday on the terrorist attacks, the ISC revealed an MI5 assessment showed “almost all attack planners downloaded, shared or consumed radical and extremist media of some kind.”Salman Abedi, the Manchester Arena bomber who killed 22 people including children, had also been able to manufacture his improvised explosive devices from online videos.“Action that affects their profits hits home harder than any sense of ‘doing the right thing’, and it is this that the Government should focus its efforts on.The committee highlighted cases where tech firms had refused to remove extremist content or co-operate despite Government requests, often citing the right of their customers to privacy as “trumping other considerations.”In one, an unnamed tech firm claimed the “violent and disturbing images” linked back to an academic site and to remove it “would compromise the quality of analysis the site owner provides.” Another refused to take down the website of a banned terrorist group.WhatsApp cited its “end to end encryption” for not revealing to police the final messages of  Westminster attacker Khalid Masood who stabbed PC Keith Palmer to death.The committee said it had been among the first to castigate the social media firms for failing to be more proactive in hunting down and removing extremist material rather than relying on users, organisations or police to alert them to it.But that was, four years ago after the terrorist murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby.Although the firms have hired more moderators to assess material, the committee was frustrated that they continued in many cases to be used as a “safe haven” for extremists and terrorists.Searching the internet for “how to make a bomb” returned almost 2m results and a search for “beheading video” returned 250,000 hits in a study five years ago - and it was likely to have increased since.Although the tech firms were developing algorithms to track down terrorist material and alert police to it, the MPs said: “It is disappointing that - despite a great deal of engagement - little tangible progress has been made in the four years...and the scale of the challenge remains significant.”The criticism was backed last night by Yvette Cooper, chair of the home affairs select committee, who this week wrote to Twitter, demanding to know why extremist material from a proscribed far right group was still available on its site.“It is frankly outrageous that these internet giants continue to profit off dangerous content, which we know can have fatal consequences,” she told The Daily .“These companies have been asked repeatedly to develop better systems to remove illegal material and have failed to do so. It is not good enough.”“Given the vast scale of this content, law enforcement and intelligence agencies are simply not equipped to tackle this issue alone. Social media companies must immediately take responsibility for dealing with extremist and illegal materials on their sites.”Senior counter terror officers said they had struggled to get quality data out of the tech giants for years. “They simply don’t get it, so to take action that affects their advertising revenues would be the best thing to do,” said one ex-counter terror chief.Strictly Come Dancing 2018, week 10 results: will viewer votes save Lauren Steadman for second week running?Comment: Leavers and Remainers will only be reconciled if we drop the Irish backstopEmmanuel Macron rejects parallels between French \u0026#39yellow vest\u0026#39 protests and Brexit Airstrikes hit Syria\u0026#39s last rebel stronghold after alleged gas attack on regime-held AleppoEU leaders approve Theresa May\u0026#39s deal - but minister admits Government could collapse if it fails in CommonsDavid Mundell under more pressure after Macron threat over access to UK fishing watersMueller probe is making me stronger, says Donald Trump in new bookHundreds of \u0026#39flash frozen\u0026#39 turtles washed ashore in New EnglandWar in Yemen: Desperate civilians trapped inside Hodeidah fear loss of a generationBow-wielding tribesmen scare off police searching for body of American missionaryThree ways Theresa May could yet get her Brexit deal past MPsComment: Bored Of Banging On About Brexit?

Researchers speculate that global warming is encouraging them to linger, making them vulnerable to sudden cold snaps.“It is thought that animals foraging in shallow bays and inlets become susceptible to cold stunning because the temperatures in these areas can drop quite rapidly and unexpectedly,” says the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.“Recently, we\u0027ve been averaging about 600 cold-stunned sea turtles in Massachusetts from late October through December. In addition, New York, specifically Long Island beaches, also see several cold stunned turtles each winter.”It says that loggerhead sea turtles and green sea turtles are also affected.Strictly Come Dancing 2018, week 10 results: Graeme Swann in dreaded dance-off but who will he face?Comment: Leavers and Remainers will only be reconciled if we drop the Irish backstopEmmanuel Macron rejects parallels between French \u0026#39yellow vest\u0026#39 protests and Brexit Airstrikes hit Syria\u0026#39s last rebel stronghold after alleged gas attack on regime-held AleppoEU leaders approve Theresa May\u0026#39s deal - but minister admits Government could collapse if it fails in CommonsDavid Mundell under more pressure after Macron threat over access to UK fishing watersMueller probe is making me stronger, says Donald Trump in new bookWar in Yemen: Desperate civilians trapped inside Hodeidah fear loss of a generationBow-wielding tribesmen scare off police searching for body of American missionaryThree ways Theresa May could yet get her Brexit deal past MPsComment: Bored Of Banging On About Brexit?

Cloudy with a Chance of MeatballsKicking us off is Phil Lord and Christopher Mille’s bizarre animated film about a scientist who creates a machine that transforms water into food. So far, not too crazy, but then the machine gets stuck in the sky and it starts raining food. Everything goes wrong and Flint Lockwood must save the day by flying up to the machine and kicking fried chicken butt. Yeah, a pretty crazy premise, but a fantastic film.Michael Fassbender may be one of the most bankable stars of the moment - having starred in the likes of Steve Jobs, X-Men and Macbeth - but in 2014, instead of flaunting his face, producers decided to make him wear a weird papier-mâché mask for the film’s near entirety. The plot see’s Fassbender’s titular character front a rock band, play SXSW and make ‘likeable’ music. It’s all just a bit strange.Almost anything with Bill Murray in it is a win in my book, but when you say the premise of Ground Hog day out loud - a weatherman who must relive the same day over and over again - it sounds quite boring. What transpired was one of Murray’s funniest films.With Star Wars being so prevalent in pop-culture, it’s hard to imagine a time when no-one except George Lucas knew what a Lightsaber was. Producers must have been shocked when this young director came into the office trying to sell a script about Luke Skywalker, R2D2, Darth Vader, Chewbacca and Stormtroopers. Thankfully, they believed in his vision and now we have one of the best sci-fi sagas of all time.A dream, within a dream, within a dream. Even those who watched Inception were left confused, let alone those who only heard what the film was about. Christopher Nolan’s final flick, however, was a masterclass in storytelling and one of the best films of the last ten years.The high-concept Speed is quite ridiculous really. Keanu Reeves can’t let a bus go below 50 miles per hour or it will blow up. It’s quite amazing how Jan de Bont managed to make his debut 116 minutes long in the first place, let alone making it a decent film in the process.Tim Burton is a director who could fill this entire list up. While he may have chosen to reboot numerous films in the past few years (Alice in Wonderland, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the upcoming Dumbo 2) it was his original concepts that set him apart from everyone else. In Burton’s head, the love story of a man with scissors for hands and a young woman made complete sense, while for everyone else - from just the premise - it seemed entirely weird. Luckily, he was given the opportunity to make the film and a cult classic was born, all while Johnny Depp’s ability to play the outsider was solidified. Post-Hook and Aladdin, Robin Williams was on a role. One of his standout performances was as Mrs. Doubtfire, the father-turned-drag-housekeeper. As a premise, dressing your lead male as a woman wasn’t exactly new (see Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie), so the filmmakers ran the risk of it all seeming like an overdone joke. Luckily, Chris Columbus managed to pull off the ridiculous plot (how wouldn’t the kids know it’s their father, really?) leading to one of the funniest films of the 90s.Like Burton, most of Yorgos Lanthimos’s films could probably feature on this page, but we’ve gone with The Lobster. The film tells of a hotel where residents must find a suitable partner within 45 days otherwise they will be turned into an animal. Try to run away and the other residents will hunt you down with tranquillisers. The result was one of the best love stories of 2015.Some comic book superheroes should not be adapted to the big screen (*cough* Howard the Duck *cough*). Ant-Man is not one of them. Against all the odds, Paul Rudd and Peyton Reed managed to make a compelling film about a man who could shrink down in size and control ants. What’s incredible is that - somehow - the film quickly became one of Marvel’s most beloved films.

While her original co-star Dick Van Dyke will appear, Andrews turned down Disney’s offer to return out of respect to Blunt’s portrayal of the magical nanny.Andrews has lent her voice to several films in the past, with roles in Despicable Me, Shrek 2 and Enchanted in which she was the narrator.Aquaman is released in the UK on 14 December, mere days before Mary Poppins Returns (19 December). The former DC adventure also stars Amber Heard, Patrick Wilson and Nicole Kidman.Support free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent MindsShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

They won’t accept my BitPay, what’s the point of Black Friday sales fiat losers?”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

On a weekday, when thousands of commuters were trying to get to work, college and school let alone the other, vast number of folk who thought they they would see the railway as their most convenient form of travel.Because it was in the North, the stoppage raised barely a glimmer of interest in the South. If it had happened in Kent or Surrey, to trains into London Bridge or Waterloo, all hell would have broken loose. Instead, it was just another day of misery, to go with the other numerous days lost, including when they changed the timetable, and the services across the North could not cope.Meanwhile, the Government is pressing ahead with a £56bn plan to develop HS2. Will the new high-speed link between London and the North-West change any of this? Will it improve things? Not at all. Will it make a difference that justifies such vast expenditure? Hardly. Is it a grotesque example of ministerial machismo, of gesture politics, of a total inability to see the wood for the trees? You bet it is.Archaeologists begin examining 10,000 years of history along HS2 routeNow we know HS2 really is a flawed projectHS2 requires extra £43bn \u0027for people to make the most of it\u0027The trains I’m talking about, the ones that were cancelled, were mostly on the branch lines, on the routes that people use day in, day out - not the West Coast Line, which already has a fast, comfortable service. In my lifetime, since growing up in Cumbria, and travelling to and from London to visit family, journey times have plummeted. On the main, trunk route - not on the secondary ones. This is where the problem lies, where the service is creaking.Cutting several minutes off the London to Manchester service does not matter a h’apporth. What would boost the experience immeasurably there would be to ensure that wifi works all the way, that a mobile signal is not lost. But that, too, is not what HS2 is about.Already, there is talk by those on the inside that the projected costs are soaring. The “main works civil contracts” on the London to Birmingham section, reports The Sunday Times, are “several billion pounds” over the official budget of £6.6bn. That’s before any earth is turned, and all manner of unseen, below ground problems are discovered.Conscious of a final bill that could spiral out of control, and being seen to get a grip, ministers are demanding that instead of sanctioning extra expenditure, costs are being renegotiated, to stick to the budgeted figure. This, in turn, has led to delays, as more design and development is required, and specifications redrawn. Again, the word is that the vast project - the country’s biggest and most demanding infrastructure scheme - is likely to be more than a year behind schedule.That\u0027s how fast HS2\u0026nbspservices will travel at when the project is completedPart of the issue here is that mooted figures are proving inaccurate, the result, apparently of an insistence that the new railway meets a deadline for the beginning of services, of 2026.The thinking behind this demand, that Britain is sick and tired of major capital constructions that seem to take forever to reach fulfilment (runway expansion of Heathrow was first raised exactly 50 years ago) is laudable. But put that together with a scheme that is huge and complex, and it can become a recipe for chaos. And that’s without HS2 being unnecessary in the first place.This is what ministers should realise: that £56bn buys you an awful lot of terribly needed enhancements, for instance to existing country and suburban services, and to digitalisation.There is a subtext, of course, to HS2 - one that is hardly ever raised, let alone publicly admitted. And it is that the 250mph railway has another purpose, beyond rushing passengers from London to Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. It is that the faster railway makes commuting from Birmingham in particular all that more manageable. House prices in the West Midlands are so much cheaper than in the South-East. Public sector workers in essential occupations, in sectors like the NHS and education, will be able to afford to commute from Brum. HS2, you see, is aimed in part at alleviating London’s growing housing crisis. Which makes it a very expensive solution indeed.When confronted with the news of the overruns and delay, the Department for Transport said it would not comment on speculation. “Our priority is to ensure value for money for the taxpayer.”Yes, but does the overall project seriously provide value for money?Ministers have the ability to stop it in its tracks, to ert the investment elsewhere. Of course, that would involve a loss of pride. There would be some dismay in the North, but not as much as might be expected - particularly if the money was spent on other local, much-needed advancements. Perhaps they should test attitudes towards the new service before it\u0027s too late.For there are warning lights flashing all over this. An awful lot of cash is being committed to something for which there is little demand. Getting from A to B may become quicker, but B to C will be just as slow –\u0026nbspand it’s the B to C that is used by so many people every day, that ceased to operate last week and will do so again, even with HS2.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

This is an unprecedented move but it’s an unprecedented situation. We’ve failed to get answers from Facebook and we believe the documents contain information of very high public interest,”\u0026nbspMr Collins told the paper.Facebook had some “very serious questions” to answer, he said, and he accused it of misleading the committee over Russian involvement in the platform.“It has not answered our questions about who knew what, with regards to the Cambridge Analytica scandal,” Mr Collins said.“We have followed this court case in America and we believed these documents contained answers to some of the questions we have been seeking about the use of data, especially by external developers.”Facebook said: “The materials obtained by the DCMS committee are subject to a protective order of the San Mateo Superior Court restricting their disclosure.“We have asked the DCMS committee to refrain from reviewing them and to return them to counsel or to Facebook.“We have no further comment.”\u0026nbspThe move comes after Mark Zuckerberg said he was “unable” to testify to an international “grand committee” investigating Facebook’s role in spreading fake news.The social media company will instead send Richard Allan, its vice president of policy solutions, to answer questions at a hearing in the Houses of Parliament on Tuesday.Additional reporting by PAShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Price-conscious customers are realising they could buy last year\u0027s handset instead for a much lower cost\u0026nbsp– despite it not featuring the brand new iPhone design – and that is thought to be having an impact on sales of the more expensive models.It is not clear when the iPhone X will be re-introduced to the line-up, or even if it will make it back onto sale. The iPhone X features an almost identical design to the iPhone XS, but misses out on new features such as an improved camera and upgraded processor.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

At six I wake in the box room bedroom at my grandparents that I’ve claimed as my own since coming to Cheshunt as a baby. Suddenly I’m 51: this is the last time I’ll ever sleep in this three-bed former council house on an estate on London’s northern edge. My paternal granddad Leslie died in 2014 and for over a year my nan Eileen has languished in a care home with worsening dementia, which means never again will she return to the house that for all those decades was the family home.After my grandfather returned from war, he, Nan and my infant father moved into a two-bed semi on a large estate being built for heroes called Bury Green: one of Nan’s ways to make ends meet was to clean the newly completed houses after the workmen had finished, walking the plank across muddy foundations, my father in her arms. When a larger, three-bed place came up further in they moved, the neighbours mucking in with hand carts.Empty houses are depressing, and this house has lain empty for more than a year it smells dank, there are cobwebs, and half the family photographs have been removed from the wall leaving a patchwork of anachronistic memories. Soon, when Nan dies, or her savings run out, this house, the sole childhood home of my dad, uncle and auntie – which my grandparents agonised over buying due to their socialist principles – will be sold. After half a century, I look round for a final time, and close the door.How a family hiking trip left me thinking about mortalityRecently I realised that dozens of places important to my family stretching back 100 years took place along the A10New River layline between Cheshunt and Soho. The birthplace of my father, two of my grandparents and my two children the places where I, my parents, and grandparents, met our partners and where we married several of my former homes, plus the ones in which my mum, dad and grandparents grew up schools and universities where me, my kids, my parents and grandparents studied and worked, are all strung along a 20-mile route which I have decided to walk in one day: a long trek into my past, back to the warm heart of my city.The November sun is rising over “New” River (dating from 1613) at the end of the street, the same street on which Cliff Richard was raised and whose forged autographs my father sold round school as a kid. Cutting through the alley where I learnt to ride my bike and where louts often linger with flickering lighters, I leave the estate, passing the graveyard where my great-grandmother Flo is buried, and cross the metal footbridge that crosses the A10, watching trucks and cars thunder to and from London.Being political animals, my granddad ran the tenant’s association, Nan the Labour women’s section. One day in the Fifties she invited an earnest young prospective candidate (who had no chance despite estates like Bury Green, Cheshunt was Tory) to speak to the Labour ladies about his policies. Nan was mortified by the way the other women sat, listened and carried on knitting, needles flashing and clicking like praying mantes. The pleasant young man was Dennis Potter: years later, Nan would watch his TV play Vote, vote, vote for Nigel Barton\u0026nbspand shudder with recognition.Piggott and his mum Flo in 1915\u0026nbspAs you walk east on College Road a huge tree – possibly a cedar of Lebanon – that has barely changed since I was a kid marks the start of Blindman’s Lane. Here, at 55, my paternal grandfather Leslie Piggott grew up in a bungalow without hot water, one of five siblings to Florence and Edwin Piggott, who were doubly blessed. First, because Ed was stone deaf, thus escaping the trenches second, because he was a nursery foreman which meant there was always food on the table – unlike many homes in what in the Twenties was one of the poorest rural districts in England. (Their luck would change: their only daughter died of cancer and their son Vincent was killed in action in the Second World War).Even when I was a kid – spending many of my school holidays in Cheshunt – the town had become a distant suburb of London, joined by the threads of rail, river and road, but back in the Seventies the town was overwhelmingly white Tesco ran the town like the Cosa Nostra. Today’s inhabitants are more erse and Turkish grocers surround the Old Pond in my granddad’s youth, the only Turk most Cheshunt people would have met would have been at Gallipoli.Piggott at St George’s Church in 1940\u0026nbspAt Old Pond roundabout – where Vincent Piggott’s name is inscribed on the war memorial – I turn right down Turners Hill, past the library where my grandfather worked as a teen before discovering the money in the factory was better, past the site of long-demolished Merston House where he was born in 1915. Turners Hill merges into Crossbrook Street, which runs down to Waltham Cross (still as ugly as the day I was born) and has another family connection. In 1944, when my father Michael was just two weeks old, my grandfather wrote him a letter from his RAF base:“On a certain April evening in 1939, my pal ‘Ginger’ Liddard and I were off for a stroll and a drink along Crossbrook Street to Waltham Cross. In those days, I’m afraid, I was rather a heavy drinker, but anyhow I’ll leave the explanation of my sins until later, so back to my story. We had just passed Cheshunt Building Society when all of a sudden we heard a ‘Hullo’ from the opposite side of the road, and when ‘Ging’ and I looked over we saw, what appeared to us in the dim light, a pair of very young girls. We stuck our noses in the air, said ‘schoolgirls trying to be funny!’ and passed on our way to the nearest pub. On our way back to Cheshunt we ran into the two ‘schoolgirls’ again, this time on our side of the road, and lo! And behold! They were not schoolgirls but very pleasurable young ladies of some 17 years of age…”Places change: so, too our perceptions. I used to associate Archway with pubs, kebabs and scary underpasses now sealed over but that was in another lifeOne of the girls was one Eileen Ball from Enfield. The pair began courting Nan was much impressed by Granddad’s good manners, smart appearance and relative affluence as a skilled toolmaker he earned double most of his contemporaries. In 1940, Granddad was given leave from the RAF where he now worked as a Spitfire mechanic beneath Guy Gibson to marry Nan at St George’s Church, Hertford Road. The photographs of their wedding day will be instantly familiar to anyone with English ancestry: grandfather in uniform, grandmother in white. Go into any English home and you’ll find variations on the theme: an ancestor in uniform, smiling uncertainly into the lens (not wanting to be at the centre of this or indeed of anything), a determined, set look keep calm, and if you come home carry on propagating the genes.St George’s has hardly changed, to my unpractised eye: red brick, imposing, small memorial garden out front where a mourning woman lays flowers. A couple of streets further down I pass Unity Road, where my father was born in 1944. Bombing raids were a part of life: years later my nan, an air raid warden in the factory where she worked, recalled:“When Michael was about six weeks old, early one evening, I was breastfeeding him when we heard the sound of what we thought was a hit plane coming down. I shot under the table in my mum’s dining room crouching over Michael, who, luckily, was blissfully unaware of the danger and went on suckling!”Unity Road is suburban, low-rise, and seems more affluent than the surrounding blocks. I have a photograph from May 1945 of a Unity Estate VE tea party, Nan holding my father in her arms (unmissable, due to her habit of tippexing outlines round family members in any group photos). Now, on the corner, perhaps on the very site of that street party, stands a vast Lidl.From Unity Road it’s a slog through scrofulous suburbs and a characterless stretch of the A10 (the factories in which Granddad worked – Murex, Thorns, Manifold – are now retail parks) to Bertram Road, Bush Hill Park. My nan was born at 104, and grew up at 122, poor, half her father’s weekly wage of £2 from Ediswans lightbulb factory going on the rent.Nan’s dad, Arthur Ball – a name I imagine caused some merriment in the factory – also worked in the factories up the A10. Enfield was heavily industrialised and would be a prime target during the war. One of Arthur’s workmates was Jimmy Dimmock: he worked in the factory all week, then turned out for Spurs of a Saturday. When unemployed, which was often, Arthur – teetotal, musician, talented painter – set up a group for dole-drawers in a hut. He sat Eileen on his knee when she was five and explained how everyone had a right to clean linen nan took it to heart. She left school at fourteen to help out and got a job at the same factory as her dad, where she was known like all the typists as an “office tart”,\u0026nbspand at dinner time Arthur would come through the rubber doors that separated classes (factory and office pool) with his trolley and give her jam sandwiches a taste of an older England long since gone to Pot Noodle.Despite her poverty, Nan’s memories of childhood are generous and rich, recalling games in the street, kids in and out of one another’s houses, evenings round the piano, doting grandparents nine doors down.The current occupier of Nan’s childhood home, Peter, generously lets me come in and see the place Nan was raised. Peter, a rough, friendly decorator of 53, and his wife have lived here for years but are shortly moving to Winchmore Hill.I’m surprised at the size of the house, with its big back garden and kitchen extension, and have to remind myself that when Nan lived here the extension wouldn’t have existed, and lacked even electricity, let alone flatscreen TV.From Bertram Road it’s a drab, dreary walk to Arnos Grove, passing through the middle-class ghetto of Winchmore Hill (where my mother grew up in the station house), the site of Minchenden Grammar (which Mum attended with Lynne Franks and Martin Rushent), Mum’s first place of work – the Metal Box Company on the North Circular – to the former council flat where her father, my maternal granddad, resides. All these suburban streets look the same, and I keep getting lost: at one low point I have to double back and walk a mile out of my way uphill. I’m less than halfway through my odd odyssey and exhausted, and for the first time begin to worry I won’t make it, chide myself for failing to do any preparation whatsoever – unless you count walking to the offie.Despite Granddad’s claims, the Piggotts weren’t drinkers and the Balls of Methodist stock so when it comes to alcohol, I must take after my mum’s parents. My mum’s mum, Kit Walsh, had to leave Ireland when she got pregnant there are rumours Mum has an older sibling somewhere who was given away. When I was born my nan was still only 36 she’d give me whiskey to help me sleep. Nan was what you might call a character, and great fun. On one occasion when I stayed as a kid, she came in saying she’d just met Jesus on the tube. We thought she’d finally lost it then it transpired she’d met Robert Powell and given him whiskey from the bottle she kept in her fake fur coat and taught him to sing The Men Behind The Wire.Now 95, Jack Brown has lived in a smart three-bed flat in one of the four-storey blocks for 50 years, raising with Kit six children. Many of my holidays as a child were ided between here and Cheshunt, between my two sets of grandparents. Today all the blocks are covered in scaffolding, making them seem grimmer than ever: there’s no entry phone and when I bang on Granddad’s door he shouts fearfully from within: “Who’s that?”“Me, Granddad. Mark.” (Adding, as always:\u0026nbsp“Sandy’s son.”)Granddad opens the door, looking every day of 95: he is short, as are all my forebears, five two, stocky, face still fierce, still with a purple boozer’s nose though he can no longer drink anything but J2O. He shuffles back to the lounge on his walking stick and we sit at his desk. Kit died at Chase Farm in 2008 a few years later my mum’s youngest brother, my uncle, five years younger than me, assaulted his dad and went to prison. An exclusion order remains in place, and now Granddad’s only visitors are a daughter and her partner. I ask Granddad how he is.“Not so good,” he growls, still with a faint Ipswich burr in his accent after all the decades. “I got robbed.” A week earlier, two young men posing as workmen on the renovation used fake ID cards to gain access one distracted my grandfather while the other took £400 he’d been saving to buy his communist chums a pint for his birthday. A few days later, just down the road, a 98-year-old was beaten almost to death for his TV.Granddad looks shaken, vulnerable: this family is no stranger to bleak times (Nan mugged on her way home from Bingo, Uncle Liam, stabbed, Uncle Liam, brain-damaged, Uncle Liam, diagnosed with MS, Uncle Liam – who gave me my middle name – who died this year), but I sense this might be the last straw. What a sad end for a man who stood as a Communist Party MP, who ed into burning seas to save Navy comrades after his ship was torpedoed, who worked for 40 years for British Rail, where he showed John Betjeman how to change signals and who once travelled to Moscow with Kit by train. Nan Brown often told me how they were invited to a grand ball in Moscow and as they ascended the sweeping staircase she hissed at my grandfather: “Jack! Your flies are undone!” “That’s nothing,” said Granddad. “You’ve got your dress tucked in your knickers.”Created with Sketch.The London that could have been Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Planned in the 1960s when bus use was declining and personal car use was increasing.

Now I recall Nan Piggott telling me of the reception at my mum and dad’s wedding, where my Irish nan’s contribution to the buffet was a string of uncooked sausages and where during a slow dance Jack slid his hand down over Eileen’s bottom as his wife suggested wife-swapping to shocked Granddad Piggott: two very different families, brought together only briefly in a ceremony at Haringey Civic Centre, my mum’s black dress bulging visibly, guests including Fairport Convention.Neither my mum or dad recalls the date they married (the marriage itself only lasted two years), but both recall where I was conceived: at a Socialist Labour League conference in Morecambe, shortly after friend-of-the-Redgraves Gerry Healy told Mum: “I will sleep with you on the eve of the revolution.”For a time, Mum and Dad lived in Rosebery Road, Muswell Hill, in a house with a shared bathroom Mum recalls bopping around the living room to Dizzy Gillespie as her belly expanded. Dad was quite the lad about town in the mid-Sixties: hanging out in jazz clubs and\u0026nbspshebeens, a groovy dude in velvet pantaloons. Once, he tells me, Rod Stewart nicked his dope another time he was on the door of a party in Chelsea when four scruffy looking louts tried to enter. Dad barred their way, to be informed he’d bounced the Rolling Stones. Dad got into an unspecified spot of bother and the young couple went north to Manchester, where I was born: a northerner in spirit but not a drop of northern blood.From Wood Green it’s another slog, through Hornsey and Crouch End and up the hill to Hornsey Rise, then right along Hornsey Lane, thoroughly exhausted now, wolfing eclairs and Coke, the unseasonal November sun blinding. Just before Suicide Bridge – immortalised, if that’s the word, in my first novel Fire Horses – a passing white van smashes the wing mirror of a parked van and the debris of glass and torn metal hits me: the van doesn’t stop. Nor do I. Standing on the bridge I look down over the bowl of my city, London proper.Empty houses are depressing, and this house has lain empty for more than a year it smells dank, there are cobwebs, and half the family photographs have been removed from the wall leaving a patchwork of anachronistic memoriesArchway Tower – where I used to sign on – has been transformed into an apartment block, reflecting the transformation of an area which in the 1980s – when I lived in a condemned row for three mostly unhappy years – was dubbed “where angels fear to tread”. We stuck the article on the wall, a badge of pride. Much of those years are now just a blur: dropping acid during the Great Hurricane, drinking with Pete Postlethwaite a blazing row with Kathy Acker.In my first published story, “Hatful of Holloway”, I imagined a terror attack in which Archway Tower is blown up and falls onto what used to be the Archway Tavern, a rough Irish pub where they cashed your giros at a counter and men waited each morning at six for the van to the site. The same year that story was published, I was at Archway Station with my wife and baby daughter when we heard about the 77 terror attacks: I remember looking down Junction Road, trying to work out the safest way home with our precious pram cargo, and suddenly it looked like a corridor of glass.Places change: so, too our perceptions. I used to associate Archway with pubs, kebabs and scary underpasses now sealed over but that was in another life. Crossing Highgate Hill, where Dick Whittington turned again, I walk down Dartmouth Park Hill, past the Whittington Hospital where two years apart our two children were born in the same delivery room, a continuation of a process of self-gentrification that mirrors the new N19, where plastered Irish builders have become Damian Lewis and Benedict Cumberbatch. My Irish nan drank in the Boston in the 1950s, telling me how anyone who refused to put money in the IRA collection plate was thrown out the window the Boston remains satisfyingly down-market, with racing on the TV and smokers congregating at the door even as goths queue for the Dome next door.Limping past Cathcart Hill, where I lived from 1999 to 2013 with my wife and then our two children after nine brief months in the country we were pulled back, to Finsbury Park (where, in 1987, I presented Network Seven and hung out with junkies on Six Acre and Andover) and then back to the manor, to Warrender Road, where we live today.Utterly exhausted I enter the house: my wife makes me tea and sandwiches, Daughter, 14, teases me about my bedraggled appearance Son, 12 shows me the game he’s been creating on his laptop. It would be so easy to sit here and sleep: but I have made a promise, to myself at least, so after dumping my bag I say goodbye and walk, past Mercers Road, the first house in London I lived in aged 18, where a regular visitor – much to my excitement – was Roland “Fine Young Cannibals” Gift, then at the peak of his fame. In the distance I see London Met on Holloway Road, where I took a degree 10 years later, and where, 10 years after that, my first novel was launched (and sank without trace).Past Lloyds Bank at Highbury Corner, part of which used to be a curry house above which I shared a room with my oldest friend which had no windows, and maggots on the carpet, and where we had to place a disconnected door in the door-shaped hole to allow the other to defecate in peace. Where, the day in 1991 I received the letter confirming I’d been allocated my own little flat, I picked up a bottle of cider from the floor, took a swig in celebration, then realised it contained urine.Highbury Corner, where the Islington Twins used to hang out, and those older, odder twins used to walk up and down in matching checked suits, and where I once slept in bushes at the centre of the roundabout, and The Cock, where Arthur Mullard made me get off his stool. Down Upper Street, past 127, the site of Brown and Blair’s infamous Granita Pact, which I mentioned in a novel past the red-brick Municipal Office where I both worked and signed on past the town hall where in 2003 my wife and I were the first to be married in the chambers: we appear on council literature. My mum and dad met just around the corner, at an SLL meeting: they saw eye to eye, not only politically, but physically, dad being 5ft 2in, mum 4ft 11in.Between them they were over 10ft tall.To the Angel and past Nags Head, for so many years our pub of choice: sometimes when I had no money I’d walk up and down Upper Street for hours, watching all the drinkers behind warm glass. Taking a right up White Lion Street I pass a Hilton, bemused: in the 1980s King’s Cross was still rough. Up York Way, we attended “acid rock” warehouse parties in 1986 today I turn south onto Amwell Street, passing the flats where I lived with J and her mum back in 1989-90 before it all fell apart (all me – my bad).Filthy McNasty’s – where I set a key scene of my first book, and once drank with Shane MacGowan – is now the George and Monkey. One night on mushrooms I had a bad trip there, and Amwell Street extended to eternity. At Roseberry Avenue I pass Finsbury Town Hall, where I was once best man, stinking drunk because I’d just been on the telly.Exmouth Market had pie’n’mash and jellied eels when I lived in the Peabody Flats (1991-98) I pass the pub where the blind man used to give his guide dog Guinness in an ashtray. Down the steps I staggered down a thousand times: in Australia, 1994, homesick, I was watching A Fish Called Wanda when I saw those same steps, my own flat. I look up at the tiny bedsit where I lived and died a thousand deaths, crushed by loneliness and rage some rainy winter Sundays I would walk from my flat to the Thames without seeing a soul, go days without uttering a word. I became so introverted, so lacking in confidence and self-esteem that I began to imagine a huge coat which as I walked through the snow would erase all my footsteps, leave no trace. But then Clerkenwell Green around the corner is where I explained to J that one day, I would be quite the catch, and she laughed and at Clerkenwell Green I learnt my first novel was to be published.I’d only been living in Farringdon Lane a few months when a new neighbour moved into the flat directly upstairs. By a bizarre coincidence it was J’s best friend D, with whom we’d once trekked across Europe D now worked as a childminder for Mike Leigh and told him about this strange event. A year or two later, when Naked was released, I was somewhat perturbed by the similarities between the Thewlis character and myself. Pure coincidence, of course though later, when D told me about Secrets and Lies and I asked if it was about her, D laughed and said – “No, Mark – it’s about you. Again.”When I first got involved with the magazine, I was also still vaguely involved with Class War, agitating at Wapping, appearing on page 2 of The Sun holding a misspelt banner when Princess Anne came to tour the youth project I was locked in a room because they were scared that I’d burst out with placards.Memorial for Sikh soldiers vandalised in first week after unveilingBrain implants will soon allow hackers to ‘manipulate memories’How memory can help build confidence in the kitchenIt has grown dark, and as I begin the final stretch to Soho in my long back coat, I feel invisible. Am I really here, or just another ghost in a city full of ghosts from Roman armies to Amy Winehouse? My steps and breath shorten the pain in my thighs, calves, feet, hips intensify: but now I know I will make it.I pass the Phoenix, site of my second book launch in 2010, when it seemed authordom was mine and easy. Eighteen months later I was back on the dole. As I limp up Shaftesbury Avenue each step is a torment, but now I see my destination just across the road, in Soho proper: The Coach and Horses.Why end here? Well, I had to end somewhere, so why not a pub – one I frequented when Jeffrey Bernard propped up the bar, and I had to restrain a mate from flattening Norman Balon who’d called him a cunt, and where, years later, for two short hours, I was part of the media aristocracy?Entering, I order a Guinness. The barmaid smiles and serves. I check my pedometer: 48,664 steps, 20.7 miles. No, there’s another reason I picked this pub.1999: My lowest ebb. Having graduated from college and secured an agent I borrowed £10,000 from a bank in anticipation of the advance that was surely coming, and never did. With fellow loons I drifted across the capital, drinking and taking whatever else I could find all night and day, sometimes sleeping rough at one point in Oxford Street I lay on the bonnet of a car and was carried for several hundred yards. Then, later, as police came to arrest me for causing a disturbance in my flats, I smashed my fist through a window and almost severed the hand entirely I was rushed to hospital but after being bandaged left again, still buzzing. Next morning a doctor removed the temporary bandage and I saw my severed wrist, tendons and veins dangling, like a robot I was rushed back to hospital for emergency surgery.A few days later I wandered into the Coach and Horses, Soho, where a pretty trainee nurse from Liverpool smiled and seeing my ragged, loose sling said in a kind voice:“Are you OK?”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The moment in question madeher look incapable of reading aloud and saw co-presenter\u0026nbspTess\u0026nbspDaly silently stunned as the floor manager (presumably) fainted. \u0026nbspUp until then, the most shocking moment of the night was one of this series’s favourites – former Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts – only finishing third on the leaderboard.Here are the episode\u0027s five biggest talking points.There were many sniggers about how our seven remaining couples might crash into each other when they all took to the floor simultaneously to lindyhop the audience into submission. But in the end, it was the judges who provided the carnage. When the music stopped,\u0026nbspBallas was asked to read out who came 7th. After a technical error meant her digital read out was unavailable, she reached for a scrap of paper and duly read out who had come first. Then she got the names of the professional dancers wrong. And was left to tie herself in knots before Claudia Winklemen eventually diffused the tension with a couple of one-liners. Seann\u0026nbspand Katya will be furious they now have competition for the most awkward moment of the series.Faye and Giovanni’s dream waltzAshley and Pasha remain the only couple to receive a perfect 40 (translation: the only ones that\u0026nbspCraig Revel-Horwood has given a ten), but Faye\u0026nbspTozer and her partner, Giovanni, got really close tonight. They were nervous after abandoning their American Smooth to save Gio’s bad back mid-week, \u0026nbspin favour of a waltz mid-week. But you couldn’t tell: it was a dreamy, graceful routine met with a shower of judges’ compliments. They finished top of the leaderboard and surely booked their place in next week’s quarter final.Stacey and Kevin’s fierce pasoStacey Dooley loved her Blackpool salsa so much she didn’t wash her hair for a week to preserve the memories. Watch her interview on Friday’s It Takes Two if you don’t believe me. After initially panicking about the ‘Paso Dooley’, she really attacked this number and Kevin choreographed an incredible routine to atmospheric, authentic music. After waiting all series for a ten they got three. See you in the final, Stace.Created with Sketch.

While Shirley and Brrruno adored Joe sugg’s hip-hop inspired routine with props, tricks and writhing around on the ground, Craig and Darcey were a bit more reserved. Two tens seemed rather generous, but then again Strictly are always looking to encourage younger viewers to stay watching the show…Lauren’s out of her depthAfter hoping last week’s low-scoring Argentine Tango was a one-off, Lauren Steadman was gutted to get underwhelming feedback for her salsa tonight. Public support saves her every week, however vulnerable her spot on the leaderboard, but she’s struggling to keep up with the competition now. Will her fans save her again? Pool enthusiasts certainly won’t be impressed after she and her partner, AJ, wrecked a perfectly good table by jumping on it.So, who will go? This is a very different question from who ‘should’ go? While Lauren was by far the weakest dancer, dance-off regulars Graeme and Charles both find themselves on the bottom half of the leaderboard. One of them is bound to run out of luck tomorrow night….Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

I campaigned and voted to leave the EU.“I don’t believe that, so far, this deal delivers on what the British people really voted for, take back control of your borders, your laws, your money. I think it has ceded too much control.”Support free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent MindsLabour MP Lisa Nandy, who represents Leave-backing Wigan, said it was “inconceivable” for her to back the deal, in a blow to the prime minister’s hopes of support from Labour ranks.Ms Nandy called for an extension to Article 50 to head off a no-deal, adding: “There is a real prospect now of no deal because many of those Leave voters, contrary to the opinion in Westminster, actually dislike this deal more than the Remain voters who contact me on a regular basis.”However European Commission president Jean-Claude\u0026nbspJuncker\u0026nbspfired off a warning to MPs\u0026nbspseeking to derail the deal, saying: “This is the best deal possible for Britain, this is the best deal possible for Europe.“This is the only deal possible.’’\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The only deal possible.”\u0026nbspHe added: “Those who think that by rejecting the deal that they would have a better deal will be disappointed in the first seconds after the rejection of this deal.”Outside the summit, pro-Remain activists took a blowtorch to a mock copy of the withdrawal agreement, before they were asked to stop by Belgian police.EU president Juncker says he would vote in favour of May’s Brexit dealEU leaders agree to back Theresa May’s Brexit dealTop ministers ‘plotting different Brexit’ if deal fails in CommonsTheresa May writes ‘letter to nation’ insisting Brexit agreement worksHigh Court to rule if Brexit vote ‘void’ amid Banks investigationSpeaking on the doorstep of the meeting, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said he did not expect MPs to reject the deal.“I don’t expect a ‘no’ vote. I expect a ‘yes’ vote and this is the deal on the table. I don’t think there’s anything more,” he said.Discussion about what to do in the event the deal was rejected was notable by its absence from the meeting, with one senior EU official saying there was “no appetite” for it after the gruelling slog to an agreement.“I don’t think there were any ‘what if’ questions asked to Theresa May today, quite a few were wishing her good luck,” they said.We don’t want to create the false impression for the UK that a better alternative deal is possibleIrish prime minister Leo Varadkar said: “We made the conscious decision as 27 not to speculate\u0026nbspon alternative scenarios.“We don’t want to create the false impression for the UK that a better alternative deal is possible.”Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz added: “It is important that everyone in the UK is aware of the fact that this agreement is the final result. It will definitely not be renegotiated and there will be no further leeway.”The European Council conclusions released after the meeting specifically thanked chief negotiator Michel Barnier “for his tireless efforts as the Union’s chief negotiator and for his contribution to maintaining the unity among EU27 member states throughout the negotiations”.\u0026nbspEU leaders met among\u0026nbspthemselves without Theresa May, and were then joined by the British prime minister to discuss the deal once they had signed it off.

The UK conceded in writing that Spain should have a veto over whether any future trade deal applies to Gibraltar – potentially storing up trouble down the road. Spain wants any future relationship governing the British overseas territory to be negotiated bilaterally between itself and the UK.Behind the scenes, officials in Brussels were delighted with the result, particularly the maintenance of EU unity in the face of British attempts to ide the bloc.“Many member states have had very particular concerns which are all legitimate, and there has been a willingness to accommodate,” one EU source said.“More fundamentally that says something about the nature of the union. The union stands up for its member states – like Spain, Ireland. This is the essence of the union.

It\u0027s the best deal possible and the EU will not change\u0026nbsp its fundamental position when it comes to these issues.Plenty of talk about regret and tragedy today.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIrish leader Leo Varadkar said he still regretted the fact that the UK was leaving the European Union.The best outcome for Ireland, and I think for Europe and Britain, would be for the UK to stay in the European Union, to stay in the single market and customs union, but we respect their decision not to do that.Former Tory leader and now prominent backbencher Iain Duncan Smith he confirms he won\u0027t be supporting Theresa May’s deal.\u0026nbsp“From what I saw in the last week and a half or two weeks, makes it very difficult for someone like me to support this deal,” said on Ride on Sunday on Sky News.\u0026nbsp“It seems to me that far too much has been given to the EU and far too little allies itself with our commitments.”Lithuania\u0027s president has discussed the range of options that are available if MPs vote down the\u0026nbspBrexit withdrawal agreement.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShe says there could be another general election, another referendum or a re-negotiation with the EU.Communities Secretary James Brokenshire told Sky News\u0027s Sophy Ridge On Sunday that MPs should back the deal when it comes before the Commons or risk taking the UK back to square one.It\u0027s for MPs now, of course, to scrutinise this properly but if that does not happen then, effectively, you will be back to square one with more uncertainty, more ision.It is important for people to get behind the Prime Minister, get behind the deal that we see being approved today, allowing us to move forward as a country on to all of those things that the British people want us to do, all of the domestic priorities.Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said he was absolutely confident that Theresa May has everything now on the table to argue for a majority in the British parliament.I don\u0027t want to contemplate the no-vote, I think there will be a yes vote. But more in general, I think this is the max we can all do. Both Theresa May and her government, as well as the European Union.(There are) no victors here today, nobody winning. We are all losing. But given that context this is acceptable.European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has warned Britain cannot expect to get a better\u0026nbspdeal if Parliament rejects the agreement hammered out by Theresa May.This is the deal. It\u0027s the best deal possible and the EU will not change its fundamental position when it comes to these issues, he said.Please allow a moment for the live blog to load\u0026nbspJean-Claude\u0026nbspJuncker, the president of the European Commission, warned them the agreement was the “only deal possible” and hopes that a better one could be struck were in vain.“Those who think by rejecting the deal that they would have a better deal will be disappointed in the first seconds after the rejection of this deal,” he said.In a veiled plea to MPs\u0026nbspMichel Barnier, Europe’s chief negotiator, called on “everyone to face up to their responsibilities”.Mr\u0026nbspBarnier\u0026nbspsaid the deal with the UK was a necessary step to advance to the\u0026nbspnext phase of the negotiations.I have worked with my team and negotiated with the UK, never against the UK, he told reporters as he arrived for the summit.Now it is time for everybody to take their responsibility. This deal is a necessary step to build the trust between the UK and the EU we need to build.The next phase is an unprecedented and ambitious partnership. We will remain allies, partners and friends.Created with Sketch.Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EU Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.workers sorting radishes on a production line at a farm in Norfolk.

Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said the agreement was the only deal possible.The EU has ruled out renegotiating the agreement, but is likely to come under huge pressure to do so at its meeting in December once it has been rejected.Created with Sketch.

radio.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but

The country hopes these discoveries will brighten its image abroad and revive interest among travellers who once flocked to its iconic pharaonic temples and pyramids but who have shunned the country since its 2011 political uprising.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

This is the people’s disappointment in the DPP,” he said, citing slower-than-expected initiatives that have drawn criticism including pension and justice reforms.Votes were still being counted in Taiwan’s affluent capital, Taipei, where the incumbent mayor Ko Wen-je, an independent, is in a close race with the Kuomintang’s Ting Shou-chung, and the DPP is running a distant third.Kaohsiung’s Kuomintang mayor-elect, Han Kuo-yu, who described the city as “outdated and poor” while on the campaign trail, told a rally he would go all-out to boost its economy.“We must immediately roll up our sleeves and get to work,” Mr Han said, speaking of what was once one of the world’s busiest ports but which has lost much of its business to China.There was no immediate reaction from Beijing to the poll results, where state media simply noted Ms Tsai’s resignation as party chairwoman “to take responsibility for the party’s performance in Taiwan’s local elections”.A spokesperson for the US\u0026nbspState Department praised Taiwan for “demonstrating the strength of their vibrant democratic system through a successful round of elections”.Taiwan television stations reported a high turnout, with some polling stations in parts of Taipei and Kaohsiung remaining open past 4pm (8am GMT) when the polls were due to close.Candidates fanned out across the island to shake hands and canvass votes, and held noisy, colourful rallies that have become the hallmarks of Taiwan’s vibrant democracy, in marked contrast to China where the Communist Party tolerates no dissent to its rule.Tensions across the Taiwan Strait have heightened, with China conducting military drills around the island and snatching away Taiwan’s dwindling number of diplomatic allies.\u0026nbspMs Tsai’s domestic reform initiatives, from the island’s pension scheme to labour law, have also come under intense voter scrutiny recently.Confidence in the government has waned in recent months after reform moves upset both the opposition and some supporters, who said Ms Tsai had backed away from promises to reduce the deficit and cut pollution.Underscoring Ms Tsai’s challenge are a series of public votes also held on Saturday on whether to make same-sex marriage legal, an issue which has deeply ided Taiwan.Voters looked set to back a referendum defining marriage as between and a man and a woman, dealing a sharp blow to Taiwan’s position as a bastion of liberalism in Asia.Created with Sketch.Best pictures from the 2018 Taipei Gay Pride March in Taiwan Show all 35Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Participants take part in the 2018 Taipei Gay Pride March in Taipei, Taiwan, 27 October 2018.Thousands of people attended the march in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan.Participants walk in the parade.The march took place ahead of a landmark vote next month on LGBT+ rights in Taiwan.On May 24 2017, the Constitutional Court in Taiwan ruled that same-sex couples have the right to marry in the state.After making its ruling on same-sex marriage in May last year, the court stated that its decision must be implemented in two years.On November 24, a public vote will be held in Taiwan on same-sex marriage.A participant of the march poses next to a wedding studio.A young woman from Chongqing in mainland China holds a fan reading free writers before the start of the march.Participants with Pikachu-styled costumes pose as they gather at the square outside the presidential office for the start of the march.Thousands took part in the parade in support of same-sex marriage.Participants in the square outside the presidential office before the start of the parade.A couple take part in the march with their baby.Members of Tokyo Rainbow Pride walk in the parade.The parade was awash with rainbow-coloured paraphernalia.A participant of the march poses with a fan.A participant from Japan holds a banner before the start of the march.A person taking part in the march waves a rainbow flag.A man, decorated with balloons and a rainbow flag, takes part in the celebrations.An American man and his Japanese partner, both wearing headbands saying \u0027Japan\u0027 in Japanese, kiss each other during the march.Thousands of people attended the annual march.Taiwan gay rights activist Chi Chia-wei attends the march.

We have an agreement that took between 18 months and two years to negotiate, it is in several parts, is over 500 pages long and as of today has the support of 28 governments.Anyone can have a better deal or an alternative deal in their own minds, but an agreement 500 pages long that 28 member states can sign up to, nobody has that.What\u0027s on the table is the only deal that\u0027s on the table.2.30pm update: Brexit deal is \u0026lsquonext best\u0026rsquo option - VaradkarIreland\u0027s premier said the best outcome for all concerned would be if the UK remained in the EU, but given that was not going to happen the draft agreement was the next best option.Leo Varadkar said: \u0026ldquoI\u0027ve always thought the best outcome for Ireland and for Europe and indeed the United Kingdom would be for the UK to stay in the European Union, the customs union and the single market, but we respect the decision of the British people and the UK parliament not to do that.What we have agreed today is the next best outcome. It protects the peace, affirms the rights and freedoms of European, Irish and British citizens, ensures there will be no hard border and also insulates our economy from major disruptions in trade.He added: What we need to do now is to get on with it and get on with the ratification of this agreement by the House of Commons and also by the European Parliament and when that\u0027s done, from March, April onwards, to get busy negotiating the future relationship treaty.2.06pm update: Spain hints at new bid for Gibraltar sovereigntySpain has signalled it is preparing a fresh push over the sovereignty of Gibraltar as the Brexit talks enter a new phase of negotiations.Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez claimed the Withdrawal Agreement, signed off by EU leaders in Brussels on Sunday, represented a win for his country in the 300-year-old dispute over the Rock.He told an end-of-summit press conference: With the departure of the UK we all lose, especially the UK. But in relation to Gibraltar, Spain wins, and Europe wins.Mr Sanchez had earlier threatened to scupper the special summit to approve the deal unless he received fresh assurances on the status of the Rock in the forthcoming talks on a free trade deal between Britain and the EU.The Spanish leader was pressing for Madrid to have a veto over how any UK-EU trade deal applies to Gibraltar.In an effort to resolve the row, the UK\u0027s ambassador to the EU Sir Tim Barrow issued a letter on Saturday confirming the Withdrawal Agreement imposed no obligations regarding the territorial scope of future agreements.Theresa May again insisted that it made no difference to constitutional status of the Rock.1.00pm update: \u0026lsquoWorst of all worlds\u0026rsquo Corbyn confirms Labour will oppose Brexit deal.Jeremy Corbyn has confirmed Labour will vote against Theresa May\u0026rsquos Brexit deal when MP\u0026rsquos have their say in the House of Commons.The Labour leader said: This is a bad deal for the country.It is the result of a miserable failure of negotiation that leaves us with the worst of all worlds.

but the EU has warned that would render the mechanism pointless.It would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade.At the same time the UK would be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries.On November , thereported that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab demanded the right to pull Britain out of the EU’s Irish backstop after just three months.The paper claimed the hardline pitch to the Irish government “stunned” Irish officials.Its claimed Mr Raab’s proposal was put to the Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney in a private meeting in London.However, the Irish Prime Minister told Theresa May that he will not accept a Brexit deal which gives the UK the unilateral power to halt backstop arrangements for the border with Northern Ireland.The EU has suggested a backstop that would see Northern Ireland staying in the customs union, the EU VAT system and parts of the single market.This will essentially draw a customs border down the middle of the Irish Sea, potentially damaging the union of the UK.Mrs May has suggested a backstop that will see all of the UK aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after .Brussels has two issues with Mays plan.The first is that May wants the backstop to come to an end after a certain time period the EU thinks this would be self-defeating as its possible no solution for the Irish border would be found.The EU also thinks this risks leaving Britain benefiting from the customs union and single market for years after Brexit - reaping all the benefits without having any of the obligations that full membership would entail.In June  European leaders said Britain was running out of time to do a deal because of the unsolved border problem.In July Theresa May quoted Shakespeare as she insisted the UK would not be broken up with a border down the Irish Sea.Theresa May has told EU leaders she is looking at ways of keeping Britain under their rules for at least another year as part of efforts to break the Brexit deadlock.Addressing the  national bosses at a tense summit in Brussels on the night of October , the PM said she is “ready to consider” extending the  month transition period after the UK leaves the EU next March.The potentially incendiary move has been drawn up by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier to try to end a bitter impasse over the Irish border.It would mean abiding by all Brussels rules until December  at the earliest.The news comes after talks on Sunday, October , hit a brick wall once again, as the issue of the Irish border continues to cause a headache for Theresa May.Theresa May has insisted any backstop arrangement must apply to the UK as a whole so not to create a border in the Irish Sea.However, talks broke down after the EU had insisted on a second backstop arrangement - just involving Northern Ireland -the UKs version wasnt ready in time, according to Downing Street sources.Brussels admitted in a draft trade agreement that technology COULD be used to solve the thorny issue of the border, using Max Fac solutions at the frontier as part of a future deal between the UK and EU.But the backstop - which keeps Britain in the customs unionno alternative is agreed to keep the Irish border open - will stay in the withdrawal agreement as an insurance policy.Ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith said: The withdrawal agreement will make it very clear that should we struggle with a negotiation for a free trade arrangement and not complete that process, we will fall into the Northern Ireland backstop.I would hope that she would now consider that none of this is at all workable unless we get the withdrawal agreement now amended so that any arrangements we make strip out that backstop.Former minister Owen Paterson added: As long as the backstop is in existence in a legally binding document, there is a danger that should talks fail the backstop becomes accepted.We would have the horror of falling into a customs union, the horror of having Northern Ireland separated from the rest of the United Kingdom. Mrs May dubbed the continuing row with Brussels over how to avoid a hard border in Ireland as “the one real sticking point left, but a considerable one”.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.On November , , the PM faced crunch Cabinet showdowns with her ministers where she will set out the details of the agreement she struck with Brussels the previous day.A number of pro-Brexit ministers are feared to be on the brink of walking out over the deal.They believe it would leave Britain tied to the EU customs union for years to come, because of the controversial Irish backstop arrangement.If the Cabinet does block Mrs Mays deal, she could find her position is untenable - leading to a Tory leadership crisis."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000450259066-e1542730861899.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"true story the innocent man","story":"The scene of the  sex slaying was beyond horric: Debbie had been violated with a ketchup bottle and her crazed killer had scrawled messages all over her body and the walls of her flat using tomato sauce and nail polish.For five years the police failed to garner enough evidence to convict anyone of the murder.Then, in , Ronald Keith Williamson – already in prison for forging bank cheques - was blamed for the horric crime and sentenced to die.But all was not as it seemed.Williamson protested that he didnt do it, and it took  excruciating years on death row before he was eventually exonerated and released.The nightmare crime made for a story which has so many twists and turns that it became the subject of a book by John Grisham, and has now been made into a Netflix series, The Innocent Man, airing on  December.Here, Sun Online takes a closer look at the true story behind the upcoming show.Ron Williamson was born in  in Ada, Oklahoma - the same town as murdered Debbie Carter.He was a natural athlete and excelled at sports, but his primary interest was baseball.After enjoying some early professional success - even playing with the New York Yankees - Williamson’s dream of baseball greatness ended with a shoulder injury that saw himto his hometown at the age of , his career in tatters.No longer a local hero, Williamson was dogged by failure and fell into a deep depression, living at his mother’s house and sleeping up to  hours a day.He was soon diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but he was never given proper treatment and self-medicated with drugs and alcohol.The downward spiral continued until his le finally hit an even more desperate low in  - on a night when Debbie Carter worked her sht as a waitress at Coachlight, a bar which Williamson frequently went to.After the murder was discovered, police interviewed Glen Gore, another customer at the Coachlight that evening, and he claimed he had seen Williamson arguing with Carter that evening.The police were also told that murdered Debbie Carter had revealed to a friend that Williamson, “made her nervous”.Police quickly identied Williamson as a suspect, along with his friend Dennis Fritz. Neither were able to provide an alibi for the evening, as they couldn’t remember where they’d been.Williamson agreed to take two polygraph tests, both of which came up as “inconclusive”.Without any physical evidence, a confession, or solid circumstantial evidence, Williamson was released and the case went cold for five years until Williamson ended up in Pontotoc County Jail in Ada, awaiting trial for forged cheques.There, an inmate named Terri Holland claimed the usually reserved and quiet Williamson confessed to her he’d murdered Debbie Carter.Police exhumed the body of Debbie Carter in May of  and arrested Williamson’s friend Fritz who also happened to be caught – on tape – confessing the murder to a cellmate.Hairs found at the scene were then analysed by the forensic chemist lab in Oklahoma City and were found to match both suspects and they were charged with the murder.Williamson, at this point, was still in a dire mental state.He had been diagnosed with schizophrenia in addition to his prior battles with bipolar disorder and depression.“Untreated, unmedicated, Ron was charged with capital murder,” Grisham said in , hinting at the gross injustice of the case.Denied access to medication by prison guards, Williamson became, “a wild man” at the trial.Scared and exasperated, he started shouting and screaming his innocence at the judge and jury.But his pleas didnt help his case the jury convicted him of murder and the judge sentenced him to die.Appeals were fruitless.It was only after Williamson had spent  years on death row in Oklahoma, and with only five days until his scheduled execution, on September , , that the judge issued a stay that made it possible for Williamson to be exonerated and take his le back.With the help of a new legal team, Williamson was moved to a treatment area for mental patients, where doctors finally concluded he was completely unstable.His new team of lawyers argued that Mr. Williamson had not been competent to stand trial and his lawyer had not effectively challenged the hair evidence or sought other suspects.In , Williamson underwent DNA testing that proved his innocence beyond a doubt and on April , , he and Fritz were completely cleared of all guilt.DNA evidence, meanwhile, matched Glenn Glore – the main eyewitness for the State at Williamson’s trial who helped to convict him – as the true murderer.Fritz and Williamson filed a civil lawsuit accusing the Pontotoc County district attorney and other defendants — including the city of Ada, the state of Oklahoma, Gore, and county police officers — of engineering “a  case that consisted of faulty forensic evidence.They also said this included fictitious confessions reported by jailhouse snitches with overwhelming motives to lie, in addition to the self-serving lies of the actual murderer.”Williamson and Fritz settled the suit and both men received an undisclosed sum of money.The spring after their release, Williamson and Fritz visited New York, where they took a tour of Yankee Stadium.Williamson said at that time that he was just getting a taste of how much fun they were having up here.”Sadly, just five years later, on December , , Williamson died in an Oklahoma nursing home, surrounded by his family after being diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver.He was  - and had spent over a fth of his entire le behind bars, waiting to be killed, for a crime he didnt commit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Anyone could veto it: Spain over Gibraltar. Or the Belgian Walloons who almost wrecked the EU Canada deal.

Im going to make sure thatwe need to make changes to support them then we will.Research has shown that single mums and women generally are some of the hardest hit by the Universal Credit and welfare system.The flagship policy, which is set to roll six benefits into one, has been beset with issues, but the new DWP boss has vowed to fix them.She insisted that the system was a force for good but admitted there were real problems that needed to be dealt with.Millions more Brits are set to go onto the new system in the coming months, as ministers transfer people from the old to the new system.Yesterday MPs demanded it be put back while ministers fix the problems with the scheme as it stands.Influential politicians on the Work and Pensions Committee demanded extra payments for those transferring over, a scrapping of the five week wait for people already on benefits, and moves to try and transfer vulnerable people over automatically.Ms Rudd said she wanted to make sure women are protected and have access to split paymentsthey are in domestic abuse relationships.She said: We need to give [claimants] more confidence in the fact that they can access cash immediately.You know people are nervous about moving from legacy benefits to Universal Credit because they cannot afford quite often to be without cash for a few days, a week, two weeks, three weeks.I have to make sure that they can have confidence in access in earlier.Ms Rudd said in the Commons earlier this week she would talk to the Treasury about extra cash for the department.Chancellor Philip Hammond revealed a package of measures in last months Budget to help those on Universal Credit - with a multibillion pound programme.Brits will be able to keep £ of what they earn and will get help with extra payments and debt management, but those arent set to come in for years.Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord.

And on one day, it hit  .And back then there was no plumbing. Instead, everyone in the city simply relieved themselves into channels which carried the sewage to the Thames where, at low tide, it was six feet deep on the banks.The smell was unbearable and so was the disease. Thousands and thousands died every week from cholera and typhus.But then, on an early incarnation of ­Toilet Day, someone decided to build ­sewers and an embankment keeping the Thames and the city apart.And after all that was done, the death toll fell to just about zero.World Toilet Day then sounds like it should be a joke. But actually, it’s not funny at all.Unlike Wednesday, which was World ­Television Day. Again, I’m not sure how we were supposed to mark this.I watched the end of Narcos Mexico. Hope it helped.THIS is not funny. But when an American ­missionary called John Chau, pictured, heard about how the ancient tribesman on the remote North Sentinel Island between India and Burma were notoriously hostile to outsiders, he decided he must pay them a visit.He knew, of course, that the th Century explorer Marco Polo had described them as cannibals.He also knew that when a rescue helicopter ­hovered overhead after the  tsunami, they threw spears at it.But he was doing God’s work. It was important work. To convert the heathen.So off he set with hope in his heart and a song in his lungs.He paid fishermen to take him as close as they dared to the island and then he did the last bit of the journey in a canoe.Eventually, he reached the beach where he was promptly hit by an avalanche of arrows. Which killed him.And the incident can’t be investigated becausea policeman lands there, he will immediately be eaten.NO one knows how the Starship Enterprise works. Or why the crew doesn’t fall over when it suddenly goes into warp drive – not even Zoe Saldana .It’s always been billed as ­science fiction. But now two boffins in America have turned it into science fact. They’ve built a plane that has no moving parts, inset. It uses electronic trickery, nitrogen and ordinary air to get thrust from what’s known as an “ionic wind”.And it works. It actually flew for  metres before it crashed into a wall.That doesn’t sound like much.But let’s not forget that the Wright brothers only ­managed  metres on their first flight. And  years later, we were going through the sound barrier.THIS deal that’s been thrashed out between Mrs May and all the European leaders.Does it mean,and when it’s done, that we will be in the EU or not So far, I can’t find a single person who actually knows.BAD news from Italy. After some crafty engineering work in the s, the leaning tower of Pisa is starting to straighten up.Tourism chiefs must be praying however that it never becomes properly straight, because Pisa without that bendy tower would be like Barry Manilow without the nose.I’VE always vehemently opposed the death penalty. With two exceptions.People who drop litter and people who block yellow boxes at junctions.They should be ­executed, on the spot. By sniper fire.It turns out, however, that only two cities in ­Britain enforce yellow box laws with one, London, saying that they are ­handing out £ fines as fast as the postman can run. Almost  people a DAY are being fined at one junction alone.Offenders say they can’t help it and that poor traffic light sequencing is to blame. Hmmm. Well let’s impose my death penalty idea and seethey’re quite so willing to flout the law then.WE were always told the HS high-speed rail link would be worth it, as it could cut the journey time between London and the North West by as much as  or  seconds.But now, engineers are saying that trains will not be able to go through the tunnels as quickly as they’d hoped.So actually, ­Manchester United fans ­wanting to travel from where they live, in ­London, to Old ­Trafford may in fact be better off using a horse.MANY people ran into the street screaming this week when it was revealed that one of ­Britain’s top bosses was paid £million in the last financial year.And what’s more, it turns out that the boss in question, Denise Coates, pictured, from the gaming ­company Bet, was paid £million the year before. That’s nearly half a ­BILLION in two years.Even the Tories were cross, with one MP saying that no one in the country should be allowed to earn more than a million a year.Well, let’s think about that shall we Mrs Coates, who started the business herself, has donated more than £million to ious charities. She’s helped the victims of cancer, typhoons and even gave £, to a school in Stoke so they could help youngsters in Sierra Leone.She sounds to me like a very sound, very big-hearted and very good woman.And then there’s the small matter of how much tax she pays.As she still lives here, quietly, in Cheshire, it’ll be around  per cent of what she earns.Which means in the past two years, she’ll have given the Treasury about £million.That’s one taxpayer coughing up enough to build eight secondary schools.Which means she’s done a damn site more for the country and the world than some bitter and twisted MP who just wants to get her name in the papers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Occasionally I will allow it, and you can also make some porridge or use the microwave.What you can eat: If you ONLY eat cooked fried meals because you don’t know how to make a sandwich, and you hang around the kitchen for hours a dayor spend every weekend preparing elaborate meals and baking, etc, this isn’t a place for you.How you spend your free time:If you spend all your free time hanging around the house, streaming TV show and talking on the phone for hours, we’re not gonna like each other.What you can expect from your housemates:This isn’t a very sociable house. We don’t do parties and we don’t have time to cook together or watch TV together, mainly because people always have dferent schedules and they’re busy.How often you can have your mates round:I don’t want to constantly see your friends hanging around the flat. If you have guests  times a week, it’s too much.How much booze you can have:As for alcohol, drugs, and other such things, I don’t really want to see people here ‘under the influence’. Beer, wine etc in reasonable amounts are obviously fine, we’re all adults here, but apart from that I don’t want any crazy stuff here.What you should think of your flatmate: I’m quite easy-going and I live and let live.If you have a proper job, this shouldnt be a problem.They go on: My new flatmates has to be a quiet and considerate person.Which means you should use door handles rather than push the doors to slam, and try to behave quietly, especially when its late or early in the morning, so as to not disturb others.And I expect your guests to act respectably when here.Calls for quiet dont even stop there: I used to have this flatmate who was on Skype for - hours ever day .I wont have that.Listening to podcasts and music or watching music without headphones is also expressly forbidden.And although the tyrannical tenant admits this isnt a very sociable house, they still expect their new flatmate to be someone who has friends, who goes out to see places, and does things like sports etc.This is explained: I dont want my new flatmate to assume that just because I spend so much time here, its OK for them to do the same.But perhaps most controlling is the renters attitude to cooking.Declaring that theres no cooking before .am or after pm, they say: Occasionally I will allow it, and you can also make some porridge porridge or use the microwave.Most baffling of all though is the authors understanding of what theyre like to live with.They conclude: Im quite easy-going and I live and let live."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000451556584-e1543095226631.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"aldi staff caught smooching on cctv","story":"They smooched in the cramped room unaware their passionate antics were being picked up on the store’s CCTV.Footage shows the man moving in for a kiss.He snogs his co-worker as she leans against a unit.Another still shows them wrapped in each other’s arms — leaving other staff wondering, “Did they or didn’t they ”Word spread that the lovebirds had been caught on camera, with them ribbed by colleagues.They are both dressed in their Aldi unorm in the footage taken at a store in North Yorkshire.A source said: “It isn’t the first time they’ve been caught up to no good but it’s the first time it was caught on camera.“Sometimes they sneak off to the office during work hours and the queues at the tills can get really long.“They must be really into each other.“Imagine what it’s going to be like when the mistletoe comes out.”The chain made headlines last week as parents fought in the aisles over its festive Kevin the Carrot soft toy.The source added of the passionate pair: “Other staff have been joking that it’s a good job Kevin didn’t see them getting carried away with each other.“He wouldn’t have known where to look!”Last year Aldi, whose slogan is Good Dferent, overtook the Co-op to become Britain’s fth biggest supermarket with a . per cent market share.The firm declined to comment on the kissing coupleOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Most of them knew the word sorry from pretty early on.”The BBC Two four-part series features scientic experiments used to assess infant development.Experts say our personalities and physical and intellectual abilities are shaped in our early years.Paediatrician and TV host Dr Guddi Singh called the study “huge” and the “the biggest ever attempted on the subject.”Assessing the development of children can help tackle issues such as autism and speech disorders.In another scenario on the show, one-week-old Arthur is the youngest baby in the UK to be fitted with the sensor hat.Scientists tested whether the tot was able to recognise human faces.It was believed babies didn’t recognise human faces in the very early stages of le.

Securing a general election is the only thing that matters to them.Jeremy Corbyn is showing scant regard for statesmanship and putting our country’s best interests a poor second to sheer tribal and selfish ambition.I will tell you one thing about Theresa May: No one can say she is putting herself through this for personal political ambition.Hers has been a tormented week of continued public duty and personal, selfless service.Stoic and steadfast, the Prime Minister has shown a resilience seen rarely in politics, probably last admired when another woman ran the country.The stance of Arlene Foster’s DUP is carelessly irresponsible in the extreme.A lot of the “backstop” stuff and the — unacceptable in my view — possibility of the EU being able to block our exit, has been caused by a bona fide effort from May to accommodate the DUP’s wishes.For me, it has been an interesting week in another way as well.I have presided over the board meetings of several of the six private companies I have the honour to chair.Dferent sizes, dferent sectors, dferent parts of the country, yet they are all saying the same things. That business is doing fine. Not what the doomsayers want to hear, but true. It is hard work but certainly not Armageddon.Companies up and down the land are demanding a diet of “boring, stable predictability”. It means they can invest more cash and employ more people. It is uncertainty that kills us.I am hearing from boardrooms that the Brexit proposal is fine, with one big caveat.On the plus side, a Single Market for manufactured goods will work.Anyone selling into the EU — yes, even China and Trump’s USA — has to abide by EU regulation.“Taking it” from Berlin, er, Brussels in this area is not a problem whatever ideologues may say. It secures hundreds of thousands of jobs and tax revenues.The proposed deal means business will be free to recruit essential immigrant labour on the basis of their skill and not where they come from.Choosing from a global, not just an EU, pool of talent is so, so helpful and will assist our international competitiveness hugely.But the one message ringing through my ears is, “Get on with it.”Regardless of whether a business is in Birmingham or Barcelona, Sunderland or Stuttgart, the wealth-creators of Europe, the payers of the tax that builds schools and hospitals, the job-providers just want their politicians to stop this rowing now.Stop the bullying, Berlin stop the rowing, Tories stop the naked, tribal, selfish manoeuvring, Labour — and just do it.One big caveat: You cannot expect anyone in our country — businesswoman or a guy on the line alike — to accept a deal that gives Jean-Claude Juncker’s lot the final say on when, indeed,we leave. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his team have bullied us enough.While there are a million dferent beliefs on what the majority of Brits voted for in the referendum, one thing is certain: They DID vote to leave.Giving the EU the final yes no on that is unacceptable and surely no deal is better than that.No deal means no £billion to the unelected, unaccountable Eurocrats. No deal means fewer jobs in troubled Germany and faltering France.Yes, it would be harder for UK business for sure. But not fatal. There would be a price to pay, but whoever said freedom does not come at a price There was one other thing businesses were clear on at my meetings last week.The quicker this country understands there is a greater threat to prosperity, jobs, tax revenues and a successful economy than Brexit, the better.A Corbyn government would turn this country into Venezuela in short order talent and capital would leave so quickly that John McDonnell would have nothing left punitively to tax.The message from small business is as clear as it is strong.The Conservatives, Liberals, big business and the establishment must stop obsessing about Brexit and focus on the greatest threat this country has faced for decades.And that is a bunch of extreme hard-Left business-haters who would ruin this great country and probably blame their abject failure on Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is in our national interest and is one that works for our whole country, whether you voted Leave or Remain.Like Mr Blair, she has also opted for five simple messages to explain the deal — an end to uncontrolled immigration, better trade, protection for jobs and taking back control of our laws and money.The cards, funded by the Conservative party, will be a major weapon to be deployed by Mrs May and her supporters in the weeks leading up to the crucial vote.In her letter on Saturday she says that March  will mark a new chapter in our national le.She added: “I want that to be a moment of renewal and reconciliation for our whole country.Former transport minister Jo Johnson - who quit government in protest against the plan - claimed grassroots party members are rising up against it.And he revealed that ex-Chancellor George Osborne, a fellow Remainer, sent him a thumbs-up emoji in a text message when he resigned.Mr Johnson said in an interview: “You really don’t throw a ministerial job away lightly.

I was really shell-shocked.”It seems like such a simple admission. But the reality is that with most celebrities, from the Kardashians to the Beckhams, projecting an unfeasibly perfect image of parenthood as part of their brand, many expectant mums think a new baby is going to be a walk in the park.The reality for most of us really couldn’t be further from the truth.Paloma also talked about the dficulty of balancing being a new mother with having a career.“I found it very dficult, the pull between wanting to be the greatest mother ever but also trying to sustain an inherently selfish career,” she said.The transition from being a woman with a career and all the time in the world to a mother wanting to continue working is no easy feat.There’s a period of adjustment and, often, the road is rocky. So here’s the reality, for what it’s worth.In my experience, EVERY woman who is a parent finds motherhood hard at some point or ­another, but especially at the beginning. And the women who seem to be sailing through it are often putting on a brave face, partly because they feel under pressure to do so.Often, people’s public portrayal of their le, including motherhood, is heavily edited, airbrushed and ­censored.The pressure on women for everything, including motherhood, to be “perfect” is clear.And,that isn’t your experience, with everyone  seemingly acing it, the pressure is on to pretend that it is.The vicious cycle is born. So it’s brave of Paloma to talk about her experience out loud.Given that every mum in the history of the universe has felt this way about motherhood at one time or another, we should be more honest about admitting it to be true.Modern pressures are making it so dficult I have to say I’m so glad I’m not raising a child today.The internet had still not been invented. The Twitter and Instagram inventors had probably not even been born.When I was growing up the only “influencers” in my le were my mum and dad.We ate as a family every night and there were three channels on the TV that all stopped airing by midnight. You had to make your own entertainment.Nowadays you can’t move for influencers on YouTube, Instagram and Twitter telling your kids how they should look or feel — and ­promoting lestyles that are simply unattainable.No wonder there has been such a dramatic rise in young people self-harming and taking anti- depressants. Too many influencers, who are hashtag “blessed”, don’t talk about the dficult stuff.Paloma, by the way, is raising her child as “gender neutral” — a ­decision that seems to be another indication of the pressures that ­people are under to do the right thing by their children.Too much choice and too much pressure to do the right thing and be the perfect parent can lead to paranoia.The best advice I could give a parent now that my own two are  and  is to find your own path.Don’t look too hard at what everyone  is doing.Don’t compare yourself to any other mothers, especially not celebrities with a team of personal trainers and chefs, and who snap back into shape two weeks after giving birth.Instead of aiming for perfect, just try to do your best.Listen, understand and give your child the one thing that really does matter: Self-esteem.Talk to other women, and be honest, evenyou are finding it hard. Because it IS bloody hard.So good for Paloma for being honest and fighting the tide of propaganda about motherhood.Because being honest makes it easier for other women who might be struggling.ISN’T it incredible to think that a hundred years ago, on November , , women were allowed to stand for parliament in the UK for the very first time Fast forward to the  General Election when  female MPs were elected.Yes, that’s in relation to  male MPs, so we still have a way to go – but look how far we have come.I know I am biased, but women are such a brilliant parliamentary asset.Look at all the things they bring to the table and to the conversation.Women are great listeners, good mediators, brilliant diplomats and inspiring promoters of family and equal rights. Oh, and we are resilient.Just look at Theresa May who, at a time when most men would be hiding under the duvet and emitting a high-pitched wailing noise, is rising to the unbelievable challenges being thrown at her by the Brexit process – and enjoying beans on toast with her husband Philip in the evening.Compare her to a politician such as Jacob Rees-Mogg who is doing everything he possibly can to promote himself and his political ambitions – rather than focusing on what the country needs.The PM is the living embodiment of resilience – a tough old bird indeed.ANYONE in a long-term marriage should take note of Dolly Parton’s insights on what makes her -year union work.“When people ask me what’s the key to my long marriage and lasting love, I always say, ‘Stay gone’,” the singer, reveals. “I travel a lot, but we really enjoy each other when we’re together and the little things we do.”Her husband Carl doesn’t like to appear in public or walk the red carpet – so she leaves him at home.Instead of glamorous date nights, they take trips in a “little camper”, go on picnics and eat at local restaurants, including a drive-thru McDonald’s.But eventhey are having a quiet night in, she says she always makes sure she is “fixed up for him because I don’t believe in going home and being a slouch”.You’ve got to love Dolly.NOT many people can ooze class, charm and elegance with their leg raised higher than their head – at the age of .Butthere’s one woman who can, it’s the glorious Darcey Bussell, who must be one of the nicest, and classiest, women in showbiz today.Goldman was one of the first corporate firms to introduce “lactation rooms” for women to express milk and it also runs free prenatal fitness classes at its office gym.It also has on-site day care where employees’ children are cared for  days per year for free.All of which is great – and let’s hope more companies follow suit for new parents.Mind you, it’s not like the need for childcare ever really stops – I still need an emergency nanny occasionally when my -year-old daughter loses her keys or my -year-old son locks himself out.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A new list of second-hand vehicles also shows their most common faults and when they become a problem for drivers across the UK. The findings are based on a number of key indicators, including the numbers of claims against faults and how much each car costs, report The Sun . A spokesman for Warranty Wise, who conducted the research, said: This data is derived from real cases and genuine warranty claims making it the most trustworthy information a used car buyer can get. “We are not suggesting, by any means, that these problems are guaranteed to occur, but it is the sole reason a warranty exists.” The most reliable brand is the Honda with a % reliability rating - while Seat is the least reliable with %. As can be seen in the following list, three Vauxhall models are deemed to be the most unreliable, while surprising entrants in the form of high end cars from Mercedes and Range Rover also are beset with issues. THE  MOST UNRELIABLE CARS . Renault Clio   The Clio is of the most common cars on UK roads - but it is still susceptible to big electrical faults and ignition coil problems. The most expensive common problem with the car is gearbox faults which on average cost pound to repair. . Fiat  The Fiat  is another very common car on UK roads, but is very prone to gearbox problems. The Italian car also suffers with problems arising from the suspension, electrical faults and also clutch faults.   Problems start to arise with car when it is close to eight years old. . Seat Ibiza The Spanish manufacturer is popular with motorists - but Warranty Wise say most common problem is with the engine and will cost motorists a huge pound.    Other common faults with the car include issues with the ignition coil, turbo faults and gearbox faults which all cost more than pound to repair. Normally problems start to pile up on Ibiza drivers when the car is nine years and three months old. . Mini Cooper The Mini Cooper is one of the UKs most iconic cars due to its association with the classic film The Italian Job - but they have a number of issues which do not come with mini repair costs. The most common problem with the Mini Cooper is a clutch fault which typically sets motorists back approximately pound.   But costly issues such gearbox or engine failures will set motorists back on average a whopping pound. To compound the woe, it normally takes just one-and-a-half years for the problems to pile up. . Mercedes-Benz C-class A Merc is an expensive car to buy, so unsurprisingly it isn’t a cheap car either to fix. The most common fault with the car is an electrical fault which costs on average pound to fix.   Other common problems include sensor faults, suspension faults, engine faults and problems with the alternator. But it does normally take close to a decade for the issues to surface. . Vauxhall Astra Despite being Vauxhalls second best selling model behind the Corsa in the UK - some of the most common faults will set you back a small fortune to repair. The most common warranty claim is for gearbox issues - which cost more than pound, to fix.   Another major problem with car is with engine faults normally costing around pound to repair - alongside electrical and clutch faults. It normally takes nine years and three months for problems to pile up. . Peugeot  French manufacturer Peugeot has a reputation for unreliability. The most common fault with the car includes engine problems, faults with cylinder head gasket, clutch faults, electrical faults and gearbox faults.   The priciest problem with Peugot is engine faults which on average cost owners pound. But it normally takes  years and two months for problems to pile up. . Vauxhall Insignia This is Vauxhall’s second entry to the list, a popular saloon car with families. Warranty Wise state the biggest problem with the vehicle comes down problems with the steering.   This usually costs around pound to repair but other common faults include engine faults and gearbox faults which typically cost more than pound, to fix. It normally takes seven years and seven months for problems to pile up. . Vauxhall Zafira Vauxhall makes yet another entry into the list - and the Zafira has been the subject of ious recalls due to fire fears that have been caused in the main by replacement parts. But the most common fault with the car is down to problems with the gearbox which on averages costs more than pound, to repair.   More common issues include clutch faults, problems with ignition coil, alternator and ious electrical faults. It normally takes  years and three months for the problems to develop. . Range Rover Sport A Range Rover Sport does not come cheap, so its unsurprising that the cars most common faults are expensive to fix. Warranty Wise claims the most common fault with the car is its suspension, which on average costs around pound to repair.   More common faults include problems with the alternator, brake faults, electrical faults and EGR Valve faults - and it usually takes around nine years for these problems to build up. For those reasons, it is one of the most unreliable cars on the market.

Mums to be should ideally take it months before conceiving, but certainly from a positive shypregnancy test until the end of the “sensitive period”  weeks into the pregnancy. However, many shypregnancies are unplanned and some women can’t access the recommended folic acid supplements. So they and their unborn babies are vulnerable. So what’s to be done  Well, the Government has come up with a scheme to forty flour with folic acid in a bid to tackle foetal abnormalities. The UK has some of the highest levels of abnormalities in Europe.   Many women currently don’t get enough folate during pregnancy, and there are about , pregnancies affected by abnormalities each year. The plan should be an effective way to ensure women achieve adequate folate levels, although the fortication of flour with folic acid won’t protect against these defects entirely. I believe this move would reach women who are most at risk, shyespecially those with a low income and those who didn’t plan to become pregnant.Experts are of the same mind. Professor Louis Levy of Public Health England says: “The vast majority of women between - haveblood folate levels below global thresholds, highlighting a risk of neural tube defect-affected pregnancies.Comprehensive evidence shows that mandatory fortication of flour would go a long way towards reducing the number of complications some shyexperience during pregnancy.”  Public Health Minister Steve Brine said: “All women should be able to access the nutrients they need for a healthy pregnancy and, in turn, reduce the risk of devastating complications. “We have agreed that now is the right time to explore whether shyfortication in flour is the right approach for the UK. My priority is to make sure thatintroduced, we are certain it is safe and beneficial for all.” Chief Medical Officer Professor Dame Sally Davies believes “that shyfortying flour with folic acid is a shypractical way of reducing folate shydeficiencies in pregnant women and reducing birth defects. “I am pleased to see the shyGovernment taking action on this issue, which could benefit and improve the lives of many women and babies in this country.” Hear, hear!

But what exactly does a Duchess carry around with her when shes out and about on official royal duties  There has been a lot of speculation over the years about what the Queen keeps in her bag, but now a royal author has revealed what Kate keeps in hers. In her book Kate: A Biography, Marcia Moody claims Kate only carries four things with her - and theyre all very practical.  The first item is a staple in most womens handbags - a compact mirror, reports MamaMia. Perfect for checking shes ready for all the cameras before she arrives at an event. Next is lipbalm. While most might expect her to have a lipstick in her bag, she carries lip balm instead. Which might be why we never see her with dry lips! Kate also reportedly always carries blotting paper, which is normally used to take care of excess oil or sweat on the face. Again, this could be very useful when making sure shes ready to meet important people or to smile for the cameras.  The final item is a handkerchief. When shes off duty and out and about with the kids, Kate is normally carrying a much bigger bag so probably has lots of other bits and bobs. We assume that, like most parents, she carries all the essentials little George, Charlotte and Louis might need for a fun day out.

Yesterday it emerged that Harry and we Meghan would be moving out of Kensington Palace and would set up home on the Frogmore estate, amid reports of a rt with Prince William. The Duke and Duchess of Susex will move into the -bedroom home, near Windsor Castle, to raise a family in a quieter setting. But one royal source has suggested the move could be down to friction between Meghan and Kate which has driven wedge between the two brothers. Kate and Meghan are very dferent people. They dont really get on, an insider told the Daily Mail. Meghans Hollywood persona has shaken up the royal family but some claim it has upset the balance in the household.  Meghan and Kate appeared to be the closest of pals on occasions when they have ventured out in public together. They clapped and cheered together as they watched Serena Williams play Angelique Kerber at the Ladies Wimbledon Final earlier this year. Some observers have noted that Kate has caught the Meghan Markle bug after she was pictured hugging children during a rare break from tradition at an event in Essex. It appeared the Duchess of Cambridge had taken a leaf out of her touchy-feely sisters-in-laws book and has become more hands on with well-wishers.  It is claimed that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex had planned to move into one of Kensington Palaces main apartments, next to William and Kate, but there has been a bit of tension between the brothers. A royal source told The Sun : The initial plan was for Harry and Meghan to move out of their cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace and into one of the main apartments. But there has been a bit of tension between the brothers.  Now Harry and Meghan don’t want to live next to William and Kate and want to strike out on their own. They need more room and hope Frogmore Cottage will be ready in time for when they have the baby. Frogmore Cottage is a gt from the Queen to Harry, , and Meghan,  and the property will be given a taxpayer-funded makeover in time for the couple to move in.  A royal statement said: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will move to Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor Estate early next year as they prepare for the arrival of their first child. The couple have lived at Nottingham Cottage since their engagement last year. Windsor is a very special place for Their Royal Highnesses and they are grateful that their official residence will be on the estate. The Duke and Duchess’s office will continue to be based at Kensington Palace.  Earlier this year it was reported that the Queen warned Prince Harry about dficult Meghans attitude after a row over about what tiara she could wear on her wedding day. Bride-to-be Meghan wished to wear a tiara with emeralds but was refused after its origins could not be established. The -year-old eventually wore a diamond and platinum headpiece selected by the Queen, despite Harry, , telling staff previously “what Meghan wants, Meghan gets”. The claim was made in Robert Jobsons new book, Charles at Seventy.

The couple will swap their two-bedroom cottage at Kensington Palace for a Grade II-listed -bedroom pad near Windsor Castle, officials confirmed. Speculation had grown that “a bit of tension” between Harry and brother William was behind the move. But the Sunday Mirror can reveal there is no brotherly falling-out, with royal sources rubbishing the claims. The switch by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex is down to their wish for more space in preparation for their new arrival.It is believed both want a wing at their next home for Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland,  – who aims to be a hands-on gran to her first grandchild in visits from Los Angeles.  The pair will move from Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace to Frogmore Cottage half a mile south of Windsor Castle. A source said: “With a baby on the way, there wasn’t the option of the Duke and Duchess staying at the palace as Nottingham Cottage is tiny and none of the bigger apartments is available. “Doria will be staying with them for quite long periods and they need a larger place.” Frogmore Cottage is a gt from the Queen to Harry, , and Meghan, .The pair had their engagement photos taken there and hosted their wedding reception in it last May. It lies on the Frogmore estate, has a gym and yoga studio and is said to be undergoing a multi-million-pound refit funded by taxpayers.  The royal source said: “Frogmore Cottage isn’t massive but it’s certainly big enough for Doria to have a separate area there.” William and his we Kate live in a -bedroom apartment at Kensington Palace. Ex-social worker Doria was the only member of her family to attend Meghan’s wedding. She captured Britain’s heart as she choked back tears watching Prince Charles walk her daughter down the aisle in place of Meghan’s dad Thomas, who could not travel for health reasons. Doria spent much of the summer with Harry and Meghan in the UK and was described by her son-in-law as “amazing”. The source added: “The couple are bound to have a pad somewhere in Kensington Palace but Frogmore Cottage will be their main base. “It’s not too far from London in terms of getting to royal engagements. Their office and staff will stay at Kensington.” "},{"url":null,"title":"national lottery one lucky ticket","story":"NewsNational Lottery: One lucky ticket holder scoops £million Lotto jackpotLotto jackpot worth £million is won by just one ticket bought in the UK before Saturday nights draw - is it you ShareCommentsByStephen JonesDeputy News Editor:,  NOV NewsSomeone is a LOT richer than they were  hours ago \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne lucky ticket-holder has scooped the pound million Lotto jackpot.

Billie-Jo Robinson has said she wasnt seen by any medical professionals and was left lying on a cold airport floor at am in the morning after being removed from the flight from JFK airport to Manchester last Saturday. The -year-old, who had been on holiday with her sister-in-law and a friend, said passengers were left waiting to board the plane for more than two hours, during which time she began to feel unwell and needed a sick bag. But she claimed that soon afterwards she was told by a cabin crew member that the airlines ground staff doctor and deemed her not fit to fly. Billie, who is  weeks pregnant and from the Wirral, said she was told to get off the flight and was left until the early hours of the morning with no money, food or accommodation.  She told The Liverpool Echo : We were left waiting on the plane for ages because of missing passengers. It was really hot and I had really bad heartburn after having a McDonalds in the airport and felt a bit sick. I saw an air hostess with sick bags and asked her for one, and I was sick a little bit - but not enough to leave my seat. I asked the air hostess could she get rid of the bag and she asked was I okay, to which I said I was fine and she gave me a bottle of water. It had been about  minutes since I had been sick and I was just sat reading my magazine when a member of the cabin crew came up to me and said I needed to get off the aircraft. She said a doctor on the ground, who had never even met me or seen me, had made the decision I was not fit to fly. A spokesman for Virgin Atlantic said the decision was made after the situation was evaluated with independent medical experts. Billie, a childrens home manager who is due to give birth in April, said she was reassured by staff she would be put up in a hotel, taken to the hospital to get a doctors note and then put on the next flight. But she claims that she, her friend and her sister-in-law were left until am on a cold airport floor with only  and travel cards between them.  Billie said: I was crying when I was told to get off the flight but I was told by the cabin crew not to worry, Virgin will take me to the hospital to get a fit to fly letter, sort us a hotel and food, until the next flight we can be booked onto. However, when we got off the flight I was told to go and collect our luggage, which was a  minute walk away, and then drag a kg case across the airport, up escalators. Bear in mind Im too sick to fly and need to go to hospital. Our other case which has the only bank card in didnt come off the plane and when we went to the customer services desk they said they couldnt find it. And then we were told we wouldnt be going to a hotel or hospital and I needed to sort it myself because it wasnt their responsibility. After hours of trying to resolve the situation, Billie and the group were eventually given a hotel and a hospital visit was arranged via their travel insurance for later the same day. However, later that morning Billie said she was contacted by the airlines duty manager and told she had been booked on another flight and didnt need a doctors note. The group were then flown from JFK to Atlanta and then on to Manchester. Billie said: I want an apology and an explanation as to why I was kicked off the flight. I want to know what information the on the ground doctor was told to say I was not fit to fly.

Twisted Richard Dowling made -year-old Daniel have sex with him and the young boys stepmother during three years of sickening abuse. The father claimed he abused his son “to try and steer him in the right direction and not to go to the way of being gay, because there was like, sort of, tendencies for him to be gay”. Daniel was also made to watch porn and when he refused to perform a sex act on his stepmum his dad tried to punch him. Dowling told Reading Crown Court: “All I ever wanted was for him to turn out the right way.”  Daniel was robbed of a normal childhood – replaced by a sordid existence which right-minded people will find hard to fathom. He has been haunted by his ordeal – even by the smell of his stepmum’s perfume – for more than  years. But now he has now seen his tormentors jailed after turning detective to prove the guilt of his father, an ex-Ministry of Defence worker. Warped Dowling was jailed for five years and his ex-partner Annette Breakspear got eight. They are  now but were  when the abuse began. Legal reasons prevented them being identied before today. But they can finally be exposed after Daniel, , bravely waived his anonymity.   He told the Sunday Mirror: “It was Dad’s job to protect me. They stole my innocence and ruined my childhood. I can never get past that.” Daniel will never forget the day the abuse began. It was a Sunday afternoon. Dowling and Breakspear were playing board game Frustration with Daniel at home in Bracknell, Berks. Fashion retail manager Daniel, who now lives in Surrey, recalls: “Dad told me we were going to try something dferent – to take our clothes off whenever someone lost. By the end of the game Annette was completely naked. “They instructed me to touch and kiss her breasts. Dad was encouraging me to do it so I thought it was okay. I think that night was a tester of how I’d react because intercourse started after that.” Daniel’s father had met former carer Breakspear through a lonely hearts ad after splitting from the lad’s mother. During three years together Breakspear stole Daniel’s virginity and abused him more than  times.   Once, he was picked up by his dad from Scouts, taken home and told to “give Breakspear a goodnight kiss”. Daniel said: “I went into their room and she was handcuffed to the bed naked. “I gave her a kiss and went to leave but she asked me to touch her and to untie one of her hands. We had intercourse and Dad came and joined in.” Another time, he was made to view porn before his dad had oral sex with Annette and said: “That’s how you do it.” In another sickening incident Daniel was called in to find them naked and engaged in a sex act. Breakspear then had sex with Daniel. He said: “We’d watch porn in bed together and then we’d have threesomes. She’d instruct me on what to do. Sometimes when Dad wasn’t there she’d ask me into her room for fondling and intercourse. “I was an only child and I spent a lot of time playing Lego but she’d come in and ask me to do things to her.”   Daniel, who is gay but currently single, said: “I was sexualised at such a young age that sex means nothing to me now. “The few positive memories of my childhood are tarnished by memories of the abuse. When I smell someone wearing her perfume, or see that board game in a shop or on TV, it brings the memories back.” Daniel added: “Dad said that he did it to stop me being gay because I showed feminine traits as a child. “One day we were at a car boot sale and my neighbour saw me wrestling an old lady for a handbag. “She told my dad, ‘Your Dan’s going to bat for the other side’. And Dad said ‘No son of mine will be gay.’ I think the abuse started after that.”   It only stopped when Dowling and Breakspear split up around . He claimed he broke up with her because she told him she’d had sex with Daniel and his grandad on the same day. The teenager and his father moved to Weymouth, Dorset. But Daniel, then , was targeted by another paedophile. Police raided the pervert’s home and found naked pictures of Daniel. It was then, as he was being interviewed by a child psychologist, that Daniel revealed the years of abuse from his dad and stepmum. Dowling was quizzed but claimed his son was an “attention seeking” liar. Daniel believes Breakspear was not questioned and there were no arrests. The despairing youngster later tried to kill himself. When the case finally came to trial in May this year it was claimed police treated him “shoddily” at his  video interview – and that one constable even mocked him. Daniel says it was left to him, some  years later, to finally get justice. On September , , he secretly recorded a phone conversation in which his father admitted the abuse. Two days later Daniel walked into Staines police station, Surrey, with the recording – and he said that this time the police took him seriously. He said: “I don’t knowtraining has improved orI was just unlucky the first time, but I would definitely encourage other victims of historic abuse to come forward and report it now.” Daniel’s dad admitted to police that he and Breakspear carried out “sordid and deplorable” abuse and that he felt ashamed and disgusted.   In court he claimed the abuse was to prevent Daniel “turning gay”, to “protect him from paedophiles so he would know what was right and wrong” – and to educate him about how he should treat women. He blamed his actions on “undiagnosed depression” and said he fell under the influence of Breakspear – who he labelled “a Jekyll and Hyde character”. Breakspear was found guilty of three counts of indecent assault. Dowling admitted one count of cruelty to a child and two counts relating to sexual offences involving a child. He was found not guilty of one count of indecent assault. Judge Maria Lamb told Dowling: “Your warped sense of right and wrong allowed him to be exploited by your then partner not just once but again and again. You’ve failed to protect him from the sexually predatory behaviour of your co-defendant. “The damage is incalculable. The abuse of trust is monstrous and the reality is that one of you was involved in active sexual abuse and the other connived at it.” The judge told Breakspear: “For your own perverted sexual gratication you initiated this boy into a world far beyond anything to which he should ever have had to be introduced at those tender years.” Daniel, who has not spoken to his father for over two years, said: “Dad threw me under the bus instead of admit his guilt. He is dead to me now.” Det Supt Fiona Grant, of Dorset Police, responded to criticism over the  video interview. Praising Daniel for his courage, she said: “The video met all necessary guidelines and was accepted as evidence during the trial at Reading. “We conducted multi-agency professionals meetings with regards to his ongoing safeguarding. “Dorset Police takes sexual assault extremely seriously. Do not suffer in silence, come forward and report it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"top 10 experience gifts brits","story":"NewsTop  experience gts Brits are buying this ChristmasResearchers found the nation plans to spend  per cent more on experience-based gts this festive season compared to last yearShareCommentsByRob Knight:,  NOV NewsWe are set to see a dramatic rise in experience gting this year as more Brits favour tickets to physical presents \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPhysical Christmas presents are being replaced by experiences as thrill-seeking Brits seek to get a buzz from the festive period, a study has found. Researchers who polled , UK adults found experiences are becoming increasingly popular and are deemed to ‘mean more’ than something hurriedly plucked from a department store shelf. Those who prefer the opportunity to get out and try something new are doing so to avoid getting ‘the same old thing’ every Christmas. According to the study, experiences will take up around pound. billion of festive spends this year - thanks to treats such as comedy show tickets, concert tickets and ‘red letter day’ vouchers.  Commissioned by Barclaycard, the research also found one in five plan to buy an experience-based gt for a loved one this Yuletide. Spokesman Daniel Mathieson said: “Brits are fed up with receiving stockings full of socks or the same customary cosmetics and chocolates year after year, we now expect more from our loved ones. “Not only do we want presents that provide entertainment, we want to create long-lasting memories too, meaning for many, physical items no longer cut-it as Christmas gts.” The study also found Brits are planning on spending an average of pound each on experience-based gts, a rise of  per cent from a year ago. Almost half of Christmas shoppers fear that friends and family will be given the same material gt twice, while  per cent worry that they will struggle to find the perfect present. One in five gt-buyers believe making memories is the most important thing when picking a Christmas present, and  per cent want to make sure the recipient has something to look forward to.   It really is the thought that counts for Brits, as almost six in  feel the thoughtfulness of a present is the main factor to consider when gt-giving. Twenty-five per cent feel sentimental value is also an important factor when receiving a present. Nearly four in  millennials admitted the main reason for buying experiences with their parents was to enjoy quality time together. A further  per cent also admit they consider whether a gt they’re purchasing for a loved one will create exciting content for their social media channels, with millennials aged - more conscious of this than any other age group.  Mathieson added: “The emotion and excitement of giving and receiving an experience is something money can’t buy, particularly when it comes to activities that can be shared. “What’s truly heart-warming though, is that people want to spend more time with their friends and family and are choosing presents they can enjoyed together while also providing something to look forward once the festive season is over.”The research was commissioned by Barclaycard to mark its entertainment partnership with Live Nation which offers exclusive  festival pre-sales with  per cent back at the checkout for each and every pre-sale ticket bought through Barclaycard Entertainment.TOP  - EXPERIENCES BRITS ARE GIFTING THIS CHRISTMAS:Theatre   comedy tickets Spa   beauty treatments Concert tickets Meals out  culinary courses Red letter day vouchers Tourist attractions Sporting event tickets e.g. rugby football match Adventure trips e.g. skying, rock climbing Cultural experiences, e.g. art gallery Historical experiences, e.g. visiting National Trust sites"},{"url":null,"title":"welsh rarebit flavoured crisps withdrawn","story":"NewsWelsh rarebit-flavoured crisps withdrawn over claims they offend people from WalesPackets of Welsh rarebit-flavoured REAL Crisps show \"Rhodri the coal miner\" appearing from a gloomy pit - but Twitter users have accused the firm of cultural appropriationShareCommentsByBradley Jolly:,  NOV NewsThe crisps have been popular snacks for years \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCrisp packets featuring a caricature of Rhodri the coal miner have been axed following complaints they were offensive.

Scientists discover all humans are descendants of ONE coupleScientists have found that modern humans all came from a single pair of beings, so there may be some truth in Adam and Eve after allShareCommentsByKatherine Clementine:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsScientists may have proven the myth that Adam and Eve were the first man and women on Earth \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe myth that Adam and Eve were the first man and women on Earth may have been proved true - as all humans are descendants of a single couple, scientists say. Scientists have said that we sprang from a solitary pair of adults - who lived , to , years ago - after a catastrophic event almost wiped out the entire human race. The findings were made by scientists who surveyed the genetic bar codes of five million animals - including humans - from , dferent species. And its not just humans who came from a single pair of beings - these bar codes, or snippets of DNA that reside outside the nuclei of living cells, suggest that nine out of every  animal species do, too.  According to the Bible, Adam and Eve were chosen to be the first people to live on Earth and were the first parents. The research was led by Senior Research Associate Mark Stoeckle and Research Associate David Thaler of the University of Basel, Switzerland, , Mail Online reports. They concluded that % of all animal species alive today come from parents that all began giving birth at roughly the same time, less than  thousand years ago - throwing into doubt the patterns of human evolution. This conclusion is very surprising, Thaler admitted, and I fought against it as hard as I could. Dr Stoeckle said: At a time when humans place so much emphasis on inidual and group dferences, maybe we should spend more time on the ways in which we resemble one another and the rest of the animal kingdom.  The new report from experts at the Rockefeller University along with from the University of Basel published the extraordinary findings in Human Evolution. They mined big data insights from the worlds fast-growing genetic databases and reviewed a large literature in evolutionary theory, including Darwin. The conclusions throw up considerable mystery as to why the need for human le to start again was needed such a relatively short time ago.  The last known extinction we know of was during the time of the dinosaurs  million years ago - opening up the possibility of an inbuilt human evolutionary process wherein we break down and die out, leaving the need to start from scratch. Humans are also surprisingly similar to not just every other human, but every other species. If a Martian landed on Earth and met a flock of pigeons and a crowd of humans, one would not seem more erse than the other according to the basic measure of mitochondrial DNA, said Jesse Ausubel, Director of the Program for the Human Environment at The Rockefeller University. Culture, le experience and other things can make people very dferent but in terms of basic biology, were like the birds, Dr Stoeckle added.  The mitochondrial DNA examined in the research is that which mothers pass down from generation to generation and it showed the absence of human exceptionalism. One might have thought that, due to their high population numbers and wide geographic distribution, humans might have led to greater genetic ersity than other animal species, added Stoeckle. At least for mitochondrial DNA, humans turn out to be low to average in genetic ersity. The study has been misunderstood by some religious parties who thought it meant that we all came into being in some seminal Big Bang-type event , ago, but this isnt what the findings actually suggest. What Stoeckle and Thalers findings point to is that our species has to revamp far more often than we thought, and we do so in unison with all animals.

I’ve been very pleased with what we’ve seen from him so far.”Curran’s role has changed under the new manager after previous boss Neil McCann wanted to develop him into an attacking full-back.McIntyre, though, sees him further up the pitch where he can use his pace to hurt opposing teams more directly.Also able to play as a central midfielder, Curran’s versatility has its uses for a manager but Jim has urged the young Aussie to “nail down a position” to really fulfil the potential he sees in him.The Dens boss said: “I see him playing further forward rather than right-back, though I know he can play there. He has that athleticism you need to play full-back, wing-back as well but I think you can get goals out of him.“He’s versatile but I think sometimes with players you need to nail down a position so we’re trying to do that with Jesse.“But I definitely see him in the midfield area.”Curran is expected to continue in that right-wing role for the Dark Blues at Hibs on Saturday despite having fit-again Roarie Deacon as competition.The former Sutton United man missed the draw with St Mirren with a thigh strain but trained this week and is available.Sven-Goran Eriksson wants Dundee youngster Jesse Curran\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp sven-goran-eriksson-wants-dundee-youngster-jesse-curran embed # secretxcPQdfeTm\" data-secret\"xcPQdfeTm\" width\"\" \"\" title\"#Sven-Goran Eriksson wants Dundee youngster Jesse Curran# # Evening \" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/5bf3f4dff169b-e1542721422611.jpg ","title":"no parking bus at hibees for dundee","story":"Jim McIntyre has no plans to park the bus this coming weekend as his Dundee side travel to free-scoring Hibs in the Premiership.The Dark Blues have the leakiest defence in the ision while the Hibees have notched  in five league matches at Easter Road ahead of their clash on Saturday.The Dens gaffer is under no illusions how tough it will be against Neil Lennon’s side, though he’s seen encouragement from his side over the past couple of matches.And he’s planning to put their opponents “under pressure” as his side aim for a much-needed result.He said: “Things were taken on from the Motherwell game and things were more positive with the St Mirren performance and it’s about trying to turn small margins into points.“We know we are facing a top side in Hibs who have done a fantastic job this season, are an exciting team to watch and have a lot of attacking threat but we have to go there and put them under pressure.”Of late, however, the Hibees haven’t won in their last four – but that recent form won’t change how Dundee prepare.“You are going to have peaks and troughs through any season but I’m sure them being at home Lenny will have them fired up,” added Jim.“We know they have good players and will be looking to take maximum points but from our own end the encouraging signs have been there and we want to try to build on the St Mirren result.“The boys clearly know how I work now after a month.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"bustling prestwick town praised national","story":"NewsBustling Prestwick town praised on national stageThe town landed second place in Scotland at the Great British High Street Awards last week.ShareByPippa Smith:,  NOV NewsSuccess Prestwick is boom town \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBustling business in Prestwick has been praised on the national stage.

I hope that nightmare prospect really focuses minds in the days ahead.There is nothing to stop the SNP and Labour backing the deal. It achieves key goals set out in their own Brexit plans, like protecting trade and citizensrsquo rights.

to campaign for a new high school in Hawick - ahead of both Galashiels and Selkirk.Westminster MP John Lamont and Holyrood MSP Rachael Hamilton have launched the campaign, which aims to bring about a new high school as soon as possible and unite the townrsquos politicians behind a united front.Scottish Borders Council launched a review of all educational facilities in the Borders in September , with a view to building new schools, assessing which schools may need to be merged or closed, and considering how appropriate current catchment areas are.Education bosses at the council are known to prefer an intergenerational model of education, such as the poundm campus at Jedburgh which will cater for - year olds and contain community spaces and a library.In April , Scottish Borders Council agreed to create inidualised plans for schools in Galashiels, Hawick, Peebles and Selkirk, and agreed to bring an update to the council in October.However, the update has so far failed to materialise leaving parents and students in the dark about the future of their school.John Lamont, who represents Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk in Westminster, said: ldquoHawick High School has had its fair share of publicity recently, but it is clear that hard working pupils and staff are being let down by a site which is simply not fit for purpose.ldquoThat is why I have joined with my colleague Rachael, to call on the townrsquos representatives to come together for the good of the town.ldquoGalashiels is already the front runner to get a new school, because the town and the community is united and has a clear plan.ldquoHawick is lucky to have very active local representatives who have already put in a lot of work in to securing a new school for the town.ldquoNow is the time for the community and for its representatives to come together to focus on delivering for Hawickrsquos pupils, teachers and parents.ldquoIf we argue amongst ourselves about details, the effect will be that Hawick is put to the back of the queue.Rachael Hamilton, who represents Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire in Holyrood, added: ldquoMaking a decision on a site would give pupils, teachers and parents a real boost.ldquoOther towns in the Borders have been fortunate to benefit from a new modern teaching and learning environment and Hawick is clearly in need of some investment.ldquoPolitical infighting wonrsquot help, clarity should be provided over such an important issue, this is about giving young people and future generations a place to be proud of.The townrsquos councillors have welcomed the intervention of the two politicians, and threw their weight behind the campaign.Councillor Stuart Marshall commented: ldquoI think itrsquos very important that all politicians, councillors and community leaders join forces to continue the campaign for a new high school.ldquoOf course funding such a project will be a major factor in whether we can deliver such a project, and itrsquos great that both our Westminster and Holyrood representatives in the area are throwing their weight behind such an initiative.ldquoLet us hope that between them they can come up with much of the finances required.Councillor Watson McAteer said: ldquoI am delighted that our local elected UK and Scottish Conservative politicians are throwing their weight and influence behind a new high school for Hawick.ldquoI am in complete agreement that politics should have no role in deciding the future of our children and by definition our town and the quicker this project is agreed by all the better.ldquoHawick High School has seen its fair share of problems and a new learning campus would go a long way to resolving existing and future problemsCouncillor David Paterson added: ldquoAll of the Hawick councillors are campaigning furiously to get a new high school for Hawick, and the councillors in other wards are shouting for their areas as well.ldquoIrsquod like John Lamont MP to encourage the Tory government to make more money available to the Scottish Government to make this into a reality.The proposals to create inidual plans for Galashiels, Hawick, Selkirk and Peebles came on the back of assessments of the four schools that found they all have what are described as major defects.The facilities at each school were graded from A to D, with A signying that the buildings are performing well and operating effectively and D indicating that the economic le of the facilities has expired and they are at risk of failure.The overall conditions of Galashiels Academy, Hawick High School and Selkirk High School were given C ratings, while Peebles High School was deemed to have a B, or good, rating."},{"url":null,"title":"devastated-family-pay-tribute-to-charity-that-helped-them-remember-their-beautiful-baby","story":"A FAMILY from Blyth Bridge wants to repay the kindness shown to them

mean Spark becomes a standalone part of this large independent supplier ndash operating from our offices in Selkirk, Edinburgh and Horsham offices, supplying our customers under the new parent

Council has published a belated update on its much-anticipated school estates review, and it reveals that Galashiels is the top priority to receive new investment, with Hawick second, Selkirk third and Peebles fourth.Education chiefs are recommending that councillors approve plans for a pound.m cross-generational campus in Galashiels, which would be due to open in .The plans would see , secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students,  primary school pupils and  nursery children educated across the campus, to be split between the new Langlee Primary School and a new building at either Scott Park or Netherdale.Although the cross-generational campus is the preferred model outlined by council officers, there would be a public consultation which would explore alternative options, which includes a new standalone secondary school building which would cost pound.m.The costs outlined in the report are currently indicative but would be confirmed once a detailed delivery strategy is drawn up.The report states: ldquoWhile both Galashiels and Hawick high schools are both classed as grade C in relation to their condition, Galashiels will require signicantly more financial investment on an element-by-element fabric basis in order to remain a fully ing asset with no impact on the delivery of the curriculum.ldquoIt is recommended therefore that Galashiels is the first priority for investment given the current condition and suitability of the existing school in relation to the rest of the estate.If the report is approved by councillors, Hawick would be the second town to receive investment in its school estates.As in Galashiels, council officers are recommending the construction of a cross-generational campus, due to open in , at a cost of pound.m.The campus would cater for  secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students, , primary school pupils and  nursery children.Again, the option to create either a cross-generational campus or just a stand-alone secondary school at a cost of pound.m would be discussed with Hawick residents.However, issues relating to flooding risk and available space have led to Hawick missing out on first priority place as council officers do not currently have a concrete plan for where any new campus would be sited.The report continues: ldquoThere are other complex issues within Hawick aside from questions of scale and accessibility, in particular with relation to flood risk.ldquoWhile the existing high school site in Hawick has been included within the options appraisal, it is noted that further detailed investigations are required regarding the currently proposed flood prevention works at this site and the nature of permissible development works which could render this and other adjacent town centre sites undevelopable for an education project of this scale.ldquoThe Hawick flood protection scheme will deliver protection to the town generally at a level commensurate with one in -year flood events.ldquoEarly advice is that any new school provision on the same site or at the same level would require to achieve, a higher level of protection commensurate with its classication as a strategic asset.ldquoIn addition, other sites are already identied within the local development plan in terms of business, mixed use or industrial zoning, and this could have a detrimental impact on the wider economic health of the townutilised for educational purposes and an analysis would therefore be required.Selkirk would be the third priority for new investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m cross-generational campus, potentially due to open in .As with the campus recommendations at Hawick and Galashiels, there would be a public consultation that would consider just building a replacement secondary school, at a cost of pound.mThe report states: ldquoFrom experience with the Jedburgh intergenerational campus model, it is considered appropriate that a three-to- campus option could be considered for the Selkirk cluster.ldquoThis could comprise all the schools within the town and potentially a partial inclusion of the rural schools within the cluster, as was suggested during the pre-consultations, with pupils from P and P transitioning to the campus.,params: .pushldquoPrevious consultation with the community has focused on secondary education. It is therefore proposed that further consultation is undertaken with the community, parents, pupils and staff to determine the preferred option in terms of educational model.ldquoThis will help develop a proposal to take forward to the next stage of the process. Discussions will also be progressed with the public, private and third sector regarding the potential for other services to share services and facilities.Peebles has been designated as the lowest priority for a new school but it would receive the largest investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m campus to be opened in .The alternative would be a new secondary school building at a cost of poundm.The report continues: ldquoPrimary and secondary schools within Peebles currently have limited capacity for increased roll numbers, which is the main concern in this location as opposed to issues of condition at Galashiels and Hawick.ldquoBoth Priorsford and Kingsland primary schools are operating at  per cent capacity and Peebles High School at  per cent capacity, and further work on projected roll figures is required.ldquoIt is recommended that any decision to build a new school or campus model must form part of an overall Scottish Borders Council masterplan for the town taking cognisance of projected housing developments, transport links, infrastructure, including flood risk, and the local development plan.The campus model is favoured by council officers and the elected administration as consolidating educational provision in one or two locations would allow the closure of disused school buildings and reduce annual running costs.The report will be presented at the next full council meeting, to be held next Thursday, November , and councillors will be asked to approve the priority and sequence of investments."},{"url":null,"title":"50k-boost-for-museum-from-festival-of-speed","story":"MORE than pound, has been donated to a Borders museum by organisers of the Goodwood Festival of Speed.And a

dferent.David Cameron announced the date for the EU referendum in February , with the referendum itself held on June , a mere four months later.The referendum campaign lasted a matter of weeks, trying to get across what were often highly complex issues, against a background of half-truths and disinformation.Remember the £ million on the side of a bus and spending irregularities There was no clear idea of what Brexit actually meant, with those campaigning for leave promoting often contradictory views.The electorate was  presented with a blank sheet of paper, acting on blind faith as to what Brexit meant.The Scottish independence referendum date was announced in March , a year and a half before the actual vote.The electorate fully debated the key issues.In November , the Scottish government published Scotland#s Future, a -page white paper laying out the case for independence and the means through which Scotland might become an independent country.Contrast this with the Brexit campaign.The concern of some in the SNP can be shared, but it should be noted that the circumstances for a people’s vote are very dferent from an independence referendum.Ultimately the public has a right to change its mind, that’s democracy.Many did not know what they were voting for when it came to the EU referendum and I doubt many voted to make themselves poorer, with the continuing negative

We had just popped in to get a few simple items, but I ended up with a very upset wee boy. The supermarket had already begun to display toys. My son had noticed them immediately because they had been deliberately placed at his level.I eventually managed to distract him and we made it out without a major meltdown, but it just highlighted to me the pressures we are all put under.I kept on saying to my son: ldquoNo, but maybe for Christmas.It was a tactic to get some immediate peace, but I realised I was building up expectations that Christmas is the time when all the accumulated desires for stuff are met.We are made to feel that the value of Christmas is measured in the amount of stuff we acquire or give. I hate this and reject it but I am by no means immune from its pressure. I am made to feel guilty and every year I give in some way or another.The psychological warfare in our minds has already begun. The new toys laid out in that supermarket was but the opening shot. Soon a lsquoChristmassyrsquo atmosphere will engulf us as we do our shopping, designed to press our internal panic button that we need get on with buying lots of stuff, like a stressed squirrel collecting nuts for the winter.I know Irsquove ranted about this before but in February I spoke to a group of vulnerable parents in a course I was delivering. Many had huge debts yet had spent literally hundreds of pounds on Christmas presents, most of which were by this time broken, forgotten about or discarded.One of the parents encapsulated it perfectly: ldquoThe trouble is itrsquos easy to realise after itrsquos all over that yoursquove gone overboard, but the pressure is so hard to resist before Christmas. Yoursquore made to feel that you are a bad parent or a failureyou donrsquot get all that stuff. Itrsquos everywhere you go and on the screens. Itrsquos impossible to escape from it.In the discussion the parents said they wished there was a course or some guidance on how to resist the pressure while still making Christmas special for their kids.In a sense, this issue is not just a Christmas one, although the consumerist pressure is at its most intense in the run-up to Christmas, and even immediately afterwards with the sales. We have literally been sold the idea that buying stuff is what defines us.It has been a conscious, deliberate and sustained ideological assault on us and our children.In her brilliant film The Story of Stuff, Annie Leonard gives a quote from a retail analyst Victor Lebow: ldquoOur enormously productive economy. . . demands that we make consumption our way of le, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. We need things, consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.While this was in reference to the USA a number of years ago, it holds true for us here and now.Christmas, as well as other seasonal festivals, have been made a festival of buying stuff.Itrsquos destroying the very planet we live on, it piles our homes with unneeded and soon-to-be discarded consumerist items .Meanwhile, more and more of us are time poor and running about to pay for things we soon forget we even bought and are likely already in the dump or charity shop.I was once told I was being a Scrooge when I spoke of this issue. But the message in Scrooge, when he realises whatrsquos important, is that he gives his employee time off to be with his family, and a pay rise so they can eat he shows kindness and shares a meal and social time with his family. Itrsquos not about tons of stuff.Our time together is the most valuable and valued thing we will ever have. Irsquod never say donrsquot buy presents, as I know a thoughtful present is a wonderful thing. Butitrsquos lost in a sea of other stuff then its signicance is lost too.What I think is important is doing things together and measuring the value of gts by the thought put into them, rather than the price or quantity of them.

was needed in order to fund the stadium.However, the spectre of the stadium has also led to campaigns by anti-greyhound racing campaigners to stop it being built.Last year, Sirius Sport received

were affordable were raised however, Iain McFarlane, the councilrsquos head of planning, said at the time the reason the houses were all ldquohigh-end was because they were designed to raise the

I realised I didnrsquot know quite where to start. The feeling of inclusiveness, the uncontaminated landscapes, the astonishing beauty of cities like Edinburgh and the thriving cultural hub of Glasgow, all of these make a person who lands on Scottish soil feel welcomed into a special place.There are so many driving factors that bring people to Scotland and leave a permanent imprint in their minds. There is a good reason why the country was voted as top destination by travel publisher Rough Guides in  ndash it just has so much to offer. But how do the most popular tourist attractions shape up  I set out to find out.National Museum of ScotlandChambers St, Edinburgh EH JFFree www.nms.ac.ukIf someone were to think of a Scottish remake of A Night at The Museum with a sci-fi feel, then the National Museum would be the ideal setting. Besides a rich collection of curiosities from the Victorian age and archaeological relics, it has a scientic section with working models of engines and machines that would wake anybodyrsquos inner child.A solemn Victorian building on the outside, it hides a labyrinth within its walls, at whose heart is a bright and wide central hall connecting all the other sections and a laid-back cafe. Free tours run every day. What I found outstanding, besides the breadth and iety of the permanent exhibitions, ranging from scientic achievement to art and world cultures, is its interactivity and its aim to be a hub for culture and development: the cafes and other spaces where people can sit, relax and explore it bit by bit ndash or just use it as a meeting point. I loved its originality the rooftop, for instance, not only offers a spectacular view on the Old Town and the surroundings, but is also a small botanical garden with historical and geographical information. The section on New Scots is also a reflection of the countryrsquos propensity to embrace foreign cultures. I believe there could be more information provided in foreign languages, so that people whose English is not incredibly fluent could enjoy the exhibits even more. The collections stand up well in comparison to other museums in Europes capital cities.Vote:  Edinburgh CastleCastlehill, Edinburgh EH NGTickets on sitepound poundThe iconic building is like a gem encrusted on top of a hill, watching over the city from above. A very well preserved inner area hosts so many dferent museums and areas of interest it reminded me of a Russian doll ndash there is always something new to discover, a new corner with a dferent, stunning view on the Old Town. Yet its interior, which is rich in detail, is not over-designed, and renovations are good enough not to look, as often happens, like a bad copy of the original. However, despite creating one of the most stunning urban landscapes I have seen around Europe, I have to admit it was not love at first sight when I visited one of the UKrsquos highest rated locations. High season can lead to queuing for around  minutes, battered by rain and chilly wind, for a ticket that was not what I would call cheap. Whereas I understand such a building requires funds to keep running, it is one of the most expensive attractions I have been to. I also find that the absence of a student or young people discount is unfortunate, although discounts are available for children, families, senior citizens and the unemployed. Information around the castle grounds is basic unless the visitor decides to pay for an audio guide . These are well made and available in a very good iety of languages. Staff are present all around the castle and are ready to help visitors. Edinburgh Castle is a magnicent piece of history, however, they should work on their prices.Vote:  Scottish National GalleryThe Mound, Edinburgh EH ELFree With a Da Vinci masterpiece welcoming you as you step into the first exhibition hall, entering the Scottish National Gallery is like walking into a pantheon of myths. A fascinating journey spanning the centuries and crossing the borders of the Old Continent, itrsquos an adventure through artistic treasures, going from Botticelli to Van Gogh, going through the main exponents of Scottish art ndash a feature that, Kelvingrove Museum aside, makes of it a unique collection.Though modest in dimensioncompared to other art galleries across Europe, it is dense in quality and rich in ersity. Itrsquos setting in the old building on The Mound makes it a stupendous landmark on Edinburghrsquos skyline. The interior has a feeling of solemnity and cozy familiarity at the same time. Lights and artworks are very well positioned so that the visitor can enjoy the paintings and sculptures at their best. What I found particularly worth of praise is the amount of information given for each piece of the exhibition: whereas many other galleries would not go beyond basic details such as title, author, a few dates and the technique adopted, the National Gallery provides details and background for each masterpiece, making it easier to the occasional visitor to read through the beauty standing in front of them. It unclosed the gallery, making it more accessible and yet entertaining and educational.The staff itself was very warm and from an international background. On the downside, there was little information for those whose native language was not English, though maps were available in the most common European languages and Chinese. I found it a place where I felt welcomed, and where I would go more often to explore in more detail.Vote:  Riverside MuseumPointhouse Place, Glasgow G RSglasgowle.org.uk museums venues riverside-museumSet on the northern bank of the Clyde, the Riverside Museum stands out from the surroundings for its incredible architecture, a legacy from pioneering architect Zaha Hadid, which looks like a mixture between a urban skyline and an ECG segment. Despite being quite a niche genre of display, this transport museum is strong in its interactive approach and its reconstruction of the ages in which the vehicles were in use. This makes locomotives, trams and cars become something more than a mere model ndash they are part of a frame made of sounds, architectures and colours characterising their times, be it the s or the th century. I found staff particularly helpful and attentive, and two simple cafes offer an occasion to rest. What I think is extremely positive is that free tours are available during the day for groups, which is helpful to gain a deeper knowledge of the objects and on the history of the city as well. Part of the information displayed on screens, positioned in ious parts of the building, is available in the most common European languages and Mandarin, although many details appear only in English. It is good to see that there is information in languages which are now part of the Glasgow community, such as Urdu and Polish, to make it more accessible to families living in the area. Overall, this is a very immersive experience: from one of the first carriages of the Glasgow Subway to the Glenlee, the ship moored on the river outside the museum, itrsquos a true moveable feast back in time.Vote: . Kelvingrove Art Gallery and MuseumArgyle St, Glasgow G AGFreeglasgowle.org.uk museums kelvingroveKelvingrove Museumrsquos red walls stand out from the green background of trees of its namesake park, and make it appear even more magnicent and solemn, especially by night, when the lights make it a beautul and a bit sinister sight while it glows through the darkness.I found it a very good starting point to discover the history of this country, especially while going through the paintings and relics of the Scottish Identity in Art section and I appreciated immensely the collection dedicated to local design and Charles Rennie Mackintosh ndash a figure unknown to me before my visit. The free guided tours are very insightful without giving too much information, keeping the visit entertaining and making it easier to take in the concepts passed by the guide. One of the best features is the majestic organ towering over the centre hall: being caught by the resonance of a starting recital while contemplating the ious pieces of the collection or while sipping a coffee in the bar at the ground floor is an utterly pleasant surprise. Moreover, one of the most revered items, namely Christ of St John of the Cross by Salvador Daliacute, is finally back home after a long tour in London and Florida. Set in its own display section, the painting emanates a magnetic aura.Unfortunately, I didnrsquot find any information available in languages other than English, although foreign tourists might benefit from some specic indications. Despite this, Kelvingrove represents a beautul example of a hub dedicated to culture and science.Vote:  OUT OF TOWNLeaving behind the thriving main cities, Scotland is first and foremost known for its sublime outdoors, with landscapes so beautul to often seem unreal. A few of them however seem to attractLoch NessThe legend of the monster is just part of the magnetic attraction that Loch Ness seems to have on the global public. Tourists from all over the world gather ndash a human flow that could easily lead to the transformation of a pure and beautul place in something more similar to a fun park. That has happened, to an extent and tours, cruises and Nessie centres are abundant around Loch Ness shores. Despite this, and in line with an attitude that I particularly appreciate in Scotland, the wilderness and mystic allure of those places have not been altered. The more ldquoboring touristy bits can be avoided by renting a car or going a few steps away the most visited locations ndash the magic is still there.Loch LomondIt is dficult to find a place from which not to adore Loch Lomond, be it walking along its southern shores in Balloch, through the West Highland Way, or crossing the Trossachs National Park by train while heading to the Highlands from Glasgow. I believe people living in Glasgow are extremely lucky to have such an amazing view on their doorstep ndash something that made me fall in love with Scotland. You can drive up from the most industrial centre of the country and you can find yourself lost in nature, with little or no people around you. Its multiple locations make Loch Lomond one of those places to discover bit by bit, getting to know it better each time ndash although it can be tricky to get to places outside the main route without private transport.SkyeThis beautul corner of the world has been in the news due to the influx of tourists which has seen facilities fully booked and ndash at times ndash overwhelmed. On one hand, itrsquos good to see so many people appreciating the breathtaking landscapes of Sligachan, Portree, the Old Man of Storr and many others. On the other hand, the island is probably not equipped as yet to face massive incursions during summer. Something which, I believe, is not entirely a negative side. What Scotland has over other countries is also its ability to preserve its environment, with a respect I wish was present in my home country as well. Although there could be scope for improvement on facilities such as public transport and accommodation, I hope Skye wonrsquot lose its unspoiled beauty."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-insider-guide-st-andrews","story":"As far as visitor attractions go, the home of golf - which also happens to be home to Scotlandrsquos oldest university and some of its most beautul beaches ndash has it all.And although the unique atmosphere of this beautul town in north east Fe never seems to change, the shops and restaurants do move with the times, bringing new le to the cobbled streets.Even when you know St Andrews well, itrsquos a place that constantly draws you back to check out new attractions and reacquaint yourself with old favourites.

Grew up in Sarajevo and lives in GlasgowIrsquove been in Scotland six years and I was in London for  years. I came to work on the Commonwealth Games. The plan was to stay for a couple of years and then move on. But the people were nice and open and I thought that there was no way Irsquom going back to London.It was the people that did it. Does Glasgow feel like home  To be honest I never thought, as a displaced person, that I would find that kind of calm, warm feeling. But as much as I can have it, I have it here.Glasgow is much calmer than London. It is also the right size of city. We have a saying that Sarajevo is made for a measure of a man. Itrsquos the right size to exist in, and I think Glasgow is the same.During my first month here I couldnrsquot understand anybody. My first night I was in the local shop and this woman started talking to me and I thought what is going on here  Then I realised, lsquoYoursquore the idiot, not the person talking to you. Yoursquore the one thatrsquos been completely desensitised by being in London so long.rsquo And I just thought this is lovely.Francois Owiafe, former teacher from Ghana. Self-employed and living in EdinburghThe job that I did in Ghana was examination administrator, a senior job, based in Accra, the capital of Ghana. I came to Scotland because my we had come here to study and had benefited from a scheme which allowed her to stay. It wasnrsquot easy to find work. I could have got work as a teacher in England but that wasnrsquot possible here.People ask questions like, lsquoHow did you come here  Did you come by aeroplane or by boat rsquo Even though we have British nationality, it seems sometimes that people think we are coming in to drain the welfare system. But the job I had in Accra was a very good one.Irsquom a practising Christian and I do volunteer work with the street pastors. I have experienced racism. I had a particularly bad situation where myself and my children were racially abused on the bus. It went to the courts and the guy was found guilty. In spite of all these things itrsquos still better here. For instance, in Africa our healthcare is poor. Also roads are bad. Ghana has one of the highest rates of death by accident in the world. We have people who have come here and made Scotland their home then gone back to visit their family, and never come back because they boarded a car and had an accident and died.Ruzita Millington, grew up in Singapore. Raising her family in EdinburghWhen I was in Singapore, Irsquod never heard of Edinburgh. But, oh my God, Irsquove ended up in a lovely gem of a city. I met my husband in Singapore. He was working there, and he had to come back here with his work. He brought me here on holiday during the festival time. It was love at first sight.The first thing that got me was the culture shock. It was just not what I had imagined. I come from a culture that is quite conservative. I have three children. They know they are Muslims, but they go to Catholic school. They participate in all the Christian events. I think thatrsquos your opportunity to meet other cultures.What I miss most is the food. Recently I made a curry for a girl who had moved from Singapore to study here because I know how it feels to have come here. I cooked her chicken curry for her birthday the way that they have it back home.Lourdes Gala Santos, from Tenere. Lives in Glasgow and works in wind turbine engineeringI moved to Scotland in  because I got a PhD position at the University of Strathclyde. I remember getting on a flight into Prestwick and taking a train into Glasgow and being very excited about my new le. On the train the ticket master was saying, lsquoTickets, tickets.rsquo And he asked, lsquoItrsquos your first time in Scotland rsquo I said, lsquoYeah, Irsquom just moving here. Irsquom so happy to be moving to the north of England.rsquoThe face of this man! He said, lsquoThis is Scotland. Scotland is a country.rsquo So within half an hour of landing I was educated into Scotland being a country. I said I was really sorry. I was so glad that he did not throw me off the train.The following day I kept seeing the St Andrews flag and I phoned my mum and I was saying, they must love Tenere here because our flag is absolutely everywhere. Then I realised that the Scotland flag is exactly the same as the Tenere flag. We share the same flag. It makes me feel at home.My PhD was in aerodynamics and control for wind turbines. So I started a career working in the renewables industry. For wind and tidal and marine renewables, therersquos not a better place to be than Scotland.One of the things that surprised me about people in Scotland is the amount of alcohol people drink with the intent of getting drunk. In Spain and Italy we also drink but not so much to get hammered.Scotland has the most amazing outdoors that Irsquove ever seen. I have travelled quite a bit and when you go to the Highlands or the coast itrsquos incredible. No picture can convey how overwhelming it is up there. I discovered cycling here in Glasgow to my surprise. I had rarely touched a bicycle before that..Praveen Kumar, grew up in India, worked in some of the worldrsquos best hotels and runs Tabla restaurant in PerthBefore I came to Scotland I was working for Sandals hotels in Jamaica and met a couple in the Caribbean. I had been going to go to work in the United States but it was them that enlightened me about Scotlandrsquos quality of le. I found a job at the Turnberry. I came in February  and it was a sunny day, but freezing, and I arrived in shorts and a T-shirt from Jamaica. That two minutes walking from my flight to the terminal was my first experience of actually being in the cold.Later, I got headhunted by Gleneagles. Not long after that my parents found a girl for me, in India, and in March  we got married. In  we opened our restaurant, Tabla, in Perth. Somebody recently asked me, lsquoWhy Perth  Yoursquove got so much talent and knowledge. Why not London rsquo The answer was itrsquos not money that motivates me, itrsquos quality of le. My we and I have built a community around us. The restaurant is embedded in the society in which we live.The most important thing Irsquove found here is the people and their friendliness. Theyrsquore approachable. You can approach anyone in Scotland. If you ask me Irsquom Scottish. Itrsquos been  years so I think I can call myself Scottish.I miss the buzz you get in India. Thatrsquos one thing thatrsquos missing here. In Indiayou want to do something, you can do it straight away. If I want to go and see my friends, I just go. I donrsquot need an appointment. I donrsquot need permission. I just go. And, of course, I miss the food, the street food. Thatrsquos what Irsquom building a business around bringing the rustic street food to all over the UK in a chain of restaurants.Tatsuya Minagawa, , from Yamagata, Japan. Owns renowned whisky venue The Highlander Inn in Craigellachie.I was working in a whisky bar in Japan and I thought Irsquod see more of the whisky environment, this is why I came to Scotland. It was meant to be just for one year. Itrsquos been more than  years now. Probably my biggest surprise was how friendly people were. It was strange for a big city like Edinburgh. Itrsquos not the same as in London or Tokyo. Then I moved to Speyside and was a bit worried because it was so remote...but it turned out to be really good.I was let down by the work attitude at first. It was so much dferent than in Japan. The efficiency of the staff, the attention to detailhellip I still think, to be honest, that itrsquos like that. Back home I had to ask only once for something to be done, but here sometimes you have to ask two or three times. But itrsquos a small issue and I love Scotland. I enjoy living here ndash this country welcomed me very well.Working in the whisky industry, I saw that the drinking culture is very dferent. Here, bars close very early, and people rush to get the last drinks, whereas in Japan they are open for longer hours, which means that people take more time to indulge. We do get drunk, too, donrsquot get me wrong, but in a much dferent way.I find that Scottish and Japanese, we are very dferent but also very similar: we donrsquot have big conversations when we meet the first time: it takes a long time to build a relationship, but when it happens, it lasts longer for forever.Vangelis Stamoulis, , came from Athens, Greece, in  to do postgraduate studies at University of Aberdeen. Sales manager in the oil and gas industry.I found the Scottish culture to be very similar to the Greek one: people are very open, sociable and direct and hospitality is great ndash I felt at home almost immediately. One of the surprises was how the weather was, particularly in Aberdeen, being so far in the north. It doesnrsquot change much ndash itrsquos either cold or very cold, you never actually get a summer.What I really like is that you can get in the car and in less than half an hour you are in the middle of an amazing countryside, andyou like hiking, photography, visiting castles or whisky distilleries thatrsquos perfect.I guess that was the most enjoyable aspect: although I live in a city it felt like living in a village. However, Aberdeen is an international city because of the oil and gas industry, you get to meet people from all over the world, and Scottish people are very tolerant with dferent cultures.I think that Brexit is going to affect all of us, both European and British citizens, and will do so in a very bad way. For me, it has been a beautul home. Irsquove built my professional career here, itrsquos a beautul and safe country, and I hope that I can continue leading my le here.Bola Ugoji, grew up in Nigeria. Runs MaDebrsquos African food shop in EdinburghIn  I came from Nigeria to join my husband who was working in Edinburgh. Irsquod never travelled to the UK before. My -year-old daughter and I came through Heathrow, met my husband and he brought us to Edinburgh. I remember when I walked around then, there were few blacks. But that has changed. Now we have a lot of black people around. Still, even then it was okay because a lot of the white people would come to you and ask you questions, smile at you.After I had my second daughter I felt it would be best for me to set up my own business. I saw a shop space on Great Junction Street and took over that place, selling African food. I was there for nearly five years. Sometimes when I walked down the road, everyone would be waving, lsquoMaDeb! MaDeb!rsquo A year ago I moved the shop to this site on Leith Walk.Here, when your mum is old, she has to go to a home. Where I come from, we donrsquot do that. If my mum is old, I, or my young ones, look after her. I found it shocking when I came here. There was an old lady neighbour living by herself. Sometimes I would go in to say hello, just to chat with her. She was happy seeing us. It was shocking to me that she was alone."},{"url":null,"title":"bp-expects-production-at-giant-shetland-oil-field-to-last-for-decades","story":"The start of production follows a . billion investment programme completed in harsh operating conditions which was one of the biggest on the United Kingdom Continental Shelf for years.Read more: West of Shetland in focus for BP after oil giant quadruples profitsBP expects Clair Ridge to recover  million barrels with production set to last for decades.Industry leaders noted the potential to extract huge quantities of additional reserves from the Clair field through other projects, with BP and partners already mulling another development phase.The start of production from the project will boost hopes other developments in the frontier area West of Shetland could unlock billions of barrels oil and gas and help the industry recover from the deep downturn triggered by the crude price plunge.Read more: Oil industry leaders welcome show of faith in North Sea from BP as Chevron signals retreat from areaOil  Gas UK chief executive Deirdre Michie said first oil at Clair Ridge was a major step forward in BPrsquos campaign West of Shetland, which she described as ldquothe frontier region which is likely to have the greatest potential to expand current UK production.The start of production from Clair Ridge was an important step towards maximising the recovery of the reserves in the wider North Sea area.ldquoItrsquos greatly encouraging to see one of the basinrsquos original explorers using new, ambitious approaches and pioneering technology to help lead a revival in production, added Ms Michie.The comments highlight how advances in technology have encouraged oil and gas firms to develop fields West of Shetland that were long thought to be too challenging to be commercially viable.BP discovered the Clair field in  but only started production from the m barrel first phase in  in an effort the company said involved leveraging its technology and ingenuity.Read more: At nearly  Clairs time has comeThe head of its Upstream exploration and production arm, Bernard Looney, said the start-up of Clair Ridge was a culmination of decades of persistence.He added: ldquoThis is a major milestone for our Upstream business and highlights BPrsquos continued commitment to the North Sea region.Clair Ridge is the first project completed using low salt technology BP developed to make it easier to flush oil out of reservoirs.The company developed two huge production s and laid miles of subsea pipelines to take output from Clair Ridge for processing at the Sullom Voe terminal on Shetland.These could be used to help bring other fields in the area into production.West of Shetland has remained relatively under-explored compared to parts of the North Sea close to the UK mainland partly because a lack of production facilities in the area has put firms off drilling.Read more: Bumper gas find stokes excitement about West of Shetland frontierAriel Flores, regional president for BPrsquos North Sea business, said: ldquoSafely delivering first oil from Clair Ridge, in some of the harshest conditions in the United Kingdom Continental Shelf, is the result of years of planning and hard work by BP, our partners and supply chain colleagues.ldquoWe are proud to have played our part in this pioneering project and are excited for the Clair regionrsquos continued potential.BP noted Clair is estimated to contain seven billion barrels oil and gas.With the Clair Ridge facilities designed for  years of production the project could make a big contribution to BPrsquos profits for years to come.Directors have highlighted the profitability of such large scale projects, on which the company can take advantage of scale economies and advances in technology to achieve high margins.Production from Clair Ridge is expected to peak at , barrels daily.BP maintained investment in Clair Ridge despite shrinking its North Sea operations and shedding around  jobs in the region in response to the crude price plunge from  to .Clair Ridge has provided plenty of work for the UK oil and gas supply chain since it was approved in .

The unions argue that pay has fallen in value over the last decade and they want a % rise as a ldquorestorative measure. Swinney says % is unaffordable and has offered %. A proposed rejig of the main grading scale would also boost incomes.Teachers remain hostile to the offer. A rally in Glasgow, held to promote the pay claim, attracted tens of thousands of supporters. In a consultative ballot last week, around % of members in the two main unions - the EIS and the SSTA - rejected the % offer. A statutory strike vote is getting closer.Swinney could ignore the unions and stick with the % offer, which was formally made by council representatives as part of the tripartite body set up to determine teacher pay. He could argue that no other public sector group is getting close to % and explain that such a rise would go to all teachers, regardless of income, including heads on pound, a year. He could stand his ground.The political reality is he will put more money on the table. Swinney and his Cabinet colleagues are trying to build momentum for a second independence referendum and want to assemble a coalition of voters to tip them over the edge. The SNP Governmentrsquos ultimate objective would not be advanced by tens of thousands of teachers going on strike.Swinney has already antagonised the unions by writing to teachers directly about the % claim. They saw it as an interference in their democratic affairs. It also backfired: after Swinneyrsquos ldquocommunication, teachers overwhelmingly rejected his pay offer. He will now want to dial down the row.What is he likely to do  With extra money coming to Scotland as a result of the UK Government budget, Swinney is in a position to argue for extra resources to bump up the offer. One suggestion is a deal over three years, rather than twelve months. Such an outcome would have the advantage of ensuring that teachers will not cause the Government any more headaches on pay until after the  Holyrood election.Police officers were recently given a multi-year deal and the First Minister last week hinted that a similar offer could be in the pipeline. ldquoPay awards need to be affordable, becausethey are not affordable, they cannot be delivered, she said. ldquoI would love to give teachers and all public sector workers a  per cent pay rise, but that is simply not affordable in a single year.One reason for believing that strike action could be averted is the positive relationship between Swinney and EIS general secretary Larry Flanagan. Whereas EIS members have an increasingly unfavourable opinion of the Education Secretary, the union leader gets on well with Swinney. Asked about him last year, Flanagan said: ldquoI think he is very competent.Back in the s, Flanagan was a Militant Labour councillor in Glasgow whose political career was stymied by the party. He is believed to have a long memory of his treatment by Labour and has constructive relations with the SNP Government. He is also said to be more critical of council umbrella group COSLA than Swinney.However, simply increasing the pay offer creates an additional problem for the Government. Councils employ a range of staff, not just teachers. The unions that represent these workers have made similar arguments about restorative pay claims and they too are limbering up for strike action. If EIS members get %, why should it be lower for those in the GMB, Unite and Unison COSLArsquos position on ldquoparity - which roughly means staff groups receiving the same inflation pay increase - is noteworthy in this respect. Swinney could solve one problem by offering a % rise to teachers, but in the process trigger strike action by the other unions which would want the same for their members. Sturgeon herself raised this point on Thursday by saying that ldquoall public sector workers have suffered because of years of pay restraint.Put another way, consider the range of staff that work in schools as part of the wider ldquoteaching family. If Swinney agreed to a % rise for teachers, heads on pound, would get a pound, boost. By contrast, the lower paid classroom assistants, cleaners and school technicians would get % in one year. It would be a tough sell for any Government that claims to believe in fairness.As Finance Secretary between  and , Swinney had a knack for producing creative solutions to a range of problems involving local government. He will need to be politically nimblehe is to solve the puzzle of the teacher pay dispute.CLASSROOM PAYTeachersPoint pound,Point  pound,Point  pound,Point  pound,Point  pound,Point  pound,Point  pound,Headteachers and depute heads can earn between pound, and pound,THE sONE aspect of the current dispute that will be irritating the SNP Government is the repeated comparisons to the Thatcher era, when teachers walked out over pay.Between  and , the EIS led a sustained period of industrial action in protest over pay. John Pollock, the unionrsquos general secretary at the time, said thatthe ldquogrocerrsquos daughter was going to be made to listen, the EIS had to be prepared for a long battle.Action included work to rule and a series of national one day strikes, which included targeting the constituencies of Tory government ministers. Malcolm Rkind, the then Scottish Secretary, responded by announcing an ldquoindependent review into teachersrsquo pay and terms and conditions, after which an agreement was accepted.Over thirty years later, teachers are poised for another strike over pay and opposition politicians are calling for a root and branch review of remunerationWHERE DO THE PARTIES STAND Pay rises for teachers are a matter for the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers, not Holyrood, but opposition parties can apply pressure on the Government.The Scottish Greens have been most vocal in backing the unionsrsquo demands for a % rise and party co-convener Patrick Harvie has brought the issue to the chamber on more than one occasion. Raising the result on the consultative ballot last week, in which nearly % of teachers who took part rejected a % deal, he said:ldquoNone of us needs a maths teacher to help us to understand those numbers. Can the First Minister recall a more overwhelming democratic mandate from any section of the Scottish workforce Labour has also been supportive of the call for a restorative pay award. MSP Iain Gray, a former teacher, was highly critical of the Governmentrsquos decision to write to teachers directly over the % offer. He also compared the SNP Government to previous Tory administrations:ldquoThe last time Scotlandrsquos teachers were angry enough to go on strike Margaret Thatcher was still prime minister, I was a school teacher, the First Minister was a school pupil and some of the % of current teachers who have just rejected the pay offer were not even born.The Conservatives, who have backed pay restraint at a UK Government level, have not supported a % rise. The Liberal Democrats described the ballot result as an ldquoextraordinary and brutal rebuke to Swinney and have called for a ldquofair deal and an independent expert review."},{"url":null,"title":"rossetti-drawing-bought-in-second-hand-bookshop-for-75-to-go-on-show-at-museum","story":"The artwork, called Ricorditi Di Me, Che Son La Pia , has not been exhibited in public in  years.Rossetti featured the model Alexa Wilding, whom he first met in the street, in the  study for a painting he completed in .He used his better-known muse Jane Morris, we of arts and crafts designer William Morris, for the final painting, La Pia DersquoTolomei, which is now in the Spencer Museum of Art in Kansas.The drawing, bought by Sir Ivor Batchelor, is part of the Sir Ivor and Lady Batchelor Bequest, made to the Fitzwilliam in , with highlights of the collection to be displayed from December .Henrietta Ward, assistant keeper for paintings, drawings and prints, said: ldquoThe fact that he found it in the bookshop was quite a fluke.Sir Ivor wrote in an essay: ldquoIt was in the tiny second-hand bookshop of Robert Aitken in Bruntsfield, Edinburgh, in the years immediately after World War Two that I found drawings and prints which were within our miniscule budget and which were often of real quality.ldquoAitken was a dealer of exceptional knowledge and discrimination.ldquoIt was a red letter day in  when off the floor in Aitkenrsquos shop, with a windfall of royalties from a book, we bought for pound Rossettirsquos very fine and very large drawing for La Pia.Museum workers inspecting the piece found a typewritten note from Rossetti on the reverse, with his instructions for care.It read ldquoThis drawing not being lsquosetrsquo it will require the greatest careever removed from its frame, and was followed by Rossettirsquos address.ldquoItrsquos quite nice that he put that little warning note, said Ms Ward.She said Rossetti was ldquoquite famous for his use of models, he had very obsessive relationships with his models.He had an affair with Jane Morris and ldquoabsolutely loved her, Ms Ward said, and had been ldquoobsessed with Wildingrsquos ldquobright auburn hair and her beautul face.The exhibition, called Collecting And Giving: Highlights From The Sir Ivor And Lady Batchelor Bequest, features  objects from the overall collection of  items including drawings, bronzes, glass and pieces of English pottery.Also in the display is a .inbronze statue of Perseus by Sir Alfred Gilbert, who famously sculpted Eros in Piccadilly Circus.Perseus, who killed the snake-haired Medusa in Greek mythology, is portrayed as thoughtful by Gilbert, with one winged sandal off as he equips himself.Sir Ivor Batchelor, who was Professor of Psychiatry at Dundee University from  to , died in  aged .Lady Batchelor died in .The couple first made contact with the Fitzwilliam Museum in  and generously donated objects from their collection over the following decade.This will be the first time items from the Batchelor bequest are exhibited together, and they will be displayed at the Fitzwilliam Museum from December   to March  ."},{"url":null,"title":"university-team-given-celebrity-support-in-scottish-cup-match","story":"Sir Andy Murrayrsquos mother Judy and Olympic swimmer Duncan Scott were among  spectators at the University of Stirlingrsquos fixture against Elgin City on Saturday.It was the first time the team had competed in the third round of the national competition, but they went down - to the Scottish League Two side.Stirling coach Chris Geddes said: ldquoI have been involved with the university for eight seasons now and I have never seen anything like this at a home game before.ldquoI would have loved to have been playing today.

If no deal is out and the PMs Withdrawal Agreement is toast, it means Brexit is now seriously stalled.

So what happened  Two events led up to this important juncture: the failed ldquoDads Army coup and the publication of the Political Declaration.The vainglorious attempt by the European Research Group of hard Brexit Tory MPs, led by Jacob Rees Mogg, to organise a coup against the Prime Minister was a dismal failure. They failed to gather enough votes even for a leadership contest to be triggered. It exposed the entire hard Brexit faction of the Conservative Party to ridicule and underlined their own irrelevance. Strike one to Theresa May.Suddenly, the press started to feature more positive images of the PM: no longer the hapless, bumbling dancing queen but a serious politician doing her best, a stateswoman even. One Tory backbench supporter said her opponents were motivated by ldquomisogyny and many women appeared to agree. A YouGov Times polls showed that the PMs approval rating had risen  points in one week.But then came what was probably the crunch moment in the entire two and a half years of Brexit negotiations: the publication of the  page Political Declaration. This was supposed to outline Britainrsquos future trading relations with the EU after Brexit. It didnrsquot. The painful reality is that nothing has been agreed.To say that the document is woolly is an insult to sheep. It is a disingenuous confection of warm words, empty declarations and wishful thinking that no one could possibly take seriously. The only thing it really delivered was a surfeit of adjectives - ldquoambitious, broad, deep and flexible - without the slightest hint of how Mrs Mays ldquofrictionless trade deal could ever be achieved. It amounted, as the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon observed, to the release of a herd of unicorns.Theresa May insists that the PD outlines ldquoa unique trading relationship with the EU, but it does nothing of the kind. It promises: ldquoa free trade area as well as wider sectoral cooperation where it is in the mutual interest of both Parties. But the reality is that the mutual interests of the parties, the UK and the EU, are irreconcilably opposed, not least because of the PMrsquos red lines on immigration and the single market. At bottom, the Political Declaration only guarantees a Canada-style free trade agreement.The document makes clear that the EU will regard the UK as a ldquothird country, and that further participation by the UK in the single market involves: ldquorespecting the integrity of the Unionrsquos Single Market and the Customs Union and the inisibility of the four freedoms. If Britain accepts the common rules or ldquolevel playing field on trade and services, it has also to accept ldquothe integrity of the Unionrsquos legal order... including the role of the Court of Justice of the European Unionin the interpretation of Union law.This has been compared to the kind of control the old Soviet Union exercised over nominally autonomous republics like the Ukraine. Thats unfair: the EU is not a communist dictatorship. But it does look very like the current EU arrangement with Turkey, which is in the Customs Union for goods but not in the EU. This is because of Britains commitment to the Northern Irish backstop in the draft Withdrawal Agreement, which accompanies the Political Declaration.The backstop began le as an attempt to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland, but has ended up placing the UK in an intolerable position for a sovereign nation: having to accept laws over which it has no control. Dominic Raab is absolutely right. This is far worse than remaining in the European Union. Right now, the UK is fully represented, not just in the EU parliament and the Brussels commission, but as a member of the Council of Ministers, is part of the supreme decision-making body of the Union. This gives the UK an effective veto matters of vital national interest.Britain loses this power next March, when we leave the EU. Thereafter we will still have to accept EU laws during the transition period and throughout the backstop arrangement, which will continue unless and until there is a new frictionless trade deal negotiated. The Political Declaration made clear that there isnt the remotest sign of such a deal happening.In the backstop, Theresa May has agreed for the UK to remain in the Customs Unionand for Northern Ireland to remain largely in the single market. Worse still, Britain can only leave the backstop by mutual agreement with the EU, which gives Brussels an effective veto on Britainrsquos departure from it. As Dr Kirsty Hughes has pointed out, the transition backstop places the UK in the same subordinate position as Turkey, a country which is trying to enter the EU but has not met the relevant conditions. Britain will have a legal obligation to follow trading rules on which it has no say.Does Theresa May understand how the EU s  She says that Britain is restoring its ldquosovereignty in the Withdrawal Agreement. Yet the truth is, the UK never lost its sovereignty in the  years it was in the EU. This was stated clearly in paragraph . of the UK governments own White Paper in February . However, under the Withdrawal Agreement Britain really does stand to lose sovereignty, and become a country whose laws governing trade are set by a foreign entity.That  page document was a tightly-drafted legal text, written in a language accessible only to lawyers. Now the Political Declaration has, by its very vagueness, exposed Britains dilemma with crystal clarity: we are in danger of making a mistake of historic proportions. It is simply impossible to contemplate Britain agreeing to this, and no responsible national legislature should accept it. No longer is British sovereignty ldquopooled in the EU, it is effectively relinquished.I dont blame Brussels for this. They wish Britain well, but their priority has always been to protect the integrity of the European Single Market while avoiding a hard border in Ireland. The EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, simply stuck to his brief. Theresa May tied herself in linguistic contortions, trying to gain privileged access to the EU without being a member of it. That was never going to happen. Like M.C. Escherrsquos impossible staircase, the negotiations always ended up at the beginning.MPs must now help Dominic Raab to draw the obvious conclusion, revoke Article  and halt the process. Dead.

Strike one to Theresa May.Suddenly, the press started to feature more positive images of the PM: no longer the hapless, bumbling dancing queen but a serious politician doing her best, a stateswoman even. One Tory backbench supporter said her opponents were motivated by ldquomisogyny and many women appeared to agree. A YouGov Times polls showed that the PMs approval rating had risen  points in one week.But then came what was probably the crunch moment in the entire two and a half years of Brexit negotiations: the publication of the  page Political Declaration. This was supposed to outline Britainrsquos future trading relations with the EU after Brexit. It didnrsquot. The painful reality is that nothing has been agreed.To say that the document is woolly is an insult to sheep. It is a disingenuous confection of warm words, empty declarations and wishful thinking that no one could possibly take seriously. The only thing it really delivered was a surfeit of adjectives - ldquoambitious, broad, deep and flexible - without the slightest hint of how Mrs Mays ldquofrictionless trade deal could ever be achieved. It amounted, as the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon observed, to the release of a herd of unicorns.Theresa May insists that the PD outlines ldquoa unique trading relationship with the EU, but it does nothing of the kind. It promises: ldquoa free trade area as well as wider sectoral cooperation where it is in the mutual interest of both Parties. But the reality is that the mutual interests of the parties, the UK and the EU, are irreconcilably opposed, not least because of the PMrsquos red lines on immigration and the single market. At bottom, the Political Declaration only guarantees a Canada-style free trade agreement.The document makes clear that the EU will regard the UK as a ldquothird country, and that further participation by the UK in the single market involves: ldquorespecting the integrity of the Unionrsquos Single Market and the Customs Union and the inisibility of the four freedoms. If Britain accepts the common rules or ldquolevel playing field on trade and services, it has also to accept ldquothe integrity of the Unionrsquos legal order... including the role of the Court of Justice of the European Unionin the interpretation of Union law.This has been compared to the kind of control the old Soviet Union exercised over nominally autonomous republics like the Ukraine. Thats unfair: the EU is not a communist dictatorship. But it does look very like the current EU arrangement with Turkey, which is in the Customs Union for goods but not in the EU. This is because of Britains commitment to the Northern Irish backstop in the draft Withdrawal Agreement, which accompanies the Political Declaration.The backstop began le as an attempt to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland, but has ended up placing the UK in an intolerable position for a sovereign nation: having to accept laws over which it has no control. Dominic Raab is absolutely right. This is far worse than remaining in the European Union. Right now, the UK is fully represented, not just in the EU parliament and the Brussels commission, but as a member of the Council of Ministers, is part of the supreme decision-making body of the Union. This gives the UK an effective veto matters of vital national interest.Britain loses this power next March, when we leave the EU. Thereafter we will still have to accept EU laws during the transition period and throughout the backstop arrangement, which will continue unless and until there is a new frictionless trade deal negotiated. The Political Declaration made clear that there isnt the remotest sign of such a deal happening.In the backstop, Theresa May has agreed for the UK to remain in the Customs Unionand for Northern Ireland to remain largely in the single market. Worse still, Britain can only leave the backstop by mutual agreement with the EU, which gives Brussels an effective veto on Britainrsquos departure from it. As Dr Kirsty Hughes has pointed out, the transition backstop places the UK in the same subordinate position as Turkey, a country which is trying to enter the EU but has not met the relevant conditions. Britain will have a legal obligation to follow trading rules on which it has no say.Does Theresa May understand how the EU s  She says that Britain is restoring its ldquosovereignty in the Withdrawal Agreement. Yet the truth is, the UK never lost its sovereignty in the  years it was in the EU. This was stated clearly in paragraph . of the UK governments own White Paper in February . However, under the Withdrawal Agreement Britain really does stand to lose sovereignty, and become a country whose laws governing trade are set by a foreign entity.That  page document was a tightly-drafted legal text, written in a language accessible only to lawyers. Now the Political Declaration has, by its very vagueness, exposed Britains dilemma with crystal clarity: we are in danger of making a mistake of historic proportions. It is simply impossible to contemplate Britain agreeing to this, and no responsible national legislature should accept it. No longer is British sovereignty ldquopooled in the EU, it is effectively relinquished.I dont blame Brussels for this. They wish Britain well, but their priority has always been to protect the integrity of the European Single Market while avoiding a hard border in Ireland. The EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, simply stuck to his brief. Theresa May tied herself in linguistic contortions, trying to gain privileged access to the EU without being a member of it. That was never going to happen. Like M.C. Escherrsquos impossible staircase, the negotiations always ended up at the beginning.MPs must now help Dominic Raab to draw the obvious conclusion, revoke Article  and halt the process. Dead. Say no to no say."},{"url":null,"title":"israeli-minister-snp-harshest-in-europe-on-israel","story":"Michael Oren, a historian who is now deputy minister in the Israeli Prime Ministerrsquos office, also accused the Scottish Government of ldquogratuitously misreading international law when it described Israelrsquos attacks on Gaza as ldquodisproportionate.Oren spoke to the Herald at the Knesset ndash Israelrsquos Parliament ndash in Tel Aviv last week as rockets fell on Israeli towns and cities last week.The barrage of almost  rockets from Gaza followed a botched spying mission by Israeli forces which left eight dead. Israel responded to the rockets with air strikes at more than  sites in Gaza. The violence was the worst in the region since the -day conflict in .In August  then Minister for External Affairs Humza Yousaf condemned rocket attacks from Gaza but added that Israelrsquos response was ldquodisproportionate.His assessment was based on the death toll in Gaza, where , people died, including , civilians. On the Israeli side,  soldiers and six civilians died.Michael Oren MKsaid: ldquoI understand the Scottish Government has taken a position on us which is probably the harshest of any political party in Europe. They vie with some of the Swedish parties and the Irish parties.ldquoBut let me say aboutdisproportionality. First of all, it is a gross misreading of international law. I studied international law. Disproportionality says very simply that an army can only use the force necessary to meet the threat. If we use a certain amount of force and rockets continue to fall on our territory then the force cannot be disproportionate, just cannot by definition.ldquoSo, itrsquos a gross misreading and I would say a gratuitous misreading of disproportionality principles. We are in fact,anything, under proportion in our use of force.ldquoMany other societies, most other societies, would use a reckless amount of force to stop rockets falling on civilians. We have not done that. We have the power, boy we have the power. We could end it very quickly.Human Rights organisation Amnesty issued a report on Israel earlier this year which accused the government of ldquocollectively punishing Gazarsquos entire population with an air, land and sea blockade.The blockade has triggered a humanitarian crisis with electricity cuts affecting clean water and sanitation and diminishing health service access. The blockade has rendered Gaza increasingly ldquounliveable, according to the United Nations.Oren said: ldquoI know this is dficult but when you think about Gaza you have to throw out everything you know about everything in human affairs. Irsquoll give you examples. Hamaswants to keep a low light on the humanitarian crisis there but it burnt down a crossing to Gaza three times. It burnt fuel lines to a population which is in any case only getting three hours a day of electricity.ldquoAnd by the way Hamas has   electricity in its tunnels and its bunkers and headquarters. No problems there with electricity, no problems with water.The Scottish Government said its position on the situation in Gaza ldquowas and continues to be in line with much mainstream international opinion.A spokesman for the Scottish Government added: ldquoMore generally, we support international efforts to bring resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, based on working towards a two-state solution."},{"url":null,"title":"top-israeli-politician-celtic-fans-who-fly-palestinian-flag-are-sad","story":"Michael Oren, deputy minister in the Israeli Prime Ministerrsquos office, also said collecting cash at matches for charities thathelp Palestinians is ldquoill-advised.But when asked what he thought about Rangers fans who fly the Israeli flag the politician smiled and said: ldquoI like lsquoem.The Herald revealed in September that the Palestinian and Israeli flags were on a police list of flags which could be a criminal offence to fly in Scotland.A ldquorestricted document issued to officers includes pictures of potentially criminal symbols and a brief description of the laws which may be brokenthey are flown ldquoin a provocative manner.The Israeli flag is flown by loyalists who ldquoalign themselves with Israel due to British support for the state, according to the document.

Perhaps theyrsquoll be watching tomorrow when InSight touches down on that distant world which has so long held sway over the imagination of humanity. Perhaps theyrsquoll realise that the landerrsquos mission is another vital rung placed in the ladder which will inevitably take us sooner rather than later from this blue planet to that red planet.Nasarsquos Insight lander is basically a robot geologist which will unlock the secrets of Mars - including why the planet has no electro-magnetic field to protect it from the sunrsquos deadly radiation. If Mars ever bore le then one theory has it that it was the loss of its magnetic shield which caused that le to end. Andmicroscopic le is still there, it will be hidden beneath the surface away from those killer rays.InSight left Earth in May and is set to make touch down around noon on Monday. The excitement in the space community around Insight is tangible - everyone you speak to can barely contain their anticipation, because InSight underscores that what was once thought impossible is now becoming probable: humankind will one day walk on the surface of our closest planetary neighbour, and most likely colonise it too.However, while that journey now looks very likely to take place in the near future - perhaps as early as the mid-s - the struggle to make it happen is Herculean. Lives will be lost, trillions spent, reputations made, and careers ruined. But when that manned mission happens, it will change humankind forever. Not only will we have become a space-faring species, and secured ourselves from extinction - with humans on two planets it is unlikely we will ever be wiped out by war, weather or any other wild event - but humanity will have created a collective and unying goal that will change how we co-operate across nations and see ourselves and neighbours. It would be the greatest moment of change in the history of humankind - and it will probably happen in our letime. On top of all that, we could also discover whether there was ever - or perhaps even still is - le on Mars, albeit microbial, and answer the most profound of all questions: lsquoAre we alone rsquoSome ask whether the pay-off is worth the risk. Most scientists tend to think like Jim Lovell, the astronaut who commanded Apollo  on its near fatal mission to the Moon in . lsquoIs it worth it rsquo Lovell asks himself in his mid-west drawl. lsquoUh-huh, itrsquos worth it.rsquoChapter OneFIRST STEPSRight now, in labs and research centres around the world the groundwork is being laid for the future mission. Biologists and chemists are working out how astronauts will take enough water and food to stay alive on a  million mile journey lasting around seven months. Psychologists are trying to establish how a handful of people will endure such a voyage in a gloried tin can and then live together without killing each other while pioneering the harshest environment humanity has ever experienced. Physicists and engineers are designing the sort of rockets and le support systems that will get us there - and hopefully back.Liz Seward, senior strategist at Airbus Defence and Space - which is building the new Mars rover for the European Space Agency at Stevenage in England - says the next decade will be spent learning how humans can live in space. The moon will be used as a testing ground and sometime after  people could be exploring the red planet. lsquoTherersquos water ice there so humans would be able to live there and mine it,rsquo Seward says.Seward thinks that the future of space exploration depends on private companies working with national governments. lsquoGoing into space is quite expensive,rsquo she says, adding: lsquoEventually someone has to pay for it and there has to be a reason to be out there. There are resources you can find on Mars and the Moon and on asteroids that you canrsquot find on Earth.rsquoChapter TwoGETTING THEREElon Musk - one of the richest people in the world and a man who could have stepped from the pages of a sci-fi novel himself - has as his chief project the building of cities on Mars. His company SpaceX has supercharged the new space race.Muskrsquos engineers are designing the Big Falcon Rocket- a fully reusable spacecraft. His team is evangelical - weeping when rockets crash land and ecstatic when a flight goes well.But humanity is still a long way from the goal. lsquoAll we can do right now,rsquo says Jim Green, Nasarsquos planetary science ision director, lsquois land a one tonne rover, to get humans there we need a  tonne spaceship.rsquoThe key is next-generation retro-rockets. The Martian atmosphere is so thin that there is little to slow a spacecraft coming in at Mach . Any ship will need to turn its thrusters to the surface of the planet and fire them up to cause enough drag to land safely. Bladed shields will be indispensable to stop the craft evaporating in the heat of its descent, and even old-fashioned parachutes will be required to add a little extra gravitational pull.Chapter ThreeTHE COLONYSo what do we do once we get there  Most probably the first humans to arrive on Mars will live in their ship - but that couldnrsquot last long due to the effects of solar radiation. Eventually, wersquod have to build some permanent site. This Martian outpost wonrsquot be a series of domes in the arid landscape. Wersquore more likely to set up home in the empty lava tubes of extinct volcanoes - where there might be a chance to find frozen water and where wersquod definitely be much safer from solar rays.A Martian colony would comprise a number of key buildings: therersquod be lsquohabsrsquo for living in a communications and satellite post a medical centre a cargo centre an oxygen creation centre called a lsquoMoxiersquo a water creation centre called a lsquoWarsquo a solar  field a D printer post a nuclear reactor and a mining centre. It would be austere but efficient.Chapter FourTHE FIGHT FOR SURVIVALBut would it be survivable  Astronaut, Scott Kelly, spent a year on the International Space Station, while his twin brother Mark, a former Space Shuttle commander, stayed on Earth, in order to test the long term effects of space travel on the human body. Muscles atrophy, bones weaken, the cardio-vascular system slows, red blood cell production drops, balance deteriorates, eyesight fails, the immune system is hampered. Thatrsquos just the really bad stuff - therersquos also a constant blocked up nose, insomnia, and the dreaded space farts because interplanetary travel means extra gas in the body, not a lot of fun when yoursquore trapped in a command module.So much for the physical effects - what about the mind  Two main projects have tested psychological resilience to space travel: the Hi Seas Mission at Mauna Loa on Hawaii and the Mars  Mission in Russia. In both cases, small crews were kept isolated in a simulated spacecraft for months on end. As all Mars scientists know, the human being must be as resilient as the rocket.From the Mars  experiment, only two crew remained psychologically heathy out of six. Four experienced problems with mood, impulsivity and insomnia. Most were trained astronauts and medics. We still donrsquot know why there were effected, or how to prevent such effects reoccurring.Chapter FiveTHE SWEET SPOTSo once we make the gruelling journey where would we land  Dr Philip Thomas, principal investigator with ExoMars, the joint European-Russian mission hunting for le on the red planet, says until the ExoMars satellite swung over our distant neighbour in  we knew lsquodiddly-squatrsquo. Wersquod only mapped about three percent of Mars. lsquoMoving dunes, dust devils, polar caps, are all now being seen,rsquo he says.Once we have a D map of the planet wersquoll be able to pick the safest, flattest site. Mars is known as the graveyard after all. Nasa historian Roger Launius of the Smithsonian Institute explains that only % of probes sent to Mars are successful in their mission. lsquoThatrsquos not a great track record,rsquo he says.Launias thinks our initial forays to Mars will be a little like our journeys to Antartica. Initially wersquoll explore, then wersquoll build a research station at a sweet spot that is resupplied with people and material from the outside world, and slowly wersquoll build up a presence in an inhospitable land. McMurdo Station in Antartica is now an effective city with many nations working together there.Chapter SixDAILY LIFE ON THE RED PLANETHowever, as the popular scientist Neil deGrasse Tyson makes clear: lsquoIf you want to stay there, you need to grow your own food.rsquo At first, wersquoll do this is small greenhouses, then giant greenhouses, but in the long-term the plan would be to terraform Mars - to turn the red planet green. Broadly speaking, that means creating a huge greenhouse gas effect to heat the planet and thicken the atmosphere, but as yet we donrsquot have the technology, so when we do get there it looks like wersquoll be living in habs at the bottom of volcanoes and eating greenhouse GM food for a while.Just because we get there, though, it doesnrsquot mean wersquoll survive. The docu-drama Mars, on the National Geographic channel, paints a terrying portrait of le for early settlers - all informed by scientists like deGrasse Tyson. Mars is unforgiving. It kills. Rockets mal, fires break out, minds snap - and a trail of human bodies is left littering the path to humanityrsquos new frontier.Perhaps the greatest risk to human le once we get there is weather. Nasarsquos Jim Green says: lsquoWersquove been studying dust storms for quite some time and therersquos a particular season where some of the dust storms can go global. They can be enormous -  kilometres high. They can get charged and in the case of these really large storms lightning can strike.rsquo These storms can last a month. It sounds impossible to survive.Chapter SevenWHERE THERErsquoS A WILLhellipRichard Nixon was the president who pulled back from the drive to go to Mars, following public concern in the wake of Jim Lovellrsquos Apollo  expedition, and focussed instead on Space Shuttle missions. Many in the space community call the shuttle project lsquogoing into low orbitrsquo as it didnrsquot really take humankind anywhere. It was like giving up on the New World after Columbus sailed to America.With that in mind, loss of le - which many see as inevitable - could derail any Martian exploration. Roger Launius, from the Smithsonian, says: lsquoIf you send astronauts to Mars and they die there, I guarantee you that public opinion will prohibit you from ever doing it again.rsquo Itrsquos little wonder that the moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos, are named after the gods of fear and terror.The thing is, though, humanity has already dreamt of going to Mars. From the ancients through to modern science fiction writers, we have the idea of journeying to, and living on, Mars engrained in our collective consciousness. If yoursquove dreamt something, yoursquoll most likely one day do it.Peter Diamandis, co-founder of Planetary Resources - an asteroid mining company - says: lsquoTherersquos a romanticism about going to Mars and colonising it - and itrsquos a future in which we are building cities. We humans love a target. We love to have something to shoot for, to aim for hellip itrsquos been the case over and over again, whether itrsquos the colonisation of the New World, the railroads, the opening up of the west, all these things are impossible until we make them real.rsquoTHE SCOTS SCIENTIST HELPING PIONEER MARSDR PATRICK Harkness is a modestly-spoken man. Most of us wouldnrsquot be quite as humble about our endeavours as he is - after all, the Glasgow University scientist has developed a key piece of kit without which human exploration of Mars just wouldnrsquot be feasible.On Mars, low gravity makes it almost impossible to drill - the lack of weight means itrsquos extremely hard to get the necessary heft behind drilling machinery to crack the surface. But Harknessrsquos ultrasonic drill removes that problem - and think how important drilling will be on the red planet. As we know, itrsquos more likely we will live underground. Wersquoll also be searching for water beneath the surface, and microbial signs of le - whether long-dead or still alive and kicking - will probably be underground away from killer solar rays.For Harkness, though, there are big ethical questions over what we do with samples found on Mars. The plan for a Mars lsquosample and rsquo mission is already well underway. Its first stage would see a robot mission bring back rocks and possibly even evidence of extinct or extant microbial le. The work done in Glasgow has advanced the science around lsquosample and rsquo, but Harkness worries about the possible risk of Martian rocks contaminating Earth.lsquoWhen you take samples from another planet and bring them to Earth, you have to be absolutely certain they pose no threat,rsquo he says, lsquoand as unlikely as it may appear that there will be any virus or protein in these Martian samples, chances can not be taken.rsquoHarkness speculates the safest plan might be to take the samples no further than the International Space Station and analyse them there. Perhaps, they could be rendered inert on the ISS and then transferred to Earth.Hersquos conscious of the fact that with private companies now potentially leapfrogging governments in the space race that business needs to be regulated in the same way as agencies like Nasa for safetyrsquos sake. lsquoYou need regulation to stop crazy people putting the planet at risk,rsquo Harkness says from his office in the School of Engineering. lsquoTherersquos nothing wrong with doing things privately as long as they are regulated. If people just went to Mars and brought back samples that would be dangerous.rsquoAnother ethical worry for Harkness is the inevitable result of colonisation: babies. lsquoSay someone got pregnant on Mars - then you have a child who didnrsquot chose to be born on another planet. They will grow up experiencing one third of the gravity of Earth so their muscle tone will not be the same, their heart will not be strong enough to pump blood to their brainthey ever ed to Earth.rsquoDespite his caution, hersquos pretty confident that there will be men and women walking on Mars within his letime - and hersquos only . Such a monumental achievement, he said, could well uny our increasingly fractured planet and make Earth a better place for all."},{"url":null,"title":"future-shock-the-secrets-of-spiritualists-and-why-its-unlikely-any-of-them-are-going-to-heaven-themselves","story":"Yoursquoll note he didnrsquot mention women, but maybe itrsquos because therersquos simply no requirement for a defined gender ldquoup there.

Doubt the broo fork out for that one.Even something as innocuous and silly as psychic mailings ndash letters promising spiritual messages ndash is estimated to cost UK believers poundm each year, according to Office of Fair Trading research.Yet, itrsquos newer technological devilry such as online and satellite TV services that have allowed spiritualism to join the dark pantheon of digital cam-sex, casinos and bingo in casting a spell of mass zombied stupor over the nation.Right now, millions are sacricing their dignity in supermarket aisles, scrapping with strangers over yellow Whoops! sticker food items ndash just so they have enough cash to send on a one-way journey to humming servers registered for tax reasons in the Isle of Man ndash chasing the dragon of thrills and comfort clearly missing in their real lives.Tricks of the tradeThe well known terms lsquocold readingrsquo and lsquohot readingrsquo are little more than clever use of what is known to sociologists as the Forer Effectand itrsquos how even the smartest of us can be taken in by those who \"talk to the dead\" and accept all major credit cards - but would likely prefer cash in hand.The bold, brave Derren Brown has masterfully built an admirable career using similar psychological tricky, suggestion and subtle thought manipulaton but at least he and others such as entertainer Keith Barry - who made one of the most successful TedTalks of all time when he guessed the name of a womans ex with just a few quesions - never actually claim to be psychic. Quite the opposite - mentalists like Brown and Barry seem to get a kick out of exposing the woo and deception of ldquoreal mystics who monetise on human weakness and susceptibility. Its the oldest game in town.So why are so many otherwise clever folk fooled  There are countless methods, some learned, some a natural sensitivity to expressions and vocal tics, but herersquos a few familiar and perhaps not so familiar.Firstly, the fact we are social animals who assimilate to our environment and mostly play along with the overarching vibe is one always exploited by mediums. Itrsquos quite clear to psychics that you are not seeing them reluctantly like the docs or dentist - you are there for one very specic reason - and have paid money to get it. Therefore, you want value and will fool even yourself to feel you got it.Secondly, a familiar ldquovagueness of the connection to the spiritual ether allows psychics to backtrack on their many mistakes, using them as ldquofeelers. While they explain to you that the spirit world doesnt always communicate clearly, mibbie still on dial-up, theyrsquore studying each of your facersquos  muscles for the slightest twitch at their vague suggestions of common first names, initials, common cancers and medical conditions, funeral songs, coloured house doors and dog collar material. Its all very mundane in the afterle, it seems.One does wonder why spirits play games with initials. And instead of telling us that you liked the cardigan we wore at the graveyard, tell us what God is like. What has your new plane of existence revealed about the meaning of it all, granny  Oh, you liked the song we chose at the funeral - thanks for coming through from the great beyond to share that. pound well spent, but no receipt.The whistleblowerWe all like to think ourselves as unreadable behind our social masks, but the true is wersquore all pretty much open books to those who know what theyrsquore looking for - especially now in the days of ubiquitous social media. Simple, minute shts in body language, facial expression and plenty of other subtle cues also leave us standing as naked as Cheggars on Channel .One rather simple yet effective trick was part of a confession by psychic-turned-whistleblower Mark Edward, who revealed when customers paid in advance by credit card for the psychic session, the crook on the other side - of the phone, that is - will not only receive the money but be able to see an itemised credit card history. You can certainly tell a lot about people by what they buy over the course of a month. Where they shop, how much they spend, what particular items - its all builds up a very vivid picture.Fortunately for us, whilst the scam is common practice and perfectly legitimate in the US, using credit card details in this way is illegal in the UK. ldquoItrsquos not a gt, says Edward. ldquoItrsquos maybe a skill - but I call it fraud. I have met people who are very intuitive and sensitive but there is nothing supernatural about them. They just assess information that most people donrsquot think about.\"Psychic BrexitersIN a world where a TV advert highlighting the environmental folly of palm oil production is banned, you may wonder how mediums get the green light to advertise that they can contact the dead and predict the future.Well, since , they actually canrsquot ndash and itrsquos how the spiritualist community found unlikely solidarity in another set of confidence trickers ndash the Brexiters.Unamused by folk profiting from the misery and vulnerability of others, the EU brought in new Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations forcing all commercial traders to substantiate claims made about their business ndash not easy for psychics with the whole chatting to the dead thing. They clearly never saw it coming. Humiliated spiritualists have since been forced to describe their once-revered services as ldquofor entertainment purposes only or ldquoan experiment.Perhaps they should be happy theyrsquoll never need to prove their creative fabrications are valid banter from the spirit world. It also seems the EU made a sound prediction itself ndash that in Brexit Britain, more ldquoentertainment will be absolutely necessary to stop us eating each other. And are you not entertained And finally ...MY dad was once interrupted by the police while burying our dog Trudy in the grounds of a local church. ldquoWhat the f*** you playing at, mate  they apparently enquired.I donrsquot know what my dad was playing at either.

Furthermore, few predicted that one of the biggest threats to the deal would eventually come from Brexiteer MPs when, in the early stages of the negotiations, Remain campaigners took the Government to the highest court in the land in order to secure a meaningful vote for MPs. This Commons vote is the major hurdle Mrs May must now overcomeher hard-won deal is to be enshrined in UK law. The vote is expected to take place before MPs break for Christmas in December.Led by figures including Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, a swathe of Brexiteer Tories have rejected Mrs Mayrsquos deal and called for it to be renegotiated. This raises the prospect of some of Mrs Mayrsquos own MPs voting against the agreement when it goes before the Commons. Appearing at the DUP conference on Saturday, Mr Johnson said the deal will leave the UK a ldquosatellite state of the EU. In the Sunday Express Mr Rees-Mogg said the deal ldquodoes not deliver on Brexit and ldquoinstead of taking back control, in some areas it will leave the United Kingdom with even less control than it currently has: the vassal state.LIVE: Watch Rt Hon Arlene Foster MLA ndash Party Leaderrsquos Address at the #DUP Party Conference in Belfast gt https:whellip https:t.co yhGYiTENmdash DUPNovember , The Euroscepticsrsquo rejection of the plans stems in large part from the dealrsquos backstop provision for the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Hardline Brexiteers say it risks the UK being unable to ever fully leave the EU. The DUP say the backstop would see Northern Ireland adopt a dferent regulatory regime to Great Britaina wider UK EU trade deal fails to materialise. DUP leader Arlene Foster said the draft deal fails to protect the Union. With  MPs in the Commons, their support could be crucial for Mrs Mayrsquos deal to pass.Labour repeatedly warned that they would vote against any deal that does not pass six tests. Among the requirements are that it delivers the ldquoexact same benefits, fair management of migration and the protection of workersrsquo rights and protections.

The talks will follow on from last weekrsquos meeting at Westminster between Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister, and Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader.Labourrsquos Brexit proposal is for the UK to be in a customs union with the EU, to be as near to the single market as possible and to protect workersrsquo rights and privileges the SNPrsquos is to keep the country in the current single market and customs union. The key point of disagreement between the two parties appears to be on the issue of freedom of movement Labour wants restrictions, the Nationalists do not.Plus, there is the issue of optics. Labour and the SNP forming a united front on the future of Brexit will leave them open to accusations of cosying up to pave the way for the Nationalists to prop up a Labour government in a hung Parliament infor a promise of facilitating another vote on Scotlandrsquos future.Indeed, Annie Wells, the Scottish Conservative MSP, said on Sunday that it was becoming increasingly clear that Mr Corbyn was ldquocooking up a deal with Ms Sturgeon to get him into Downing St.ldquoLabour at Westminster cant be trusted to defend our Union. Labour at Holyrood are too toothless to do anything about it. Only the Scottish Conservatives at both Westminster and Holyrood will stand up against Nicola Sturgeonrsquos obsession with a second independence referendum,\" said the Glasgow MSP.Sources close to the Lab SNP talks pointed out how there were currently two main alternatives: some form of customs union single market option and staging another referendum.One senior insider noted: ldquoAs things stand, a Peoplersquos Vote is gaining traction and seems the likelier option because it will be easier to get support from the Remainer Tories and the Lib Dems. But, as with everything to do with Brexit, things might change.Speculation about Labour warming to a second referendum has been stoked by suggestions that John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, held talks with Tom Baldwin and Alastair Campbell, the former respective spin doctors to Ed Miliband and Tony Blair, who are now campaigning for a so-called Peoples Vote.The former Prime Minister told the Andrew Marr Show \"Its moving that way\", adding: \" I would be really surprisedthe Labour Party doesnt end up in the position of supporting another vote because theres no other proposition that can get through Parliament.\"Meanwhile, it is suggested five Remainer ministers - David Lidington, Philip Hammond, Amber Rudd, Greg Clark and David Gauke - have agreed to try to get Mrs May to adopt a softer Brexit, involving a permanent customs partnership with the EU,she fails to get her current proposal through the Commons.Meanwhile on Tuesday, judges at the European Court of Justice will rule on a case brought by politicians across dferent parties as to whether or not the UK Government could unilaterally end the Article  process and keep Britain in the EU.If they rule that it can, then this option could become the key alternative to Mrs Mayrsquos rejected plan it would mean MPs and not the public voting to keep Britain in the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"bennachie saved from a96 dual plans","story":"The option to create a dual carriageway through the Bennachie area has been scrapped by the Scottish Government.It has been removed following initial design and assessment work, and also feedback from the public.Initial options removed include the existing A Inverurie Bypass and the offline southern route between east of Huntly and Blackburn, which passes through the Bennachie Special Landscape Area.Local communities and road users in the Inverurie area have the chance to see and comment on the options being taken forward for further design as the Scottish government looks to identy a preferred route option next year.Public exhibitions will be held at Inverurie Town Hall todayand tomorrow , and residents in Huntly will get to have their say on Wednesdayat Stewarts Hall.

Why not pop in on an elderly relative or neighbour and make their day Founded in Spain in  to combat Black Friday’s commercialism, it is now a global movement.But Scotland is the first nation to sign up as a whole.Ben Macpherson, Minister for Europe, Migration and International Development, was delighted to launch the initiative.He said: “This St Andrew’s Day presents an inspiring opportunity for people in Scotland, in all our ersity, to celebrate the inclusive, outward-looking and compassionate spirit of our nation – by helping others and showing our generosity.Pause for thought...consider buying a homeless person a hot meal or drink to help make their St Andrews Day.“We can all show the best of what it means to be Scottish by each doing something small to #MakeSomeonesDay. “If each of us does something kind for someone , together we can make a hugely positive impact.“We wanted our national day to act as a focal point to showcase the Scots’ generous spirit and nature.data-src\"https:images.johnstonpress jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.donsidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Missing teenager Liam Smith\"  Liam Smith: Search widens viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"“This is not about how much you can spend it’s about little acts of kindness that mean so much more.“We’re asking people to make time for elderly neighbours, donate goods to charity shops, hold a charity bake sale at work, volunteer time to a good cause or gt a meal or hot drink to a homeless person.“Everyone can get involved – all you have to do is make someone’s day.”The initiative is tied in with Fair Saturday which next year will take place on St Andrew’s Day itself.Ben added: “We’re linking in with the event this year so we can build up to having a major celebration in .“Fair Saturday gives communities across the country a chance, through arts and culture, to celebrate what it means to be Scottish in the st century.“We live in a multiculural and erse society and we want to celebrate that.“Fair Saturday offers the perfect  to do that.”First staged in Bilbao in , the Fair Saturday movement is spearheaded by social entrepreneur Jordi Albareda.It has since been adopted by Malaga, Santander and Huelva in Spain, Milan and Pisa in Italy, Lima in Peru and Bristol in England.However, Scotland is the first nation to sign up.Jordi said: “When we began the Fair Saturday movement, we wanted countries all over the world to embrace its ideals of creating social impact through arts and culture. “It is fitting that Scotland is hosting the first nationwide Fair Saturday festival outside of Spain.“Scotland is a nation that focuses on ersity, multiculturalism, social empathy, kindness and, of course, arts and culture. “So it made complete sense for us to deliver the movement here. It is the most vibrant case of Fair Saturday to date.“In a time of building walls, we want to build bridges to connect people, cities, communities and cultures. “Millions of people working together surely must be stronger than some irresponsible global leaders.“We hope the Scottish people will mobilise behind our aim of creating a better future for all.”Some  events have already been organised in  cities and towns across Scotland on Fair Saturday, December .And the movement will also be celebrated in more than  locations globally.Jordi said: “More than  cultural events with a social impact will be taking place around the world.“Could you imagine the day when millions of people take part  It would send such a powerful message – that’s our aim for the future.”Fair Saturday aims to make people reflect on how arts and culture and social causes contribute to society. So all its events support a social cause of their choice in one of three ways:By recognising the charity’s workBy allowing the charity to spread its message to a wider audienceBy contributing to the charity’s work via ticket sales and donations.November  and December  in Scotland will also serve as a perfect antidote to Black Friday’s commercialism, which initially prompted Fair Saturday’s launch.Jordi added: “We connected with the Scottish Government thanks to our British Council in Bilbao in late  and are delighted to launch our first Fair Saturday here this year.“We believe it is one of the best nations in the world in which to start the journey. “Scotland’s National Day is all about sharing, giving and being kind. That tells you a lot about its people.”Visit www.scotland.org events st-andrews-day makesomeonesday to find out more or share your good deed at #MakeSomeonesDay.Fair fight back against Black FridayFair Saturday aims to mobilise people through social empathy rather than commercialisim – being staged the day after Black Friday to make that point.Jordi Albareda, its founder, convinced  choirs to perform in Bilbao, Spain, on November , , in dferent locations around the city at the same time. The result was incredible more than  people attended, raising more than  Euros for social causes.Since then, the movement has continued to grow, with more cities, cultural and social organisations and supporters joining along the way.Jordi said: “We are living in a material world. It prevails over humanity. “The strong desire of having has taken over from the profound aspiration of being. But living to the fullest is mostly about love. “In the last hours of our lives we won’t remember the things we owned but rather the people we loved.“Black Friday is one of the most irrational days of the year strong proof of a growing materialist system, based on the short term and unsustainable. “We do not pretend to fight against Black Friday but we do offer a positive alternative.“It’s all about culture before materialism. Social empathy before greed. “It’s a day to be better following a day to have more.”As for the future, Jordi hopes to target one of the world’s largest commercial markets – America.He added: “We are already taking the first steps to develop the movement in the USA in  and we’re expecting more European cities to get involved too.“Black Friday may be popular but surely Fair Saturday makes more sense.”To support Fair Saturday and find out about events in your area, visit the website at https:app.fairsaturday.org.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Sunday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : amAdvertorial: Date: th November  Time: .pm – .pm Venue: Kirkwall  St Ola Community Centre, Broad Street, Kirkwall, Orkney Islands KW DH sectors.sepa.org.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These concerns were echoed by the group of experts giving evidence to the Committee this morning.Speaking after the committee meeting, Mr McArthur said: “Today’s evidence session left no doubt at all that the Scottish Government is now isolated over its approach to tackle fuel poverty in rural and island areas. It is increasingly clear that Ministers will have to think again and ensure their proposals are properly #island proofed#.“In a desperate move yesterday evening, the Housing Minister issued a briefing to MSPs seeking to justy his decision not to include a rural Minimum Income Standard in the revised definition of rural fuel poverty.  This attempt by the Minister to get his retaliation in first backfired, however, as the Committee heard again today how this approach flies in the face of all the advice.“The Rural Fuel Poverty Task Force, the government’s own Independent Panel of Advisers and every organisation across the Highlands  Islands involved in housing and fuel poverty have made plain that excluding a rural MIS risks support not going to the people and communities who need it. As a result, the government’s own targets for combatting fuel poverty across the country will be undermined.“While fuel poverty is not simply an island issue, all the evidence shows that it affects rural and island communities more than others. Hopefully, today’s committee evidence session will persuade ministers to think again. If not, it will be up to parliament to force the government to do the right thing”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There are a number of potential routes we could now take with them – some of which offer us the opportunity to generate income, some to make savings # and officers will be exploring these opportunities in due course.”According to OIC, the Stewart Endowment Trust disperses the majority of its funds locally, including to NHS Orkney. The council therefore anticipates that most of the money generated from the sale will stay in and benefit Orkney.Iain Macdonald, chair of the Stewart Endowment Trust said: “The Stewart Endowment Trustees offered these islands for sale in order to generate funds, which are used to support the work of local congregations, the Balfour Hospital and a couple of national charities, as defined by the Endowment’s founding document.#We are delighted that they will be moving into ship of the local authority, where they will remain a precious asset for the whole community for generations to come.”The main island, Faray is around  acres, the Holm of Faray around  acres and the smallest of the three, Red Holm, is just five acres.There are a number of ruinous dwelling houses scattered across Faray together with a bothy which is housed in the former school. The island is mainly semi-improved grassland and has several sandy beaches together with rocky shorelines and clfs.According to the council, Faray had a population of  in , falling to  by .

We have used bikes in the past and thought this peddle-powered car would be a slightly dferent iant.\"Rev Bissett, an ordained minister who does supply for Fodderty and Strathpeffer Church of Scotland and who lives at First Field Avenue, North Kessock with we Susan, minister for Killearnan and Knockbain churches, said it was good to watch it leaving for a new home.\"Im glad that it is going to be put to good use now,\" he said. \"I couldnt have scrapped it.

Albyn Housing is asking them to pay a lot more each month in some cases.The concerns were echoed by the MP Mr Blackford who said ldquofor quite a while now, he has been working with the CAB to get to bottom of ldquowhat I would generously describe as curious practices from Albyn Housing.He added: ldquoIn one case an Albyn Housing client who had just undertaken a tenancy was immediately sent a letter informing her rent was already in arrears.ldquoIn effect, they are asking for a payment arrangement in view that it is a debt, and extra payment is, therefore, being requested each month.ldquoI am sure as a charitable organisation Albyn Housing has their tenantsrsquo best wishes at heart, however, their recent practices raise many questions.ldquoThese must be reviewed to ensure that no additional hardship is being brought upon the people who take up a tenancy with them.In response, Calum Macaulay, chief executive at Albyn Housing Society, insisted his rent due date had not changed and said his organisation followed the statutory form of tenancy laid out by the Scottish Government in the HousingAct  ldquowhich states that rent is due on, or before, the first day of the month, paid in arrears.He went on: ldquoTenants claiming housing benefit previously had their rent paid directly to Albyn Housing.ldquoWe were always made aware that the payment was due, and as such, any arrears would be treated as technical.ldquoNow, with universal credit, the tenant is responsible for paying their rent direct. The society has no dealings with the DWP and we are not made aware of incoming housing payments. This means that all tenants, regardless of whether they are claiming universal credit or not, are required to pay their rent in accordance with their tenancy agreement.He said housing officers would be ldquomore than willing to help tenants make arrangements that work for them.It comes weeks after Albyn Housing had to apologise to a vulnerable tenant in Inverness after a boiler check bungle ended up leaving the single mum locked out of her flat for the night with her toddler daughter and having to rely on social workers to pay for emergency accommodation.Sunday  Nov  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The daughter of a self-made man, Coates gained a first in econometrics and went on to build her business up from scratch as a result of an instinct for the future and sheer hard graft. As that business grew, she based it in Stoke – bringing good jobs to a languishing post-industrial city – and set up a foundation which has donated £m to charities like Oxfam and CAFOD. On top of throwing energy into growing her company, she has five children, four of whom are adopted from the same family.There is a lot to commend there in , her entrepreneurship was recognised when she was awarded a CBE for her services to the community and business and the following year she was named one of the UK’s most powerful women by BBC Radio ’s Woman’s Hour.And yet for all Coates’ undoubted attributes, there is no getting away from the central fact: her online betting company, Bet, which last year had an operating profit of £m, has flourished on the back of the UK’s two million problem gamblers and the obscene salary she pays herself – which is , times the national average – is money that would have been better staying in the pockets of those iniduals who can ill afford to lose on the horses .Much attention has been paid to the evils of Fixed Odds Betting Terminalswhich have been spreading like smallpox in the UK’s most deprived areas where people stake what little money they haveon the vain hope of beating the system.FOBTs – described as the “crack cocaine of gambling” – are so pernicious because bets of up to £ can be placed every  seconds often the terminals are juxtaposed with pawnshops encouraging those who have already lost too much to trade their possessions for one more go.After a succession of suicides were linked to FOBTs, the government promised to reduce the maximum stake to £. Of course, reducing the maximum stake reduces profits, which in turn reduces income to the Treasury. It took the resignation of sports minister Tracey Crouch to force the government to back down on plans to delay the move until October . Thanks to Crouch, it will now take place in April as originally promised.This is a step forward but the understandable focus on FOBTs means the burgeoning issue of online gambling has been less publicised. Which brings us back to Coates. Coates is no stranger to high stakes. She began her career in her family’s bookmakers business. In , she realised the future of gambling was online and borrowed £m from RBS with the family firm as collateral. Her risk paid off as Bet has grown into one of the world’s largest online gambling companies, taking £.bn in wagers last year alone.But there are many things about Betthat don’t sit easy. There’s its name for a start. Bet is encouraging consistent, daily betting – not the odd flutter on the World Cup or the Grand National.Then there’s the whole tax avoidance thing. Like most online gambling companies Bet moved its headquarters to Gibraltar because of its more “favourable regulations” .But mostly, the unease with Coates’ success comes from knowing it is built onan upsurge in online gambling amongst smart phone-using millennials who can place a bet at the tap of a screen. Unlike casinos and indeed FOBTs, online gambling sites can be accessed day or night, sober or drunk, and using a credit card. The service Coates’ company offers is not merely  days a year, but also  .A recent report from the Gambling Commission showed  to -year-olds are the group most likely to have more than five online gaming accounts and to have gambled in the past four months.Online, stakes on casino games like blackjack and roulette have been known to be as high as £,. In sports, there is now a panoply of hypotheticals you can take a punt on. Where once the options were fairly limited – the final result, the highest goal scorer – there is much more focus on in-play betting: the first penalty, the first red card or even, in one famous case, whether or not a particular player will eat a pie on camera. Sure, some of this is harmless – a way of adding a bit of extra excitement to the event but it’s not the harmless gambling that brings the likes of Bet the millions it’s the problem gambling. Coates’ financial success also underlines the way in which gambling and football have become totally enmeshed. North and south of the border, betting companies such as William Hill and Ladbrokes sponsor leagues and cups and strips, largely replacing tobacco and alcohol brands.In Coates’ case, the connection is even closer Bet has . per cent of the shares in Stoke City FC Coates’ father Peter is the chairman and her husband Robert is a director.Online gambling is widespread among players who tend to have a lot of down time sitting around hotel rooms with nothing to do but play on their phones there is peer pressure too. It gives the players something to bond over, the irony being, of course, thatthey are caught gambling on football matches they face a fine or suspension.I suppose you could argue that making money out of gambling is no worse than making it out of smoking or drinking all three involve fostering potential addictions. But in Coates’ case, it’s the sheer scale of the inidual profiteering that shocks. The £m she is pocketing this year alone is more than double the total wage bill for Stoke City.That sum would be offensive enough in any sphere butshe were making her money from manufacturing a product or providing a service or creating something of social value, then at least there would be a quid pro quo.As it is, it is dirty, predatory money, and she’s made no attempt to cleanse it the addiction charity Addaction claims the sum she paid herself is over  times more than the entire industry’s contribution to treatment, and her foundation has made no contribution to that cause.To say Coates has worked hard for what she has earned is not enough to say she is not breaching any laws is a cop-out.The growth of Bet depends on persuading more and more people to squander money they cannot afford on a game that, in the long-run, they will always lose. And – successful woman in a man’s world though she is – that’s not something to celebrate.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4834733.1543145149!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon there s almost nothing true in theresa may s brexit letter","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon has hit out at Theresa May#s public plea for Brexit support, saying #almost nothing in this desperate letter is true#.In a “letter to the nation” published before the Prime Minister met the other  EU leaders in Brussels, Mrs May said leaving the union on March   would mark “a new chapter in our national le”.The -word message said that the result of the EU referendum in  would be honoured and that freedom of movement would end.It also stated that the UK would “take back control” of laws and money which,it suggested, could be spent on the NHS.Scotland’s First Minister described the letter as “desperate” and reiterated her calls for alternatives such as staying in the single market and customs union or holding a second referendum.Ms Sturgeon tweeted: “I don’t say this lightly, but almost nothing in this desperate letter is true.“This is a bad deal, driven by the PM’s self defeating red lines and continual pandering to the right of her own party. Parliament should reject it and back a better alternative - SM CU or #PeoplesVote.”As EU leaders endorsed the deal on Sunday, SNP MSP Brexit secretary Mike Russell said it “does not work for Scotland”.“It takes Scotland out of the European Union against our democratic wishes, it removes us from the single market against our economic interests, and it would put us at a competitive economic disadvantage compared to Northern Ireland,” he said.“The only thing it guarantees is years of damaging uncertainty, which will cost jobs and hit living standards and, by ending freedom of movement, will make it harder to attract the staff we need for our NHS“That is why the Scottish Government will now work with others to get a better deal for Scotland within the European single market and customs union - which is eight times bigger than the UK market alone - and why we support another referendum on EU membership.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4834693.1543131384!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish independence campaigners aim to thrive on brexit turmoil","story":"Independence campaigners are mobilising as they seek to #seize the opportunity# presented by the Brexit turmoil engulfing UK politics, leading figures among pro-nationalist groups have said.They say Nicola Sturgeon will “absolutely get a mandate” to stage a second referendumshe puts it to the people at the next Holyrood election, as Westminster continues to withold authority.But the First Minister has been warned she must adopt a radical approach to persuade Scots that a Yes vote will avert the looming “clf edge” of Brexit and transform the country’s fortunes.It has prompted claims from pro-Union groups that nationalists will “never stop” campaigning for independence despite no sht in the polls towards a majority for independence.Sturgeon has come under fresh pressure to set out her timetable for a second referendum after publication of the final EU Withdrawal Deal was met with derision and appears likely to be rejected in the Commons. “Across the board in the Yes movement there is a real appetite to seize this moment of opportunity,” said Green MSP Ross Greer, who was also communities co-ordinator with the official Yes Scotland group during the last campaign.“A UK state that is in complete crisis, that is bogged down in its own contradictions, is causing this damage to Scotland and the UK as a whole in such a visible public way.”He said “huge numbers”ofpeople were getting involved in such things as marches outwith the formal party political campaigns.“The opportunity we have to really give the independence vision a shot in the arm is to give a vision of how things can be better – or how do we mitigate the damage of this bad decision, but present a vision for society that says this doesn’t have to be Scotland’s long-term future.”The Scottish Independence Convention, an umbrella body of  pro-independence groups recently announced plans to take on two full-time employees as part of a drive get support for a Yes vote above  per cent. It came after a fundraising drive secured more than £,. Vice-convener Dave Thompson, who also heads up Christians for Independence, said: “We need to be prepared. That’s why we’re setting up the company and employing staff and getting ourselves organised. We need to be ready for whenever that campaign happens. At the moment, it’s very dficult to know when that’s going to be.“We’re ready any time. We could go very quickly, butit’s a bit further down the line. we’re ready for that as well.”Margaret Young, national co-ordinator with Women for Independence, said local groups had been forming in recent months even without any particular promotional activity.“Throughout  we’ve had about one new group a month forming,” she added.The roadblock facing the SNP at Holyrood as it seeks to hold another vote is the fact that Westminster has control over the constitution and Theresa May has refused to grant the “section ” order which would pave the way for a second vote. The First Minister has ruled out a Catalonia-style vote without legal backing and indicated last week that she may put the referendum to the people by making it the centrepiece of the Holyrood election in . If a pro-independence majority was ed, such as the current SNP-Greens alliance at Holyrood, it would be seen as an irrefutable mandate.Greer added: “In those circumstances I think you absolutely can get a mandate to win another referendum and in that situation any continued opposition from the UK government would just be completely unsustainable.”The last independence campaign initiallyfloundered, Greer said, when it sought to allay voters fears’ of leaving the UK with the message change would “safe” and minimal.“The public know independence is a massively radical step,” he added.“We need to justy why that radical step is necessary and will result in better things. We need a compelling message from the start.”But pro-Union campaigners insist there is no appetite for independence among most Scots as the post-Brexit chaos ensues.Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said: “This is a stark reminder that nationalist groups will never stop campaigning for a isive and unnecessary second independence referendum.“We know from polls that the majority of people in Scotland want to remain in the UK.“But there must be absolutely no complacency.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

stand-off.The breakthrough follows \"extremely positive and constructive\" high-level discussions between the hotel group and Highland Council.Local Highland High Leusers have been unable to use the leisure pool since the end of August when access ended because of a funding wrangle.Macdonald Hotels chairman Donald Macdonald and deputy chairman Gordon Fraser met with the councils new chief executive Donna Manson in Aviemore on Tuesday and reached a one-year agreement to resolve the stalemate.HLH users will not have to pay any additional charges which had been one of the options on the table as attempts were made to break the deadlock.There is further good news with confirmation that HLH swimming lessons for children and aquafit will also resume.Details of the funding arrangements have not yet been made public nor when the doors will re-open.Speaking after the meeting, Mr Fraser said: \"Were extremely encouraged by the positive and constructive approach taken by Donna Manson and her team and are very happy that we have reached an agreement which will see the local High Le Highland members enjoying the facilities at Aviemore Resort very soon.\"We understand that local authorities throughout the country are facing financial pressures and that there is a clear responsibility to spend tax-payers money wisely.\"We were also encouraged by the recognition of our own position that we have had to swallow a wide range of very signicant cost increases in rates, energy bills and staffing costs over the past  months.\"Mr Fraser continued: \"Its clear that both we and the council were very keen to welcome back local people and reach a clear and swt resolution to what has been an unfortunate situation for everyone concerned, and particularly for the many local High Le Highland members.\"For our part, we are very keen to have our local guests back through the doors, and I know that members of the local community will be happy that this matter has been resolved.\"The new agreement will allow time for further consultation on public access to the leisure facilities in future years.Highland Council convener Bill Lobban, who lives in Aviemore, said: \"I am delighted that a sensible agreement has been reached.\"This new deal is great news for Highland Council, High Le Highland and Macdonald Aviemore Resort but most importantly its fantastic news for the residents of Badenoch and Strathspey.\"The swimming pool is a well-used, important attraction and I would like to congratulate the staff from both sides who have worked really hard behind the scenes to get this result and more especially members of the local community who made sure that their voice was heard in the process.\"Well done to all.\"A positive community campaign had been launched called Save Our Swimming following the doors closing to HLH users at the end of the summer.SOS co-ordinator Joe Kirby described the agreement as a fantastic result for all the parties.He said: \"It is great that the council and Macdonald Hotels have listened to the concerns of the community and that a pragmaticto talks has delivered this deal.\"I know as a father myself that folk across the strath will be really looking forward to getting backing into the swimming pool with their children and other families members.\"Id like to thank everyone who wrote correspondence to Macdonald Hotels, attended the public meetings and demonstrations and who helped to fund the SOS  campaign.\"It all goes to show what can be achieve with a bit of community spirit.\"Judith Thurlow, chair of Aviemore Primary School parents council, was also absolutely delighted.\"This is a leline for so many members of our community and an essential skill for the local children to learn,\" she said.\"Thank you to everyone in the community who has persevered, shown great resilience and played a part in reaching this really positive outcome.\"Pupils from the school had written to Mr Macdonald imploring him to let them go swimming again and local GPs and aquafit users ndash some in their eighties ndash had also gone public with their health concerns.There had also been several peaceful protests at the resort by SOS  in the aftermath of the decision.The Strathy tried yesterday to contact the council and Macdonald Hotels for further information on the new funding arrangements and when

not the pound.m which Councillor Bruce has claimed.\"HIE also acquired pound.m in preference shares.\"However, due in large part to delay, obfuscation and obstruction by the previous administration of Highland Council, planning permissions were still not able to be delivered after  frustrating years of trying.\"As a result, and to the intense dismay and signicant financial cost of the three partners involved, the scheme, which would have created hundreds of much-needed jobs locally in an area of the country which desperately needed them, was forced into administration.\"This obviously meant the loss of pound.m of public money, which was utterly lamentable and deeply regrettable, as well as millions of pounds of losses to the three partners involved, but it also delayed huge investment in the local economy.\"It was only because Macdonald Hotels had a rock-solid commitment to regenerating the resort that we reached an agreement with the administrators in June  which prevented it from closing down completely for a second time.\"Ironically, it was only after the administration process that Highland Council granted the planning permission which had been applied for  years previously and which two previous owners had walked away from during that time.\"There was nothing controversial within that planning permission and itrsquos no more than the design of the resort as it is today.\"Since then we have invested pound.m in transforming the infrastructure at Aviemore and are now the largest private-sector employer in the area, with hundreds of full and part time staff employed there and an annual wage bill of pound.m.\"\"Indeed, we estimate that the resort will have hosted over , overnight stays, including several international conferences ndash some of them with up to  delegates - in the current year, many of which will provide vital additional income to local bars, restaurants, shops and attractions.\"Gordon Fraser, deputy chairman of Macdonald Hotels  Resorts, said: \"It is, of course, right and proper that local politicians get involved in such important issues, but for Councillor Bruce to insist that we should simply swallow the enormous increases in rates, salaries and energy costs at Aviemore without seeking a reasonable increase in the amount we receive for allowing Highland High Le members to use private leisure facilities, is blatant double-standards.\"Itrsquos a bit rich for the council to increase our annual rates bill by . per cent in the year to March  and yet when we seek a modest uplt in charges to help us cover a small element of those and many other cost increases, one of the councilrsquos own officials described our request as lsquounaffordablersquo.\"Like us, many local businesses might consider their large rates increases to be lsquounaffordablersquo but we have no choice other than to pay them.\"Councillor Bruce should remember that we entered into this agreement, and were happy to do so, on the basis that it saved Highland Council from having to spend many millions on building their own swimming pool and leisure facilities locally.\"And he should also bear in mind that the annual sums we are discussing are far, far lower than those which Highland Council would face each year for running their own facilities.\"Despite the ill-judged intervention of Councillor Bruce, we have been encouraged by the constructive and helpful approach of other politicians and hope to meet with senior council officials in the very near future to resolve what has been a damaging and unnecessary episode.\"The sooner we can welcome High Le members back into Aviemore, the better, but it has to be on a sustainable and viable commercial basis.\"Councillor Bruce was unavailable for comment.He had asked: \"Given that HIE awarded an pound. million funding package to Macdonald Hotels to develop the Avie-more Resort ndash including the construction of the leisure arena in the early s ndash should Macdonald Hotels not allow High Le card members to use the swimming-poolfacility in view of the public funds they enjoyed and has this point been raised in negotiations rsquoHighland Council has said it remains open to restarting negotiations.Aviemore Primary School pupils recently wrote to Mr Macdonald asking for the pool to reopen and the schools parent council led by Judith Thurlow has also been part of the campaign.Sunday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118344.jpg","title":"Its far from being the end of the line","story":"Tom Ramage\"IM nervous as heck!\" confessed Karen Blessington, as she prepared to launch her own railway line last Friday.\"I have never spoken in public in my whole le so please bear with me...\"The huge crowd certainly did that and they loved every minute of the occasion as the flag went up again at Grantown East exactly  years to the day it last went down.It had been quite a journey \"from sadness to joy\" as she put it, following those drastic Beeching cuts of the s.\"The Phoenix has risen from the ashes of a derelict brown site.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting.

Have a wee look at my YouTube channel and go to the website to ask me anything about the island. Fergie and I hope to see you soon on Skye!”Creator Calum MacDonald was inspired by a previous drawing by his niece, Sadie MacDonald.Calum said: “In November , following on from Skye receiving negative publicity during that summer, I was inspired by a drawing my niece had drawn of her family. I came up with the idea of creating a character from Skye, acting as a friendly face for the island and having him help solve the problems Skye was facing.“Since then Donald has developed into an animated character and is the star, along with Fergie the Tractor, of his own animated film. Donald and Fergie answer any questions visitors might have about Skye on the website and we hope to add further episodes of Donald from Skye soon.“The Donald from Skye website acts as a hub of information for visitors, with business listings, a ‘recommended by Donald’ list and clips of Donald and Fergie. Donald from Skye is also on social media, allowing visitors to see updates and recommendations from Donald directly on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.”“I hope Donald from Skye will be informative and entertaining for both tourists and locals and enhance their experiences on this beautul island.”"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds. He died on  November ,  years ago this week.  test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27492  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaAt the start of the th century women began to campaign actively against the denial of their right to vote. In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27501  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna“We already have all-island teams that demonstrate that we can achieve great success when we work on an all-island basis.

I am not doing the work here for the students to recognise me in that way, I teach because I love it but it was such a great boost.

I’m very much a home bird, I love being here, teaching here but I ask myself the question what does going across to Liverpool to teach have that we don’t have here at home  How are we supposed to make young lives betterwe leave and take our skills where “There is a young teaching staff in the Religion department here and our big focus is very much on ethics, making the subject more relevant to the pupils’ lives, how do you live out your faith through action  The girls I teach are so kind, there is a real kindness about our pupils, they would offer you the food from their lunch boxes, they are just so, so caring. At the minute our ‘Mini Marillacs’ named after St Louise, are collecting for the homeless and I would put a big emphasis on helping those less fortunate and the girls would bring in hats, gloves, scarfs, toiletries which are then brought to the Legion of Mary for distribution.”“Our sixth years go up to St John’s residential home every Tuesday to make cups of tea, bring buns and biscuits for the elderly. I can see them from my window and it just makes me smile knowing they are going up and more importantly want to go up, you don’t have to police them,” she said.Alanah spoke warmly of the “community spirit” in St Louise’s and how “everybody knows everybody” as school le presents “always something new”.“This is a huge school but you know everyone in it.

And he added that despite the fact that Remembrance Sunday was marked almost a fortnight ago, poppies are still being displayed by some staff – with some workers opting for the double-whammy of a banned football and the remembrance symbol.“Employees here are brazenly walking around in Rangers and Northern Ireland tops even though everybody knows the rules,” our source inside the factory said. “It’s not asCoca-Cola is a wee firm that employs two or three people in a shed. It’s a massive global company with strict rules in place to ensure harmony and equality and yet nothing is being done. People see other people wearing football tops and they think, ‘Oh, that’s allowed now.’ And the poppies are still around too as well as other symbols used by one side of the community. Sometimes they’re pinned to the banned jerseys.”The worker said that Catholic members of staff are disappointed by the lack of action by senior members of staff. He added that things would continue to get worse until existing policy is enforced.“Management have yet to do anything about it,” he said. No-one is even being talked to never mind disciplined for their actions.“Personally, I feel antagonised, intimidated and fearful working in a place that is allowing this to continue and I know others do too. This is a place of work and people should be able to come to work without being in fear or intimidated in this manner.”A spokesperson for Coca-Cola denied any knowledge of football shirts being worn in at the plant but pointed out that the wearing of poppies all year round is acceptable.“We are not aware of any recent instances of employees wearing football shirts at work. Doing so would be in contravention of our unorm and dress code policy. This follows the guidance of the NI Equality Commission which states that the wearing of football shirts has the potential to disrupt a good and harmonious working environment.“In line with the Commission’s guidance, we do not prohibit the wearing of a poppy at work.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"renowned west belfast artist to set out stall at culturlann","story":"PROLIFIC West Belfast painter and illustrator Tony Bell is set to unveil a personal retrospective exhibition entitled ‘Special People Special Places’ at the Cultúrlann on Thursday November .

Furthermore, few predicted that one of the biggest threats to the deal would eventually come from Brexiteer MPs when, in the early stages of the negotiations, Remain campaigners took the Government to the highest court in the land in order to secure a meaningful vote for MPs.

The vote is expected to take place before MPs break for Christmas in December.Eurosceptic rejection\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Boris Johnson speaking during the DUP annual conference in Belfast Led by figures including Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, a swathe of Brexiteer Tories have rejected Mrs May’s deal and called for it to be renegotiated. This raises the prospect of some of Mrs May’s own MPs voting against the agreement when it goes before the Commons. Appearing at the DUP conference on Saturday, Mr Johnson said the deal will leave the UK a “satellite state” of the EU. In the Sunday Express Mr Rees-Mogg said the deal “does not deliver” on Brexit and “instead of taking back control, in some areas it will leave the United Kingdom with even less control than it currently has: the vassal state”.DUP oppositionLIVE: Watch Rt Hon Arlene Foster MLA - Party Leader’s Address at the #DUP Party Conference in Belfast  https:w… https:t.co yhGYiTEN— DUPNovember , The Eurosceptics’ rejection of the plans stems in large part from the deal’s backstop provision for the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.

The DUP say the backstop would see Northern Ireland adopt a dferent regulatory regime to Great Britaina wider UK EU trade deal fails to materialise.

With  MPs in the Commons, their support could be crucial for Mrs May’s deal to pass.Labour opposition\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn with shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer Labour repeatedly warned that they would vote against any deal that does not pass six tests. Among the requirements are that it delivers the “exact same” benefits, fair management of migration and the protection of workers’ rights and protections.

She has also sought the backing of business in an effort to encourage MPs to support the deal.What happensit is voted down BFE: Have you written, emailed or visited YOUR MP yet  Have you told them what you think of Mays Deal for your country  The easy to use new #PeoplesVote tool makes it a doddle!

treatment for a rare spinal condition in that hope that it will be made available to children in the North.Donna Ferris’ three year-old son Charlie was diagnosed with progressive infantile idiopathic scoliosis when he was just six months old.If left untreated, the spinal deformity can lead to severe twisting of the spine, respiratory problems and even decreased le expectancy.When little Charlie was first diagnosed back in February , doctors in Belfast told his anxious parents Donna and Jodie that their only option was to put their son in a plaster jacket to hold in the curve in his spine until he was old enough for surgery.However, determined Donna vowed to do everything in her power to keep her baby son away from the operating table and invasive surgery.After hours of online research, the mum-of-four found a hospital in the United States which offers specialised scoliosis treatment.Donna discovered that Shriners Hospital in Philadelphia offered advanced treatment which could potentially avoid surgery.She said: “When I was researching I checked for hospitals in the east coast of America as I knew it would be easier to fly into there from Ireland.  I came across Shriners Hospital and made contact straight away askingthey accepted international patients.  They said they did and sent me some forms which I filled in.  Within four days of applying to the hospital for the treatment Charlie was accepted, and within a month he was at the hospital.”On April , , Donna, Jodie and their four kids made the trip to Philadelphia for Charlie’s first appointment.Just a few days later, Charlie was fitted with a Mehta cast which was specially designed to correct the curve in his spine.Over the last  months, Charlie has made the same journey  times.Before having his first cast fitted, the curvature in Charlie’s spine was at a -degree angle.Earlier this month, during their th trip to Shriners Hospital, the Ferris family received the news they had been hoping for.“They took Charlie’s brace off  hours after arriving at the hospital and sent him for x-rays.  After this the doctors brought us in and gave us the great news that Charlie’s spine is now down to six degrees,” said Donna.“I just burst into tears crying.  I just couldn’t believe it.  The staff at the hospital were also crying and hugging us.  They were just so, so happy.  They are always willing the children on there.  It was just amazing news to get.”Donna said before starting his treatment in the US, Charlie was a ‘very restless baby’ and she ‘really struggled to get food into him’.Now, she says her son is a completely dferent person.“The boy we have now is just perfect.  He is meeting all his milestones and is doing everything a wee child of his age should be doing and he will go on to lead a healthy le,” she said.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Charlie knows that he’s dferent and he has to wear a brace that not everyone  does but he’s adapted to it all from the get-go, he’s just brilliant.“The plan now is that Charlie will remain in brace until June next year and then he will switch to a night time brace for six months at least.  Hopefully he will not have to wear a brace at all eventually.”Following Charlie’s diagnosis and the news that he would have to travel to America for the specialised treatment, the Ballinderry and wider community set about fundraising for the family to help fund their travel, something which the Ferris family are ever grateful for.Donna also has nothing but praise for Shriners Hospital.“Words cannot describe how grateful we are to the hospital for what they have done for us,” she said.“When we first took him to the hospital we knew Charlie was going to be in expert hands as they specialise in infantile scoliosis.“We are so, so grateful to them and it’s very hard to put into words how good they all are.  They don’t just treat Charlie, they treat the whole family.  It’s the same people treating Charlie each and every time and he has become so familiar with them all.“Shriners is a non-profit hospital and they treat families regardless of their ability to pay.  All the time we have been there we have never received a bill from them.  To go half way across the world to another hospital and not be billed is just amazing.”Charlie’s journey over the last  months has been well documented by Donna on a Facebook page named ‘Charlie’s Journey with Infantile Scoliosis’.Through the page, other parents in similar situations have reached out to Donna who has offered them support and advice.  She has also given them ‘hope of what can be achieved’.On November , Donna attended the Families First awards ceremony in Sligo Park Hotel where she was presented with an ‘Inspirational Person’ award – an accolade which she had been nominated for by a parent from Co Cavan.“I spoke to the audience and told them our story and I received a standing ovation afterwards.  I was just overwhelmed by how many people I have touched out there.  It was the perfect end to the perfect week.”Donna now hopes that by speaking out about Charlie’s treatment that it will give other children hope.“The treatment that Charlie received at Shriners Hospital has been available at Great Ormond Street Hospital since July this year however I really want it to become available across the UK and Ireland.“Charlie is living proof of what can be achieved by this gentle, non-invasive treatment so why not offer it to babies here and give them a chance.“I want to be able to help other children in our own country and want parents not to have to feel the need to travel abroad for adequate care.  I would just love to see this treatment available here so there is hope for other families.”To follow Charlie’s progress visit ‘Charlie’s Journey with Infantile Scoliosis’ on Facebook."},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOFxcXC8xMVxcXC8yMzE3Mjc0NFxcXC9TY3JlZW4tU2hvdC0yMDE4LTEwLTEyLWF0LTE1LjQ2LjEyLTc1MHgzNTAucG5nXCIsXCJ3aWR0aFwiOjY0NyxcImhlaWdodFwiOjM0MCxcImRlZmF1bHRcIjpcImh0dHBzOlxcXC9cXFwvd3d3LmRlcnJ5bm93LmNvbVxcXC9hc3NldHNcXFwvaVxcXC9uby1pbWFnZS5wbmc_dj0xXCJ9IiwiaGFzaCI6Ijk3MmMxMTk4ZmE5YWU1MzJmN2Q4ODNmMTdkODBlMzc4Mjg5MWY1NmIifQ==/screen-shot-2018-10-12-at-15-46-12-750x350.png","title":"irish filmmaker wants james bulger film screened derry reopen debate case","story":"The writer and director of an award-winning film about the murder of Liverpool toddler, James Bulger, screening in Derry this weekend, said he hopes the film will open up a new debate on what made two -year-old boys murder a child.Vincent Lambe’s film, ‘Detainment’, is based on the true story of James Bulger, abducted in Liverpool in  and found brutally murdered two days later. However, the most shocking aspect of the case was that the main suspects were just children themselves - two ten-year-old boys, Jon Venables and Robert Thompson. Based on their interview transcripts, the film dramatizes the police interviews which took place at the time.Detainment stars Will O’Connell , David Ryan , Tara Breathnach , Morgan C. Jones , Brian Fortune , Kathy Monahan , and introduces two exceptional young actors, Ely Solan and Leon Hughes.Speaking to the Derry News, Vincent Lamb said that he hopes the film will challenge public perception of the boys who committed the murder and open a wider debate on the matter.When asked what drew him to the story, he replied: “I was asked that same question when I was over in London where I did an interview for Sky News the UK audience find it strange that an Irish filmmaker would be interested in something so deeply rooted in the British consciousness.“But it affected the people here in Ireland just as much as the people in the UK. I was  at the time it happened and I remember it very well.“I remember growing up hearing about it and heard it mentioned again as an adult and it was unexpected how I felt about it at the time.“I started reading everything I could find on it and then I got the transcripts [of the police interviews] and felt that I was seeing something not everyone  was seeing.”SensitiveVincent said that casting the child actors for the roles of Thompson and Venables was challenging but that the young actors, Ely Solanand Leon Hughes , who have been critically-acclaimed for their astonishing performances, were ‘phenomenal’.“I had a lot of apprehension about making a film on such a sensitive story,” he said.“The public outrage at the time was unprecedented and it hasn’t gone away, it’s still there. So many people just seen these boys as being evil and couldn’t cope with the fact that they were just two little boys. The only way they could make sense of it was to see them as evil.“Newspapers labelled them as ‘evil monsters’, the spawn of Satan’ and ‘freaks of nature. People hadn’t really looked at other points of view andyou did, you were criticised – people couldn’t see any other reason for it other than they were evil.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“When I was , I accepted that they must have been evil but as an adult when I researched it a bit more, my opinion altered and I hope that this film will help other people change their minds.“By looking into the boys’ family background, I got a better understanding of what could have led two -year-old boys to commit such a horrible crime.“This film is not sympathetic to the boys and is not trying to make an excuse for them in any way but it humanises them. People may be more comfortable thinking of them as evil monsters but, after reading the transcripts, it was a tragedy for three families and that’s not a popular opinion.“The film is entirely factual, there is no embellishment – it is almost entirely verbatim. When I was making the film, given my apprehensions, it was very important to me that everything was factual.”‘Prevent this happening again’Vincent said that he was especially nervous when he heard that journalist and expert of the James Bulger murder, David James Smith, was attending one a screening of the film at the Winchester Film Festival. Smith wrote a book on the matter, The Sleep of Reason: The James Bulger Case.“He turned up at the last screening in the UK and I was terried,” he said.“He’s such an expert on the case, I was dreading to hear what he thought but he said the film was ‘authentic’ and a ‘remarkable achievement’ which was an amazing endorsement.“He also wrote a lovely review saying thatthe audience were willing to find the truth out about those boys, they could not ignore their inescapable smallness.”“People don’t talk about this case enough, butyou have any other opinion other than the boys were monsters, it’s rejected and it stles debate on the issue. We want to prevent this happening again so we need to understand the case.“I remember the Judge’s comments about the boys and I thought it was a ludicrous decision to name them but the more I read, the more I understood his reasons – he wanted a discussion about it, to look into the background of the boys and see how something like could be prevented from ever happening again. I hope that people will debate the case again after watching the film.”Vincent finally had a word for the Bulger family: “I don’t want anyone to think that I don’t have sympathy for the Bulger family, I have enormous sympathy for little James, for what he went through and what his family have been through.”‘Detainment’ by award-winning director, writer and producer, Vincent Lambe and Irish producer, Darren Mahon, will screen at Foyle Film Festival in the Nerve Centre on Sunday, November , at pm.More information about the film and upcoming screenings can be found at: www.detainmentfilm"},{"url":null,"title":"people derry urged think twice visiting emergency department winter emerges ae altnagelvin dealing 230 people","story":"UP to  people are visiting the Accident and Emergency department in Altnagelvin Hospital every day, it has emerged.The figure emerged at Novembers meeting of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Health and Community meeting, where senior figures from the Western Trust were in attendance to discuss its Winter Resilience Plan  .Speaking at the meeting Geraldine McKay, Director of Acute Hospitals with the Trust, said that ‘demands’ were already very high on its services as it had experienced an increase in the numbers of people attending the AE department at Altnagelvin over the past year.She told the meeting that the eight per cent increase over the past year meant that the hospital was now dealing with  to  people on a daily basis, compared to a figure of  to  every day last year.Mrs McKay added that the bulk of people attending the department were Category  and Category  patients, who she said were the ‘sickest patients with the most complex needs’, adding that these patients would be in need of ‘immediate attention’, and required treatment within an hour.The meeting was told that the emergency department was facing additional pressures due to issues with gaining accesses to beds within the unit, adding that there also had been an increase in the numbers of people who have had to wait over  hours for treatment.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshMrs McKay continued that it would be issuing an appeal through the media urging people to consider their condition before attending the local Accident and Emergency department.“We do believe there will be a tough winter ahead of us all, and we hope you can disseminate that information to people that they may not need to attend the Emergency Department,” she told the meeting.Mrs McKay also spoke of the extreme pressure placed on the department last winter due to the outbreak of the norovirus, and also urged people to take advice from their GPs on their condition before attending the AE.However, she also stressed thatpeople do feel that they must attend the unit, then they should not ‘take any chances’.“Go to your GP and take the advice,” Mrs McKay said.“If you need to the be there , then you need to there, because there are people who put off going there over the fear that there may be already large numbers there.”"},{"url":null,"title":"angela receives highest uk air ambulance honour","story":"WAA Chief Executive Angela Hughes receives her Letime Achievement Award.\" \"   typemchtype\" \"\"Angela receives highest UK Air Ambulance HonourWAArsquos fleet of four helicopters.\" \"   typemchtype\" Skip to next image raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"visiting tangent clubs luminary on hand to switch on llandrindod wells christmas lights","story":"Prize winners in the decorated lantern competitionreceive their prizes as Sue ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtHill presents Sophialtspan classtruncate-full-screengt Morgan with her first place award.

I hope new hotel investment, which would provide the local economy with a signicant boost, can be realised, he added.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the council undertook a study to review hotel provision across the district and identied additional need specically within the Newcastle area.ldquoThe council has carried out an initial feasibility study on the Newcastle Centre site which identied that a hotel could be built on the site. General discussions have subsequently taken place with a number of potential developers about hotel provision in the Newcastle area,rsquorsquo he continued.ldquoThe council is also currently working with a consultant on the feasibility study for leisure provision in the Newcastle area and it is anticipated that a report will be presented to the Active and Healthy Communities Committee in the coming months..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan wildlife activist recognised by Prime Minster  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN teenager has been recognised by Prime Minister Theresa May for urging young people to protect the environment.Fourteen year-old Dara McAnulty is one of the latest recipients of the the Points of Light award, which recognises outstanding volunteers who are making a change in their community and inspiring others.He was presented with his award at an event held at Kew Gardens in London last week.Mrs May wrote to Dara congratulating him on his achievement.ldquoThrough your award-winning blog, you are encouraging young people to support their local environment and learn about the importance of conservation, she said.ldquoYour writing is raising awareness of how nature can help people cope with autism and you should feel proud of this remarkable achievement.Dara has been a driving force behind the Grassroots Challenge run by Ulster Wildle.In his blog he encourages other people his age to make videos of the out-doors and at the same time participate in conservation.Dara, who is autistic, says he is inspired by the beauty of the Mourne countryside on his doorstep and that developing a connection with nature helps him manage his anxiety.This in turn helped him to open the door for other people his age to become conservation enthusiasts too.Dara said: ldquoI am honoured to receive the Points of Light award. I sincerely hope that it shines a light on how vital nature is to us all, our mental health, our wellbeing and the survival of all le.ldquoWe need more young voices to speak up and take action for nature though.

The players ran their socks off and there was plenty of commitment. The tackling was hard, but fair, and it was a credit to the spirit in which the tie was played that not a single player was yellow-carded.The first half chance of the match fell to nippy YM striker Aaron Cheevers, who was almost through on goal, but was thwarted when Connolly came quickly off his line to save.Jack Roddy then headed narrowly over for Olympic and not long afterwards Olympic were awarded a free kick outside the box following Richard Annettrsquos challenge on Shane Rodgers. Unfortunately, Darryl Russell shot tamely against the wall.The best chance of the half fell to Olympic just after the half hour. Following a corner Gary Wilsonrsquos shot was cleared off the line and Roddy blazed over the bar.Cheevers was always a threat up front for the YM. On  minutes he was clean through, but again Connolly came out to thwart the danger. On  minutes he came within inches of putting his head on a cross by the impressive Wilson and just before the break his flicked header were narrowly wide.Ten minutes into the second half Olympicrsquos Simon Marmion found Joshua Fennell with a long pass, only for Fennell to shoot over from outside the penalty area on the right side.Four minutes later Damian Travers found himself with space in the box, but his left-footed shot was easilysaved by Connolly.On  minutes YMrsquos Sam Annett let fly, but his shot took a deflection off an Olympic defender for a corner.Both sides made a number of changes to break the deadlock and with five minutes to go YM substitute James Croskery shot low and hard, but straight at Connolly.The breakthrough nearly came moments later when Wilson delivered a dangerous free kick into the YM box, but Adam McDowell and Lee Maxwell couldnrsquot get a touch.In the first period of extra time, Rhys Patterson thought he had won it for Olympic, but Tate pulled off a great save.Just at the end of the second period Ronnie Johnston shot inches wide for YM after a good cross from the left by Adam McDowell.But the goals didnrsquot come and in the end it was all down to a penalty shoot-out. Olympic deserved to win, but it was cruel on the Young Men.Ballynahinch Olympic II: R Connolly, J Roddy, D Russell, N McGlew, M Rice, S Marmion, J Fennell, G Wilson, R Patterson, D Travers, S Rodgers.

The problems of vandalism and high running costs have made it virtually impossible to keep going any longer.Crisis points are no strangers to the harassed members of the hall committee. Two years ago they ran into trouble when funds for the hall completely petered out.The hall fell into an appalling state of disrepair and a public appeal to raise pound, was launched. Only pound, was raised and since then the management committee have an uphill battle to survive.While the hall belongs to the community and is run by a committee appointed at public meetings, the nature of the trust deed, under which it is held, means that it cannot be taken over or run by the district council.The hallrsquos usefulness became redundant as the old style of social s was replaced by nights out at licensed restaurants and by public house entertainment.Mrs Katie Williams, the committee treasurer, said: ldquoAlthough we still have money problems, the main thing we have to break down is apathy among the townspeople.

If anyone sees a route we have missed, please lest us know.Maurice added: ldquoWe hope that future editions can both improve the content and mapping of North Lecale and cover the Lecale coastline all the way to Dundrum Bay.ldquoThe book would make a wonderful Christmas present for anyone who loves Lecale or anyone with relatives aboard this Christmas who want to be reminded of the beautul Barony of Lecale and the local history of each parish. We have fully funded this publication so every book sold goes to develop local community walking routes and it will be available in most local shops.Cllr Enright said he was grateful for the knowledge and support he had received from older people ldquosteeped in folklore from every village and townland over the past year in producing the book as well as the invaluable technical expertise of his co-author Duane.ldquoPeople like Terry Swail, from Kilclief, Portaferryrsquos Lennie Lawson and Vincie Curran, from Myra, gave their time freely and ungrudgingly to make this publication such a success, he said.Councillor Enright said the book emerged from the process of developing village plans over the past five years with many public consultations highlighting the need for safe, off-road walking routes to keep people active and healthy.ldquoEvery village wanted to know how their walks could be integrated into the wider network of trails around Lecale, he continued. ldquoThere was a demand to know the details of the law and how they could assert local walking routes in their area.ldquoResidentsrsquo associations in the Downpatrick area led by those in Stream Street actually commissioned technical reports into how walks like the four kilometre Quoile River Walk could once again be integrated with the network of parks like Delamont and Castle Ward.Cllr Enright added: ldquoThey wanted cycleways on new greenways to Dundrum, Ballynahinch, Belfast and Comber following old railway lines and we packed all this information into the book with maps, photographs and references. I am sure that anyone with an interest in these matters will find it an invaluable reference document for their endeavours.The new publication has also been given a ringing endorsement by Dr Tim Campbell, Director of the Saint Patrick Centre in Downpatrick.He said: ldquoThis book illustrates how Downpatrickrsquos tourism hub around the Cathedral, Down County Museum and the Mound of Down could be linked off-road to every village in Lecale and rejoin the local way-marked trails like the Saint Patrickrsquos Way and Ulster Way to make a network of walks and cycle paths in East Down.The new book is available at Kevin Ogrsquos shop in Strangford, the St. Patrick Centre, The Road Houses Bar, Oakley Fayre, Down County Museum and Down Arts Centre.

Thousands of people regularly empty a iety waste into the bin bags and take them to the recycling centres. But that could be about to change.Council officials also want to vigorously challenge the perception that the centres are viewed by many as ldquodumps and reinforce the message that they are for recycled waste only.They say the misuse of the centres has potential cost implications for the authority, with the review examining detailed guidelines and systems which are required for what is being described as the ldquoproper operation of the recycling centres.The review examined entrance policies and a potential restriction or complete ban on large vans using the centres with a daily restriction on the amount of waste the facilities can receive.There is also growing concern at senior management level that a signicant amount of the waste being taken to recycling centres ends up in the general waste stream as it cannot be recycled. Council officials say addressing this issue will cut costs and produce savings.Last night, politicians were asked for permission to complete a detailed report on the way forward, based on the evidence gathered during the review process, with a particular focus on centre opening hours and staffing levels that must be achieved at no extra cost.Councillors were told the report will also make a recommendation to harmonise policies and procedures across all current recycling centres in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.Over recent months, local politicians have expressed concern at a number of fly-tipping and illegal dumping incidents across the district, with several taking place within a stonersquos throw of the Cloonagh Road facility in Downpatrick.This particular facility has long since passed its sell-by-date with work on a poundm replacement at the nearby Flying Horse Road currently underway.

The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There is no need for the Irish backstop so let’s get rid of it.”Mrs Foster insisted the DUP’s confidence and supply agreement with the Conservatives remained “live”.But she again warned that her party would “review” the arrangementthe Brexit deal gained parliamentary support, though stopped short of saying she would definitely end the relationship with the Tories in those circumstances.“We have to see where we are when that vote is taken,” she said.Askedshe would support the Prime Ministera parliamentary defeat triggered a confidence vote in the Government, Mrs Foster added: “We will have to see what happens at that time. I think this last couple of weeks should tell all of us that you shouldn’t jump ahead of ourselves.“What we should do is wait to see what develops in that respect.”Mrs Foster was also non-committal when asked whether the DUP would support a Norway-style relationship with the EU, with the UK joining the European Economic Area .Fatality after single-vehicle crash Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“I’m not going to be proscriptive with the Government,” she said.“What I’m saying to the Government is this deal, this current deal, does not allow us to take back control. Certainly not in terms of Northern Ireland, because we stay within the European Union structure and we will have no say on those rules - we will have a democratic deficit, we have to take the rules but we have no way of influencing those.”She rejected claims of inconsistency in regard to ergence with Great Britain, given the DUP advocates dferent laws in Northern Ireland on social issues such as gay marriage and abortion.“Those matters are devolved to Northern Ireland to make decisions on,” Mrs Foster said.“But international trade, customs, the single market, those things stay at Westminster. Those things are kept in the national parliament and what this document does, what the international treaty that has just been agreed today does, is make a dference between us in terms of those international issues and I think that’s very important to us.”Askedthe Prime Minister had let her down, the DUP leader replied: “We are disappointed with the way this has progressed, I have to say.“I really do understand that she is a unionist, that she wants to get the best deal, but actually what this deal does is go against everything she has said around all of that.”Pressed on whether a defeat of the EU deal in Parliament would spell the end of Mrs May’s tenure as Prime Minister, Mrs Foster said: “That’s not a matter for me, that’s a matter for her own party.”try catch     .               ..

OK, he and his we have jetted off to Lanzarote to get a break from work, the weather and, of course, the furore over Brexit. Sandra ChapmanHe wouldn’t normally decide to take a break at this time of year. But, as a Brexiteer, he says he has had his fill of politicians, politics and the  promises over Brexit. He says he will be back, but threatens to emigratethe country falls apart.He got a lot of sympathy from Himself who also has flown off this week to the British mainland leaving me with just the dog, which I’m pretty sure is happy to get a bit of peace and quiet from the pair of us who really haven’t been able to argue in any logical fashion about the political crisis surrounding us. Dogs are wonderful at pretending they understand everything you say especiallyyou are saying it near the cupboard where the treats reside.The whole sorry saga of Brexit is impossible to escape.I was about to roll up a page of newspaper to light the fire only to be drawn to the headline at the top: ‘The EU will turn us into captiveswe sign up to this appalling sell-out.’ It was the latest rant in the Dailyfrom Boris Johnson, who wants the Northern Ireland backstop scrapped with both sidesto simply ‘commit to avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland by the use of new unobtrusive checks and discussions of the future economic partnership’ where, he says ‘the Irish discussion rightly belongs’.suitcases packed.That was the day before Sinn Fein’s president Mary Lou McDonald was shouting at the top of her voice about the DUP being out of step on Brexit and ‘must face reality’. Now, I wonder what that reality might be  Seconds later she was urging Arlene Foster to “wake up and smell the coffee”. This is the very same Mary Lou who claims to have “no regrets” over her handling of the Mairia Cahill case. Mary Lou can shout all she wants. Only her own side will be listening.The Northern Ireland born Labour MP for Vauxhall Kate Hoey had a lot to say this week too. Ms Hoey informs us she has “ploughed through” the  pages of the proposed withdrawal agreement plus the explanation notes – that makes her a hero in my eyes – and declares that “Northern Ireland, to all intents and purposes, becomes separated in many ways from the rest of the United Kingdom”, with the backstop arrangements looking like they were written by the Irish government.All in all it means that the Republic of Ireland would, effectively, be representing Northern Ireland in the EU, she believes. A highly respected politician, one not given to exaggeration, I would say she has got it right. That was one page of newspaper I saved from the flames.Then, of course, there are the Scots whose nationalism is getting a fresh kick from the Brexit chaos.Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s First Minister, accuses Theresa May of asking people to “take a blindfold leap off a clf” with her Brexit deal. Ms Sturgeon, as we all know, has her heart set on independence for Scotland. She may yet be successful second time around. How amazing it is that women are playing such a big role in the whole Brexit saga.Years ago Margaret Thatcher had the political field all to herself. Had she been in charge today she would long ago have hand-bagged Jean-Claude Junker and the elegant Mr Barnier into submission. Theresa May, on the other hand, looks like the one being hand-bagged.Legacy Scandal: The IRA was able to wage terrorism on Castlederg because it was near the safe haven of the Irish Republic Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"So when does this crisis begin to calm down so that the rest of us can get on with planning our Christmas  It’s not looking good.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here.

It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

An initial pre-application notice was issued for the scheme last year, but now the developer behind the scheme – Neptune Carleton – has submitted an outline planning application for the ambitious project. If the plans, which could include , homes on the large site at Blaris, get the go-ahead, it would be one of the largest residential property developments to be built in Northern Ireland in recent years. Elsewhere, this week a major £m housing development in Larne was awarded outline planning permission.

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/shore_1.jpg","title":"alternative london the place to be seen in the city","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business From London’s thriving bohemian hub and street art capital to a food, drink and nightle must-visit... John Mulgrew explores Shoreditch and beyond Once just the purview of the artistic and trendsetting, Shoreditch has fast become a location worthy of a trip in itself when visiting London.Nestled in the East End of the city, Shoreditch offers up a buzzing cultural environment, lots of independent places to eat and drink, and boasts one of the city’s best markets. Now, those in the north west always feel a little hard done by when it comes to connectivity outside Northern Ireland.In this case though, Flybmi now connects City of Derry Airport regularly with London Stansted. From there, it’s a regular train into Liverpool Street station, and then onwards using the tube or bus across the city.Andyou’re visiting Shoreditch, it’s hard to miss Boxpark. Sitting close to the tube station, it’s an array of black-clad shipping containers, with a host of retailers and places to eat. A bite at posh chip shop Poptata helps fuel the day.Journalists often prefer the freedom to explore a city at their own pace – picking up things along the way, without being ferried from place-to-place. But a food-focused tour from Alternative London brought out areas that might have otherwise been missed.Shoreditch is famous for the sheer volume of graffiti and art strewn around the area, but getting an insider’s view on the changes taking place in the area – including paid-for advertising now adorning some of the spaces reserved for artists from the area, or a Banksy – really helps take in as much as possible.Christiaan Nagel’s mushrooms, which can be found in several roof-top locations, led us to teashop T, taking in a salt-beef bagel at Beigel Bake on Brick Lane, followed by the modern, family-run self-styled home-style Indian restaurant, Gunpowder. The aloo chaat is a signature, with punch, depth and zing, while an almost unavoidable venison and vermicelli ‘doughnut’ is worth the visit alone.A brief half in the grade II listed Ten Bells, which has links to Jack the Ripper, was followed by a familiar trip to Old Spitalfields Market. It has a dense, tight offering of top-end food stalls, from Asian steamed buns at Yum Bun, to Portuguese custard tarts and fruit tea at Yi Fang.An unmissable food destination sits across from the market. St John Bread and Wine is one of Fergus Henderson’s London outlets. It’s a casual, laid back and sparse affair, which allows you to same some of the best British cooking available. You can stop by for a very reasonably priced, and one of the restaurant’s signature dishes, such as Welsh Rarebit, devilled kidneys on toast or, my choice on this visit, blood cake and egg. Think richer, chunkier black pudding, crispened in a pan with a rich-orange hued yolk. There are plenty of spots to socialise in and around Shoreditch, with some of London’s better beer bars included. The Craft Beer Co has a location on Old Street, while there’s a Brewdog and the Draft House, hidden in the Bower development.Arriving back to the hotel in the evening, don’t expect dull or leless environment at the Hoxton. The downstairs is thriving during the day, with the usual spectrum of aluminium-clad Apple Macs, but at night, especially at the weekend, it’s very much a nightspot in the area.Butyou’re after a decent night’s sleep, there’s very little sound making its way to the bedrooms from the ground-floor buzz.Leaving the hip surroundings of Shoreditch, and heading to the rather more touristy affair of Leicester Square, the Hotel Indigo is offers a grand view of the London skyline.The new rooftop bar is a superb vantage point to overlook the square, and pick out the city’s most famous structures. Then there’s the National Portrait Gallery – which sits just a short distance away from the Hotel Indigo.During the trip there was a Michael Jackson ‘On the Wall’ exhibition – one for Jackson fans, certainly – but the gallery itself, which is free, is worth a visit for everyone . It also hosts a ‘Friday Lates’ event – opening into the night, and with a small pop-up bar for visitors.Not far away, the Japan Centre offers up a myriad of everything the country has to offer in regards to food and drink in particular – from freshly made miso, to a ied and wide-selection of sake, it’s a stop worth making for anyone keen on trying to replicate the flavours they’ve had while visiting the country.Meanwhile, Shoryu Ramen – located very close to base camp at the Hoxton – offers some of the best casual noodles in the city. Starting off with cleanly flavoured salmon sashimi, followed by the garlic kick of the Dracula Tonkotsu – a heady allium-rich version of their -hour pork broth.For those in and around what is one of the city’s most tourist-heavy locations, Granaio is a reasonably recent addition.It’s a fairly familiar format – Italian classics and a wide-ranging menu, which will keep the majority of visitors content, at a reasonable price, considering the location. A beef tartare was solid, and a ribeye cooked correctly on the inside, despite a lack of charring on the outside.The theatre obviously plays a large part in the attraction to London, but the Immersive Gatsy experience turns a chunk of a Long Lane building into an interactive re-telling of F Scott Fitzgerald’s the Great Gatsby. It’s dferent, but impressively choreographed, and something alternative to spending a huge wad of cash on a West End show.A crisp sunny day before heading back on the train to Stansted offered a chance to try Hawksmoor. The steak restaurant now has nine locations in the UK, and focuses on dry-aged beef and all that comes with it.A Sunday lunch of rich, pink rump of beef comes with a Yorkshire pudding, stunningly crunchy roasties and a roasted bulb of garlic, and shallot – leaving them soft and packed full of umami.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety.
