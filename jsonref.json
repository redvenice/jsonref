The firm, the subject of recent complaints by Trump about supposed anti-conservative bias in search programs – was represented by an empty chair next to its tech competitors. Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio said executives \u0027don\u0027t want to be here to answer these questions,\u0027 then posited: \u0027Maybe because they\u0027re arrogant.\u0027Google\u0027s parent company Alphabet was also down almost 2 per cent. President Trump warned last week the firms were \u0027treading on very, very troubled territory and they have to be careful.\u0027 Twitter shares were down 6 per cent in trading during Dorsey\u0027s testimony, CNBC reported.  Trump has called Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u0027s probe a \u0027witch hunt,\u0027 but the intelligence community has concluded that the Kremlin orchestrated efforts to manipulate social media platforms to try to sway the electorate and sow isions.The firms said shoring up defenses for their platforms was a \u0027national security priority.\u0027 Sandberg compared the effort to stay ahead of would-be manipulators overseas to an arms race.\u0027We are more determined than our opponents and we will keep fighting,\u0027 she said. Senators wanted Larry Page, the chief executive officer of Google\u0027s parent company Alphabet, to testify. The company instead offered Google\u0027s senior vice president for global affairs and chief legal officer Kent Walker, who lawmakers said was not senior enough to answer their questions.          Senators left an empty chair for Google after the company declined to send an executive the lawmakers deemed senior enough to testify  Testifying: Jack Dorsey and Sherly Sandberg are testifying on election interference and their preparations for the mid-terms with less than two months until voting          Big event: The Senate committee room was packed for the evidence from the Facebook and Twitter leaders          Making his point: Alex Jones of Infowars held an impromptu press conference outside the committee hearing where Sheryl Sandberg and Jack Dorsey were being quizzed on Facebook and Twitter\u0027s election security          Banned: Alex Jones of Infowars, who has been kicked off Twitter, was in the audience for the hearing and had interrupted a live CNBC broadcast just beforehandWalker said he will be submitting written testimony to the committee and will  be in Washington to brief lawmakers on Google\u0027s efforts to combat possible foreign influence operations.Trump has upped his criticism of social media firms, accusing them of interfering in both the 2016 and 2018 elections. \u0027I think they already have,\u0027 he told the Daily Caller in an interview published Wednesday. He then switched to 2016, where special counsel Robert Mueller has been probing Russian interference to harm Democrat Hillary Clinton and boost Trump.\u0027I mean the true interference in the last election was that — if you look at all, virtually all of those companies are super liberal companies in favor of Hillary Clinton,\u0027 Trump said.He continued, without providing any concrete evidence: \u0027Maybe I did a better job because I\u0027m good with the Twitter and I\u0027m good at social media, but the truth is they were all on Hillary Clinton\u0027s side, and if you look at what was going on with Facebook and with Google and all of it, they were very much on her side,\u0027 Trump said.    The execs are defending their companies against  lawmakers who say they aren\u0027t doing enough combat continuing foreign efforts to influence American politics.Sandberg, who will testify alongside Dorsey, will acknowledge to the Senate Intelligence Committee that the company was too slow to respond to Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election and American society, but insist it is doing better.\u0027That\u0027s on us,\u0027 she wrote in prepared testimony released by Facebook. \u0027This interference was completely unacceptable. It violated the values of our company and of the country we love.\u0027 Sandberg says the platform is \u0027now blocking millions of attempts to register false accounts each and every day\u0027 and is \u0027making progress on fake news.\u0027\u0027As these past few weeks and months have shown, this work is starting to pay off.\u0027She said the accounts are taken down if they are foreign or domestic.  Dorsey, who broke with tradition and did not wear a tie to testify, said Twitter is identify 8 to 10 million suspicious accounts every week.  Dorsey, in prepared testimony for a House committee, pushes back on the allegations of bias.  \u0027Let me be clear about one important and foundational fact: Twitter does not use political ideology to make any decisions, whether related to ranking content on our service or how we enforce our rules,\u0027 he plans to say.If Woodward\u0027s book was an \u0027accurate reflection of what is...\u0027I\u0027ll never be a staffer.

And I\u0027m skeptical that, ultimately, you\u0027ll be able to truly address this challenge on your own. Congress is going to have to take action here.\u0027\u0027The era of the Wild West in social media is coming to an end,\u0027 he said. \u0027Where we go from here is an open question.\u0027            \u0027I mean the true interference in the last election was that — if you look at all, virtually all of those companies are super liberal companies in favor of Hillary Clinton,\u0027 President Trump told the Daily Caller, diminishing conclusions of Russian interferenceFacebook, Twitter and other technology firms have been on the defensive for many months over political influence activity on their sites as well as concerns over user privacy.Their executives have traveled to Washington several times to testify in Congress, including 10 hours of questioning of Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg over two days in April.The Senate Intelligence Committee has been looking into Russian efforts to influence U.S. public opinion throughout Trump\u0027s presidency, after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that entities backed by the Kremlin had sought to boost his chances of winning the White House in 2016.Moscow denies involvement, and Trump - backed by some of his fellow Republicans in Congress - has repeatedly dismissed investigations of the issue as a partisan witch hunt or hoax.Some Republicans have also charged social media companies with bias against Trump and other conservatives. Twitter\u0027s Dorsey was to follow his Senate testimony on Wednesday morning with an appearance at an afternoon hearing looking at that issue in the House of Representatives.    Here to reassure: Jack Dorsey and Sheryl Sandberg are trying to convince senators on the Intelligence Committee that their social networks are ready for the midterms          Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg acknowledged the company was too slow to respond to Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. electionDorsey will tell the House Energy and Commerce Committee that Twitter \u0027does not use political ideology to make any decisions,\u0027 according to written testimony also made public on Tuesday.Trump faulted Twitter on July 26, without citing any evidence, for limiting the visibility of prominent Republicans through a practice known as shadow banning.Last week Trump accused Google\u0027s search engine of promoting negative news articles and hiding \u0027fair media\u0027 coverage of him, vowing to address the situation without providing evidence or giving details of action he might take.Republicans control majorities in both the Senate and House, but the House\u0027s approach to the election issue has been far more partisan than in the Senate.In the Senate, both the Republican Intelligence Committee chairman, Richard Burr, and Democratic vice chairman, Mark Warner, said they called Wednesday\u0027s hearing to press the social media companies to do more."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/06/00/4FB7480A00000578-6134017-Another_competitive_canine_scooping_up_a_world_record_in_Geronim-a-3_1536189878977.jpg","title":"Guinness reveals world record holders 2019 including dog jump six feet","story":"    Feather, a greyhound rescue from Maryland, USA can jump 191.7cm (6ft 3in), which is only a few centimetres less than the British women\u0027s record set by Katrina Johnson-Thompson at the Rio Olympics in 2016.  Samantha Valle, 31, Feather\u0027s owner, says her talents became apparent when she saw her jump so high she hit their basement ceiling.She then began to train Feather to jump over hurdles an soon she was hopping over 150cm \u0027effortlessly\u0027.She then began to train Feather to jump over hurdles an soon she was hopping over 150cm \u0027effortlessly\u0027.Another competitive canine scooping up a world record in Geronimo, a border collie - Australian kelpie cross, also rescued by Samantha.Geronimo holds the record for the most double dutch-style skips by a dog in one minute, at 128.

However, some private institutions have different fees.Despite tuition fees being high, students are also expected to pay for books, stationary and field trips out of pocket in addition to paying for living costs, which includes accommodation, bills, transport and social events.What student finance is available?Student Finance England offer a tuition fee loan for first-time undergraduates which is paid directly to the university and students will not have to repay until they leave their course.Student Awards Agency Scotland, Student Finance Wales and Student Finance Northern Ireland offer similar funding and a maximum of £9,250 per year can be paid on behalf of the student.      When is the student loan repaid?Students will not have to start repaying their student loan until they are earning over £25,000-a-year, which is referred to as the repayment threshold. This figure applies to England and Wales, while the threshold is £18,330 in Northern Ireland and Scotland.However, for those who started university before 2012, they will have to start repaying after earning over £18,330 a year. Graduates will be required to pay back 9 percent of anything they earn above these amounts every month.So, if you are earning £15,000-a-year, you will not pay anything back while if you are making over £35,000, repayments will be £75 a month. As the money is automatically taken from wages, those who are not self-employed will not have to do anything.If the student loan is not repaid within 30 years, any remaining balance is wiped, but interest could play into graduates wanting to repay their loan early.While interest is set at RPI, currently set at 3.3 percent per year in Scotland and Northern Ireland, it is charged on top of the rate of inflation in England and Wales, plus 3 percent every year.How to apply for student financeAccording to Gov.uk, most full-time and part-time students are able to apply for university funding through Student Finance England. Here are the steps to follow:Open an online account on the Student Finance England website and complete the applicationIf you would like the amount you receive to be dependent on household income, add information about your parents and partner.If required, send in proof of identity and any evidence SFE have asked for.While it is recommended to apply as soon as possible, students can still apply for funding nine months after the first day of the academic year for their course. For example, if you are starting between August 1 and December 31, the last day to apply would be May 31.Student finance datesStudents will only receive their funding until after they have registered at their university or college, so in some cases, this may mean that you will have to move in to accommodation and pay rent before the first installment of the money hits your bank account.Payment dates vary from student to student, but Student Finance England aim to provide their customers with their loans during the following months:First payment - September 2018Second payment - January 2018Third payment - April 2019Strictly Come Dancing 2018: What is the Strictly curse?Who is Chris Young?

Coleen’s crime - if you can describe it as that - was to appear on Loose Women a week ago alongside her nemesis from Celebrity Big Brother, Kim Woodburn, to try and settle their differences. I reluctantly agreed to mediate - and, (unwisely, in retrospect) - agreed to emulate Judge Rinder and put on a black robe.It was supposed to be a light-hearted bit of fun, and Kim was happy to come on the show, for which she received a decent fee. To put the record straight, Kim Woodburn and I have never fallen out - she’s not everyone’s cup of tea, and (like me) she isn’t afraid to speak her mind. During her last appearance on Loose Women, we got on fine.          Two-faced: Things had escalated on the show, as the pair discussed their past together, with Coleen admitting: \u0027I think Kim\u0027s right I was two-faced with Kim in the house,\u0027This time, however, the chat got off to a rocky start, with Kim immediately accusing the totally innocent Linda Robson of siding with Coleen. What followed, was unreal - in all my 40 years of television, I’ve never encountered someone like Kim who defies all reason, who started ranting, convinced she was being attacked, and would not draw breath. I could do little to stem the tirade - if you watch the show that’s obvious. I’m hardly colluding in verbal abuse. Kim eventually stormed off after deciding to introduce her troubled childhood into the discussion. Coleen (who also, by the way, had an extremely difficult childhood) barely said a word.          Shocking: Kim Woodburn and Coleen Nolan proved their feud was still going strong as they had an almighty row during Wednesday\u0027s episode of Loose WomenAfterwards, we sat in a meeting room in total shock. The breakdown in communication between the presenters and our guest was bad enough - but what followed on social media was truly insane, and didn’t reflect (in my opinion) what actually happened. Coleen has been accused of being a bully, of gloating (and worse). She’s received death threats and has been trolled by small minded idiots who say they hope she dies of cancer like her sister Bernie. Even more bizarre, a petition has been launched to try and get Coleen sacked from Loose Women, signed by thousands who haven’t even watched the interview.I’ve been told I am a bully and that my reputation is in tatters, and slagged off by high minded newspapers like the Guardian - who seem desperate to join in the storm. The effect on Coleen has been devastating - a day afterwards, she texted me to say she’d been crying non-stop. Yesterday she appeared on ITV’s This Morning, still barely able to talk through the tears.  Shocked: The pensioner went on to accuse the audience of \u0027laughing\u0027 at her, as she spat: \u0027Look you folks can laugh all you want. I\u0027m going to tell you something now and then I\u0027m going to leave\u0027As Coleen has said, this storm is truly shocking - and hard to understand. She (and all the Loose Women) have fronted well-received campaigns to highlight mental health and body confidence, and the show won Best Entertainment show at the Mind Media Awards. Last year, Coleen, Linda and I stripped off for a billboard campaign to persuade other women that whatever shape you are, it’s OK. When I joined Loose Women seven years ago, Coleen was a friendly face. It was a challenging experience, a bit like starting at a new school. Trying to find a way to fit into a gang of old mates, who had been around for ages wasn’t easy. Coleen extended me a warm welcome and was always supportive.To see her go through the recent breakdown of her marriage, and still go on screen being a strong woman who is there for other women, has been inspiring. She represents everything I am very bad at - close family relationships and empathy, laced with a strong dose of down to earth common sense and life experience.          TRASH! Shaking her finger at Coleen, Kim then angrily shouted out \u0027She is trash\u0027, as she stormed out the studio, ignoring Janet Street-Porter call out \u0027She\u0027s not trash\u0027Coleen and Kim have never seen eye to eye - but Coleen is not a spiteful or revengeful person, all of which makes her current predicament so incomprehensible. A woman who has publicly talked about her grief over the death of one sister and is coping with the serious health issues faced by another is hardly unsympathetic. A woman who has talked candidly about a violent father who sexually abused her sister Anne. Coleen understands the tough side of life - and, at the age of 53 - has decided to go back on tour - alone. She says she wants to ‘take control’ of her life, to reassess things, now that she’s a single woman again.To put the record straight, Coleen Nolan is not a bully - and neither am I. I’m proud she’s my friend, and shame on those people who want to hurt her. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/03/12/4F79974200000578-0-image-m-4_1535974590327.jpg","title":"UK French talks prevent scallop clashes","story":"Share this articleScallop wars: Breakthrough after UK and France talks"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/05/14/4FA7F89800000578-0-image-m-77_1536153867998.jpg","title":"Indonesian Sharia law district bans men women dining unless married related","story":"    Young Acehnese people sit at a restaurant in Bireun, a district in Indonesia\u0027s easternmost province Aceh, where from today restaurants are not supposed to serve women unless they are accompanied by their husband or a relative          A Muslim woman gets caned with 23 strokes after being caught in close proximity with her boyfriend in Banda Aceh in October 2016          Indonesia\u0027s deeply Islamic Aceh province has banned men and women from dining together unless they are married or relatedUnder the latest Islamic regulation, women in Bireuen district on Sumatra island will not be able to share a table with men at restaurants and coffee shops unless they are accompanied by their husband or a close male relative.Co-workers on their lunch break would also be forbidden from sharing a meal.Jufliwan, the head of the local sharia agency, who like many Indonesians has only one name, told AFP today: \u0027The objective is to protect women\u0027s dignity so they will feel more comfortable, more at ease, more well-behaved and will not do anything that violates sharia (Islamic law).\u0027Another part of the directive - signed by the district head last month - said women who were alone or not with family should not be served at restaurants and cafés after 9:00 pm.\u0027Kristen was half in the pool, face down\u0027: Dad of Australian...British woman, 29, is found dead in a swimming pool on dream...Australian teenage girl drowns after falling into a pool and...Dele Alli is accused of being an agent of Satanist...Share this article    Out of seven couples caught spending time together outside of marriage, 13 were caned while one woman was spared after it was discovered that she was pregnant          Crowds watch and film the punishment on their mobile phones outside a mosque in Banda Aceh, IndonesiaAuthorities say it will be up to restaurateurs to enforce the regulation, although offenders will not be punished.Three years ago provincial capital Banda Aceh banned unaccompanied women from entertainment venues like cafes and sports halls after 11:00 pm.In 2013, Lhokseumawe city in Sumatra\u0027s north ordered women to sit \u0027side-saddle\u0027 on motorbikes with their legs dangling off to one side.The mayor at the time said straddling male drivers on motorbikes was \u0027improper\u0027.In 2016 a Muslim woman was caned 23 times after being caught in close proximity with her boyfriend in Banda, Aceh. Out of seven couples caught spending time together outside marriage, 13 were caned while one woman was spared after it was discovered that she was pregnant.

Their mission was a success and after the British agreed to talks with the Sardar, they agreed to roll back the tax rates.Patel was also a sanitation commissioner in the city of Ahmedabad from 1917 and was later elected Ahmedabad’s Municipal President in 1922, 1924 and 1927, during a time in which there was an extension of electricity supply and major educational reforms.Following this, Vallabhbhai rose to the Indian National Congress and was at the helm of various rebel events before organising the party for elections in 1934 and 1937, as well as promoting the Quit India movement.As India’s first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister, he was also responsible for organising relief in Punjab and Delhi while restoring peace throughout the country. Patel was one of the early promoters of property rights and free enterprise in India.However, while his leadership was multifaceted, Vallabhbhai’s pivotal role was to practice what was referred to Suraaj, which means good governance and always encouraged unity, having mobilised the farmers and bringing together various castes to join the struggle for freedom.Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in courtBefore he became involved in the struggle for freedom, Vallabhbhai Patel was a lawyer with dreams of becoming a barrister, but in those days, in order to achieve this, one had to travel to England and having been born to a farmer, he did not have the financial means to even attend university.However, Patel taught himself after borrowing books from a friend who was a lawyer and started attending court sessions, learning from just observing the arguments that were made. He passed his exams with flying colours and opened a practice in Godhra.His selfless character shone through when although he had the financial means to send himself to England, he let his older brother Vitthalbhai, who was also a lawyer, pursue higher education in Law first before he left for England himself.Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel statueSardar Vallabhbhai Patel will be memorialised with a statue that will remind India of its struggle for freedom and also, inspire the people of the country to share his ideologies of unity, patriotism, growth and governance.Already being built on Sadhu Island in the state of Gujarat with the Narmada river around it, the Statue of Unity will be 597 feet tall and will be twice the size of the Statue of Liberty and 100 feet higher than China’s Spring Temple Buddha.The Statue of Unity will have a viewing gallery at 501 feet in addition to a visitor’s centre, offering expansive views of the surrounding area. There will also be a three-star 128-room hotel with a restaurant and conference facilities.Strictly Come Dancing 2018: What is the Strictly curse?Who is Chris Young?

Kyl had previously served as a U.S. Senator for Arizona from 1995 to 2013.He was born in Oakland, Nebraska on April 25, 1942.The son of former U.S. Representative John Henry Kyl, he attended the University of Arizona and graduated in 1964, later earning a law degree from the college in 1966. After working as a lawyer and lobbyist in Phoenix, Arizona, he was later elected to the United States House of Representatives, serving there starting in 1987 until being elected to the United States Senate in 1994 and joining the chamber officially the following year.In the Senate, he formed a close relationship with fellow Arizona Senator John McCain and ultimately rose to the position of Minority Whip in December 2007, making him one of the most influential Republican Senators in Washington, D.C. On Capitol Hill, he advocated strongly for tougher crime laws, lower taxes and a conservative foreign policy.Kyl retired from the Senate in January 2013, ruling out a run for political office in the future except if offered the role of Vice President.

Mail critic QUENTIN LETTS casts a sardonic eye over last night\u0027s Love Island finale after the ITV2 reality show gripped millions ‘We were right to say in March that the Russian state was responsible,’ said Mrs May.‘Now we can go further. The Government has concluded that the two iniduals named by the police are officers from the Russian military intelligence service, also known as the GRU.’This earned gasps from the House. Or at least most sides of it. Jeremy Corbyn and his neighbour Emily Thornberry slanted their heads with expressions of sour ennui. Mr Corbyn’s response to Mrs May was a classless piece of work: grudging, equivocal, snippy, approaching only the minimum of decency.He conceded the attack was ‘an outrage’ and that there had been ‘a superhuman police effort’ but he wanted to know what steps Mrs May and Co were taking to secure the Kremlin’s co-operation in bringing the suspects to trial.Conservative MPs gave him the bird for this. ‘Get real!’ shouted one. It did sound as if the Labour leader still did not comprehend the Russian state’s likely complicity in the attack. Mr Corbyn bridled. ‘This is a serious matter,’ he said, his rising voice petulant.Tory MPs: ‘Yes it is!’Miss Thornberry shook her head to show she disapproved of and put herself morally above the Tories’ molten anger. Later Mr Corbyn suffered a slip of the tongue when he said he wanted to ‘condemn’ the police. He swiftly corrected this to ‘commend’ but it was an eye-rolling moment. Boris Johnson (Con, Uxbridge \u0026amp S Ruislip) was the first backbencher to be given the floor. He deplored Mr Corbyn’s ‘somewhat weaselly language’.Later Corbyn critic Chris Leslie (Lab, Nottingham E) urged Mrs May to ‘ignore the cranks and the ideological extremists’ who sided with Russia to ‘sow mistrust in our security professionals’.Richard Benyon (Con, Newbury) spoke of the Kremlin having ‘fellow travellers and useful idiots’ in the West. Several Labour MPs had chosen to stay away from the Chamber, perhaps not wishing to have to endure another of Mr Corbyn’s unpatriotic performances on the Salisbury attack. Towards the end, even his frontbench was pretty empty.Ian Blackford, leader of the SNP, found a more certain tone of gravity than his Labour counterpart. Dominic Grieve (Con, Beaconsfield) described the Russian state as ‘a gangster organisation’ and hoped we would make it harder for Russians to enter our country.‘We must unreservedly condemn Russia,’ said Yvette Cooper (Lab, Normanton) – something Mr Corbyn had omitted to do.Chris Bryant had ‘no doubt’ Vladimir Putin ‘himself personally’ was at the end of the bloody trail.

Valery Starchenko, 66, is the uncle of one of the Novichok poisoning suspects Alexander Petrov          CCTV images of Petrov and Boshirov the day before the attack at the train station Theresa May claimed both Petrov and Boshirov are GRU agents and that their mission to plant novichok at the Skripal family home in Salisbury would have been approved at the highest levels in the Kremlin.There is also evidence that Petrov made a trip to London from 28 February to 5 March 2017, claimed Fontanka based in St Petersburg.With Boshirov, he also made previous trips together to Europe, according to flight records.\u0027From September 2016 to March 2018 they visited Amsterdam, Geneva, Milan and went several times to Paris.\u0027Boshirov and Petrov are known to have non biometric passports with almost identical numbers, suggesting they were issued two years ago at the same time.Petrov is believed to have been born in June or July 1979, making him 39.Boshirov is said to be born on 12 April 1978 making him 40.He appears to have a job - possibly his cover - as an employee of Microgen, national manufacturer of immune and biological medication.Microgen reports to the ministry of healthcare and was established in 2003.It is unclear if such a role would give him any expertise in the dangers of novichok, a nerve agent manufactured in Soviet times as a chemical weapon which was used in the Salisbury attack.Russia accuses Britain of \u0027dirty tricks\u0027 over CCTV Gatwick...\u0027More Johnny English than James Bond\u0027: Security minister...Novichok showdown at the UN: Britain and Russia face off...Share this article    Yulia Chopivskaya, from Ukraine, aged around 30, was the only Facebook friend of Boshirov          Chopivskaya said she met the Russian for about half an hour at a cafe in Prague around five years agoThe secretive Boshirov had only one friend on a Facebook account, it appears, a glamorous Ukrainian woman.She has spoken of the \u0027nightmare\u0027 caused by the revelation from London that he is a suspected spy who poisoned the Skripals.Yulia Chopivskaya, from Ukraine, aged around 30, said she met the Russian for about half an hour at a cafe in Prague around five years ago.He then set up a Facebook account with her as his sole friend.She denies having seen him since but today has been inundated with demands to know if she is close to the spy.\u0027This is a nightmare,\u0027 she said.\u0027I haven\u0027t stayed in touch with this person and I don\u0027t know him.\u0027I deleted him from my friend\u0027s list.She said: \u0027I don\u0027t know if this is a real last name or not.\u0027In 2013 or 2014 I met a guy who introduced himself as Ruslan, it was in Prague.\u0027Then he asked how to find me on Facebook and added me there.\u0027We chatted for half an hour maximum and said goodbye to each other at that very cafe.\u0027Since then I haven\u0027t seen him.\u0027His Facebook only has a street scene from Prague.She did not recognise him from the picture released by police in London, she said.She claimed: \u0027I don\u0027t know the person in the photograph.\u0027Boshirov like Petrov has not spoken on the British allegations.Anonymous social media channel Nezygar also surmised that Britain had a high-ranking mole inside the GRU, the military intelligence identified by Theresa May as sending two agents to Salisbury to launch a chemical weapons attack.          Novichok poisoning suspects Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov are shown on CCTV on Fisherton Road, Salisbury at 1:05pm on 04 March 2018Citing an intelligence source, Nezygar claimed the most likely explanation of the poisoning in Salisbury was a mafia operation or a British provocation to undermine Russia.\u0027Theresa\u0027 May either publicly disclosed information about British intelligence having a high-rank mole within Russian military intelligence who passed confirming information or it is a simple assumption, manipulation, a game of coincidences,\u0027 stated the channel.The visibility of the Russian pair in Britain and the bungled attack \u0027clearly raises suspicions about their professionalism and qualification\u0027, suggesting they are not GRU.\u0027The look of the \u0027officers\u0027 is more like members of an organised crime community.\u0027Russia has accused Britain of tinkering with CCTV images of the two alleged spies.Pictures showed Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov separately walking up steps at Gatwick Airport.Yet both images are timed at the same moment - 16:22:43.Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zhakarova said: \u0027Either the date and the exact time were overlaid on the image, or the staff of the Russian GRU learned to walk simultaneously - but their images are captured in two different photographs.\u0027The pictures released by the Metropolitan Police were being mocked on Russian social media.One said: \u0027Yes, the corridors (at Gatwick Airport) are different.\u0027These are corridors at border control.\u0027But what an amazing synchronization of the GRU\u0027s staff.\u0027\u0027Don\u0027t worry it happens - people will swallow such \u0027evidence\u0027,\u0027 said a social media comment mocking Britain over the pictures.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/06/09/030ED98C000007D0-6138045-image-a-14_1536224037286.jpg","title":"John McDonnell says NEVER use UKs nuclear deterrent","story":"    Shadow chancellor John McDonnell (pictured) made clear there were no circumstances under which he would deploy the weapons - and said Britain should not even have had them during the Cold War          Critics point out that the principle of the Trident deterrent (test launch pictured) is completely undermined if hostile states like Russia believe it would not be deployedThe veteran left-winger is a life-long supporter of unilateral disarmament, and is still vice president of CND.But despite Mr Corbyn vowing that he would never use Trident as PM, Labour\u0027s official policy is to support renewal of the weapons system.Critics point out that the principle of the deterrent is completely undermined if hostile states like Russia believe it would not be deployed. Asked in the interview with the New Statesman whether he would ever be willing to press the \u0027nuclear button\u0027,  Mr McDonnell said: \u0027No.\u0027Corbyn faces backlash over \u0027weaselly words\u0027 on Russian blame...Raab holds crisis talks with Michel Barnier in Brussels...Share this articleMr McDonnell named Clement Attlee as his political hero - but said he had blundered by ordering the development of the nuclear bomb.He said Tony Benn was his favourite Labour MP, but quizzed on who his favourite Conservative politician was he replied: \u0027None.\u0027He added: \u0027I honestly don\u0027t like their politics, though I have worked with Justine Greening and Zac Goldsmith against the third runway at Heathrow.\u0027 Mr McDonnell said Marx\u0027s tome espousing a communist economy had been the most influential on his views. \u0027It has to be Das Kapital.

Coleen’s crime - if you can describe it as that - was to appear on Loose Women a week ago alongside her nemesis from Celebrity Big Brother, Kim Woodburn, to try and settle their differences. I reluctantly agreed to mediate - and, (unwisely, in retrospect) - agreed to emulate Judge Rinder and put on a black robe.It was supposed to be a light-hearted bit of fun, and Kim was happy to come on the show, for which she received a decent fee. To put the record straight, Kim Woodburn and I have never fallen out - she’s not everyone’s cup of tea, and (like me) she isn’t afraid to speak her mind. During her last appearance on Loose Women, we got on fine.          Two-faced: Things had escalated on the show, as the pair discussed their past together, with Coleen admitting: \u0027I think Kim\u0027s right I was two-faced with Kim in the house,\u0027This time, however, the chat got off to a rocky start, with Kim immediately accusing the totally innocent Linda Robson of siding with Coleen. What followed, was unreal - in all my 40 years of television, I’ve never encountered someone like Kim who defies all reason, who started ranting, convinced she was being attacked, and would not draw breath. I could do little to stem the tirade - if you watch the show that’s obvious. I’m hardly colluding in verbal abuse. Kim eventually stormed off after deciding to introduce her troubled childhood into the discussion. Coleen (who also, by the way, had an extremely difficult childhood) barely said a word.          Shocking: Kim Woodburn and Coleen Nolan proved their feud was still going strong as they had an almighty row during Wednesday\u0027s episode of Loose WomenAfterwards, we sat in a meeting room in total shock. The breakdown in communication between the presenters and our guest was bad enough - but what followed on social media was truly insane, and didn’t reflect (in my opinion) what actually happened. Coleen has been accused of being a bully, of gloating (and worse). She’s received death threats and has been trolled by small minded idiots who say they hope she dies of cancer like her sister Bernie. Even more bizarre, a petition has been launched to try and get Coleen sacked from Loose Women, signed by thousands who haven’t even watched the interview.I’ve been told I am a bully and that my reputation is in tatters, and slagged off by high minded newspapers like the Guardian - who seem desperate to join in the storm. The effect on Coleen has been devastating - a day afterwards, she texted me to say she’d been crying non-stop. Yesterday she appeared on ITV’s This Morning, still barely able to talk through the tears.  Shocked: The pensioner went on to accuse the audience of \u0027laughing\u0027 at her, as she spat: \u0027Look you folks can laugh all you want. I\u0027m going to tell you something now and then I\u0027m going to leave\u0027As Coleen has said, this storm is truly shocking - and hard to understand. She (and all the Loose Women) have fronted well-received campaigns to highlight mental health and body confidence, and the show won Best Entertainment show at the Mind Media Awards. Last year, Coleen, Linda and I stripped off for a billboard campaign to persuade other women that whatever shape you are, it’s OK. When I joined Loose Women seven years ago, Coleen was a friendly face. It was a challenging experience, a bit like starting at a new school. Trying to find a way to fit into a gang of old mates, who had been around for ages wasn’t easy. Coleen extended me a warm welcome and was always supportive.To see her go through the recent breakdown of her marriage, and still go on screen being a strong woman who is there for other women, has been inspiring. She represents everything I am very bad at - close family relationships and empathy, laced with a strong dose of down to earth common sense and life experience.          TRASH! Shaking her finger at Coleen, Kim then angrily shouted out \u0027She is trash\u0027, as she stormed out the studio, ignoring Janet Street-Porter call out \u0027She\u0027s not trash\u0027Coleen and Kim have never seen eye to eye - but Coleen is not a spiteful or revengeful person, all of which makes her current predicament so incomprehensible. A woman who has publicly talked about her grief over the death of one sister and is coping with the serious health issues faced by another is hardly unsympathetic. A woman who has talked candidly about a violent father who sexually abused her sister Anne. Coleen understands the tough side of life - and, at the age of 53 - has decided to go back on tour - alone. She says she wants to ‘take control’ of her life, to reassess things, now that she’s a single woman again.To put the record straight, Coleen Nolan is not a bully - and neither am I. I’m proud she’s my friend, and shame on those people who want to hurt her. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/03/12/4F79974200000578-0-image-m-4_1535974590327.jpg","title":"UK French talks prevent scallop clashes","story":"Share this articleScallop wars: Breakthrough after UK and France talks"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/05/14/4FA7F89800000578-0-image-m-77_1536153867998.jpg","title":"Indonesian Sharia law district bans men women dining unless married related","story":"    Young Acehnese people sit at a restaurant in Bireun, a district in Indonesia\u0027s easternmost province Aceh, where from today restaurants are not supposed to serve women unless they are accompanied by their husband or a relative          A Muslim woman gets caned with 23 strokes after being caught in close proximity with her boyfriend in Banda Aceh in October 2016          Indonesia\u0027s deeply Islamic Aceh province has banned men and women from dining together unless they are married or relatedUnder the latest Islamic regulation, women in Bireuen district on Sumatra island will not be able to share a table with men at restaurants and coffee shops unless they are accompanied by their husband or a close male relative.Co-workers on their lunch break would also be forbidden from sharing a meal.Jufliwan, the head of the local sharia agency, who like many Indonesians has only one name, told AFP today: \u0027The objective is to protect women\u0027s dignity so they will feel more comfortable, more at ease, more well-behaved and will not do anything that violates sharia (Islamic law).\u0027Another part of the directive - signed by the district head last month - said women who were alone or not with family should not be served at restaurants and cafés after 9:00 pm.\u0027Kristen was half in the pool, face down\u0027: Dad of Australian...British woman, 29, is found dead in a swimming pool on dream...Australian teenage girl drowns after falling into a pool and...Dele Alli is accused of being an agent of Satanist...Share this article    Out of seven couples caught spending time together outside of marriage, 13 were caned while one woman was spared after it was discovered that she was pregnant          Crowds watch and film the punishment on their mobile phones outside a mosque in Banda Aceh, IndonesiaAuthorities say it will be up to restaurateurs to enforce the regulation, although offenders will not be punished.Three years ago provincial capital Banda Aceh banned unaccompanied women from entertainment venues like cafes and sports halls after 11:00 pm.In 2013, Lhokseumawe city in Sumatra\u0027s north ordered women to sit \u0027side-saddle\u0027 on motorbikes with their legs dangling off to one side.The mayor at the time said straddling male drivers on motorbikes was \u0027improper\u0027.In 2016 a Muslim woman was caned 23 times after being caught in close proximity with her boyfriend in Banda, Aceh. Out of seven couples caught spending time together outside marriage, 13 were caned while one woman was spared after it was discovered that she was pregnant.

But when it becomes an excuse to foist bad architecture on to struggling communities in the cynical pursuit of an ‘anything is better than what was there before’ methodology, it simply recycles the resentment regeneration was supposed to redress,” the judges said.The original nominator of the building lambasted it as “one of the most horrendous architectural responses ever conceived for Greater Manchester”.Other buildings that made the shortlist included an extension of the Shankly hotel in Liverpool, which was judged to be out of keeping with the original historic building, and London’s “bland” and “boxy” Lewisham Gateway."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d89f57575d357bb18115837ad128f32072e61c0/0_271_5985_3591/master/5985.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cdd29185597ff4b0ee3709ef7e303cb","title":"like something from pompeii battersea arts centre scorching resurrection","story":"With its charred plaster walls and restored mosaic flooring, the £13m rescue of the cherished London theatre has kept thrilling traces of the 2015 fire. The result is a spatial spectacular – with a whopping 35 performance hotspotsAt Battersea Arts Centre it can be hard to tell where the audience stops and the acting begins. The rambling Victorian town hall in south London, home to experimental theatre since the 1970s, has long revelled in blurring the boundaries of stage and seat, mingling performers with guests and presenting plays on landings, in the bar and even in its offices. BAC has finally completed a 12-year, £13.3m restoration project by celebrated theatre architects Haworth Tompkins – and it’s just as hard to tell where the original building ends and the new bits begin.“We call it scratch architecture,” says architect Steve Tompkins, referring to the process of scratch theatre pioneered at BAC, where ideas are tested out live in the early stages of development, with audience feedback used to evolve the performance. “It’s not about a perfectly authored finished product, which is a difficult idea for architects to stomach,” he adds. “But we wondered if we could do a parallel process by insinuating ourselves into the productions. What would it mean for us to relinquish tyrannical control over the project?”The answer is the creation of a magical place that surprises at every turn. In a phased process of keyhole surgery, the firm has opened up new routes through the building, carved out new performing spaces, inserted office accommodation and actors’ bedrooms, and raised the number of rooms and areas in which to stage performances from four to 35. Just as all this was reaching completion in 2015, BAC’s grand hall burned to the ground, leaving only two gable walls standing. But the fire-charred relic provided an additional opportunity: the hall has been carefully resurrected and added to, creating one of London’s most spectacular interiors.The unusual nature of the process makes more sense when you meet David Jubb, BAC’s energetic artistic director since 2004. “I’d never done a capital project before,” he says, describing his alarm at inheriting his predecessor’s comprehensive £30m masterplan for the building. “I visited a lot of other recent theatre projects and all the artistic directors had this haunted expression in their eyes, as if they’d been scarred by the process. It seems that there’s a general idea that a building is ‘done to you’, and you can’t change it.”Not a pair for following conventions, Jubb and Tompkins tore up the plans and embarked on a collaborative investigation of the building, looking for opportunities and testing out ideas. The seminal production of The Masque of the Red Death in 2007, by the immersive theatre company Punchdrunk, was a game-changer, infiltrating more parts of the complex than most people knew existed. The company opened up the building’s 16 chimneys, tore down partitions and created new connections in a process that has continued over the years and been progressively formalised. Every part of the building is now kitted out with ceiling hanging points and electrical outlets, so any space can be converted into a theatre in a couple of hours.Some of the most successful interventions are the cheapest: a line of high-backed restaurant-style bench seats and tables now climb up the ceremonial stairs in the main entrance, draped with folded stair carpet, as if the staircase grew bored with being steps and rose up to become dining booths. It is a brilliant moment of multi-levelled social theatre to be greeted with, matched only by the chaos of the new creche, where kids tumble across Teletubby mounds.Similar spatial drama is found in an old courtyard in the centre of the building, previously cluttered with lean-to structures and dead pigeons. It has been converted into a compact outdoor theatre, with vertical steel gantries and removable seating, its proportions giving the feel of a bear-pit. With layers of spectators peering down from stacks of balconies, and even from a deck on the roof, it has the vertiginous intensity of a Shakespearean theatre. The new walls have been finished in white glazed brick, framing the original red-brick building like an archaeological imprint, the facades studded with windows where performers might appear at any minute, while a raised floor allows for more trap-door surprises.One wing of the attic, meanwhile, has been converted into light and airy office accommodation for BAC’s 65 staff, who seem relieved to finally have a permanent home where they won’t be displaced by itinerant performances (or not yet). Along the other wing, the architects have inserted eight twin bedrooms, a boon given that rent is one of the biggest barriers to staging work in London. The basement has also been transformed into the Scratch Hub, a place to incubate start-up business from the surrounding area, continuing the strong outreach programme with nearby council estates, a big part of Jubb’s inclusive agenda over the past decade.“This is not a place to come and experience the future of theatre,” he says. “It is for people to come and show us what the future of theatre might be. It’s about enabling people to shape it for themselves.” His vision is in keeping with the radical history of the building, a focal point for the trade union movement, the women’s suffrage campaign and the election of the first black mayor of a London borough – Battersea – in 1913. “It has always been a place where new ideas have been made.”The sense of permissiveness and possibility is embodied in Haworth Tompkins’s approach. Details such as the new signage perched on a giant steel I-beam, or the exposed scarring in the wall, where an artist has highlighted the marks left by chasing the electrical wiring into the plaster, say that this is a building in flux even after the architects have left.The climax of old and new comes in the restored grand hall, beginning with a prelude in the atmospheric corridors at the back of the building, where layers of scorched plaster and mosaic flooring have the air of something from Pompeii. They are illuminated by rows of cast silicone light fittings, which look like hand-blown gas lamps, but will survive being walloped by a ladder, while sturdy oak doors lead into the hall.Where a barrel-vaulted ceiling encrusted with plaster mouldings once sprung, now hangs a diaphanous veil of plywood, perforated with the geometry of the original mouldings. The layers of bolted timber echo the depth of the original plaster, while the whole thing can be illuminated from the front or behind, like a theatrical gauze curtain, to reveal the hidden workings in the roof cavity. It is a startling sight, possessing the quality of fine lacework gently draped over the burnt-out carcass.“After the fire, we were faced with the question of quite how much to restore,” says Tompkins. “We thought of the building as a kind of architectural tape recorder of everything that’s happened to it over the years – physically, politically, socially – so decided that putting it all back would have been ludicrous.”It was the right decision. The scorched surface of exposed brick and plaster lends the room an atmospheric patina that it simply didn’t have in its previous state, while the new veiled ceiling allows all of the technical requirements to be incorporated above, as well as improving the acoustic with the additional volume. New triple-glazed windows will also allow BAC to put on amplified events here without annoying its neighbours. Like the rest of the rambling complex, it provides an inspiring stage for whatever the next generation of directors want to throw at it.• The Battersea Arts Centre relaunches on 6 September with a celebratory Phoenix Season."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bdce55070874c1d9453fea855be587323e40a8c/143_204_2418_1450/master/2418.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db6452a645537c807d757d7c7ee9334b","title":"soho in the eighties by christopher howse review","story":"How pub prophets, poets, local artists and above all booze created London’s little BohemiaAt the fag end of this at once elegiac and emetic memoir, Christopher Howse observes: “Obviously a painter like Francis Bacon would not have painted as he did if he had not fallen into Soho.” But I wonder if this is really obvious at all? Bacon was the standout celebrity of London’s little Bohemia, not only in the 80s, but the 50s, 60s and 70s as well – his was also a burgeoning international celebrity, such that in the years since his death he’s come to be recognised as the pre-eminent figurative painter of the second half of the 20th century. That it should have been this tight grid of streets – the area pretty much contained by Wardour Street to the west, Charing Cross Road to the east, Oxford Street to the north and Shaftesbury Avenue to the south – that engendered such genius would seem as preposterous as the assertion that it was the Bateau-Lavoir alone that inspired Picasso’s cubism.But then all bohemian milieus are really the creation of their minor not their major figures – the big beasts cruise through, ships in the night, en route for more exalted destinations, leaving bobbing in their wake parasitic poetasters, ready to cash in. It would be unfair, perhaps, to class Howse as one such: his sensitive, well-drawn book does a good job of conveying a particular place at a particular time, without either undue reverence or the anachronisms that dog hindsight. In particular, Howse is flinty-eyed about what principally animated Soho’s high spirits during the 80s (and the previous three decades for that matter): alcohol.If Bacon – a non-stop champagne tippler – was its presiding deity, standing a few feet from the bar of the Colony Room Club, above a crap trattoria on Dean Street, then Soho’s postwar prophet was indubitably Jeffrey Bernard, who succeeded Julian MacLaren-Ross as its best known chronicler. Bernard’s favoured hangout was the Coach and Horses on the corner of Romilly and Greek streets, which at that time was presided over by the self-styled “Soho’s Rudest Landlord”, Norman Balon. I never hung out much in the Coach – as it was known to Bernard, and its other regulars – or in the French, round the corner, where Gaston Bachelard’s waxed moustaches wavered over the bar like some signpost to a hipper future but I knew the Colony Room Club well in the late 1970s and early 80s (giving me a little seniority over Howse), and can testify to the – for the most part – accuracy of his depiction of its crapulent denizens. Bernard, besides penning his celebrated Low Life columns for the Spectator, was also a career alcoholic – and it’s this, a sort of existential commitment to the ruination of chronic drinking, that marked out the Soho of this era.There are still one or two illegal after-hours drinking clubs operating in the locale – remarkably, there also remain a few of the so-called “walk-ups”, brothels that occupy the upper storeys of the elegant Georgian houses that characterise the quarter. Meanwhile, the street-low-life component of Soho has been on the rise, such that the legendary “front line” for hard drug dealing has been resurrected around Shaftesbury Avenue and its environs. But for the most part, this Stygian cockpit is under assault – not from s of morality, but the property developers who are the true arbiters of our age. Shiny developments on Archer Street and around the new Crossrail station at Tottenham Court Road seem to me to be silvery spikes hammered into Soho’s vampiric heart.It was and is the micro-locales of Soho that preoccupy Howse – so much so that for two set-piece anecdotes of his era, he supplies diagrams of the interiors of the Coach and Horses and the Colony Room Club, so that those unfamiliar with the establishments can imaginatively place themselves at the centre of the action. He gives us the blow-by-blow of a raid conducted against Bernard for running an illegal horse racing book in the first establishment, and the constabulary attending the latter because its proprietor, Ian Board, had allegedly smashed up a customer’s mobile phone.While only too happy to laud him as an enemy of these ghastly gadgets almost avant la lettre, I must state for the record that Board was a nasty piece of work, with a vicious tongue and little of the wit Howse ascribes to him, unless you consider peppering your discourse with “cunt” in all its possible variations – nounal, adjectival, verbal, conjunctive – to be hilarious. His predecessor at the Colony was Muriel Belcher, the original Queen of Soho, but while Board also aspired(on grounds of sexuality, at least) to the same title, the truth was that like most chronic alcoholics he was an embittered and resentful creep. He was a pander and a pimp as well. Howse seems to have been blinded – perhaps by his spiritual inclinations – to the truly dark side of Soho. I was privy to major drug deals that were set up in the Colony, as well as other genuinely criminal enterprises, rather than merely farcical ones.Howse ponders whether the Bohemian mores of Soho inspired any real social changes, and suggests that it was in their contempt for money, vested privilege and worldly recognition that its devotees distinguished themselves. I have my doubts: he allocates a considerable portion of the book to the Private Eye crowd, who memorably lunched at the Coach and while the journal may have an honourable tradition when it comes to speaking truth to power, at a social level it has mostly comprised a sniggering in‑crowd of ex-public schoolboy establishmentarians. No, if Soho was notable for anything during these years, it was that the former haven of out gay men – and a few women – was losing its singularity. While around the corner in Old Compton Street things grew gayer and gayer, with same-sex couples walking proudly hand-in-hand and gay-friendly businesses opening, inside the Colony Room Club things grew greyer and grimmer, as the dwindling handful of old Polari speakers, like some lost Amazonian tribe, faced their miserable extinction.But most miserably extinguished of all was the putatively straight (and really rather misogynistic, as Howse concedes) Bernard. Tiring of the endless physical depredations of his chosen lifestyle, which included by this stage kidney dialysis and an amputated leg, he effectively killed himself in 1997: inviting friends to a “party” that began when he forwent treatment, and ended with his death. Howse refused to attend, presumably because as a Catholic convert he couldn’t morally sanction an act of felo de se. It’s a strange coda to a book about bohemia, and I can’t help but see in Howse’s privileging of transcendent morality over personal amity a warped allegory of Soho’s own slow extinction by impersonal market forces.• Soho in the Eighties by Christopher Howse (Bloomsbury Continuum, £20).

It has previously defended its practice by saying that the energy generated from burning its goods was captured.The FTSE 100 company now says it will reuse, repair, donate or recycle all unsaleable products.Burberry is the first major company to publicly end the practice of destroying unwanted products. Marco Gobbetti, its chief executive, said he hoped others in the industry would follow suit.Gobbetti said: “Modern luxury means being socially and environmentally responsible. This belief is core to us at Burberry and key to our long-term success. We are committed to applying the same creativity to all parts of Burberry as we do to our products.”Burberry shareholders have questioned why the unsold products were not offered to the company’s private investors.Greenpeace welcomed the move as a “much-needed sign of a change of mind in the fashion industry”. Kirsten Brodde, who leads the Detox My Fashion campaign at the NGO, said: Because fashion is a high-volume business with more than 100bn garments produced each year, consumers’ closets are already overflowing with unworn clothes, creating an overstock problem for many companies.“It’s high time for the whole fashion industry to start dealing with overstock at its source: by slowing down production and rethinking the way it does business.Burberry will also end the use of real fur and says the debut collection from its new chief creative officer, Riccardo Tisci, to be presented on 17 September during London fashion week, will not feature any. Existing fur products will be phased out.Wendy Higgins of Humane Society International UK said it first met Burberry almost a decade ago to urge the company to drop fur.“Most British consumers don’t want anything to do with the cruelty of fur and so this is absolutely the right decision by this quintessentially British brand. And as fashion week kicks off today in New York, Burberry’s compassionate stance couldn\u0027t have come at a better time, sending a strong message to designers like Prada still using fur, who are looking more and more isolated and outdated by the day.” It is a common practice among fashion firms to destroy unsold items to prevent them being stolen or sold cheaply.Earlier this year it emerged that the Swiss watchmaker Richemont, which owns the Cartier and Montblanc brands, had destroyed nearly €500m of its designer timepieces over the past two years to avoid them being sold at knockdown prices.Burberry reiterated that it takes its environmental obligations seriously and in May joined the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Make Fashion Circular initiative to prevent waste in the industry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26e05e2d8baa16687c5aecbd659bb95823900d4e/0_124_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfd17cb508c31feec9f2aed0f2ab7f99","title":"hidden costs being single","story":"Ordinarily, we like to scare the bejesus out of our youth, in the hope they’ll turn out even more boring and compliant than we are. (“Sex’ll give you gonorrhoea. Drugs’ll kill you. Rock’n’roll died with Amy Winehouse – here’s Ed Sheeran!”) And there’s another kind of aberrant behaviour that society wants to prevent. Kids be warned – we’ve made singledom appallingly expensive!According to research carried out by the Good Housekeeping Institute, “being single carries a price penalty of at least £2,000 a year per inidual”. Totting up the figures, I beg to differ. That is a conservative estimate.First, the government is intent on creating an anti-single state. The most egregious example of this is council tax: on average – in a band D home – you must pay £835 per person if you are married, and a whopping £1,235 if you live on your lonesome. Tory governments, usually so in favour of cutting taxes no matter the social cost, just love keeping them high for singletons. Is it fair to financially punish those who have failed to find true and lasting love?Our gym memberships are more expensive, our wills are more expensive, even our single person-sized milk cartons are, you guessed it, more expensive. And that’s without examining all the small print. On holiday, we pay extra to sleep alone, fly alone and eat alone.Then there’s the issue of insurance premiums. “According to insurers, I’d be a better driver tomorrow if I got hitched today,” the financial journalist Emma Lunn has complained. “You can put it to the test by comparing quotes with identical details except marital status.”Of course, things could be worse. We might be living in America. A 2013 survey of the costs of being single found that, factoring in the price of healthcare, “over a lifetime, unmarried women can pay as much as a million dollars more than their married counterparts”. No wonder that every time Beyoncé sings about single ladies the chorus consists of a load of “uh-oh’s”.Some might argue we shouldn’t worry about the single premium: we’ll all be cajoled into marriage at some point and so rid ourselves of it eventually. But, as Rebecca Traister pointed out in her book All the Single Ladies, there are more unmarried women alive today than at any point in history – and we’re a powerful demographic.If a woman is single past a certain age, society heaps all the blame – for blame is what it insists on heaping – on her. The birth rate is said to be falling not because many men don’t want to commit but because women are too busy or too picky or too high-powered and put off having children.Actually, my single friends and I have invested heavily in trying to find a partner we love who loves us so much we become pregnant. On top of all our other single-centric outgoings, according to Match we spend on average £1,280 a year on dates (mine have been utterly parlous). I’ve been searching for love since Tinder was invented and all I have to show for it is the lousy state of my bank account. Along with my best friends, I’m fretting about how to have children if conditions don’t improve on the love front. And yes, a single woman’s fertility treatment will cost her twice as much as if she were going through it with a partner.In the meantime, we’ve also spent a fortune celebrating everyone else’s happinesses – buying house-warming gifts, engagement presents, splurging on hen dos, weddings, christenings. Once, I found a card in a shop that read: “It’s better to have loved and lost than to have spent your life with a psychopath.” And I wish I’d punched the air and borne it home because it’s the closest any cultural artefact has come to celebrating me and my life choices (aside from a book that I wrote myself).And we’re not just made poorer financially – we’re all but bankrupt culturally. In the 90s, there was Kim Cattrall vamping it up on HBO proving we weren’t sadsacks now the closest thing we have to a standard bearer for our generation is Fleabag, and who would want to be her?If you’re past a certain age, everyone expects you to be married with children and if you’re not, complete strangers will demand to know why.

When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around.” It was an insight Friedman and his co-thinkers deployed with great success to seed the ideological beginnings of neoliberalism.Laissez-faire economics lay discredited after the Great Depression and the resulting rise in extremism, and then the success of wartime planning and the rise of the left. But Friedman and his allies refused to give up, meeting in the picturesque Swiss village of Mont Pèlerin in 1947 to prepare an intellectual fightback. When crisis did indeed come, three decades later, the ideological foundations for what became known as Thatcherism and Reaganism had already been constructed.The left did not learn from its opponents. The financial crash of a decade ago was the most severe crisis of capitalism since the Hungry Thirties. Yet the left’s intellectual cupboard was bare. With little to offer other than fiery speeches about bankers’ greed and defensive slogans against cuts, it presented no coherent alternative. Years of austerity followed, endorsed or even implemented by centre-left parties that signed their own political death warrants in doing so.A decade later, a new intellectual ferment can be found on the left. Meanwhile, a panicked right flips between recognising that the social order is broken – but offering no credible solutions – to believing it just hasn’t made the case for its profoundly unpopular ideology with enough vigour. When Jeremy Corbyn became odds-on favourite to win the Labour leadership in 2015, most of the British right collapsed into paroxysms of laughter, some even urging Tories to join Labour to vote for him to “help consign the party to electoral oblivion”. There were a few perceptive exceptions on the right: one Tory warned that a Corbyn victory would “shift the entire political debate to the left”.A new report vindicates this prophecy. Four years ago, the centre-left Institute for Public Policy Research published its Condition of Britain report. It was timid gruel: it not only accepted austerity, but even proposed freezing child benefit to fund the expansion of childcare.Under the leadership of Tom Kibasi, the thinktank has attempted to embrace the spirit of our time: the latest report, published by its commission on economic justice, is a critical contribution to a left intellectual revival. Its underlying message is inarguable: the current system is broken. “The UK economy is not working,” it declares. British workers have suffered the longest squeeze in wages for generations young people face a worse lot in life than their parents most who languish in poverty are in low-income work and Britain is Europe’s fifth most unequal society.The report’s prescriptions challenge assumptions that until recently were considered to be as immovable as the weather. A well-funded national investment bank would modernise Britain’s creaking infrastructure and drive innovation, while a national economic council would design a 10-year plan for the economy.What is striking about these demands isn’t just how much more radical they are than only four years ago: it’s who has endorsed them – from the archbishop of Canterbury to business leaders. The IPPR’s polling shows that, from a radical clampdown on tax avoidance to publicly owned investment banks, to borrowing to invest, there is overwhelming support for the junking of the old neoliberal order.Against this backdrop, the left needs to demand more radicalism from Labour. The very few sympathetic commentators have felt reluctant to do so because of the unrelenting attacks on a besieged Labour leadership. Some fear that any criticisms of the party from its left flank will offer succour to its increasingly hysterical opponents. But public appetite for radical reform – with even business figures endorsing it – means there is space to go further. Labour’s commitments on income and wealth taxes are insufficient to fully reverse Tory austerity and benefit cuts. The case for free movement of people in Europe has, sadly, largely been abandoned. By demanding more boldness from Labour, the political debate can be shifted further left still.The report calls for a paradigm shift as radical as those achieved by Attlee and Thatcher. Both built a new consensus, forcing their opponents to surrender to their underlying philosophies. To avoid its flagship policies being unpicked by another Tory administration, a future Labour government must seek to do the same."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71f8cf85922c8c7b0f05ec7c7daf603e6e11b932/4_0_2152_1291/master/2152.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e312a232e211e78cae0d86fcbfe7f61","title":"healthiest menu poor people free school meals hungry","story":"Four million children in the UK live in households that would struggle to afford to buy enough fruit, vegetables, fish and other healthy foods to meet the official nutrition guidelines, according to research by the Food Foundation. It makes for sobering reading but as a mother who was once in the same situation, I think the guidelines often fall short of the realities of living on, or skirting, the breadline.Over the last few years of my campaigning against poverty and working with hungry families, dozens and dozens of teachers have written to me, publicly and privately, to tell of pupils in their care for whom they provide breakfast, snacks, shoes, help with uniforms. They silently clear the kids’ school meal debts –  angels trying to patch up the yawning holes in the welfare safety net.Commentators may scoff about “chips and cheese in Styrofoam containers, and behind them is a massive fucking TV”, or claim that “the demand for food banks only exists because they are there” while sneering about smartphones and Sky TV, but I had none of these when I was living in poverty. Neither do thousands of others. I sold my tiny secondhand TV and the iPhone I had bought myself when I had a decent job, to pay the rent. We ate as well as we were able to, but most days it simply wasn’t enough. I put my son’s nutritional needs first, and existed on pasta and thin air more times than I would dare to admit.I went for lunch recently with a friend who has been appointed as an adviser to the government on nutrition. He asked my views on how to tackle the correlation between poverty and poor diet as an upper-middle-class man with no direct experience, he wanted to know what really needed to be done. Extend the free school meals programme again, I suggested. Use the revenue from the sugar tax to expand the Healthy Start vouchers programme from a measly £3.10 a week to a more reasonable sum, and available to every family in receipt of child benefit. Lobby supermarkets to keep their value ranges fairly priced, as many ingredients now cost three times as much as they did five years ago, while the gourmet ranges have stayed at a fixed rate. Understand the poverty premium on time: why it’s easier, with a quid in your pocket and no time, to buy a bag of chips than a packet of pasta and a tin of tomatoes.It’s easy to sit back and moralise under a warm roof with food in the cupboard to finger-wag and say what you would do differently in “their situation”. I write cheap recipes for struggling families and single people, and have donated 800 copies of my newest cookery book to food banks and other good causes. But my work barely scratches the surface for people who are living in hostels, fleeing violence, severely disabled, lacking cooking equipment or unable to read, along with the many, many other variables that government guidance and armchair commentators fail to take into account. Talk to families in poverty and ask them what they need, instead of prescribing it for them. Ask what the barriers are. Ask what would help.

I was under the impression that there was a ceasefire during the non-Christmas period, allowing time for Red Cross volunteers to treat victims suffering an overdose of mediocre covers of Britpop hits by breathy female vocalists. But the newly rebranded John Lewis \u0026amp Partners broke the truce on Tuesday, and detonated a truly awful advertisement during Bake Off.If you haven’t seen it, it’s a harrowing tale about a psychopathic mullet-haired primary school drama teacher who, after years of sub-par recitals, finally loses it and pressgangs his pupils into staging his nonsensical musical, a tedious We Will Rock You fanfiction set on Mars, apparently. The children are forced to sing a poorly edited version of Bohemian Rhapsody, with verses and stanzas hacked to fit the two-and-a-half-minute runtime (but don’t worry, it feels much, much longer), with different ill-fitting lyrics thrown in at random (“Mama, just killed a Martian” is a particularly egregious one). At the end, it descends into screaming as the children dodge surely illegal pyrotechnics in their worryingly flammable costumes, all while the teacher watches on, a sadistic grin on his face, his mullet bobbing ominously in silent laughter. I haven’t seen the extended cut, but we can assume that it ends with a 10-hour hostage situation where the teacher is eventually killed by police to a breathy female cover version of Don’t Stop Me Now.If you’re anything like me, the question you have at the end of this multimillion-pound commercial is “Why?” We’re given an answer of sorts by the slogan at the end: “If you’re part of it, you put your heart into it.” It’s one of those trite phrases that you can imagine Iain Dowie saying in a lull during a mediocre World Cup group match on ITV, along with “it’s the size of the fight in the dog” and “Iran are still in this, Sam”.The idea, I guess, is that the kids were so invested in this weird Queen opera that their unstable teacher made them perform that they put their heart into hand-making the costumes and sets. The problem is that the advert feels too slick for all that – this primary school play clearly has the budget of a mid-level West End production. We have to assume that all other classes have been cancelled, that the children have spent the entire term constructing these cardboard sets and costumes and that subsequently they will all fail their Sats. When a girl playing the drums rose out of a crater via a hidden door in the stage, I stood up and shouted: “What level of reality are we existing on here? Is this the real life? IS THIS JUST FANTASY?” (I was asked to leave the room by my wife.)The point is, it doesn’t feel homemade: it feels like a multimillion-pound ad agency masquerading as homemade, which means there’s a big gaping hole where the heart should be. In a way, the slogan should have been “John Lewis: we spent too much money on this when actually a cheaper version would have been better”. Which actually would have been quite appropriate for John Lewis.It turns out the reason for this expensive Christmas-in-September splurge on children with Freddie Mercury moustaches is to rebrand John Lewis and Waitrose: they’ve both added “\u0026amp Partners” to their name in an effort to emphasise the fact that the company is owned by its employees. Ostensibly there’s nothing wrong with that. I can understand the John Lewis Partnership wanting to push the genuinely unique relationship it has with its employees and its customers – anything that separates it from its heartless online competitors makes sense. But there’s something a bit unsettling about John Lewis trying to play up the angle of a socially conscious outfit, in contrast to those flashy companies wasting millions of pounds on overly slick adverts – by … wasting millions of pounds on an overly slick advert.What really sticks in the throat, however, is the news that came out this week, that John Lewis is axing up to 270 jobs in its department stores, leaving many of those partners that the company cares so much about suddenly unemployed. It leaves the whole campaign feeling like a hollow self-parody – they’ve spent so much money on a saccharine short film to show how much they love their employees that they’ve had to fire those employees to find money in the budget. It’s practically an Alanis Morissette lyric.Ultimately, it’s just an advert, and one that I have clearly over-analysed. But there’s something quite cold about it all. If John Lewis actually wants to change as a company – or at least change perceptions – it needs to start treating its partners with respect. It can’t just rework its image to look better – it needs to actually be better. Otherwise it’ll just seem like, to it, nothing really matters. Anyone can see. Nothing really matters, to its PLC."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09d08e9ed38762fa1dc523dcc5d0f8f815d1852f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a92aabb6e9af77b91bd0f50bfb7f82b2","title":"save earth disposable coffee cup green","story":"We must challenge the corporations that urge us to live in a throwaway society rather than seeking ‘greener’ ways of maintaining the status quoDo you believe in miracles? If so, please form an orderly queue. Plenty of people imagine we can carry on as we are, as long as we substitute one material for another. Last month, a request to Starbucks and Costa to replace their plastic coffee cups with cups made from corn starch was retweeted 60,000 times, before it was deleted.Those who supported this call failed to ask themselves where the corn starch would come from, how much land would be needed to grow it, or how much food production it would displace. They overlooked the damage this cultivation would inflict: growing corn (maize) is notorious for causing soil erosion, and often requires heavy doses of pesticides and fertilisers.The problem is not just plastic: it is mass disposability. Or, to put it another way, the problem is pursuing, on the\u0026nbspone planet known to harbour life, a four-planet lifestyle. Regardless of what we consume, the sheer volume of consumption is overwhelming the\u0026nbspEarth’s living systems.Don’t get me wrong. Our greed for plastic is a major environmental blight, and the campaigns to limit its use are well motivated and sometimes effective. But we cannot address our environmental crisis by swapping one overused resource for another. When I challenged that call, some people asked me, “So what should we use\u0026nbspinstead?”The right question is, “How should we live?” But systemic thinking is an endangered species.Part of the problem is the source of the plastic campaigns: David Attenborough’s Blue Planet II series. The first six episodes had strong, coherent narratives but\u0026nbspthe seventh, which sought to explain the threats facing the wonderful creatures the series revealed, darted from one issue to another. We were told we could “do something” about the destruction of ocean life. We were not told what. There was no explanation of why the problems are happening and what forces are responsible, or\u0026nbsphow they can be engaged.Amid the general incoherence, one contributor stated: “It comes down, I think, to us each taking responsibility for the personal choices in our everyday lives. That’s all any of us can be expected to do.” This perfectly represents the mistaken belief that a better form of consumerism will save the planet. The problems we face are structural: a political system captured by commercial interests, and an economic system that seeks endless growth. Of course we should try to minimise our own impacts, but we cannot confront these forces merely by “taking responsibility” for what we consume. Unfortunately, these are issues that the BBC in general and David Attenborough in particular avoid. I admire Attenborough in many ways, but I am no fan of his environmentalism. For many years, it was almost undetectable. When he did at last speak out, he avoided challenging power – either speaking in vague terms or focusing on problems for which powerful interests are not responsible. This tendency may explain Blue\u0026nbspPlanet’s skirting of the obvious issues.From this misdirection arise a thousand perversities. One prominent environmentalist posted a picture of the king prawns she had bought, celebrating the fact that she had persuaded the supermarket to put them in her own container rather than a plastic bag, and linking this to the protection of the seas. But buying prawns causes many times more damage to marine life than any plastic in which they are wrapped. Prawn fishing has the highest rates of bycatch of any fishery – scooping up vast numbers of turtles and other threatened species. Prawn farming is just as bad, eliminating tracts of mangrove forests, crucial nurseries for thousands of species.We are kept remarkably ignorant of such issues. As consumers, we are confused, bamboozled and almost powerless – and corporate power has gone to great lengths to persuade us to see ourselves this way. The BBC’s approach to environmental issues is highly partisan, siding with a system that has sought to transfer responsibility for structural forces to inidual shoppers. Yet it is only as citizens taking political action that we can promote meaningful change.The answer to the question “How should we live?” is: “Simply.” But living simply is highly complicated. In Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World, the government massacred the Simple Lifers. This is generally unnecessary: today they can safely be marginalised, insulted and dismissed. The ideology of consumption is\u0026nbspso prevalent that it has become invisible: it is the plastic soup in which we swim.One-planet living means not only seeking to reduce our own consumption, but also mobilising against the system that promotes the great tide of junk.

This – bigger turbines, with fewer positions and a bit further out – is really the shape of projects going forward.”The energy minister Claire Perry said the scheme would help the UK, the world’s number one in offshore wind installations, to consolidate its leadership and create thousands of high-quality jobs.The supersizing of windfarms around the British coastline means Walney Extension will not hold its title for long.ScottishPower’s East Anglia One will be bigger at 714MW when it opens in 2020. Ørsted itself has even larger schemes in the works, including Hornsea One and Two (1,200MW and 1,800MW, respectively) off the Yorkshire coast.Wright said it was “fantastic news” that ministers had recently committed to a timetable of auctions for clean energy subsidies every two years, starting in 2019.He said it was too early to say whether the company would submit its Hornsea Three windfarm, capable of powering 2m homes, into next year’s auction.But the executive warned that leaving the EU posed the risk of short-term disruption, and seamless borders and free-trade were important to Ørsted.“A hard Brexit or a last-minute no deal is probably the thing that would cause a problem in terms of supply chains and movement of goods and people,” he said.In the long-term, however, any form of Brexit would not change the firm’s interest in the UK and the fundamentals of the market. “We can deal with it,” he said.Wright said he was unfazed by the ‘wind drought’ that the heatwave brought to much of Europe this summer. “We will see some low wind periods, some high wind outputs,” he said.But the record-breaking temperatures and wildfires would likely strengthen political action on global warming, he thought. “It does tend to focus the mind a little in terms of climate and energy policy. I think it does have an effect,” he said.Offshore windfarms provide nearly a tenth of the UK’s electricity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e00ce93ca4ed43d3cd12f7b4714bb1a1dad794c6/198_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c56f91b32ed4e306046e2703c900b791","title":"in praise of nothing review iggy pop","story":"Iggy Pop narrates in rhyming verse as the voice of Nothing in this sensationally strange slice of avant-garde pontificatingDescribing itself as “a whistleblowing documentary parody”, this 78-minute whimsical wallop of weirdness is composed of fixed shots – landscapes, people, rooms both empty and full, and all manner of trinkets – filmed by 68 film-makers in 70 countries over nearly a decade, which Serbian director Boris Mitic has stitched together in an editing suite, possibly going mad in the process.

However, in front of the camera, Venice was a different story entirely. Three of the festival’s most anticipated and dissected films were men’s take on matriarchies stories awash with instinctive, vivacious women who for better or worse operate within a female domain.Alfonso Cuarón’s monochrome epic Roma, Yorgos Lanthimos’s ruthless period drama The Favourite and Luca Guadagnino’s controversial remake of Dario Argento’s Suspiria arrived at the Lido just days apart, conjuring glowing reviews, titillating headlines and walkouts from the front row. This hothouse industry may well be offering an artificial coincidence with such a convergence of films championing women in positions of power (the films will be released months apart in the UK). But equally, could this clutch of movies signal a much fought-for change in the cinematic landscape? Or is it merely evidence of a fleeting trend fuelled by political opportunism?The Favourite, as far as its director is concerned at least, has been a passion project for nine years. This account of Queen Anne’s excessive and colourful reign has the smell of Lanthimos all over it, although the shifting dynamic between three women – Olivia Colman’s monarch, Rachel Weisz’s Lady Marlborough and Emma Stone’s social climber Abigail – is a first in his body of work. Lanthimos explains his interest in the story at the festival: “Women are often portrayed as housewives or girlfriends or objects of desire, so we tried in our contribution to show how complicated and complex and wonderful and horrific they are, like every other human being.”Guadagnino’s Suspiria has also been long in the making. The director and his long-time collaborator Tilda Swinton, both dedicated Argento fans, discussed a remake long before 2009’s I Am Love, starring Swinton, came to fruition. Speaking at Venice after a mixture of cheers and heckling at Suspiria’s early-morning press screening, Guadagnino acknowledged that even though the project was once a pipe dream, there is an unavoidable significance to showing a film such as this in the current climate. “It’s interesting from our point of view, as males – European males – to look at the Me Too movement, which is deeply female and American,” he said. “It was a watershed moment, there’s no coming back from it, that has hit our collective consciousness. Suspiria was made before, but I still like to think that our work, this one, the one before and any future one, always comes from a pleasant will of never being in the position of crushing someone else with your power.”A complex film that juxtaposes extreme body horror with broader themes of war and violence, Guadagnino’s Suspiria presents some bold, if occasionally self-destructive messages of female survival by any means necessary. “She kept this school running when women were supposed to keep their minds closed and their uteruses open” is a line used to describe Swinton’s elusive Madame Blanc in the film. “Nineteen seventy seven was a very important time for the feminist revolt, particularly in Europe,” said Guadagnino.“We were very interested in that, given the subject of the film.”Both Suspiria and The Favourite offer more aggressive interpretations of what it means to be part of a matriarchy, where women choose to dominate others. More traditional views instead believe women should be at the helm of a more egalitarian society, following their maternal instincts to create order through respect. The latter prescription is seen in Roma, Cuarón’s arresting character study of a young housemaid, Cleo, and her mistress, set in his native Mexico City in the 1970s.It’s a film drawn from his childhood memories and based on the real people who shaped them – primarily the nanny who brought him up and his mother, both of whom endured sacrifices to maintain order and happiness in their family home. In an era when race and class were the cause of great ides in Mexico, the two women existed as equals, shouldering each other’s struggles and triumphs in a time of hardship. “This film sees all these women as protagonists,” said Cuarón, praising both the film’s subjects and female actors in his appearance at the festival. “It has been made by all these women and the result is thanks to them.”Films of this kind have been making themselves known throughout 2018 Toni Collette will be hard to forget as the head of a tormented household in Ari Aster’s chilling debut Hereditary, while smaller releases such as Xavier Beauvois’s s and Daniel Kokotajlo’s Apostasy draw on the dynamics of women living without men in the contexts of war and religion respectively. Even Incredibles 2 displayed a shift in focus, with mum-of-three Elastigirl stepping up to restore world order while Mr Incredible holds the fort at home. Matriarchal narratives will gain further momentum when Steve McQueen’s Widows, which follows four women bound by the deaths of their criminal husbands, who work together to finish a messy job, goes on release this autumn, with gala showings at the Toronto and London film festivals. Next year, we head to the 1800s for Greta Gerwig’s take on Little Women, with a female cast so stellar that Twitter all but ground to a halt with excitement when the film was officially announced.For now at least, these voices appear to be getting louder. They’re represented across different times, from different countries, and their stories are being released in varied and accessible ways. And they are having some effect: Venice has signed the 5050 x 2020 pledge, joining festivals such as Cannes and Locarno in agreeing to work harder to improve transparency in their film selection processes, in choosing the members of their juries, and ensuring that half of their top management team are female. Hopefully, these women will collaborate to challenge and change the future of representation in film, in ways not previously thought possible.

Sourced everywhere from Zambian forests to Irish meadows and London rooftops, there is a flavour to suit everyoneGot a cough? Then before you pick up an over-the-counter medicine, or head to your GP, try a little honey. Who would have thought that in the 21st century, this folk remedy would become the first line of treatment? But it has. New proposed guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) and Public Health England (PHE) say that there is some limited evidence that honey can help improve cough symptoms.This official thumbs-up for honey is a turn up for the books. These days, the mere mention of “traditional medicine” or “home remedies” provokes knee-jerk howls of “Quackery!”. Yet modern scientific research validating the age-old view that honey has medicinal properties is stacking up. There is data to show that honey helps relieve irritation in the mouth or throat by forming a protective film, and soothes coughs caused by upper respiratory tract infections and alleviates symptoms more than certain common over-the-counter medicines. Honey has a number of other well-documented health benefits, including encouraging faster wound healing and shortening the life of cold sores. New Zealand manuka honey can even inhibit the growth of MRSA, enhance the effectiveness of antibiotics and reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance.One of the interesting things about honey, even the blander types, is that it has a much more characterful, some would say obtrusive, taste than neutral table sugar (sucrose), and this makes it a self-limiting option for most. If I baked a sponge and “iced” it thickly with honey, I’d wager that very few people would be able to eat much of it. Top the same cake with sugary frosting and it would get eaten up much faster. It is actually difficult to overeat honey.The pronounced scents and flavours of honey are one of the reasons why modern food manufacturers use it only in relatively small quantities. They tend to prefer glucose-fructose syrup, an industrial form of sugar, because it behaves more predictably in a factory than quirky honey and costs much less.But if you want to take advantage of honey’s medicinal properties, what is the best type to eat? Honey that is still in the comb fits the bill, but if you prefer your honey without wax, what you want is “raw” honey: one that hasn’t been excessively heated or ultra-filtered to remove valuable “impurities”, such as traces of pollen and propolis, the resin from hives. This way it will retain its medicinally useful micronutrients.Unfortunately, “raw” is a term with no precise legal meaning and honey, just like olive oil, is notorious for food fraud. Both are arguments for buying your raw honey as close to home as possible from accountable sellers who are transparent about where their bees get their nectar – is it from organic, wild, urban or pesticide-treated land? – and who can provide chapter and verse on their extraction methods. If you read the label on the more ubiquitous honey brands, you will see that they generally contain an anonymous mix of honeys from countries in and outside the European Union, blended to give a “consistent”, some might say dully sweet, taste.If you have ever fallen in love with a fragrant, runny honey abroad and brought it home only to find that it solidifies in cool British temperatures, this doesn’t mean your honey has gone “off”. Honey’s shelf life is eternal – ancient Egyptians used it as embalming fluid – but all types of honey crystallise eventually. That said, commercial honeys obtained through higher heat treatment and fine filtering do remain runny for longer. Raw honey, on the other hand, tends to crystallise faster because the minute particles of pollen, propolis and wax encourage crystals to form. Moving the jar to a warm place or sitting it in warm water will restore raw honey to its liquid form without killing off its medicinal benefits.There is a dazzling ersity of good raw honeys out there. As a general guide, chestnut and pine honeys have the strongest scents and flavours, heather sits somewhere in the middle, and acacia and clover come in at the milder end of the spectrum. Twelve honeys were awarded the top three-star rating in the 2018 Great Taste awards. These included pine and smilax aspera (a flowering vine) honey from the Greek village of Agia Paraskevi ivy flower honey from County Limerick multi-floral honey from Exmoor a honey from rooftop hives and gardens in central London and heather honey from high Peak District moorland. Judges tried to put words to the remarkable range of perfumes and tastes: “smoky and treacly” (honey from a Rwandan forest) “sharp, clean, almost grapefruit” (London honey) “earthy liquorice notes” (organic Greek chestnut honey) “evocative of walks in tropical woodlands” (Zambian forest honey from bark hives).Shops and market stalls selling good raw honey usually encourage you to sample, so it is fun to work out your favourite. Raw honey is never cheap, but then a small spoonful of such a precious natural commodity goes a long way – especially, it seems, on a miserable winter night when you can’t stop coughing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e15c8c329b8faabbe59a315debb66465dc522065/0_1903_4039_2423/master/4039.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b56f640139172c7837a247a62c82f57a","title":"joe wicks recipe chicken orzo bake post workout","story":"This healthy post-workout recipe will keep you feeling full for longer – and it tastes great, tooMy rat-a-tat bake is perfect for a family meal or sharing with friends, and I think it’s great for autumn.

The debate is under way from academy to government level and though causes of the problem are easier to identify than solutions, it is not a conversation the Football Association will allow to fall silent.“Our pool is getting smaller and smaller,” Southgate said last week, when, holding his first press conference since the World Cup, he delivered a statistical sting to the positivity generated by England’s run to the semi-finals.Chelsea and Arsenal are lowest on the list with a combined 172 minutes for Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Ross Barkley plus a mere 56 minutes in total for Danny Welbeck and Ainsley Maitland-Niles respectively. Offering the most opportunity so far are Burnley and Bournemouth, the only clubs to have given English players over 2,000 minutes of Premier League football after four matches.Southgate cited “the precarious nature of managers in the top flight” as helping contribute to the decline. Aidy Boothroyd, England’s Under–21 manager, believes an overseas manager’s inclination to look abroad for talent is another factor. Sean Dyche and Eddie Howe, the longest serving managers in the top flight, support both theories.“There has never been a better time to be an England player, whatever age,” says Boothroyd. International honours back him up with England having won the World Cup at under-20 and under-17 level plus the under–19s European Championship last summer. However, there is a “ceiling of development” that Boothroyd fears undoubtedly exists in the Premier League. Lewis Cook and Dominic Calvert-Lewin feature regularly for Bournemouth and Everton respectively but none of England’s Under-20s World Cup-winning team from 2017 have established themselves as a first-team starter.England’s Under-21 manager, who is concerned about Dominic Solanke’s lack of game-time at Liverpool before Thursday’s Euro qualifier against the Netherlands, adds: “In the past you had British managers giving British players a lot of chances to prove they could do it. Now the game is global. I look at my old club Watford, and it is a completely different club to the one that I was at. Foreign owners and foreign managers might perhaps look abroad before looking at what is under their nose although, ironically, the best ones tend to pick our players, so there must be something in that.”But what is the solution? “We have tried the quota one, haven’t we?” Boothroyd replies. “I really don’t have the answer. It is at a different level to where I am and I am happy on the pitch picking the best players. Young players now are thinking of playing abroad first. I admire that for many reasons, I think it is great they want to learn different languages and experience different cultures and different ways of playing, but the fact they have got to go abroad to play is a real red flag for the authorities. They will be thinking: “Hang on a minute, why is that happening?’ But I’m afraid I don’t have the answer.”Quotas could increase with Brexit, which has the potential for conflict between the FA and Premier League and may fulfil Southgate’s wish for the debate over homegrown talent to continue if nothing else.The Premier League has asked the government to clarify whether it will be exempt from restrictions on European workers after Brexit. With only six months to go, it is still awaiting an answer. The Premier League’s post-Brexit proposals will require FA support. That could be the FA’s opportunity to insist on an increase to the current quota of eight homegrown players in a 25-man squad.For Jürgen Klopp, the anti-Brexit Liverpool manager, the issue facing English players and the game’s authorities is the quality and competitiveness of the Premier League, a competition that has thrived globally due to access to the world’s finest talent. Trent Alexander-Arnold, Joe Gomez and Jordan Henderson demonstrate opportunity exists at Liverpool – and support Boothroyd’s point about the best foreign managers looking under their noses – while Adam Lallana and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain would have increased the club’s England contingent but for injury.“If a German international moves to the Premier League he probably doesn’t start as often as he did before,” says Klopp. “It happens in other countries too. Emre Can didn’t start so far for Juve. Will he be a starter? I have no solution because I didn’t think about it in terms of English football, to be honest, but how I see it is that English football in their development with the young boys is in a really good way.At Chelsea, Maurizio Sarri concurs. “I was asked the same question in Italy: why is it so difficult for Italian players to play at the big clubs in Italy?” he says. “I think it’s normal. It’s difficult to play here, difficult to play in Juventus, because in this club there are 27 or 28 great players. It’s difficult.”The difficulties have prompted English players to join Borussia Dortmund, Borussia Mönchengladbach, Hoffenheim, RB Leipzig and Wolfsburg in recent months. According to one Premier League academy director, the trend is also happening at junior level and will only accelerate post-Brexit.“The talent is there, it is just about being given an opportunity,” maintains James Maddison, who has flourished on his introduction to the Premier League with Leicester City. “I’m not sure what we can do to combat the problem but the talent is there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26a05bf9fd44778f00825c6cec701f924ce0f298/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b876306c899a18ecd44d836382d3208","title":"international football and nations league 10 things to look out for","story":"Leroy Sané can play himself back into the Germany side, Luke Shaw has a chance to impress while Argentina must attempt to move on from Lionel MessiThere are three new faces in Germany’s squad, with Joachim Löw freshening up the group by picking Bayer Leverkusen’s Kai Havertz, Hoffenheim’s Nico Schulz and PSG’s Thilo Kehrer. Yet after Germany’s calamitous performance at the World Cup, when they suffered a first-round exit for the first time since 1938, Löw’s most interesting call is deciding to give Leroy Sané another chance. The manager’s decision not to take the Manchester City winger to Russia ided opinion, with one camp arguing Sané did not fit into Löw’s system and the other pointing out how that reflected poorly on the team’s style, and it looked an even stranger call once Germany, playing plodding football, had lost their opening game to Mexico’s speedsters. Yet time is on the 22-year-old’s side and he has a chance to show he can have an influence when Germany host France in their Nations League opener. Benjamin Pavard, who excelled at right-back as France became world champions, should provide Sané with a stern test. JS• Kroos questions Sané’s attitude as Germany regroupFour years ago Luke Shaw seemed certain to become England’s first choice left-back. Ashley Cole was on the way down after an excellent international career and Shaw, who was Leighton Baines’s understudy at the 2014 World Cup, looked ready to step up after joining Manchester United from Southampton, only for a broken leg to check his progress. It has been a tough recovery process, meaning that there was no controversy when Gareth Southgate chose not to take him to Russia this summer, and there have been times when he appeared to have no future at United under José Mourinho. Yet Shaw’s England recall is proof that hard work tends to pay off. He has looked sharper both from a physical and mental perspective, and it will be fascinating to see how he copes if Southgate starts him when Spain visit Wembley on Saturday. JSRicharlison has had a busy start to his Everton career. The £40m winger began in a hurry, scoring in the draw with Wolves and the win over Southampton, but then ruined his good work by picking up a silly red card against Bournemouth last weekend. Marco Silva, Everton’s manager, was not happy with the way Richarlison lost his cool during a spat with Adam Smith. “He\u0027s a boy, he has to learn,” Silva said. “It\u0027s a daft moment for him and for us but he has to learn fast.” But that moment of madness did not stop Brazil from calling up the 21-year-old for the first time for the friendlies against USA and El Salvador. There will be no better education for Richarlison than a few training sessions with the Seleção’s attacking talents. JSThe Republic of Ireland kick off their Nations League campaign against Wales in Cardiff on Thursday, before travelling to Poland for a friendly in Wroclaw on Monday. It is worrying that Martin O\u0027Neill\u0027s 26-man squad is more remarkable for who has been left out, rather than who has been included. The West Ham defender Declan Rice has asked for more time to consider his international options before nailing his colours to any particular mast, Cardiff midfielder Harry Arter appears to have stood himself down for the foreseeable future following a row with Roy Keane, while Shane Long is out through injury. Of the six Premier League players in the squad, Everton’s Seamus Coleman is by far and away the most high profile. While Rice looks likely to declare for England, who are welcome to him, the indefinite absence of Arter would be a massive loss to a midfield in need of his experience, intensity and industry. The decision to offer new contracts to O\u0027Neill and Keane just before their squad came up short in qualifying for Russia 2018 was greeted with raised eyebrows. While qualifying for Euro 2020 doesn\u0027t begin until March, bad performances in Wales and Poland will do little to increase public approval of a management duo many consider to be past their sell-by date. BGCristiano Ronaldo is selfish and I\u0027d never want him in my team. He is the kind of player that thinks \u0027no matter if we lose, the only thing that matters is that I score a goal!’ Modric, on the other hand, is a brilliant person and always willing to help others, starting with his teammates.The context to Croatia manager Zlatko Dalic’s comments this week come in the wake of Luka Modric beating the Portuguese to the Uefa Men’s Player of the Year award. Of course, Dalic’s claim that he would not pick Ronaldo is petty and false, particularly with Nikola Kalinic still absent from the squad after his World Cup tantrum and now that Mario Mandzukic has retired from international football, but it certainly adds spice to arguably the pick of the international friendlies this week. MB• Confusion greets Nations League as Uefa hopes to revive internationalsLionel Scaloni, Argentina’s new manager, does not know whether Lionel Messi will play international football again. Messi struggled to hide his discomfort during the World Cup, to the point where he seemed to be experiencing an existential crisis during the anthems before the defeat to Croatia, and the euphoria of his stunning goal in the win over Nigeria did not last long. France exposed Argentina’s flaws in the second round and it came as no surprise to see Messi left out for the friendlies against Guatemala and Colombia. Perhaps it is time for both parties to move on, even though Messi remains the best player in the world. Scaloni has also dropped Sergio Agüero and Gonzalo Higuaín and that could create space for Paulo Dybala. Jorge Sampaoli barely used Dybala at the World Cup, but perhaps the Juventus forward can be the man to lead a new generation in Messi’s absence. JSWhen Radja Nainggolan made his move from Roma to Internazionale this summer, many were surprised at the transfer fee – £33m felt on the low side for one of the league’s best midfielders joining a Serie A rival. But hidden in the deal was Nicolò Zaniolo going the other way in a swap deal, and the 19-year-old this week became only the fourth player to ever be called up to Italy’s national squad without making a Serie A appearance. The last player to achieve this? Marco Verratti in 2012, which goes some way to explaining the potential many in Italy think Zaniolo has. The 6ft 3in central midfielder will almost certainly not make an appearance against Poland on Friday or Portugal next Monday but he is very much seen as integral to Italy’s (and Roma’s) future, and will certainly hope to make an impression on the new manager, Roberto Mancini, who has reportedly been blasting Queen, Miley Cyrus, The Rolling Stones, and The Killers out on the training pitches this week. MBHaving given t\u0027job t\u0027Giggsy following the departure of Chris Coleman, Wales face a familiar foe in their first competitive fixture under the new regime. The Republic of Ireland scuppered Welsh hopes of qualifying for the World Cup by beating them in Cardiff and now pitch up for a rematch, albeit with considerably less at stake. Despite a wretched season at Everton last term, Ashley Williams has kept his place in the squad. Described by Giggs as a fantastic leader on and off the pitch, Williams will retain the captaincy. Should he bring his hideous club form to his country\u0027s matches against the Irish and whatever side Denmark put out in the wake of their player dispute, a colossus who owes his country nothing could find his international career coming to an abrupt end. On the flip side, his return to an environment where he obviously feels comfortable could be a welcome distraction. BG• Giggs prepares Wales for Danish unknowns after Ireland testConsidering their woeful recent record in qualifying for major tournaments, the Nations League is a Get Out of Jail card that Scotland should cherish. Following Friday\u0027s friendly with Belgium, they travel to Albania for a tricky opener that their manager Alex McLeish has already – perhaps unwisely – described as must win. In Kieran Tierney, Andy Robertson and Tom Cairney, Scotland have some serious talent in their squad, while the in-form duo of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Swansea striker Oli McBurnie also provide reasons fto be cheerful. Liverpool full-back Robertson has been handed the captaincy and it is to be hoped the rise in status he has enjoyed since signing for Liverpool helps inspire those around him in what, on paper, looks a decent Scotland squad. Whether or not their famously conservative manager is prepared to let them play to their strengths remains to be seen, but the next two games ought to provide no shortage of clues. BGNorthern Ireland have enjoyed a fine time of it of late, but as the cycle begins for another qualification campaign, some of their squad is ageing and horribly out of match practice. Aaron Hughes, 39, remains a big presence in the squad, Steven Davis has made just one appearance this season and 38-year-old Gareth McAuley only signed for Rangers earlier this week having spent the summer unattached. How Northern Ireland contend with Bosnia’s Miralem Pjanic and Edin Dzeko in ther Nations League match on Saturday remains to be seen, but with Michael O’Neill picking the same players, there doesn’t appear to be a wealth of talent ready to come through and replace the older generation.

They’re then on you all the time about ‘Why is he playing?’, ‘Why is he not playing?’ They’re on at you every day. If the player then has an attitude issue and we go and complain they say: ‘Get on with it, you’re not sending him back, you’ve agreed a contract, pay his wages.’”Forthright opinions, such as the one above, are hardly unusual for MacAnthony, but the Peterborough United chairman is not alone in being disgruntled with football’s loan system. This summer, EFL clubs struck a total of 254 loan deals, making up about one in seven of all players in the Football League. Last season, over the course of the year, 458 temporary arrangements were made. It is a crucial process within the English football pyramid but after the loan window came to an end last week smaller clubs are increasingly asking whether the system is working for them.The case for loans is straightforward and urgently made: young English players need to play competitive men’s football. There is a consensus that club academies (at least those in category one and largely affiliated to Premier League clubs) are producing players able to flourish at the highest level. They need practice, however, to achieve their potential. This is something not only the Football Association and Premier League agree on, but the EFL, too. For the loaning clubs’ part, they get access to players whose talents ought to be above a level they could acquire permanently. The debate, however, is on how best to give players experience and whether arrangements made are fair to all parties.MacAnthony’s complaints are felt by many clubs but are only part of the problem. Increasingly, loan deals not only include an upfront fee and a share of the player’s wages being paid by the loan club but also include sanctions should the player either fail to play regularly or appear in something other than his favoured position. Liverpool is one club that pursues such measures, especially with coveted young talents such as Ben Woodburn now at Sheffield United for the season. This is necessary, parent clubs argue, as they are unable to insist contractually that their players get game time (this would be seen as undue influence over another club). They also argue that each deal is arranged on its own merits, and more punitive clauses reflect the level of demand for a player. For those clubs trying to recruit, especially lower down the pyramid however, it is sometimes difficult to see where their leverage comes in such an arrangement.Tranmere Rovers have struck six loan deals this summer. According to the League Two club’s chairman, the former FA chief executive Mark Palios, the role lower-league clubs play in developing players remains vital. “The ability to play proper football in front of a paying crowd is missing at the top end of the game,” he says of the situation for younger players. “Proper use of experience in the football pyramid is essential and beneficial if managed properly. Not many others have a pyramid like ours and we’re fans of using it.”While Palios sees the greater good of the loan system, the list of complications are just as clear “Loans where a club insists the player plays are wrong from every point of view,” he says. “It’s wrong for the player – they have to earn their place as part of a learning process. For the club, it damages the dynamic in dressing room. Finally, from a fan’s perspective, there’s a sense that you’re basically relinquishing your independence if loanees are going to play come what\u0026nbspmay.”Palios says Tranmere don’t do such deals but have made arrangements whereby the loan club would pay a higher percentage of the player’s wages if he doesn’t play. He believes the game is not yet at a stage where parent clubs hold undue influence over those lower down the pyramid. “Nobody forces you to take a loan player every club is entitled to do what it wants and what fits within its budget,” he says, but he acknowledges that the landscape is changing. “I think you can find clubs become dependent on it,” he says. “It’s hard to put a finger on it but you lose that sense of identity, that willingness to play for the club.”If lower-league sides are integral to the development of young players, the argument that they should not be penalised for doing so is growing in volume. Whereas the chairman of Peterborough’s League One rivals Bradford City, Edin Rahic, has recently said he would be in favour of transforming lower-league teams into feeder clubs for the top flight, others such as MacAnthony argue for imposing limits on loan fees. The EFL’s chief executive, Shaun Harvey, is sympathetic to the latter idea. “I think the Championship is a different beast to League One and League Two,” he says. “Some Championship sides are taking players in order to try to reach the Premier League. In Leagues One and Two it’s much more about development. I think if I could carve out some position where players went to those leagues on terms that were generally agreed to be acceptable, I think that would be a step forward.”Crystal Palace recently wrote to League One, Two and National League clubs offering to loan their players for free – the proviso being that the players have to play if they are not in the team a proportion of their wages must be covered. The EFL is believed to have encouraged other clubs to follow Palace’s lead. There remains, however, the possibility that lowering the cost of loans will only further ingrain the system whereby lower-league clubs act as a finishing school for big club talent, rather than developing their own. “It’s always their way or the highway”, says MacAnthony ruefully. “I think that’s something we need to change\u0026nbspmassively.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa491438e1ccb6eae93d5a1147c5f552d74b5e35/0_245_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d2a037d6000ecb9ae06ba70554dfccc","title":"britain pledges 46m landmines global casualties rise penny mordaunt","story":"Penny Mordaunt announces extra funding for radar detectors and other tech as deaths and injuries reach 10-year high The British government will release an additional £46m in UK aid to the global fight against land mines, amid evidence that mine casualties, which had been declining, are rising once again.The funding, the second tranche of an existing £100m commitment, was announced by the international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, and is aimed at protecting an additional 820,000 people from the threat of land mines across Africa and Asia.The programme will support the deployment of UK-funded technology, including radar detectors, designed to identify unexploded munitions in an area the equivalent of more than 16,000 football pitches. The devices used will include remote-controlled machines such as the the eight-tonne, Newcastle-built MineWolf, which can clear up to 12,000 square metres a day in the most high-risk environments.The UK funding is also intended to support the training of all-female demining teams, in areas where many of the men have died in conflict.Hundreds of women from impoverished communities are being empowered through skills training to perform landmine clearance, and to work as vehicle mechanics and paramedic first-aiders to protect their communities.Announcing the new funding, Mordaunt said: “The crippling legacy of fear, mutilation and devastation, which landmines leave, must be wiped out for good.“UK expertise and innovation are helping to shield vulnerable people from these barbaric relics and liberating land contaminated by these devices. This will allow the poorest people to grow crops, walk their children to school without fear and ultimately give them back control over their lives.”British support will also help to educate a further 280,000 men, women and children about the dangers of land mines, an essential lifeline to safeguard communities from mutilation or death.The global battle against land mines, which the late Princess Diana brought to public attention through her campaigning, has long been seen as an international success story. But gains in the battle against mines have been pushed back, not least by the semi-industrial production of homemade mines by groups like Isis in Syria and Iraq.Among the nine countries to receive the additional funding will be Angola, where, more than 20 years ago, Princess Diana’s iconic walk through a landmine-littered field drew attention to the issue.The funds will also help demining efforts in Laos where, more than 40 years since the Vietnam conflict ended, landmine casualty rates are among the highest in the world. South Sudan, where civil conflict has led to widespread contamination with mines and cluster bombs, will also benefit.Noting the recent spike in land mine casualties Jane Cocking, chief executive of the Mines Advisory Group, said: “Global deaths and injuries from landmines have hit a 10-year high. Today, one person every hour is killed by a landmine and almost half are children.“These new funds will help us to rid some of the world’s most conflict-affected countries of landmines, cluster munitions and other unexploded weapons at a crucial time, impacting the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.”James Cowan, head of the Halo Trust, a demining charity with which the Mines Advisory Group will participate in the programme, said: “The Halo Trust was founded exactly 30 years ago to free the world from the scourge of landmines for good. Today’s announcement moves us closer to that day.“Mine clearance is the very first step in creating stability, development and ultimately self-reliance for people whose lives continue to be blighted by conflicts long after they end. Thanks to British taxpayers, these people will now be able to live, learn and cultivate in safety.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba16a375a34236d27876a5d55fdb9bb2a60ef5ed/0_568_2313_1388/master/2313.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e340e5e7e6f7928089614632cf6b8472","title":"good pub guide 2019 pubs urged to keep food simple","story":"Latest Good Pub Guide says drinkers put off by baffling, ‘pretentious’ menus at pubsBritain’s pubs are being urged to “ditch the fancy food” and stick to meals such as ploughman’s lunches and bangers and mash. The Good Pub Guide 2019 said pretentious and inaccessible menus were a turn-off for pub-goers. The 37th edition of the guide, published on Thursday, features more than 5,000 pubs on the basis of people’s recommendations, backed up by editor visits and inspections. In addition to official reviews there are online listings for another 40,000 pubs across the UK.Contributors generally welcomed the rise in culinary standards over the past decade, which in many cases saved pubs from closure, but feared it could have backfired, with overambitious menus featuring unrecognisable ingredients.The guide said: “Pubs and good food now go hand in hand, but many chefs appear to have gone Masterchef-mad. We really aren’t interested in eating kabsa, katsuobushi, matbucha, succotash, tataki or verjus in a pub. We don’t want our dishes adorned with carrot fluff, edible sand or fish ‘foam’. Leave that to the swanky restaurants. We want good, honest pub grub.”Picking up the award for value pub of the year is the Old Castle in Bridgnorth, Shropshire. In 12 years as landlord, Bryn Masterman has built up a reputation for homemade classics such as fish pie, steak pie and roasted lamb shank.“We pride ourselves on our range of hearty, homemade, food made from quality local ingredients,” Masterman said. “Probably the bravest thing we did was to serve real horse steaks just after the horsemeat scandal. Our customers really enjoyed them.”Fiona Stapley, the guide’s editor, said: “In the 37 years of the Good Pub Guide’s existence, fancy food fads have come and gone, but what always stands fast is honest cooking using tip-top local, seasonal, ingredients, but ones that we can all recognise.”Elizabeth Carter, consultant editor of the Good Food Guide, said she was no fan of “pretentious lists of ingredients devoid of prepositions, participles or conjunctions that you have to ask waiting staff to explain, for ‘beef, sprouts, coffee’ only invites puzzlement and a battalion of questions. After all, it’s the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary.”The guide awarded top spot to the Cornish seafood restaurant Nathan Outlaw for the second year running, after it notched up a perfect cooking score of 10 for the third year in a row.Clare Smyth\u0027s West London restaurant Core entered the top 10 at number three – the highest new entry in the guide’s history – and received a score of 10, behind Simon Rogan\u0027s L\u0027Enclume in Cumbria.Elsewhere in the Good Pub Guide, a village pub – The Cock in Hemingford Grey, Cambridgeshire –which sells real ale and 20 different wines, with a “bustling” atmosphere, has been named pub of the year for the second time. The pub  also sells local cider, has a bar just for drinkers, wood-burning stoves and a busy separate restaurant.The pub guide also crowned its first gin pub of the year, The Cholmondeley Arms, in Cheshire, which stocks 365 different gins.

Fuh You was made in collaboration with Ryan Tedder, a songwriter-for-hire best known for writing Leona Lewis’s Bleeding Love and Beyoncé’s Halo. A chart fixture throughout the 70s and 80s, McCartney last had a Top 10 single 31 years ago – unless you count his supporting role on Rihanna’s Fourfiveseconds, when his voice was sped up and drowned out by Kanye West. He sought out Tedder, he explained with admirable candour, in pursuit of “a hit”. During the sessions for the track, however, McCartney became concerned: “I’ve been involved with songs that have meaning, and this doesn’t amount to anything,” he protested. “Y’know, I wrote Eleanor Rigby.”The track in question rather makes you wish he’d paid attention to his haughty inner voice. It is a less traumatic experience for the listener than Mick Jagger’s recent collaboration with Skepta, but there is still something depressing about a Paul McCartney song that sounds as if it was assembled on a latterday pop production line. Not least because it doesn’t sound like the kind of undeniable smash that latterday pop production lines occasionally come up with, but the stuff they palm off to pad out albums. The best thing about it might be its Beatle nerd-appeasing title, with its reference to the obscure Apple-released single King of Fuh by Brute Force.It’s the latest in a series of ungainly lunges for contemporaneity on McCartney’s part. On his last album before this one, New (2013), for example, he hooked up with Mark Ronson to peddle a bit of thumpy post-Mumford faux-folk called Everybody Out There. You can understand where the drive for this kind of thing comes from: if you had spent your 20s at the absolute nexus of pop culture, everything shifting and changing in the wake of whatever you chose to do, you too might long to be at the centre once more. But it feels unnecessary. What we might call Paul McCartney’s classic style is a fundamental part of pop music’s DNA. Half a century after his creative zenith, its echoes are still everywhere and one suspects they always will be. He doesn’t need to strive for contemporaneity in order to sound contemporary.It’s a point borne out by Egypt Station, which is at its best when it finds new ways for McCartney to be as McCartneyesque as possible. Opener I Don’t Know shows his extraordinary melodic facility is completely intact – the tune is impossibly sumptuous – and taps into a strain of darkness in his writing that is often disregarded, overshadowed as it was by John Lennon’s front-and-centre angst, and then buried beneath the chipper Fab Macca image. This is the distracted, haunted McCartney heard on Fixing a Hole or Waterfalls or, more recently, on Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, by some distance his best 00s album.Despite Repeated Warnings is an alternately racked and vaguely optimistic response to the rise of Donald Trump. That and Hunt You DownNakedC-Link both show his penchant for episodic songwriting, complete with sudden shifts in tempo and mood, and have caused excitable voices to start evoking A Day in the Life and side two of Abbey Road. Despite Repeated Warnings does have a hint of the former – the bit where it dramatically accelerates is powered by a similar bass pulse, an old trick that still works to heart-quickening effect – but let’s calm down a little. These two songs are better compared with Wings’ still-excellent Band on the Run, or the 11-minute medley that concludes 1973’s Red Rose Speedway. Still, listening to them, you’re struck by how good McCartney is at this kind of thing, how well each element fits, how it never sounds fragmentary or patched together.The state of McCartney’s voice in recent years has caused some consternation, but its audibly aged, slightly quavering quality works here, adding an affecting dying-of-the-light edge to Confidante’s acoustic saga of regret and friendship lost, and a sense of hard-won experience to Happy With You. A man who once literally wrote a love song to marijuana – Got to Get You Into My Life – here renounces the weed in favour of the beauty of nature and companionship.Egypt Station is not without flaws. Quite aside from the misstep of Fuh You, it could use a trim – the world could probably have struggled on somehow without hearing the inconsequential Back in Brazil for a start. Which points to another longstanding issue with McCartney’s latterday output: who among his young collaborators is going to tell the guy who wrote Eleanor Rigby that a couple of his songs aren’t up to much? At its best, however, Egypt Station is an affirmation of an enduring talent, the work of an artist who has no need to try and be anything other than what he is.Big Red Machine – HymnosticThe collaborative album by Justin Vernon and The National’s Aaron Dessner is a beautifully balanced mix of the traditional and the out-there: here a Band-like song emerges from static and distorted human beatboxing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d893c793f8e699e8a2f0f6c600f98460ff8943a/0_17_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19b2e8799dd57032a4b74f095a6ae217","title":"human impulses run riot chinas shocking pace of change","story":"Thirty years ago, politics was paramount. Now, only money counts. China’s leading novelist examines a nation that has transformed in a single lifetime. By  Yu HuaWhen I try to describe how China has changed over the past 50 years, countless roads appear in front of me. Given the sheer immensity of these changes, all I can do is try first to follow a couple of main roads, and then a few smaller ones, to see where they take us.My first main road begins in the past. In my 58 years, I have experienced three dramatic changes, and each one has been accompanied by a surge in suicides among officials. The first time was during Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution, which began in 1966. At the start of that period, many members of the Chinese Communist party woke up one day to find they had been purged: overnight they had become “power-holders taking the capitalist road”. After suffering every kind of psychological and physical abuse, some chose to take their own lives. In the small town in south China where I grew up, some hanged themselves or swallowed insecticide, while others threw themselves down wells: wells in south China have narrow mouths, and if you e into one headfirst, there is no way you will come out alive.In the early stages of the Cultural Revolution, many people from the lowest tiers of society formed their own mass organisations, proclaiming themselves commanders of a “Cultural Revolution headquarters”. These iniduals – rebels, they were called – often went on to secure official positions of one kind or another. They enjoyed only a brief career, however. Following Mao’s death in 1976, the subsequent end of the Cultural Revolution and the emergence of the reform-minded Deng Xiaoping as China’s new leader, some rebels believed they would suffer just as much as the officials they had tormented a few years before.Thus came the second surge in suicides – this time of officials who had clawed their way to power as revolutionary radicals. One official in my little town drowned himself in the sea: he smoked a lot of cigarettes first, and the stubs littering the shore marked the agony of indecision that preceded his death. This was a much smaller surge in suicides than the first one, because Deng was not out for political revenge, focusing instead on kickstarting economic reforms and opening up to the west. This policy led in turn to China’s economic miracle, the downside of which has been environmental pollution, growing inequality and pervasive corruption.In late 2012 came the third dramatic change in my lifetime, when China entered the era of Xi Jinping. No sooner did Xi become general secretary of the Communist party than our new leader launched an anti-corruption drive, the scale and force of which took almost everyone by surprise. The third surge in suicides followed. When officials who had stuffed their pockets during China’s breakneck economic rise discovered they were being investigated and realised they could not wriggle free, some put an end to things by suicide. In cases involving lower-ranking officials who were under investigation but had not yet been taken into custody, the government explanation was that their suicides were triggered by depression. But, if a high-ranking official took his own life, a harsher judgment was passed. On 23 November 2017, after Zhang Yang, a general, hanged himself in his own home, the People’s Liberation Army Daily reported that he “had evaded party discipline and the laws of the nation” and described his suicide as “a disgraceful action”.These three surges in suicide demonstrate the failure and impotence of legal institutions in China. The public security organs, prosecutorial agencies and courts all stopped functioning at the start of the Cultural Revolution thereafter, laws existed only in name. Since Mao’s death, a robust legal system has never truly been established and, today, law’s failure manifests itself in two ways. First, the law is strong only on paper: in practice, law tends to be subservient to the power that officials wield. Second, when officials realise they are being investigated and know their position won’t save them, some will choose to die rather than submit to legal sanctions, for officials who believe in power don’t believe in law.These two points, seemingly at odds, are actually two sides of the same coin. The difference between the three surges in suicide is this: the first two were outcomes of a political struggle framed by the start and the end of the Cultural Revolution. The third, by contrast, stems from the blight of corruption that has accompanied 30 years of rapid economic development. Some argue, of course, that the anti-corruption campaign is conducted selectively, with the goal of purging Xi Jinping’s political opponents. But the underlying problem is: how many officials are there today who are truly clean? A few years ago, an official from China’s prosecutorial agencies put it to me this way: “If you were to stick all of today’s officials in a line and shoot every one of them, that would be unfair to some. But a lot would slip through the net if you only shot every other one.”When I turn onto the second main road that stretches from the China of my childhood to the present day, what I see before me is the declining importance of the family and the growing importance of inidualism. In Mao’s China, the inidual could find no fulfilment in ordinary social life. If one wanted to express a personal aspiration, the only way to do so was to throw oneself into a collective movement such as the Great Leap Forward or the Cultural Revolution. Mind you, in those grand campaigns, the inidual’s aspirations had to conform entirely to whatever the “correct” political line happened to be at that moment – the slightest deviation would cause disaster.To use an analogy current at the time, each of us was a little drop of water, gathered into the great flood of socialism. But it wasn’t so easy to be that drop of water. In my town, there was a Cultural Revolution activist who would almost every day be at the forefront of some demonstration or other, often being first to raise his fist and shout “Down with Liu Shaoqi!” (Liu, nominally the head of state, had just been purged.) One day, however, he inadvertently misspoke, shouting “Down with Mao Zedong!” instead. Within seconds he had been thrown to the ground by the “revolutionary masses”, and thus he began a wretched phase in life, denounced and beaten at every turn.In that era, the inidual could find space only in the context of family life – any independent leanings could only be expressed at home. That is why family values were so important to Chinese people then, and why marital infidelity was seen as so intolerable. If you were caught having an extramarital affair, the social morality of the day meant that you would be subjected to all kinds of humiliation: you might be paraded through the streets with half your hair shaved off or packed off to prison.During the Cultural Revolution, there were certainly cases of husbands and wives denouncing each other and fathers and sons falling out, but these were not typical – the vast majority of families enjoyed unprecedented solidarity. A friend of mine told me her father had been a professor at the start of the Cultural Revolution, while her mother was a housewife. Her father, born to a landlord’s family, became the target of attacks, but her mother, from a humbler background, was placed among the revolutionary ranks. Pressed by the radicals to orce her father, her mother outright refused – and not only that: every time her father was hauled off to a denunciation session, she would make a point of sitting in the front row and, if she saw someone beating her husband, she would rush over and start hitting back. Such brawls might leave her bruised and bleeding, but she would sit back down proudly in the front row, and the radicals lost their nerve and gave up beating her husband. After the Cultural Revolution ended, my friend’s father told her, with tears in his eyes, that had it not been for her mother he might well have taken his own life. There are many such stories.After Mao’s death, the economic reforms under Deng Xiaoping brought dramatic changes to China, changes that permeated all levels of Chinese society. In a matter of 30 years, we went from one extreme to another, from an era where human nature was suppressed to an era where human impulses could run riot, from an era when politics was paramount to an era when only money counts.Before, limited by social constraints, people could feel a modicum of freedom only within the family with the loss of those constraints, that modest freedom which was once so prized now counts for little. Extramarital affairs have become more and more widespread and are no longer a cause for shame. It is commonplace for successful men to keep a mistress, or sometimes multiple mistresses – which people often jokingly compare to a teapot needing at least four or five cups to make a full tea set. In one case I know of, a wealthy businessman bought all 10 flats in the wing of an apartment complex. He installed his legally recognised wife in one flat, and his nine legally unrecognised mistresses in the other flats, one above the other, so that he could select at his pleasure and convenience on which floor of the building he would spend the night.Having taken a couple of main roads that trace China’s journey over the past half-century, it is time to travel down some smaller ones. The first begins with Buddhist temples. During the Cultural Revolution, temples were closed down and some suffered serious damage. In my little town, Red Guards knocked off the heads and arms of every Buddhist sculpture in the local temples, which were then converted into storehouses. Afterwards, the damaged temples were restored and they all reopened, typically with two round bronze incense burners in front of the main hall: the first to invoke blessings for wealth, the second to invoke blessings for security.When I visited temples in the 1980s, in the first censer I would often see a huge assembly of joss sticks, blazing away furiously, while in the second, a paltry handful would be smoking feebly. In those days China was still very poor, and, as most people saw it, when you didn’t have money, being safe didn’t amount to much. Now China is rich, and when you go into a temple you see joss sticks burning just as brightly in the security censer as in the wealth one – it is when you are rich that security acquires particular importance.In China today, Buddhist temples are crowded with worshippers, while Taoist temples are largely deserted. A few years ago, I asked a Taoist abbot: “Taoism is native to China, so why is it not as popular as Buddhism, which came here from abroad?” His answer was short: “Buddhism has money and Taoism doesn’t.”His explanation, although it rather took me aback, expresses a truth about Chinese society: money, or material interest, has become the main motivating force. In the 1980s, there was a series of student protests in China, culminating in the Tiananmen demonstrations of 1989, when not just students but city dwellers all across the country joined the rallies. Back then, the demonstrations were largely motivated by concern for the fate of the nation and a desire to see democratic freedoms put in place. Today, people still demonstrate, but on a very small scale, and these demonstrations – “mass incidents” in official parlance – are completely different from the protests in the 1980s. Protests today are not geared towards transforming society – they are simply designed to protect the material interests of the group involved.A few years ago, in the eastern province of Jiangsu, the education authorities announced that universities would be reserving more places for students from poor areas in west China. This triggered an uproar among the parents of Jiangsu high-school students preparing for the university entrance examination. Concerned that this new policy would reduce their children’s chances of getting into university, they marched in the streets to protest. Something similar happened a few years ago in Shanghai, when retirees took to the streets, worried that if welfare funds were allocated to poor areas, their own retirement benefits would be slashed.These constant “mass incidents”, I should point out, reflect real issues. In recent years, for instance, many retired military veterans have gathered together across the country in protests against the stingy benefits and pensions they receive from the state. Back in the 1980s, they argue, veterans used to be more generously rewarded, relative to the cost of living. Today, even though China is richer, they receive little. Unsurprisingly, veterans feel shortchanged and disrespected.Other mass incidents, such as the widespread demonstrations by truck drivers in June, have been sparked by the fierce economic competition that now characterises life in China. In numerous industries, it has become common practice to try to secure more business by pushing down prices as low as they can possibly go. I was struck by this new reality a few years ago, at the end of a trip I had taken to South Africa for the World Cup. At the airport, I bought a vuvuzela in the airport as a souvenir, paying more than 100 yuan (£11). It was only when I got back to Beijing that I realised it was made in China. At the start, Chinese manufacturers had set their factory price at over five yuan a piece, but they soon found themselves being underbid. Some factories ultimately set their price as low as 2.2 yuan, when the production cost was 2 yuan per unit. The result of all this ferocious competition is that the profit margin keeps getting slimmer and slimmer, and those who suffer most are ordinary workers, who often see no increase in their salary even as their work hours are extended.Now I need to take two other roads – the road of innovation and the road of nostalgia. Innovation first. Given the speed at which new technologies become dominant, you sometimes feel that there is no gap at all between new and old. Take mobile payments: in the space of just a few years, Alibaba’s Alipay mobile app and Tencent’s WeChat Pay app have been loaded on to practically every smartphone in the country. From big shopping malls to little corner shops – any place where a transaction can be made will have the scannable QR codes for these two payment platforms displayed in a prominent location. People just need to take their phone out of their pocket, do a quick scan and the payment is made. Even Chinese beggars have to keep up with the times: sometimes they too have a QR code handy, and they will ask passersby to scan it and use the mobile payment platform to dispense some spare change.I recently went for more than a year without using cash or a credit card, because it is just so convenient to pay by phone instead. This July, though, when my English translator came to Beijing and my wife and I took him out for dinner, I went to scan the restaurant’s QR code but the transaction failed to go through. Instead of trying a second time, I suddenly felt an urge to pay in cash. When I pulled some banknotes out of my pocket, handed them to the cashier and received change in return, I felt a pleasant tingle of novelty.This novelty is all the more remarkable given that just 30 years ago, when Chinese people went on business trips, they would worry so much about their money being stolen that they would hide cash in their underpants, the safest place for it. They would have a little pocket sewn on the inside, with a button for extra security. When a bill needed to be paid they would reach a hand into their underwear, grope around a bit, and pull out the requisite five-mao or one-yuan note, distinguishable by feel because one was smaller than the other. Women would withdraw to a secluded spot to retrieve their cash, but some men would have no such inhibitions and would rummage about in their underpants quite unabashedly.When I turn to the road of nostalgia, I think of how my home county of Haiyan has transformed. When I was a boy, Haiyan had a total population of 300,000, with only 8,000 living in the county town itself. Now, the county has a population of 380,000, of whom 100,000 live in the county seat. Urbanisation has created a lot of problems, one of them being what happens after farmers move to cities. Local governments have expropriated large swathes of agricultural land to enable an enormous urban expansion program: some of the land is allocated to industry in order to attract investment, build factories and boost government revenues, but most of it is sold off at a high price to real-estate developers. The result is that high-rise apartment buildings now sprout in profusion where once only crops grew. After their land and houses in the countryside are expropriated, farmers “move upstairs” into housing blocks that the local government has provided in compensation. In wealthy counties, some farmers may be awarded up to three or four apartments, in which case they will live in one and rent out the other two or three others may receive a large cash settlement.But the questions then become: how do they adjust to city life? Now disconnected from the form of labour to which they were accustomed, what new jobs are there for them to do? Some drive taxis and some open little shops, but others just loaf around, playing mahjong all day, and others take to gambling and lose everything they have. Every time a community of dispossessed farmers settles into a new housing project, gambling operations will follow them there, because some of the residents will be flush with cash after the government payouts. In China, it is forbidden to open gambling establishments, but this doesn’t stop unlicensed operators from cramming their gambling accessories into a few large suitcases and lugging them around these new neighbourhoods, where they will talk their way into the homes of resettled farmers. The gambling outfits play hide-and-seek with the police, setting up shop here today, shifting to a new spot tomorrow.What is the situation back where the farmers came from – the houses in the countryside now expropriated but yet to be demolished? Peasants often have dogs to protect the home and guard the property. When peasants move to the cities, they no longer need guard dogs, so they leave them behind. And so you see poignant scenes in those empty, weed-infested farm compounds, as those abandoned dogs, all skin and bones, faithfully continue to perform sentry duty, now rushing from one end of the property to the other, standing on a high point and gazing off into the distance, their eyes burning with hope, longing for the past to return.Wishing the past could return is a mood that is spreading through today’s society. Two patterns are typical. The more widespread of the two reflects the yearnings of the poor. China’s enhanced status as the world’s second largest economy has brought them few benefits they continue to lead a life of grinding hardship. They cherish their memories of the past, for although they were poor then, the word “unemployed” was yet to exist. What’s more, in those days there was no moneyed class in a real sense: Mao’s monthly salary, for example, was just 404.8 yuan, compared to my parents’ joint income of 120 yuan. There was only a small gap between rich and poor, and social inequalities were limited.A different form of nostalgia is prevalent among successful people who, having risen as high as they can possibly go, now find themselves in danger of tumbling off the cliff. Someone reported to me an exchange he had had with one of Shanghai’s ultra-rich, a man who had relied on bribery and other underhand methods to transform himself from a pauper into a millionaire. Realising he would soon be arrested and anticipating a long prison term, he stood in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows of his huge, lofty, luxurious office and looked down at the construction workers far below, busy building the foundation of another skyscraper. How he wished he could be one of those workers, he said, for though their work was hard and their pay was low, they didn’t have to live in a state of such high anxiety. Faced with the prospect of losing everything they have gained, such people find themselves wishing their spectacular career hadn’t happened at all, wishing they could reclaim the past.If the past were really to return – that past where you needed grain coupons to buy rice, oil coupons to buy cooking oil, cotton coupons to buy cloth, that past of dire material shortages, where the supply of goods was dictated by quotas – would those people who hanker for the past be happy? I doubt it.As I see it, when the poor pine for the past, this is not a rational desire – it is simply a way of venting their feelings, the voicing of a frustration that is rooted in their discontent with current Chinese realities. And when that other, smaller group of people who have been successful in government or business realise they are going to spend the rest of their life behind bars and wish they could reclaim the past, this sentiment springs only from a wistful regret: “If I had known this was going to happen, I wouldn’t have got myself into this mess.”I’m reminded of a joke that’s been doing the rounds. Here is what’s unfair about this society:The pretty girl says: “I want a diamond ring!” She gets it.The rich guy says: “I want a pretty girl!” He gets her.I say: “I want a shower!” But there’s no water.That last situation, I myself have experienced. In my early years, more often than not, water would cut off just as I was having a shower – sometimes at the precise moment when I had lathered myself in soap from head to toe. All I could do then was hammer on the pipe with my fists, at the same time raising my head so that the final few drops of water would rinse my eyes and save them from smarting as for when the water would come on again, I could only wait patiently and hope heaven was on my side. Back then, nobody would have seen water stoppages at shower-time as a social injustice, because in those bygone days, there were no rich guys, and so pretty girls didn’t get diamond rings and rich guys didn’t get pretty girls.It is often said that children represent the future. In closing, let me try to capture the changing outlook of three generations of Chinese boys as a way of mapping in simple terms China’s trajectory over the years. If you asked these boys what to look for in life, I think you would hear very different answers.A boy growing up in the Cultural Revolution might well have said: “Revolution and struggle.”A boy growing up in the early 1990s, as economic reforms entered their second decade, might well have said: “Career and love.”Today’s boy might well say: “Money and girls.”Translated by Allan H Barr• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ce15cdf1d1e9943b81bd9a9c3ea0877a22010a1/0_0_4496_3101/master/4496.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=536d4864091df05f8ea4c98f39906703 1320w","title":"talking horses lifes a beach for 150th anniversary of laytown races","story":"Jamie Osborne has sent another strong team from his stable in Lambourn and has a host of fancied runnersLaytown races, the only official race meeting staged on a beach anywhere in Europe, will celebrate its 150th anniversary on Thursday afternoon with six races on a strand about 30 miles north of Dublin, and several of the prizes could be heading across the water as Jamie Osborne has sent another strong team from his stable in Lambourn.Osborne has fancied runners in the first five races, and all run in the colours of the Melbourne 10 Syndicate, which pretty much exists to target this meeting above all others. It even sponsors the final race – the only one, strangely, in which it does not field a runner – and while its members watched half a dozen well-backed runners finish beaten at last year\u0027s meeting before finally celebrating a winner late on the card, they are unlikely to wait as long this time around.Osborne\u0027s Rippling Waters (3.45) has a strong back-up in Prosecution in the opener, and it is a similar story in the next where Pulsating (4.15) and Kody Ridge head the market. If all else fails, Waqaas (5.15) is in a different class to his opponents in the fourth and should come home clear under Lisa O\u0027Neill.On the British cards, Rowland Ward (2.50) at Salisbury is, by association, one of the most interesting runners, as he was the runner-up behind Too Darn Hot, the new favourite for next year\u0027s Derby, when he made his debut at Sandown in early August. Honor Bound, his dam, is a half-sister to Treasure Beach, the Irish Derby winner in 2011, so Rowland Ward may not fulfil his potential until he tackles middle distances next season. He should be good enough to open his account over a mile this afternoon, however, while also paying a further compliment to the colt who beat him so readily first time up.Gunforhire (3.20) is also worth a bet in the nursery handicap on the same card. Richard Hannon\u0027s runner disappointed when fancied at Wolverhampton last time out, finishing fourth of five and nine lengths behind the winner. That was his all-weather debut, however, and Gunforhire\u0027s previous efforts on turf, including a close third at Newbury in August, were much more encouraging and so too is the booking of Ryan Moore.Chocolate Box (8.15) also ran below form last time but has won on his only two previous starts at Chelmsford City and is a fair bet at around 6-1 to beat a very strong favourite in Volcanic Sky. The market leader has an obvious chance on his handicap debut having won by eight lengths at this track last time out, but has an opening mark of 83 as a result. Fresh Terms (7.15) should also go well on the same card, while Hello Youmzain (2.40) and Mon Beau Visage (3.40) are two with solid chances on the card at Haydock Park."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/217efd1c8d1ef75312da40d4d0ce5a786dacba9b/274_685_4489_2693/master/4489.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35ffb1452d16d3d5140e985e68f15df0","title":"my testicle was so big you could play like bongo","story":"Michael Patrick’s youth was blighted by a bizarre testicular condition and the death of his father. They provided the perfect material for his moving and wincingly funny one-man showWhen Michael Patrick finally told his mum, at the age of 17, the problem had swollen to the size of an avocado. Teenage boys may be used to talking bollocks among themselves, but there was one bollock, his terrifyingly tumescent left one, that had haunted Patrick for three years and he hadn’t spoken to anyone about it.“It was massive,” he remembers, 10 years later. “I used to work in a cafe, standing on my feet for eight hours, and it would just drag and drag. The weight of it was so painful.”It started as a pea-sized lump he could feel in his scrotum. “At first, I thought maybe it was supposed to be there.” After all, your body changes in so many surprising ways during adolescence. “But it just kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger.”Patrick’s secret became difficult to hide. At school in Belfast, the bulge earned him the nickname “big dick Mick”. One day, it popped out of his shorts during PE and his friend recoiled in fear. Patrick’s own fear was that it was cancerous and even that he was to blame. “I would go to bed crying. I thought it was my fault somehow,” he says. “Maybe that’s the Catholic guilt around masturbation.” When he eventually went to the doctor, he realised how much he had been carrying around – “both literally and emotionally”.He and his mother were alarmed when Patrick’s problem was fast-tracked upon examination. “The speed that they got us through the system! We were worried that meant it was really dangerous but it was just like: ‘No, you’re so ridiculous. It’s that big! Let’s get rid of it now.’”What they needed to get rid of was 400 millilitres of fluid (“between a can of Coke and a pint”) that had collected around his testicle, enlarging the scrotum – a condition known as hydrocele testis. It is not uncommon for baby boys, but can also develop later in life. Patrick was presented with two options: simply draining it, which might result in another buildup of fluid, or minor surgery. He went with option two. “They make incisions around the membrane outside the testis and then they peel the membrane back like a butterfly chicken and stitch it directly to the inside of the scrotum sack. One of my testicles is now stitched in place so it doesn’t float around as freely as the other. I went under general anaesthetic, woke up an hour or two later and was discharged a couple of hours after that.”Having spent three years keeping silent about the problem, Patrick now can’t stop talking about it. His one-man show, rather proudly titled My Left Nut, was performed in one of the jumble of lecture rooms at Summerhall in Edinburgh last month. It is a raucous, poignant and wincingly funny drama in which Patrick plays himself as both a young child and a teenager and also shifts between the roles of his mum, his siblings, his doctors and his gang of mates.A wave of shows at this year’s fringe focused on the collision of swagger and panic that is particular to teenage masculinity Gary McNair and Kieran Hurley’s Square Go turned Summerhall’s Roundabout stage into a wrestling ring for a playground fight. In My Left Nut, this mix of bravado and terror is captured in a scene when Patrick proudly tells his mum he needs to start shaving, then bursts into tears when she buys him an electric razor because it’s “not what a man uses”.The play’s exploration of manliness is wrapped up in the death of Patrick’s father, who had motor neurone disease. In an early scene, eight-year-old Michael is told he is now the “man of the house”. What are his memories of that time when he and his three siblings were adjusting to life without their dad?“I hid completely from his death. My cousin remembers driving me to the funeral and me talking about The Simpsons for the entire car ride.” Off school for a week, Patrick spent time at home, “playing the Game Boy really happily. Then you’d sit down for a second and cry your eyes out for 20 minutes. Then you’d pick the Game Boy up again. It was a weird dichotomy.”He remembers his dad as thoughtful, quiet and intelligent, instilling in him a love of science and “questioning things”. They would watch quiz shows together and, if there was a problem to solve at home, his father would go about it in a methodical, inquisitive manner. This sense of calm is a complete contrast to the beat-’em-up Sega video games Michael plays and the testosterone-fuelled frenzy of his pals – “beautifully cocky, terrified boys” who measure their ideas of masculinity against each other. They take pride in the idea that their mate’s avocado-shaped bulge means he is “packing”, but when they hear rumours he may have cancer they are relieved that he doesn’t have a “massive schlong” after all. Patrick talks about a time he went on holiday with friends and one of them glimpsed his swollen ball the friend then became secretly paranoid his own testicles were tiny.Patrick wants the show to enable more open conversations about health. He has met audience members with similar experiences and learned that his cousin had kept quiet about his own case of hydrocele testis. At the Edinburgh performance I watched, Patrick’s siblings and mum were present, prompting a tearful hug on stage. This is a show in which he not only impersonates his mum but also, at one point, drops his boxer shorts for a session of eye-wateringly frantic masturbation in a bunk bed. What did she make of that?He laughs, remembering writing the play with Oisín Kearney at a writers’ retreat. “People were saying: ‘Your mum’s going to love the play. It’s such a unique thank you to her.’” He got home, read her the script and she didn’t speak to him for a week. “She couldn’t get over the fact that I was wanking on stage,” he says, before adding that she quickly became proud and is mostly pleased that he is getting acting work.He and Kearney met at Cambridge university where, halfway through his physics degree, Patrick realised he wanted to be an actor. He studied drama at Mountview in London, realised he couldn’t afford to live there and returned to Belfast. One day, he and Kearney met up to discuss writing a script. “I was like: ‘Here are a few ideas,’” Patrick remembers. “He was like: ‘They’re all terrible! So I ended up telling him about my ball. And he said: ‘Write that.’”The play has some hilarious moments, including an explosion of vomit, poo and vodka at a house party. Did Patrick ever see the funny side to his condition as a teenager? “When I got the diagnosis, there was about a month or so before I had surgery. Then me and my mates would laugh about it all the time. You could play it like a bongo.”That sounds like a fringe show in itself, but what about the terrible ideas his writing partner rejected? “One was about alien abductions, which was useless. Then I had another about sandwiches. The one thing I’m really passionate about is sandwiches. Oisín was like: “No one’s going to see a play about the cultural significance of the sandwich.” But that sounds great, I suggest. “I still think there’s something in it,” he enthuses. “It was going to be a history of sandwiches. I’d make them for the audience.”If it ever happens, you will understand if smashed avocado isn’t served.My Left Nut, produced by Pan Narrans Theatre, is at the MAC, Belfast, 7-15 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/538d43627198d0539941584f404163bbe4bd630b/0_0_4446_2668/master/4446.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78e0c4ea23a1d0d36d1666f6bfacfab0","title":"microsoft surface go review tablet thats better for work than play","story":"It’s fine to watch films on but this tablet transforms into a gutsy work laptop when paired with the Type Cover keyboardThe Surface Go is Microsoft’s new, lower-cost detachable Windows 10 tablet that looks to reinvent what a budget PC can be.The brief was pretty straightforward: make a smaller and lighter machine that has all the premium feel and experience of Microsoft’s category-defining Surface Pro, but at about half the cost.To do that Microsoft had to cut some corners, with the biggest being the processor out with the Intel Core lineup and in with the low performance Pentium Gold.But from the outside it’s not obvious where savings have been made. It has the same solid magnesium body of the Pro, now with slightly more rounded and forgiving edges. The Go still has a brilliant kickstand out the back that has a 165-degree range of motion, the buttons feel firm and well made and the cameras are the same.Even the screen is great: it might be of a lower resolution than the Surface Pro but it’s also smaller at just 10in, making it still look just about as pin sharp with excellent viewing angles. And it has front-facing speakers and supports the Surface Pen too, but not the Surface Dial on-screen.All in all it looks, feels and behaves like a baby Surface Pro, and that’s pretty much the point. The Go is a smaller, more portable Surface with the same capable, premium experience.Out of the box the Surface Go runs Windows 10 Home in S Mode, which is Microsoft’s latest locked down version of its signature operating system.Instead of being a truly different version of Windows, as was the case with the short-lived Windows 10 S, the new “S Mode” is, as the name implies, just a mode of whatever flavour of Windows you happen to have installed.In S Mode you can only use Microsoft Edge with Bing search and programs installed from the Microsoft Store. Slowly most of the key programs have become distributed via the Microsoft Store, which handles automatic updates for you, and so in many ways is a better experience than the old-fashioned way of installing programs.Apple’s iTunes, Spotify, Affinity Photo, Evernote, Office, Netflix and many others are all available, with the biggest outlier being Chrome (or any other browser).The idea of S Mode is that all applications are vetted for security and won’t bog down your system. For novice users or those who want the simplest and easiest to manage Windows, most of S Mode is great.The biggest issue is Edge, which still isn’t capable of fully replacing Google Chrome or Firefox. It stutters, hangs and crashes frequently, and not being able to change the default search engine is deeply irritating – Bing just isn’t good enough to replace Google.Despite being installed from the Microsoft Store, Evernote also refused to run, crashing every time on launch.After a week in S Mode, I had to switch it off – a one-button push in the Microsoft Store reverts the user to the full Windows 10 Home experience. Along with allowing the installation of Chrome and a few other smaller bits, it miraculously fixed Evernote too, which the app’s support team couldn’t explain.The Surface Go is arguably the best Windows 10 tablet, but that isn’t saying much. The experience is pretty good, if a little clunky in places, but there’s a significant media-consumption app gap.There’s no Sky Q, Amazon Video or Google Play Movies apps. There’s an All 4 app, but not ITV Hub, while BBC iPlayer is a pretty clunky web-app wrapper that has to be installed separately (not in S Mode).There’s no Kindle, Comixology or Marvel Unlimited app either.Many of these services can be accessed through the browser making the Surface Go OK for watching TV while cooking, but it means you can’t take them offline with you on the commute.The exception to the rule is Netflix. The video subscription service’s Windows 10 app is on a par with that available on the iPad, and shows that it can be done. Watching Final Space or the Expanse on the Surface Go was great, with loud and clear front-facing speakers, that great, bright screen and a kickstand that works at multiple angles and even on a soft surface.What the Surface Go lacks as a media-consumption tablet, it more than makes up for as a work machine.Without the Type Cover, it’s possible to get work done in all your normal Windows apps using the on-screen keyboard and touchscreen. But really it is the Type Cover that makes the Surface Go.It costs at least £100, but the Surface Go’s Type Cover is a marvel. Despite being a little narrower than the full-size Surface Pro version it has a large, excellent trackpad, well-sized keys and a very satisfying typing experience.Within 10 minutes I was touch typing at full speed, with a satisfying amount of key travel and the option to have the keyboard either flat on the desk or propped up at an angle. It’s one of the best typing experiences I’ve used on any compact laptop, let alone a tablet.The Go is actually easier to use on a lap, plane or train table than the larger Surface Pro, as the length of the keyboard plus kickstand out the back is shorter. It is one of the few machines that will fit on my lap while squished into the seat of my commuter train.I tested the Surface Go with 8GB of RAM and 128GB SSD, and while corners may not have been cut in the build of the machine, the Intel Pentium Gold 4415Y is no Core i7 rival. It’s a low-power, low-performance processor and is certainly the weakest part of the Surface Go.Having said that the Go is far more capable than I would have thought. It could never be described as fast, but it did everything I demanded of it without too much of a problem.The biggest difference is that you wont be able to do everything at once compared to a more powerful laptop or the Core i7 Surface Pro. But in high-performance mode when plugged into power the Go was perfectly happy with up to 10 Chrome tabs open, Typora, Wunderlist, Mail, Nextgen Reader, Evernote, Signal, Hangouts Chat, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger open across two screens.Even photo editing in Affinity Photo worked perfectly fine. Loading 5MB-plus images from a Nikon DSLR took a little longer to load, but even the advanced image manipulation tools worked fine.Working solely on the 10in screen was surprisingly good too. Snapping windows side-by-side meant two documents on screen was workable out and about or at a desk.The Surface Go has a USB-C port for accessories and power, alongside the Surface Connector to which the included charger magnetically attaches.Hooking up the Surface Go to a 23in 1080p monitor, ethernet and power via a USB-C dock worked just fine – as did the Surface Dock, connected to power, ethernet and two 23in 1080p monitors. The Surface Go even drove a 4K display at 60Hz without breaking a sweat.Overall, while the raw performance of the Surface Go in no way rivals a modern £1,000-plus laptop, or the higher configurations of Surface Pro, it is a capable little machine. You won’t be playing any graphically intensive games on it, or fancy trying to edit a movie on it, but browsing, using web apps in a desktop-class browser, Office duties and even photo manipulation in a proper image editor such as Affinity Photo are workable with a little patience.In my relatively heavy usage of the Surface Go as a productivity machine I got just under 4.5 hours with S Mode disabled and just under 4 hours in S Mode. That was with the Surface Go connected to an ethernet adapter, but no screens, and placed in better battery mode (which is the default mode when not plugged into power).The Surface Pen is another £100 accessory. Unlike the Type Cover, it isn’t a must-buy for the Surface Go, but it is still great for a number of things.You can use the same stylus with the Surface Pro and it behaves exactly the same on either machine, with no real noticeable lag and all the same pressure sensitives. It is easily one of the best pen-on-screen experiences available.It’ll be most useful for those who like to draw on screen or take handwritten notes. Microsoft’s handwriting recognition is genuinely impressive, but it’s still slower than a virtual keyboard.The Pen attaches to the left side of the tablet with a reassuring magnetic snap either facing the sky or the desk. It’s so firmly attached that it didn’t fall off once while I was getting it in and out of a bag during my testing.The Microsoft Surface Go costs £379 with 64GB of eMMC storage and 4GB of RAM or £509 with 128GB of SSD and 8GB of RAM.The Type cover costs £100 in black or £125 in silver, blue or burgundy Alcantara.The Surface Pen costs £100 one of five colours.For comparison, the Surface Pro starts at £649 with an Intel Core m3 processor, 128GB of storage, 4GB of RAM and Signature Type Cover. Apple’s iPad Pro starts at £619 and the Smart Keyboard costs £159.The Surface Go demonstrates two things. The first is that budget PCs don’t have to suck – a cheap, low performance processor can do Ok if you pair it with other good but not top-of-the-line components.The second is that Microsoft can make really great PCs even at lower price points.As a media-consumption tablet, the Surface Pro is OK, but not the best. It gets solid video-watching battery life, has good speakers and the kickstand is just great. But a lack of apps holds it back compared to the best-in-class iPad.As a productivity machine the Surface Go is really quite good. It won’t be winning any performance awards, but it’ll get the job done with a little patience and give you a nice experience with it. It is far better than non-PC tablets at getting real work done, with a desktop-class browser and proper keyboard and trackpad.It’s also light and thin enough that you can chuck it in a bag and simply forget about it. Carrying it around instead of a 14in, 1.33kg laptop over the last few weeks really made a big difference to my back and USB-C means I can charge it almost anywhere when the 4.5 hours of battery isn’t quite enough.The Surface Go is a great little machine but don’t be fooled by the price. The £100 Type Cover is a must, which means the Surface Go actually starts at £479. You can get a lot more power for your money, but you’ll struggle to get as good an experience.Cons: relatively short battery life, no USB-A ports, £100 keyboard essential, not quite as cheap as it appears, weaker performance"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1cdaa149948654bc6907a19cf60a02c63a37a3d/0_282_5150_3090/master/5150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f505cf135219f8ebd339406712e5bed5","title":"how department store liberty is fashioning success in store and online","story":"Once a favourite of Oscar Wilde, the mock-Tudor-fronted department store has rebooted with fresh designs and modern techConstructed from the timbers of two ships, mock-Tudor-fronted Liberty is one of London’s most recognisable stores.The business was founded by Arthur Lasenby Liberty in 1843 and praised by Oscar Wilde as “the chosen resort of the artistic shopper”. It’s steeped in history. And yet Liberty is also thriving in the 21st century, attracting shoppers from all over the world with its colourful Liberty-print fabrics, designer labels and one-of-a-kind gifts.Listed among Retail Week’s top 10 bricks-and-mortar retailers, it is also a successful retail platform – an always-on business with 500 employees. None of this comes easy. The retail sector is going through challenging times and, despite its wealthy clientele, Liberty must fight to maintain its esteemed position.With all this in mind, the business, with its emphasis on customer service, requires an ultra-reliable digital backbone. But such systems can become obsolete over time. “Two years ago, the company’s network switches were outdated,” says Haaron Weekes, Liberty’s head of IT service delivery and operations, who joined the business in 2016. “Hardware and software support were no longer available, and there were a number of vulnerabilities in its core infrastructure. Having legacy kit also meant we had occasional outages.” This meant staff at Liberty London had to work hard to deliver core aspects of a modern retailer, such as a reliable and secure e-commerce platform and online customer service.“Our legacy firewall was unmanaged and not fit for purpose,” says Weekes. “The infrastructure behind our virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) environment was unable to handle the workload, so the performance was poor for anyone who used it.” The VDI – which enables employees to sign in to any desktop computer as if it were their own – serves between 250 and 350 users at the same time. But it was taking some staff more than three-and-a-half minutes to log on to their desktops.To get back up to speed and provide the service Liberty is famed for, Weekes set about overhauling the store’s IT infrastructure, working with multinational technology provider Cisco, as well as his own team that develops, maintains and supports the company’s technology services.Cisco worked with Liberty to understand its objectives: achieving agility and flexibility in its fast-paced industry. “Cisco was, and still is, a network provider, but our technology portfolio has been transformed we now provide the technologies to change the way we work, live, play and learn, in a collaborative secure environment,” says Hema Marshall, its head of small and medium business sales.A team travelled to Liberty’s offices to find out how the company works as a business, and get a clear picture of its existing infrastructure and the problems it was experiencing. From there, Weekes and his team replaced Liberty’s firewall and implemented a flexible IT management tool that’s able to combine and optimise multiple cloud platforms, and can be used to develop and run a range of cloud-based applications.They also rolled out a new Cisco security system that, among other things, only permits certain iniduals to access specific tools and data. The internal network of Liberty was also refreshed and new in-store wifi installed.The wifi system means the Liberty team has gained insights into its customers’ trends via location analytics, says Weekes. Such client information can help to bridge the onlineoffline split and help turn window shoppers into online buyers. But bricks and mortar still count and while Weekes oversaw the backend upgrade, nine front-of-house shopping departments were renovated as part of a 2017 refresh.It’s critical for businesses to be able to quickly scale up and scale out as needed, but digital safeguards are just as critical – especially with new GDPR rules in place. Weekes believes the next-generation firewall has put Liberty in a better position to identify and defend against potential cyberthreats. The company has also increased its disaster recovery capabilities so that it can continue to serve its customers even in the event of any technical issues, says Marshall.Most importantly, the shopping process is now more secure for customers too, and less complicated. “Improved management of what’s happening across the business, with increased visibility and reduced complexity, allows the Liberty teams to focus more on innovation, and not just keeping the lights on,” says Marshall. This newfound ability to innovate and take on emerging challenges stems from several places – the stability of Liberty’s replacement network, the greater time efficiencies enjoyed by staff and, among other things, the benefits of its unified cloud system, which supports HR, antivirus and finance operations.Two years after bringing Cisco on board, Liberty still faces the challenge of keeping up with the everyday security threat, Weekes says. However, its new cybersecurity system does research and work behind the scenes, “so we believe we’re in a better position to face tomorrow’s challenges”, he says.That’ll make his new boss, Adil Mehboob-Khan, Liberty’s chief executive, happy. The former CEO of international eyewear manufacturer Luxottica has more than hinted at his belief in Liberty’s long-term potential. Finally the brand has a digital backbone to match its powerful ambition.Click here to discover how Cisco can help your SME grow"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40b1c4df17c6914f58e8f6716ef2d1617d7fd03c/0_217_3275_1966/master/3275.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6684d97bbdd6ee0b7736aced12ba6cd0","title":"different paths mutual respect susan and jo wokoma on sisterhood","story":"Susan’s an actor and Jo’s a nurse – the Wokoma sisters inhabit very different worlds. But that doesn’t prevent them being each other’s most avid supporter“Jo has this incredibly noble job,” says Susan Wokoma of her little sister, a nurse. “But she’ll say: ‘When we were growing up, we’d watch TV and now you’re in programmes I watch.’ That makes me feel proud of what I’ve done.”Since graduating from drama school in 2010, Susan has rarely been off our screens, notably with parts in supernatural teen drama Crazyhead and cult hit Chewing Gum. She’s also been successful on stage, making her West End debut in 2017 in James Graham’s Labour of Love. It means that although she and Jo still live close to one another in south London, where they grew up, they can sometimes go months without meeting up. “With my job, it’s really difficult,” she says. “I have to drop everything if I get a role and it can be all-consuming. But when we can, we’ll meet for a drink – it’s lovely.”As children, Susan and Jo weren’t nearly as close. Susan was the third child of four and Jo the youngest, so she got away with a lot, Susan says. “My older brother was the only boy, so he could do no wrong, whereas I consider myself the middle child.” Their mother, a cleaner who worked night shifts at MI5, dressed Susan and her elder sister identically, despite their six-year age gap. “When she started to get too old for it, I thought, ‘Cool’ – but then Jo turned up and I had to match with her. Mum dressed us like little Victorian children.”Three-and-a-half years younger, Jo looked up to Susan. “I wanted to follow her everywhere, but on the handful of times she’d take me to her friends’ houses, I’d do something to annoy her – like ask too many questions,” says Jo.“She spoke gobbledygook for a long time, and I couldn’t make out what she was saying – I found her quite sinister,” laughs Susan.For a period, their mother worked at Peckham fire station and would occasionally take the girls to work with her. One of Susan’s favourite memories, she recalls, is of the firefighters letting them play with the hoses, and drenching each other with water.At school, Susan was the good girl, “smart and very together”, recalls Jo, whereas Jo herself was “forever getting into trouble or getting suspended”. During their teenage years, they argued a lot – about makeup, magazines or clothes. Their paths erged even further after a teacher advised Susan to audition for the National Youth Theatre.“After that, I knew my route quite quickly, whereas Jo was quite a difficult kid and it took her a bit longer to find what she wanted to do,” says Susan.Their relationship changed in the coming years. “I’m not especially close to our older sister, so I thought: ‘Be the older sister you would want.’ I started asking Jo how she was, what was going on in her life. I wanted to be the first person she would come to if she was having trouble,” says Susan.Jo had decided to train as a nurse, but halfway through her course, she became pregnant. “I was only 20 and we all knew my dad was going to be really cross, because he wanted me to finish uni,” says Jo.Their Nigerian father worked full-time in the Home Office, as well as having a weekend security job at the Royal Festival Hall. “He had that immigrant mentality of work, work, work,” says Susan, and he wanted his children to do well.“I didn’t tell him until I was over five months pregnant,” says Jo, “and I asked Susan to come with me.”Their father died after Jo’s son was born, and it was Susan’s encouragement that drove Jo to finish her nursing degree. “He always said he wanted me to go back and finish, and I had no intention of doing it, but Susan had just finished filming The Inbetweeners 2 in Australia and she said: ‘If you complete it by the summer, you can come with me to the premiere.’ I graduated and she took me with her, which was really cool.”Now, they message via WhatsApp almost every day, even when Susan is filming, and meet up in person whenever they can. “As I’ve got older I’ve realised she’s super-quick and super-funny,” says Susan. “Actually, she’s overtaken me in some ways – she’s got all these responsibilities, while I’m floating around auditioning or trying to write stuff. I’ve got massive respect for her.”The feeling’s mutual. “Susan’s always been very real and matter-of-fact,” says Jo. “When I was younger I didn’t quite understand – I just thought she was horrible! Now I realise she’s straight with me and that’s what we all lack in our lives. A lot of people tell us what we want to hear, but Susan’s not like that. Any advice she gives is always spot-on, and always in my best interests. She’s a really special person.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba57c7fdb0672625da780d8093f1ae1804fb9d0d/0_75_6464_3879/master/6464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bed6ec2bfa149f7c2aab655af7bb685","title":"10 best street food stalls worldwide readers travel tips","story":"Originally cheap meals for workers, street food offers a true taste of local lives and specialitiesIn the Taiwanese town of Jingtong, I tried what is widely known as “stinky tofu”. At the back of a roadside stall, I sat on a low seat and watched three squares of tofu being cut into four before being plunged into a wok of hot oil. It was served in a bowl with soy sauce and picked sliced cabbage and carrot. It was surprisingly good, not greasy and, although there was a slight smell, it was no worse than a strong blue cheese. With a chilled lime drink, I paid about £2. Helen JI tried socca (chickpea-flour pancakes) for the first time while on holiday in Nice and I will remember it forever. I think I devoured three people’s portions. We were walking through the old town and I noticed queues at various street vendors, but one on a corner had the longest queue. The staff were working in immense heat over enormous flat griddle pans, scraping off the strange-looking substance with a flat utensil like a piece of folded cardboard. I handed over a few euros and it was literally slapped on to a plate and handed to me. With glasses of cold rose from the bar next door, we sat down in the shade to eat our food. I have never been so surprised by, or fallen in love so quickly with a food – and one that’s pretty much impossible to find anywhere at home. KatEvery Friday from spring to late autumn Ljubljana’s Pogačarjev Square fills with food and drink stalls from local producers and restaurateurs, showcasing Slovenia’s best dishes. Tourists and locals perch on the steps outside the cathedral to scoff delights such as potato dumplings with blue cheese sauce, and strawberry cream cake. All waste is recycled at the end of the market and leftover food donated to those in need. odprtakuhna.siOonaghThe best street food sometimes takes you by surprise. We exited the Salina Turda salt mine in Romania into a drizzly, cold car park with empty bellies and - seemingly - without much to eat on offer. We joined the queue at a food van and handed over 2 lei (about 40p), not really knowing what we’d get. It turned out to be a kind of flat deep-fried savoury doughnut covered in salty cream cheese... and it tasted of heaven! A bit of googling revealed that this mystery dish was langosi cu branza. We rejoined the queue.Dean PatrickThere’s a little stall with a little old lady on the corner of Rambutturi alley and Chakrabongse Road in central Bangkok that serves the best slow-cooked pork and rice in the world. It has no name, there’s no menu and she doesn’t speak English. But that’s OK: she only serves one dish and does it spectacularly well. Point at the bubbling pork, hand over 60 baht (about £1,40), take a seat on a little plastic stool and prepare to be blown away. I’ve been visiting this lady every time I go to Bangkok (for more than 20 years), and I love her like my mum! Joanna KangThe pork-rice lady across the street from the Banan Hotel in Battambang, Cambodia, sets up for the breakfast rush every morning. As is typical with this type of establishment, once she runs out of product she closes for the day. The pork was sweet from the marinade and delicately smoky from the charcoal brazier, and at about a dollar it made for a quick, tasty and cheap breakfast.Dave GrahamMomos are steamed dumplings beloved by Nepalese that are typically stuffed with vegetables, chicken or “buff” (buffalo: for Hindus, cows are sacred). These delicacies are served from stalls that spring up by the kerbside from the late afternoon all over Kathmandu. Dished up on small plates made from banana leaves, they come with a dash of spicy sauce. In Kathmandu’s Thamel, the main tourist hub, here are usually a few stalls selling momos for 100 rupees (about a dollar) – they are a bit more expensive, as it is a tourist area, but still represent great value.Marianne HeredgeLa Tilapia is just opposite Villa Las Estrellas on the long beach road in Tulum. You can’t miss the small, but beautifully painted, hut where a charming Mexican lady serves amazing tacos, burritos and ceviche. We stopped here for lunch and enjoyed several of her dishes for a modest price compared to that around. Not only does the food taste amazing it’s served on fantastic colourful plates. A stand out place for sure.LewisA tiny crowded stall at the far end of the tiny town of San Pedro de Atacama drew my attention. My language skills meant pointing awkwardly at a pile of crispy treats and receiving four perfectly filled, crispy steaming parcels of meat and vegetables. I handed over the equivalent of £2 in the hope it would be enough and received £1.75 back in change. With a can of Coke (essential for altitude sickness), I gazed at the lunar landscape and devoured these parcels of joy that Ican never recreate but are always fondly remembered.KatieWherever you are in Uzbekistan it seems you are never too far from a giant kazan, an iron pan where palov, the country’s ubiquitous street food, is cooked over an open fire. The basic ingredients are rice, meat and vegetables. My favourite variety, tuy palov, also contains chickpeas and raisins. Wandering through Tashkent’s central food market, we were invited to share a huge plate of this delicious, Persian-influenced food with a group of friendly workmen who were sitting at a long bench tucking into their lunch: a lovely example of the country’s hospitality.

Works 20 hours a week“Working a second job, and the lack of rest that comes with that, makes it really hard to do the most important thing that a teacher does: remain engaged and enthusiastic, and really be the driving force in a classroom. The second challenge is that every year, students come to me with ideas for organizations they would like to start, clubs they would like to be involved in, and some of those things match up really well with some of my own passions.“But when I weigh the additional amount of money that I need for my second job against my inclination, it doesn’t make sense.“When you consider a teacher with zero experience versus a teacher like me with now 11 years behind me, there’s only a $3,619 difference in our salary. That signals to me that our district does not value experienced teachers. If I didn’t work a second job, I would be a risk for not having funds to deal with major financial problems that could occur in anyone’s life, whether that’s a major medical expense, a major car expense, or a family emergency.”Full-time job Middle school social studies teacher.

I use my lunch breaks often times to make choreography or to make lessons for that evening. Sometimes that’s what my weekends are devoted to also. Social life? What’s that? And sometimes even my personal health is at risk. It’s hard to eat lunch when you’ve got so many different things going on.“There’s times where I have to talk to myself in the mirror and tell myself: ‘It’s OK, you can get through this. I know you’re exhausted, but it’ll be all right.’ And I get my second wind eventually. I get that adrenaline boost that I need to keep teaching. But there are times when I’m just so tired and my body is making me think that it can’t take it any more.”“I try and leave school a little bit earlier than normal when I’m working just so I can have some extra time. When I go home I have to take care of my dogs first: I have to change clothes and I have to eat dinner because I don’t get home from PetSmart until 9.30pm and I’m not eating dinner at 9.30 at night. The hardest part is just managing stress.“The reason I took a second job is that I have some debt that I’m trying to pay off. I needed the extra money to pay my bills. I was struggling with just the teaching income and this makes it so that I don’t have to struggle financially. I can live on my wage, but I’m single and have no kids. There’s a lot of teachers who are single parents who are really struggling.”“We use the envelope system a little bit. This week’s softball lesson would go into an envelope for the tire fund. Or this week’s lesson, half of it would go for car maintenance.“I will probably continue my side jobs through at least my kids going to college. We’ve accumulated some debt over the years, because when you need tires, you just put down the credit card. When the washing machine goes out, you put it on the credit card.

Moore was duped into appearing on a segment where Baron Cohen demonstrated a supposed paedophile detecting device that beeped when it came near Moore.During last year’s Senate race Moore faced accusations he pursued romantic and sexual relationships with children as young as 14 when he was a prosecutor in his 30s. He has denied the misconduct allegations.Larry Klayman, founder of the conservative group Freedom Watch, is representing Moore and his wife Kayla in the lawsuit. The complaint also names CBS and Showtime as defendants in the case.Klayman said in a statement: “Sasha Baron Cohen, who is not only low class but also a fraudster, will now, along with Showtime and CBS, be held accountable for his outrageous and false, fraudulent and defamatory conduct which callously did great emotional and other damage to this great man and his wife and family.”Representatives of Baron Cohen did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the lawsuit.A Showtime representative wrote in an email that the company did not comment on pending litigation, and to their knowledge it had not been served with the complaint.Klayman said Moore thought he was receiving an award for supporting Israel when he agreed to appear on the show. In the segment Baron Cohen appeared as the bushy-eyebrowed faux counter-terrorism instructor “Colonel Erran Morad” discussing bogus military technology, including a supposed paedophile detector. The device repeatedly beeped as it got near Moore, who sat stone-faced.Baron Cohen’s latest show, which began airing in July, has drawn in several other political figures. In one episode the former Arizona sheriff and Senate candidate Joe Arpaio argued the benefits of gun ownership to a tiny toy doughnut.Another episode led a Georgia state representative to resign after he shouted racial slurs and exposed his rear end in a supposed anti-terrorism self-defence drill."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa22f67720f4bcbadfaf297031c7a43494bda270/0_9_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04afcf2e6454cb5b2b1d85b188eac0e0","title":"brazil presidential election candidates corruption allegations","story":"A month before vote, candidates for Workers’ party and PDSB accused of illegal campaign donations in earlier racesTwo candidates on opposite sides of the political spectrum in Brazil’s forthcoming presidential vote have been charged with receiving illegal campaign donations just a month before the election.Within 24 hours, Fernando Haddad of the leftist Workers’ party’s (PT) and Geraldo Alckmin from the rightwing PSDB were both accused of funding violations in previous campaigns.Haddad is currently running to be vice-president to the incarcerated former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who has been banned from running due to his criminal conviction. Haddad is expected to assume the ticket as the presidential candidate imminently.Both candidates are accused of taking off-the-books campaign donations.Prosecutors are bringing a criminal case against Haddad for allegedly taking R$2.6m for his 2012 campaign for mayor of São Paulo from the construction firm UTC Participações.Alckmin is accused in a civil case of taking R$10m from the scandal-ridden construction firm Odebrecht during his 2014 run for governor of São Paulo state. In both cases, prosecutors are alleging that the unreported donations resulted in illegal advantages for the construction firms.A sweeping investigation of political kickback schemes, known as Operation Car Wash, has turned Brazil’s political class upside down in recent years.“These types of allegations have been constant since Car Wash began. Any politician who’s not a newcomer has received money from these sources,” said Thiago de Aragão, a political analyst at Arko Advice.It is unlikely the cases will proceed in time to result in a conviction before the election’s first round on 7 October, but De Aragão says it will cause damage to both candidates’ reputations in a crowded playing field where neither have any votes to spare.Both campaigns have denied wrongdoing. São Paulo state prosecutors announced the case against Haddad on Tuesday, about a week after announcing another civil case against him for administrative improbity. The PT released a statement calling the case the latest example of the judiciary making “frivolous, baseless accusations” against them.But on Wednesday, the same state prosecutor’s office announced their case against Alckmin, whose PSDB party is a longtime political rival of the PT. The Alckmin campaign released a statement saying there was no new evidence in the case, only an “incorrect conclusion and unusual behavior” from the prosecutors. They also say the prosecutors are politically motivated.However, anti-corruption advocates say this may be the start of a new era for accountability in Brazilian politics.“Organized crime capturing our states is a serious problem for the fragility of our democracies,” said Bruno Brandão, the executive director of Transparency International Brasil. “The Brazilian authorities are doing what they’ve never done before. They have the capacity to investigate and prosecute this systemic behavior.”Additional reporting by Dom Phillips"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21a851dd61df700d2973c518223bde8a1c85a2d7/0_22_2800_1681/master/2800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7468db6df3a68754f2294ad2bc485a6","title":"china must apologise for arrogance nauru president demands","story":"Tensions rise further at Pacific Islands Forum as leader accuses Beijing of ‘buying their way’ through the regionNauru\u0027s president has demanded China apologise for a senior envoy’s crazy behaviour at the Pacific Islands Forum, and lashed out at Beijing\u0027s arrogant presence in the region.They\u0027re not our friends. They just need us for their own purposes, President Baron Waqa said. Sorry, but I have to be strong on this because no one is to come and dictate things to us.Waqa said such behaviour merited an apology from Beijing. “We won\u0027t just seek an apology, we\u0027ll even take it up to the UN,” he said. “Not only that, I will mention it at the UN and every international meeting.”This year\u0027s annual Pacific summit, which wraps up in Nauru this week, has been one of the most contentious in the event\u0027s 49-year history.The animosity – fuelled by Nauru’s continued recognisance of Taiwan over China – erupted spectacularly on Tuesday when the head of China\u0027s delegation Du Qiwen attempted to address a meeting but Waqa refused to let him speak until island leaders had finished. Leaked video shows Waqa telling Du: “Show some respect.”The diplomatic spat pits Nauru – with a population of 11,000 and a landmass of just 21 square kilometres – against an Asian superpower that is the most populous country on Earth, with 1.4 billion citizens.Nauru has remained close to Taiwan largely through Taipei’s financial largesse, including direct monthly payments to members of parliament (described as “project funding that requires minimal accounting”) and grants and aid funding.Most of the buildings and infrastructure used to host the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) were built or upgraded with Taiwanese money.Tensions between Nauru and China were first exposed before the forum even started, when Nauru immigration officials refused to stamp the diplomatic passports of the Chinese delegation.Tuesday’s treatment of the Chinese delegate was seen as a deliberate and public humiliation, the source inside the closed-door meeting said, and a reflection of Pacific suspicions about Chinese intent in the region.Waqa told a media conference late on Wednesday Du was a “nobody” and “crazy”.Would he behave like that in front of his own president? I doubt it.He disrespected the Pacific, the forum island leaders and other ministers who have come to join us in our territory. Are you kidding? Look at him, he\u0027s a nobody.He\u0027s not even a minister and he\u0027s demanding to be recognised and to speak before the prime minister of Tuvalu. Is he crazy?Waqa’s exchange with Du highlighted sensitivities over Beijing\u0027s rising influence in the Pacific. China is set to overtake Australia as the largest donor to the region, after pledging US$4bn in aid to the region last year.There are concerns loans from China, if not serviced by small Pacific economies, could be called in by Beijing in debt for equity swaps on disadvantageous terms, giving China increased military access and strategic influence in the region.China has shown no sign of backing down, with a foreign ministry spokeswoman saying on Wednesday that Nauru violated forum regulations and staged a bad farce."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8ff14773f59ec6592a32c739699bac23879ec6c/0_20_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9769ab23f7a04721b61c1e03a5c8bc3","title":"grande opening milan gets italys first starbucks","story":"US chain hopes 2,300 sq metre flagship will entice Italians in for a new coffee experienceThe US coffee chain Starbucks has opened its first branch in Italy, with an upmarket Milan “roastery” leading the charge of an ambitious plan to conquer the home of the espresso.The Seattle-based multinational is well established elsewhere in Europe, but its entry into the Italian market had experienced delays.It hopes its 2,300 sq metre Milan cafe, which it describes as “the most beautiful Starbucks in the world”, will entice customers in for a new coffee experience.The building, a cavernous former post office near the city\u0027s cathedral, includes a heated marble-topped coffee counter, cocktails in a mezzanine-level bar and a giant bronze cask used in the roasting process.The coffee chain’s former chief executive Howard Schultz, who left in June amid speculation about a possible run for the White House in 2020, has repeatedly said the company would come to Italy with “humility”.“I came to Milan as a young man, in 1983 ... my imagination was captured by Italian coffee,” he said at an industry event in May. “We are not coming here to teach Italians how to make coffee, we\u0027re coming here with humility and respect, to show what we\u0027ve learned.”Italy is Starbucks’ 78th global market, and the Milan opening comes 20 years after its first European store opened in London. The company has described the Milan store as “the crown jewel of Starbucks global retail footprint”, and said it has plans for more cafes in the city.According to the Italian catering federation FIPE, 6bn shots of espresso are consumed each year in cafes in Italy.Matteo Figura of the market research firm NPD Group said Starbucks was entering the Italian market at the right moment. While previously an espresso was “an opportunity to have an energy ‘shot’, consumers today increasingly care more about quality and the experience they can have”, he said.Starbucks will primarily target 18- to 34-year-olds, said Figura, adding that the Italian market had room for both traditional cafes and Starbucks, as they tended to attract different consumers.Agence France-Presse and Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c4ffbf16ccf9d10ed9ad5080619bf56f0242ebe/0_196_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8279021975de73d19394919b06d15115","title":"turkey sea turtles conservation work iztuzu beach in pictures","story":"Turkey’s Iztuzu beach is witnessing a major construction boom.

In the next few months he will face the resolution of two issues that will define at least this phase of his political career.The business end of Brexit will demand decisions and judgments, some of them perhaps made in the small hours of a European summit, that will have far-reaching consequences for himself, his Government and the country.The question of how and when the Government he inherited comes to an end must also be faced.It’s that second question that is uppermost in the minds of the Fine Gael TDs and Senators who meet in Galway today for the parliamentary party’s autumn think-in. Above everything else, they want to know if there’s going to be an election. What will he tell them?However, Varadkar is clear that he will not be sending his TDs over the top immediately. Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has – as Varadkar knew he would – rebuffed his approaches for an early renewal of the confidence-and-supply agreement. The question was always what the Taoiseach would do then. The answer seems to be: nothing, for now. “I’m not going to call an election,” he says.He rehearses the arguments for an early renewal of the confidence-and-supply agreement one more time.“I don’t want to be in a situation where I don’t know how long the Government is going to last, where I don’t know whether the Government will last more than a few weeks after the budget is passed, or more than a day after the Finance Bill is passed,” he says.“I think that’s not in the interests of the country, I think it weakens our position when it comes to the Brexit talks.“When you attend meetings in Brussels, one thing anybody wonders is: ‘What’s the longevity of that prime minister?’ You know, we all know, for example, there are elections coming up in Sweden, we all know there are elections coming up in Luxembourg. People inevitably want to know is this the person you’re going to be dealing with in six months’ time or nine months’ time – so I think it puts us in a weaker position when we don’t have certainty around that.“And then also when it comes to negotiating contracts, when it comes to trying to negotiate agreements with interest groups and so on, I think the Government is in a much better position to deliver for the taxpayer if people know that that government is going to be around and be able to honour those deals.”This is thin enough reasoning. All governments are bound by the agreements made by their predecessors. The state has an eternal legal personality. Of course a new government can change the policy of an old one. But it can’t tear up legal agreements without legal consequences. The government does not have a legal personality the state does, and it is a perpetual one.In the European Union, governments change all the time prime ministers come and go. But national interests remain. Varadkar likes the high politics of European summits, and he may well be good at it. But he may also be overestimating the importance of the personal chemistry around the table with the other heads of government. Leadership matters of course it does. But other things matter too, such as a country’s permanent interests. And anyway, whatever criticisms Martin has of Varadkar’s handling of Brexit, his policy would be little different.Either way, Martin seems likely to simply wait Varadkar out. He isn’t going to start negotiations until after the budget, and the landscape for, and range of potential outcomes of, those talks will be defined by the resolution of the Brexit talks. Is there an agreement or isn’t there? Is the prognosis catastrophic, or merely bad?Varadkar repeats again and again that he wants to settle the future of the Government (in his favour, naturally) now. “But ultimately, if Fianna Fáil isn’t willing to do that, they’re not.”Negotiations have begun between the two parties though – yesterday – on the budget. The room for manoeuvre is slim enough, though – not because the budget is not expansionary (it is) but because much of the available increase in spending has already been committed, in capital spending pledges, in the costs of demographic changes, in public sector pay rises.“We did that eyes open,” Varadkar says, “knowing full well that budgets would be less dramatic than they had been in previous years. But I think it’s what you actually need.“We have limited room for manoeuvre and for big announcements on budget day – roughly €800 million, and the vast majority of that will be taken up by the welfare package and the tax package.“But I really think that’s the way we need to go into the future – these massive, dramatic budgets where there are big announcements on budget day . . . is not actually the way to solve the problems that we have in health and housing. Actually what we need is long-term planning and consistent investment.”Housing, the single greatest area of political attack on the Government, will be a particular focus. But against the political need for “something to be done” is Varadkar’s belief that there “aren’t any overnight solutions”.The long-term planning and incremental progress that he lauds has an uncomfortable corollary for politicians: problems will be fixed slowly. And with the numbers of people in emergency accommodation heading inexorably for 10,000 the demand for solutions is going to get louder. But Varadkar is keen to come to the defence of his Minister for Housing – and key political ally – Eoghan Murphy.People focusing on Murphy personally “on how he looks or how he speaks or what he wears . . . are really not people who care about people who are homeless or care about housing. They are just people who are trying to score political points or gain political advantage,” Varadkar says.Rather than focusing on the person of the Minister, he says, they should look at the “role of local authorities”.“Ultimately the responsibility for providing social housing actually lies with local authorities – that’s why we call them council houses. That’s why we call them council estates. At the very least it’s a shared responsibility between central government and local authorities. And if you look at some of the local authorities where the housing shortage is at its worst, they’re local authorities like Dublin City Council and South Dublin County Council – on which Sinn Féin is the largest party and left-wing groups dominate.”If the council wants to spend more money in housing, it can ert money from other areas, he says, or it can increase commercial rates, or raise the property tax. “It’s a tough decision to make, but they can make it.”On Brexit, Varadkar seeks to play his part in what EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier calls “de-dramatising” the issue of the Border backstop, the contentious guarantee that there will be no hard border, even if the EU and the UK fail to agree a trade deal.But does he accept any responsibility for dramatising it in the first place?“No, is the short answer.”“We do need to have a backstop. We need to make sure that it avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. But I think it can be de-dramatised in two ways. I think we should totally move away from any sort of language about there being a border in the Irish Sea – that is not what is intended, sought or asked for by the Irish Government. ”There are checks, he says, that occur already – “between Northern Ireland and Ireland around diesel, and excise, and tax, for example. There are checks that occur between Britain and Northern Ireland around agriculture and phytosanitary and so on . . . It’s not an attempt to create some sort of new political border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain – that’s not what we were ever looking for.”He has, he says, been trying to agree a date for a meeting with Arlene Foster – “but we haven’t been able to agree a date”. There seems little urgency on either side. He hasn’t spoken to Foster “for a couple of months”.He does say that he thinks it is becoming “increasingly evident that a hard Brexit might actually undermine the union between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. I think more and more unionists are perhaps starting to come around to that view. But it’s not for me tell them their own business.”“The best thing we can do to get things back on track in Northern Ireland is to have greater clarity on what Brexit is going to look like,” Varadkar says. “I think that is going to be the focus for the next couple of weeks.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3619634.1536182895!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leo varadkar rules out autumn general election","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar on Inis Meáin, Aran Islands: ‘I’m not proposing to go to the Phoenix Park next week or the week after and have an election before the budget, not at all.’ Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he does not intend to call an election despite Fianna Fáil’s rejection of his request for early negotiations on an extension of the confidence-and-supply agreement.Asked in an interview with The  if Micheál Martin’s refusal to engage in negotiations until after the budget was unacceptable to him, Mr Varadkar replied: “It’s not unacceptable. I’m not proposing to go to the Phoenix Park next week or the week after and have an election before the budget, not at all.”Later, Mr Varadkar added: “I’m not going to call an election. But I think it’s going to make it harder to agree an extension, or to agree a new confidence-and-supply agreement if we’re trying to do that in October, in the run-up to the presidential election, in the run-up to a potentially very difficult period, when we’re trying to agree the Brexit agreement, and when the Dáil is sitting.“It’s always a more politically charged atmosphere – people scoring points in the Dáil, committee hearings, parliamentary party hearings every week. It’s not a good environment I think, and I would have preferred if we had been able to do that in July, during the recess. I would still prefer if we could do that now in September.Mr Varadkar has sought, in talks with Mr Martin in July and a letter sent to the Fianna Fáil leader last week, an extension of the agreement until the summer of 2020.Asked if he would be interested in discussing a shorter extension to the deal, Mr Varadkar said: “I’m not going to have those negotiations through the media. And I know deputy Martin is a little bit sensitive about being spoken to through the media. So we’ve had a meeting in July. We agreed we’d have another meeting in September and my offer stands – that I want to begin those discussions right away, appoint negotiating teams, and what I’m proposing is that we agree a policy programme that the Government would implement over the next two years and that we agree a date for a general election in the summer of 2020.”However, Fianna Fáil remains firm in its refusal to discuss an extension to the confidence-and-supply agreement.Government Ministers again pressed the case yesterday for an early extension of the arrangement, but Fianna Fáil frontbenchers rebuffed the Taoiseach’s advances, as the two parties continued to trade barbs.The Minister for Rural and Community Development Michael Ring said no Government could be looking over its shoulder, wondering if Fianna Fáil will or will not support it.But Cavan-Monaghan Fianna Fáil TD Niamh Smyth accused Mr Varadkar of trying to pull “another publicity stunt”.Talks between the two parties on the next budget got under way, however, at Government Buildings yesterday when Fianna Fáil finance spokesman Michael McGrath and public expenditure spokesman Barry Cowen met the Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe.Going into the talks, Mr McGrath said his party would be seeking a number of measures in the budget, including additional funding for affordable housing and for the National Treatment Purchase Fund, which helps to shorten hospital waiting lists.The Taoiseach’s comments on an early election are likely to ease the nerves of Fine Gael TDs and Senators who are meeting in Galway on Thursday and Friday for the party’s annual think-in before the Dáil resumes later this month."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Reports to National Monuments Service include prehistoric barrow cemetery, a henge, ringfort enclosuresKorean presidents to meet later in month to discuss \u0026lsquopractical measures\u0026rsquo toward denuclearisationMahathir\u0026rsquos government has appeared ided about the LGBT communityProsecutions rare but law was frequently used to blackmail LGTBI+ communityEarthquake paralyses island of Hokkaido knocking out power for 5.3 million residentsAt least 11 dead and 470 injured after sustained wind over 160kmh sweeps main islandAt least six people killed in the most powerful storm to hit the country in 25 yearsNews that vaccinations for children were faulty rattles confidence in health systemKerala minister launches campaign to raise funds as food runs short in relief campsPair jailed for illegal possession of documents while reporting on violence against RohingyaSouth Korean officials react following anger over hidden cameras targeting womenAmnesty says the incident marks an \u0026lsquoappalling day\u0026rsquo for human rights in the stateKathmandu Letter: Protests and shock at growing sexual violence and rights abusesTrump administration says Islamabad is granting safe haven to insurgentsBeijing says UN panel\u0026rsquos report on one million Uighurs in detention \u0026lsquowithout factual basis\u0026rsquoBishops says children will be less rather than more safe if mandatory reporting requiredTwenty-five years after the end of a rabies-inspired ban, dog ownership is boomingAccused under antiquated law, Divya Spandana has case adjournedMyanmar under fire from UN over \u0026lsquogenocidal\u0026rsquo mass killings of Rohingya peopleSydney Letter: Public tired of PMs changing via party processes, rather than by voters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3620438.1536229143!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"66 new monuments reported to officials during july and august","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe record dry spell has been credited with the discovery of a previously unknown monument beside Newgrange, Co Meath. Photograph: Ciara WilkinsonAnthony MurphyThe National Monuments Service (NMS) received 66 reports of newly identified monuments during the months of July and August 2018, it has confirmed.Many of the new reports relate “to features identified through crop-marks or scorch-marks which had become visible on account of the dry weather,” a spokesperson confirmed.Among them was a previously unknown henge near Newgrange in the Brú na Boinne Unesco World Heritage Site in Co Meath, found by Anthony Murphy using his drone. The discovery made international news headlines.Among the other sites reported over the summer are a prehistoric barrow cemetery found in Redcow near Dundalk, Co Louth by Matthew Kelly who was trying to locate a site once described as Ireland’s Stonehenge.Mr Kelly also took drone footage of two ringfort enclosures in the nearby Glebe and Lisdoo townlands and the NMS estimates the range of monuments recorded across all sites date from 2200BC to 1000AD.The NMS said that the two ringfort enclosures “were not previously known” to it, although they were visible on aerial footage taken in 1995.The sites reported by Mr Kelly in the Redcow townland were not previously known either and the NMS said, “these features probably represent a prehistoric barrow cemetery comprising up eight inidual monuments with two of the eight features being classed as enclosures which might either represent features contemporary with the barrow cemetery or later settlement activity.”It estimates that the barrows date from 2200 to 1900BC while “the two newly identified ringforts referred to NMS by Mr Kelly in Glebe and Lisdoo are likely to date to the period 500-1000AD.”Mr Kelly, who is from Lahinch in Co Clare and chief technology officer with software company DroneSAR said, “I was inspired by Anthony Murphy’s find by drone at Newgrange due to the very dry weather, and so the very next day I went to Dundalk to see if I could also find any sign of a long lost monument discovered by antiquarian Thomas Wright in 1748 which he described as Ireland’s Stonehenge.”“But by 1907 historian Henry Morris could not find any remains of the monument, it had disappeared. I (also) read about this monument in Anthony’s mythical Ireland blog a few years ago.“I arrived at what I thought was the location of the Stonehenge monument outside Dundalk with my drone to look for any markings in the ground that might indicate the presence of this monument but I could not see anything . Before I landed the drone I decided I would do a 360 pan across the horizon and it was during this that I saw the circles in two different fields in the distance.”“I found two large circular enclosures facing each other separated by a road and then at the other location where I thought there was just one circular enclosure there was actually eight in the same field.

Mr Raab was appearing before the Commons EU scrutiny committee after Brexiteer Conservatives claimed that EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, shared their enthusiasm for a Canada-style deal.“I think you need to accept the small print of the offer that is being made in relation to the appendage of the backstop the EU is proposing, which ultimately would involve a limbo period to be determined by the EU, which could proceed indefinitely,” Mr Raab said.Mr Raab was appearing before the committee alongside Theresa May’s top European affairs adviser, Olly Robbins, who faced hostile questioning from Brexiteers. Labour’s Stephen Kinnock said that Mr Barnier had told MPs during a visit to Brussels this week that Theresa May’s Chequers proposals were dead in the water.When Mr Raab asked if those were Mr Barnier’s precise words, Mr Kinnock said he believed the phrase used was “les propositions sont mortes”.During prime minister’s questions, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told Ms May that her Chequers proposal had already been ripped apart by her own party. The prime minister said the Chequers proposal remained a basis for negotiation with the EU and claimed it would fulfil the government’s promise to respect the Brexit referendum while protecting the economy and avoiding a hard border in Ireland.In Brussels on Wednesday Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said his party could not vote for a Canada-style free trade deal because it would not satisfy the criterion it has set out demanding that any deal should offer the same benefits as EU membership.“We have our six tests and it wouldn’t meet them, and I don’t think it would be approved by the Conservative Party because you have the other wing who would be concerned about the distance between a Canada deal from where we are now,” he said.“At the end, the central problem for the prime minister is always the same: she has a warring party behind her, and the two sides can’t agree sufficiently to allow her to get a deal through unless she goes for a customs union plus single market deal with shared regulations and institutions. That I think would have a majority in parliament.”Mr Starmer added: “Whatever the agreement – if there is one – it has to keep to the solemn commitment of no hard border with Northern Ireland. The only combination that will meet that commitment is a customs union with the EU and a single market deal with high alignment.”Mr Starmer said his concern was that he did not believe Ms May was strong enough to adapt her position without facing a challenge to her premiership.Labour has said it is keeping all options on the table, including that of a second referendum, should parliament fail to back any deal Ms May strikes with Brussels."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3620373.1536214985!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us politician sues sacha baron cohen for 95m over tv show appearance","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRoy Moore was interviewed by Cohen in character as Colonel Erran Morad, who waved a “paedophile detector” at Moore.

Never had an accusation of such things. Certainly, I’m not a paedophile, okay?”In legal documents lodged in Washington DC, Mr Moore accused Mr Cohen of portraying him as a sex offender.The lawsuit includes the production company behind Who Is America?, Showtime, and the show’s network, CBS.It states: “This false and fraudulent portrayal and mocking of Judge Moore as a sex offender, on national and international television, which was widely broadcast in this district on national television and worldwide, has severely harmed Judge Moore’s reputation and caused him, Mrs Moore, and his entire family severe emotional distress, as well as caused and will cause plaintiffs financial damage.”Mr Moore signed a release before appearing on the show, but alleges it is void because it was signed under false pretences.Mr Moore (71) was accused by nine women of sexual misconduct during his race for the Alabama Senate last November.

The rupee fell to 71.785 per dollar on Wednesday, although it recovered somewhat to trade at 71.915 to the dollar in early Thursday trading.This follows a previous drop to a record low of 69.62 rupees per dollar last month, in the wake of the Turkish economic crisis.Decline in the rupee came as investors abandoned emerging market assets - EM equities entered a bear market this week, marking a 20 per cent decline from their peak in January. “Investors who have been on the sidelines may think of the selloff as a good opportunity to start accumulating some oversold emerging market assets,” said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM. “However, the prospects of more US interest rate hikes, and continuing global trade tensions make it difficult to jump in.” \u0026nbspPresident Trump is expected to announce another round of tariffs on $200bn (£155bn) worth of Chinese goods in the coming days. “Going ahead with these tariffs (will) suggest that a full-blown trade war has just kicked off and more pain will be felt across the globe,” Mr Sayed added. John Ferguson, global economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit, said: “Most emerging-market economies should be able to weather this pace of economic tightening, provided that their trading conditions remain favourable. However, investors are on the alert for financial, economic or political weaknesses.”“The turbulence experienced by Argentina and Turkey in mid-2018 is a reminder of how difficult it can be for policymakers to regain market confidence where external imbalances are large and macroeconomic policy frameworks are fragile.”Mr Ferguson added: “For now, a full-blown emerging-market crisis should be averted, but we expect the number of countries seeing their currencies come under pressure to rise over the next two years. It is likely that we will see periods of volatility as the global trade dispute interacts with the shift away from easy money.”Trump’s unrelenting trade war won\u0027t push us into a recessionSouth African rand weakens as economy enters recessionChaos in Turkey feeds fears of wider emerging market crisisMeanwhile, Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, noted that the selloff in emerging markets has spread beyond Turkey and Argentina to some of the developing world’s largest economies such as Russia, Mexico, Indonesia and South Africa - the rand dropped on Wednesday after it emerged the South African economy had entered recession.“These economies are seeing a sharp selloff in both stocks and currencies which is unnerving investors, with fears of contagion sending European shares lower and contributing to a softer open on Wall Street,” said Ms Cincotta. “Whilst Turkey and Argentina started out as the weakest links in the EM space, investors have been shaken and are broadly looking to reduce their exposure with investors questioning which economies are most vulnerable and where is spill over likely.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/19/15/guinness.jpg","title":"guinness world records new edition history origins brewer ireland","story":"Created with Sketch.Shooting party dispute in 1951 gave rise to bestselling annual account of amazing achievementsClick to followThe Independent CultureA pint of the black stuffGuinness World Records\u0026nbsppublishes its latest print edition on Thursday.The book recounting record-breaking achievements from all manner of disciplines across the world is now in its 63rd edition and continues to be a bestseller, the place to go for anyone interested in finding out who is the world’s most tattooed man or who built the fastest jet-powered\u0026nbspgo-kart.The idea came about in 1951\u0026nbspwhen Sir Hugh Beaver, managing director of the world famous Irish brewery, attended a shooting party at Castlebridge\u0026nbspHouse on the River Slaney\u0026nbspin County Wexford, where the group fell to arguing about which was Europe’s fastest game bird: the golden plover or red grouse.Failing to find a reference book\u0026nbspcontaining the answer in his host’s library, Sir Hugh realised this was precisely the sort of\u0026nbspquestion that might vex drinkers chatting over a pint of the black stuff in pubs across the land.Recalling the shooting dispute in 1954, Sir Hugh pitched a Guinness promotional campaign centred around answering general knowledge trivia to the journalists Ross and Norris McWhirter, twin brothers and research specialists on London’s Fleet Street, recommended to him by\u0026nbsptheir university friend Christopher Chataway, a Guinness employee and future Conservative MP.The McWhirters agreed to compile a list of interesting facts and figures for a tome to be found on every bar top courtesy of the company, spending 13 and a half 90-hour weeks on the project.A trial run of the very first Guinness Book of Records was published in August 1954 and distributed to local watering holes.A new publishing company, Guinness Superlatives, was incorporated that November and opened\u0026nbspits doors on the top floor of 107 Ludgate House on Fleet Street, the site of an old gymnasium.After some revisions were made, the first edition of 198 pages went on sale on 27 August 1955 and topped the Christmas bestseller lists that year, flying off the shelves every year thereafter.\u0026nbspMcWhirter (Guinness World Records)Between 1972 and 2001, the BBC children’s show Record Breakers discussed achievements from the book, featuring the McWhirter\u0026nbspBrothers answering questions from the audience with the aid of their encyclopedic memories. That segment was tragically brought to a close when Ross McWhirter\u0026nbspwas assassinated by the Provisional IRA in 1975, prompting Norris to continue alone.As the book’s fame grew, the brewer found itself in the unusual position of being recognised as an international authority on a wide array of\u0026nbspworld records, providing adjudicators\u0026nbspto oversee new attempts at ever-more unlikely feats.Members of the public can apply to set a new record or break an old one via the Guinness World Records website, where many of its achievements are recorded in its “Hall of Fame”, home to free-falling astronaut Felix Baumgartner\u0026nbspand Otto the skateboarding bulldog.\u0026nbspAccording to Guinness, the book only has space to house 4,000 records out of the 40,000 the company holds.UK news in picturesCounter-terrorism police have released images of the two suspects in connection with the Salisbury attack in March.

The rupee fell to 71.785 per dollar on Wednesday, although it recovered somewhat to trade at 71.915 to the dollar in early Thursday trading.This follows a previous drop to a record low of 69.62 rupees per dollar last month, in the wake of the Turkish economic crisis.Decline in the rupee came as investors abandoned emerging market assets - EM equities entered a bear market this week, marking a 20 per cent decline from their peak in January. “Investors who have been on the sidelines may think of the selloff as a good opportunity to start accumulating some oversold emerging market assets,” said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM. “However, the prospects of more US interest rate hikes, and continuing global trade tensions make it difficult to jump in.” \u0026nbspPresident Trump is expected to announce another round of tariffs on $200bn (£155bn) worth of Chinese goods in the coming days. “Going ahead with these tariffs (will) suggest that a full-blown trade war has just kicked off and more pain will be felt across the globe,” Mr Sayed added. John Ferguson, global economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit, said: “Most emerging-market economies should be able to weather this pace of economic tightening, provided that their trading conditions remain favourable.

With Theresa May scurrying around the EU trying to deliver Brexit, Greece is\u0026nbspquite right to probe the possibility of bringing the\u0026nbsptreasures homeClick to followThe IndependentThe Elgin Marbles are still one of the most popular displays at the British MuseumIt seems unlikely that several hundred tonnes of marble from Mount Pentelicus near Athens could have a significant role to play in Brexit. But, following a letter from the Greek government to Jeremy Wright,\u0026nbspthe culture secretary, that is exactly what is now happening. Lydia Koniordou, Wright’s Greek counterpart, has asked for dialogue with Britain over the antique sculptures known as the Elgin Marbles.Brought to Britain in the early 1800s by Lord Elgin, the artworks – more properly known as the Parthenon Sculptures – have aroused excitement and controversy ever since. They first went on display in London in 1807, then from 1817 they reached an international audience from a new home in the British Museum. Everyone from Canova to Rodin declared them to be among the most exceptional sculptures ever made. Over two centuries later, they remain one of the British Museum\u0027s most popular displays.Not everyone was happy that Elgin shipped the sculptures to Britain. Lord Byron famously lamented: “Dull is the eye that will not weep to see \u0026nbspThy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed \u0026nbspBy British hands.” But few put his panegyric into context. Byron was a Romantic, who wanted the monumental art of ancient Greek civilisation to crumble poetically as decayed vestiges of lost perfection. He was also making a one-off point rather than speaking from principle, as he personally imported Greek antiquities to Britain and sold them privately.Nevertheless, Byron\u0027s mixed attitudes towards ancient Greece\u0026nbspexpress some of the challenges inherent in questions of cultural heritage, which often see a feverish mix of emotion and romance meet a hard wall of reality.“For me, the Parthenon Sculptures raise some of the biggest questions of cultural property, ownership and where works of art ‘belong’,”\u0026nbspexplains Mary Beard, professor of classics at Cambridge,\u0026nbspThe timing of Greece’s recent letter could not be more significant. Theresa May\u0027s beleaguered strategy to deliver Brexit will ultimately require the consent of all 27\u0026nbspEU members. That means inidual rounds of diplomacy with each country. Greece is taking the opportunity – quite understandably – to probe for a possible quid pro quo, which it hopes will include the Parthenon Sculptures.There have been similar requests from Greece in the past, notably in a campaign by former Greek culture minister Melina Mercouri in the 1980s. However, consecutive British governments have consistently rejected all such requests, although an unexpected door was opened in June when Jeremy Corbyn announced that any government led by him would make it a policy to give the sculptures to Greece.Corbyn\u0027s statement was based on his conviction that the sculptures “belong” to Greece. He referred to them as “stolen” and “looted” by Britain. Many share this view, including members of the British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles, or BCRPM – one of the key groups formed in the UK to press for the sculptures to be given to Greece.The British government\u0027s view goes back to 1816, when a UK Parliamentary Select Committee interviewed witnesses – including Elgin – who had been in Athens at the time, and concluded that Elgin had obtained all necessary permissions from the Ottoman authorities in Athens to remove the sculptures and transport them to England. The Select Committee then voted, 82 to 30, to acquire the sculptures for the nation, before presenting them to the British Museum for public display, scholarship, enlightenment and enjoyment.In many circles, however, there are misgivings about Britain claiming ownership over antiquities that manifestly were not made in Britain. This feeling is tinged with even more awkwardness as the sculptures were acquired during the age of Empire: a period not known for its cultural sensitivity.However, these are generalities. The Parthenon Sculptures have a well-documented and unique history which sheds important light on the controversy.Around 480BC, Athens was entering its Golden Age. It had finally seen off Persia, and the philosophers and playwrights we revere as the founders of western civilisation were starting to tread its sun-hardened streets.Pericles, the city’s leader from around 461BC, decided to mark the city’s new influence and affluence with a vast building project. One of its highlights was to be a magnificent new temple to Athena the Maiden (Parthenos) built on the Acropolis, the city\u0027s highest hill. To ensure the temple was the envy of all, Pericles commissioned one of the city’s sculptors, Pheidias, to decorate the sacred building with a scheme of sculpture that would transport visitors from earth up onto Mount Olympus itself.The artisans in Pheidias’s workshop hacked and smoothed the white marble until eventually the pieces – once vividly painted – were hoisted up onto the great temple. Onlookers were agog, and anyone looking at the sculptures today will know why. The bodies throb with life. The skin appears warm and real to the touch. The gossamer drapery flows as if in natural motion. And the drama of the scenes is charged with an ethereal tension and electricity that is almost unparalleled in art. There are few major sculptors in the last two hundred years who have not looked on them and felt cowed.Once the classical world of mercurial gods and goddesses faded and the era of Christianity dawned, the sculptures began to suffer. Around AD500, the citizens of Athens defaced many and hacked off others in order to convert the Parthenon into a church. This systematic iconoclasm was the single largest act of destruction in the sculptures\u0027 history. Further damage occurred in 1687 when an invading Venetian force bombarded the Acropolis with mortars and scored a direct hit on the Parthenon, which was being used by the ruling Ottomans as an explosives store.The Ottomans – who had conquered Athens in 1456 – are a key player in what was to happen next. In 1799, Thomas Bruce, seventh Earl of Elgin, was appointed Britain’s ambassador to the “Sublime Porte” of the Ottoman Empire at Constantinople. According to some sources, inspired to allow the people and artists of Europe to enjoy the wonders of ancient Greek art, Elgin spent his own money on commissioning artists and sculptors to draw, paint and take casts of the Parthenon Sculptures and other statuary and stonework in Athens.When Elgin\u0027s men arrived in Athens, they found the Ottomans had turned the Acropolis into a military garrison, and soldiers were using the sculptures on the Parthenon for firearms target practice, and hacking bits off to sell to the growing throngs of tourists on the Grand Tour. By this time the Parthenon had only around half of the sculptures that Pheidias originally placed there, with many in poor condition. Mary Beard explains: “The Acropolis was then a rather sordid Turkish military base, and it would have been easy to convince oneself – rightly or wrongly – that the sculpture was better off out of there.”Elgin’s men then began overseeing the removal of the sculptures. Over the course of 10 years, they used local labourers to take down around half of the sculptures on the building (a quarter of the originals), which Elgin shipped back to Britain.Those\u0026nbsp10 years, 1800-10, lie at the heart of the whole Elgin controversy. Opinions ide. Some say Elgin was a hero and conservator who saved the sculptures for the world. Others, like Paul Cartledge, professor of Greek Culture emeritus at Cambridge, differ: “I believe,” he says, “Elgin had purely self-aggrandising reasons for seeking to acquire – for himself and his own personal display – as many of the Marbles as he could.”The 1816 UK Parliamentary select committee concluded otherwise. After examining witnesses and records, it noted that in 1801 Elgin had obtained a firman – an Ottoman legal permit – which, according to a translation shown to them, permitted Elgin to make drawings, create casts and take away “any pieces of stone with inscriptions or figures”.The BCRPM and other reunificationists stress that Parliament did not see the original firman, and so the permit\u0027s specific terms remain unknown. Moreover, they say, even the translated version does not explicitly envisage the wholesale removal of so much sculpture. Elgin was, they say, guilty of mission creep.Whichever view is right, another angle to the question is that Elgin, as ambassador, had the power of the British state behind him. Britain had just defeated Napoleon, who was also an enemy of the Ottomans. Britain was therefore in good odour at the Ottoman court, and Elgin was in a position to ask for favours. “Elgin,” Paul Cartledge believes, “certainly unquestionably exploited the fraught international situation c. 1800, whereby Britain was the enemy of the Ottoman Sultan\u0027s (French) enemy and therefore the Sultan\u0027s ‘friend’.”Those who view Elgin in a more kindly light point to the fact all this removal work was not done covertly or surreptitiously. It was carried out over a period of 10 years, in broad daylight, in central Athens, using hundreds of Greek labourers, under the noses of the authorities, and was even revalidated by a second firman in 1810 when the work was complete and French diplomats tried to hold up the last shipment\u0026nbsp(the French were hoping that they might get some of the sculptures for the Louvre).\u0026nbspThis leads to one of the central disagreements in the whole debate. Greece – aided by allies, including Britain and British philhellenes who had been inspired by seeing the Parthenon Sculptures in London – overthrew the Ottomans in 1832 and restored Greek government. The BCRPM therefore asks how the Ottomans can have given Elgin valid authority to remove the sculptures when they were an illegitimate occupying power.However, the lawyers don’t see it this way. When the Greek government instructed Amal Clooney and Geoffrey Robertson to advise them in 2014, the Syriza government eventually decided that the route to gaining the sculptures was political and diplomatic rather than legal. This came as a surprise to no one. In 1985, Professor John Henry Merryman of Stanford Law School, a leading authority on cultural property, examined the case for restitution and concluded that the modern state of Greece had no legal, moral, or ethical claim to the sculptures.Archaeological treasures of Ancient GreeceThis golden death mask was discovered in the ruins of ancient Mycenae in 1876 by Heinrich Schliemann after he went looking for the palace of Agamemnon, a central figure in the Trojan War.

The figures’ heads are in AthensA wall painting from a house in Akrotiri, Santorini, which was covered with ash from a volcanic eruption in about 1,500BC. It shows swallows swooping among clusters of red lilliesOne of the reasons for this is that by the time Elgin’s men arrived in Athens in 1800, the Ottomans had ruled Greece for almost 350 years. Countries are forever changing hands, and the Ottomans were, in fact and law, the internationally recognised government of the day. Who else, many ask, should or could Elgin have requested for permission to remove the sculptures to safety?When Elgin got back to Britain, he was suffering from catastrophic debt. He estimated he had spent around £73,600\u0026nbsp(around £3.5m in today’s money) bringing the sculptures to Britain. Parliament offered him £35,000 for the lot, which he accepted. The sculptures went to the British Museum. “It is a myth that Elgin profited hugely from \u0027getting\u0027 the marbles,” Mary Beard explains. “His wife walked out, and he faced bankruptcy, which prompted the sale to the government.” Elgin moved to France, where he died, broken and bankrupt.Once on display in London, the sculptures caused a sensation and started waves of fashion for Greek art and civilisation. “The marbles in London were a vital catalyst for 19th-century Europe\u0027s passion for Greek culture,” explains Dr Greg Sullivan, a leading sculpture historian. “The marbles got into the bloodstream of contemporary 19th-century art. If you attended the Royal Academy art schools or the Derby Mechanics Institute, or if you visited Oxford, Cambridge or Wisbech art galleries, you would be greeted with copies of the statues or casts from the Parthenon frieze.“Flaxman, Westmacott, Gibson, Chantrey. Leighton and Alma-Tadema all acknowledged their influence. It demonstrates how passion for European culture has been a key part of Britishness for centuries, Plaster casts by the British artists Westmacott and Brucciani were given or sold all over Europe to courts and art schools in Germany, Italy, Spain and elsewhere, accelerating the passion for Hellenic civilization. Henning’s miniature relief copies of the frieze were sold and pirated in Paris, Rome, Munich and Vienna.”The sculptures Elgin left in Athens did not fare well. Pollution from the oil refinery at nearby Eleusis eroded many into furry vestiges of their former glories, and a restoration from 1895-1933 by Nicholaos Balanos stapled the sculptures with iron bars which expanded, shattering sections of marble. Fortunately, the casts commissioned by Elgin preserved the details of these sculptures, and have enabled replicas to be made. The British Museum also came in for criticism for an overly abrasive cleaning program in the late 1930s, when it was fashionable to make antique sculptures gleam bright white. However, it was nothing that was not being done at the time to artefacts all over the world, including in Greece. The British Museum subsequently conducted a full investigation, held a conference, and published all results.Looking at all the evidence, Mary Beard concludes: “We must not turn a blind eye to all the problems here, but we should put them in their historical context, without whitewashing or demonising Elgin.”Amal\u0026nbspClooney\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspGeoffrey Robertson over the Elgin Marbles (Getty)The Elgin Marbles controversy does not, of course, begin and end with Elgin and the wording of his permits. A broader question – which is an increasingly important one – transcends the legal technicalities and asks whether an increasingly culturally sensitive world should be engaging in a general amnesty of cultural artefacts.It is now a real question whether museums should – as a moral act – send objects to the places they were made.\u0026nbspThere can be strong arguments in favour. Some were looted in war. Some would bring tourism to their home regions. Some have ongoing cultural meaning. “To me, the legality of the matter is the least important thing,” says Paul\u0026nbspCartledge. “We don\u0027t actually know what the Sultan\u0027s firman actually permitted Elgin to do. The most important thing is to see what remains of the sculptures – from the British Museum and elsewhere – reunified where they properly can be best appreciated, in the New Acropolis Museum of Athens.”However, against this view is the inevitable sense of loss the world would feel if its principal museums were emptied out. These great “encyclopaedic” or “universal” museums – largely products of the age of Enlightenment – offer a unique opportunity for everyone to experience the interrelationship of all things. In these museums\u0027 vast collections – in Paris, Berlin, St Petersburg, London, Athens and elsewhere – visitors gaze into other cultures, not just into a reflection of their own. They are museums of humanity.Dr Tiffany Jenkins, expert in museums and cultural property, sees strong reasons for artefacts remaining spread around the globe. “The question we should ask is, where is best for the object, in terms of truth, access and preservation? The present situation – where half the remaining sculptures are in Athens and the rest are in London – is a good one. It means the marbles can be seen and understood both in Athens, in the Acropolis Museum close to where they were created, and in London, where they are placed within a universal collection of artefacts from multiple human civilisations.” It is a powerful alternative vision to the idea of restitution, aimed at promoting a wider appreciation of the sculptures.” Jenkins continues: “Like time machines, these museums provide historical context and cross-cultural insight.”The idea of returning objects to their place of origin can also be a challenge if history has moved on. Greece, for instance, did not exist when Pheidias made the sculptures. The Parthenon was a resolutely Athenian project, with the temple used as a treasury for protection money Athens collected from the other Greek city states in the Delian League. Dr James Campbell, fellow in art history and architecture at Cambridge, notes: “It is worth remembering that the Parthenon itself was built on the proceeds of war and taxation and came to be seen by many parts of the Greek world as a symbol of Athenian oppression. It was filled with goods stolen and looted from other cultures.” The Delian League evoked such resentment that it prompted a civil war in which Sparta supplanted Athens as most influential power in the region. So although Greece is unarguably the place where the sculptures were made, they were never a symbol of Greek unity, ancient or modern.“Throughout history, goods have passed across borders and moved from one place to another. Much art fits into this category,”\u0026nbspCampbell continues.\u0026nbsp“Our galleries are full of Italian Masters, Dutch landscapes, French Impressionists. No one is suggesting that every Italian Master belongs to the Italian government. Why, then, do we think the Elgin Marbles belong to the Greek government? Or indeed that the Elgin marbles should be swapped for a better Brexit deal?”AFPGetty)Allied to the question of geographical heritage is yet another, more philosophical, perspective. It asks what an object is, and whether an artefact can have more than one identity or tell more than one story. Seen this way, Pheidias\u0027s carvings are simultaneously the Parthenon Sculptures and the Elgin Marbles, and who is to say that both stories should not be told?Dr Tiffany Jenkins elaborates further. “The sculptures have been discarded as well as venerated, seen as historical documents as well as artworks. In the early 19th-century, the Royal Academician Ozias Humphrey, thought them a\u0026nbsp‘mass of ruins’. Most recently at the British Museum they were the centrepiece of a superb exhibition that shed light on the sculpture of Auguste Rodin.”The future of the Parthenon Sculptures is undeniably a decision for Parliament. The British Museum is governed by statute and has no power to give away objects in its collection unless they are duplicates or unfit for retention. Museums also have little interest in the heated and politicised aspects to these debates. On a day-to-day level, museum curators in London, Athens and around the world share with each other and with the public their research, knowledge and an overwhelming love for the objects they care for.16th century Spanish sculpture hit with botched restoration attemptChristo\u0027s latest sculpture weighs 600 tons (and it floats)North Korea displays ice sculptures of ballistic missileHowever, as the recent Greek overture for negotiations shows, one day Parliament may be called upon to make a decision in the case of the sculptures, and perhaps that day will be soon. But the complex, multidimensional questions raised by the Parthenon Sculptures will need to be appreciated in all their shades and nuances. It will simply not do, as Corbyn has done, to fire from the hip and label them as “stolen” property. Neither can the consequences for universal museums be brushed aside, as if the Parthenon Sculptures go, there will inevitably be calls for a mass resettlement of holdings from across the world.“Today, most school children do not learn Greek,” says James Campbell. “Perhaps the sad reason we are even contemplating giving the contents of the British Museum to the current Greek government is that so few British people understand what the Elgin Marbles are, or care.”Any decision on the future of the Parthenon Sculptures should be a reasoned and responsible one. It is unarguable that more people have seen and fallen in love with Greek sculpture and ancient Greece in the free-to-enter British Museum than in the museum in Athens. The sculptures’ future must be assessed for the good of the world. The Elgin Marbles do not belong to the Conservative Party, and they must not be reduced to a cheap chip in the chaotic poker game of Brexit.Dr Dominic Selwood is a historian and barrister.

One believes that the Labour leader’s radicalism in this area is a political weakness or a distraction that should be set aside to ensure focus on domestic policy, the party’s strength. The other side takes the view that not only are there important principles at stake, but that in fact Corbyn has some compelling iding lines to draw here with his opponents and predecessors.\u0026nbspSo long as Corbyn remains leader, it is the latter camp that is likely to win out. The prominence of foreign policy is simply an unavoidable fact of life for any British government or opposition, irrespective of any desire to focus on the domestic. The UK is a permanent member of the UN Security Council, a nuclear power, one of a tiny minority of states capable of projecting military power on an intercontinental basis, and one of the largest economies in the world.\u0026nbspCorbyn’s stances in this area will continue to be shaped by his longstanding worldview, and the fact that the recent furore over his participation in a Palestinian wreath laying ceremony in 2014 has had no discernible effect on Labour in the polls means that there is little incentive for him to change course.\u0026nbspIt may be, however, that the underlying premise of this disagreement at the top of the party is a faulty one. Because when we look seriously at the actual substance of Labour’s foreign policy, what we find is not particularly radical. Corbyn’s personal philosophy on international affairs may be sharply different from that of the political class, but the concrete set of policies Labour espouses under his leadership are (to make a strictly analytical rather than a value judgement), mildly reformist, not revolutionary.\u0026nbspLabour’s current policy position is set out in four key texts: Corbyn’s speech to the foreign policy think tank Chatham House in May 2017, his brief speech in response to the Manchester Arena bombing that same month, a speech to the United Nations in Geneva in December 2017, and the party’s 2017 election manifesto. The defining themes throughout are the importance of international law and the UN system, the value of multilateral and inclusive dialogue to avoid or de-escalate conflict, and the urgency of tackling global poverty and inequality. Scholars of international relations looking to categorise this overall stance are likely to find liberal multilateralism –\u0026nbspa conventional tradition in the academic literature –\u0026nbspto be the closest fit.\u0026nbspThis is not to imply any sense of business-as-usual. Corbyn’s strongly sceptical view of western military interventionism, together with his critique of corporate-friendly globalisation, situate his policy platform firmly on the left-hand edge of the liberal multilateralist paradigm, and at odds with a great many of its adherents. But these are hardly off-the-wall positions in the context of numerous western policy failures (from the Iraq war to the financial crisis) over the past two decades, and align to some degree with a growing disquiet in the centre left of established thinking.\u0026nbspOne of Corbyn’s most ostensibly challenging positions was the one articulated after the bombings in Manchester during last year’s general election campaign, when he argued that a connection exists between western military interventions in the context of the “war on terror”\u0026nbspand the persistence of the terrorist threat. Again, within the academic literature on non-state violence this is an entirely mainstream and unremarkable analysis\u0026nbspwhen taken with Corbyn’s acknowledgement of the importance of other factors, such as the ideological outlook of the terrorists and their socioeconomic backgrounds. It is also a common view amongst the general public, with 53 per cent of those subsequently polled agreeing with Corbyn’s analysis versus 24 per cent who disagreed, and with voters across all parties more likely to agree with him than not. What generates near hysteria from media pundits and political opponents elicits merely a shrug elsewhere.“Radicalism”\u0026nbspis a relative term. While the formal foreign policies of Corbyn’s Labour are hardly radical when set against the spectrums of expert or public opinion, the underlying view of the international scene that guides Corbyn personally on these matters is very much at odds with that of the political class, and this perhaps is the real source of tension.AFPGetty)Like many on the left of his generation, Corbyn is a product of the 1960s peace movement, opposition to the Vietnam war, and the global campaign against apartheid. His worldview is one that sees modern international relations – specifically the large imbalances in military power and economic autonomy – as the product of centuries of formal empire, out of which a more informal system of quasi-imperialism has evolved in recent decades.\u0026nbspThis sharply contradicts the conventional wisdom of the political establishment, articulated by former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband, that “if the world is increasingly ided between firefighters and arsonists then Britain has, for centuries, been a firefighter”. Many in the global south do not recognise this version of history, to put it mildly. For them, and for much of the grassroots left in Britain, global north states such as the UK are not inherently benign actors, and have in fact long presented a challenge, and even a danger to, the nations and peoples of the south. Evidently Corbyn shares this view – an authentically radical one in relative if not objective terms – and this rather than his formal policy programme seems to be the actual cause of the resentment from his opponents and detractors. There is a palpable sense that Corbyn is regarded by a significant number of them as not just mistaken but treacherous – his crime being a refusal to uphold the official faith in the inherent virtue of British power in the world.\u0026nbspUK news in picturesFormer Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown speaks during the \u0027Jewish Labour Movement Conference\u0027 An inflatable caricature balloon of Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan floats, near Parliament Square in London.

Corbyn’s vision of future UK relations with the global south were set out most clearly in his December 2017 Geneva speech to the UN, where he advocated for British participation in UN peacekeeping missions, a crackdown on tax havens to help protect the fiscal autonomy of developing states, a marked increase in support for refugees, and a stronger response to global warming. There is little reason to suspect that this is a mild veneer disguising a revolutionary reality. Those who knew Corbyn best during his days in the political wilderness affirm that he could never be heard expressing support for violent struggle, with the hard-left former MP George Galloway referring to him rather sniffily as a “woolly Californian”. So even in that area of foreign relations most closely associated with his radicalism – relations with the global south –there is little in his formal policy stances to seriously offend the average genuine liberal, whatever deeper philosophical differences they may have with him.This potential, practical common ground between Corbyn and more pragmatic elements of the centre left is reflected in the resemblance between his preference for dialogue over conflict and that of Barack Obama. In the American context, Obama was the reaction to George W Bush, just as Corbyn was a reaction in the British context to Bush’s valet, Tony Blair. Although each come from different political starting points, they share a scepticism that conflicts can be solved militarily, and a willingness to point to the experiences of the 2000s to underline the point.\u0026nbspObama’s presidency should not be sentimentalised in hindsight, given, to take one example, the active enabling role his administration took in Saudi Arabia’s devastating war on Yemen, and his culpability in the resulting humanitarian disaster. But on Iran at least, Obama took a view (under considerable fire from his opponents) which Corbyn would recognise, namely that diplomacy is most required precisely with people we dislike, and is almost always preferable to military conflict.\u0026nbspHere, Obama’s approach was a direct rebuke to that of his predecessor. When Iran offered a “grand bargain”\u0026nbspto the Bush administration in 2003, offering to withdraw support for Hamas and Hezbollah, sign up to the Arab peace initiative for a two-state settlement to the Israel-Palestine conflict, and submit to nuclear inspections in return for a normalisation of relations, the offer was summarily rejected by Washington on the grounds that “we don’t talk to evil”. It is likely that a lot of subsequent pain in the region could have been avoided had that door not been slammed shut, and Obama’s push for the nuclear deal during his presidency was part of an effort to revive these possibilities, reintegrate Iran into the international system and thus de-escalate wider conflicts and tensions. The other parties to the deal have worked hard to maintain it after President Trump walked away, demonstrating the fact that its strategic wisdom remains widely appreciated.Miliband (pictured with Hillary Clinton) said: ‘If the world is ided between firefighters and arsonists then Britain has\u0026nbspfor centuries\u0026nbspbeen a firefighter’ – a view sharply contradicted by the Labour leader\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)Obama was notoriously careful about spending political capital, and his drive to secure the Iran deal resulted in weaker stances elsewhere, not least on Israel-Palestine where he showed a consistent unwillingness to apply the serious pressure on Israel that any fair resolution to the conflict will require. Israel-Palestine is the issue area where Corbyn is politically weakest due to Labour’s much discussed problems with anti-Semitism, but his policy stance itself is an entirely conventional one: support for a two-state settlement with “a secure Israel alongside a secure and viable state of Palestine”. Moreover, the wisdom of emphasising diplomacy over the “we don’t talk to evil” approach is clearly one that could be usefully applied to this case.When Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian elections, a hypothetical Prime Minister Corbyn at that time might have urged the west to take the approach it eventually took with Iran on the nuclear issue: one that says “we don’t like your ideology or your policies, but we recognise that it’s better to talk through our problems if possible”. Instead, the new government was cast beyond the pale and sanctioned, leading to a civil war between the key Palestinian parties, the isolation of Gaza, over a decade of immiserating siege, several rounds of devastating violence between Hamas and the Israeli military, and the total collapse of the peace process. The recent acceptance from Hamas of a two-state settlement (a position long in gestation within its leadership) hints at the possibilities of what might have transpired had the diplomatic approach been taken from the start. Again, a good deal of pain over the past decade might have been avoided.\u0026nbspOne of the reasons that Obama, a cautious moderate, arrived at a similar place to the more philosophically radical Corbyn in respect of the question of diplomacy over conflict is the experiences of the past decade and a half in Iraq and Afghanistan, and in Libya on his own watch. While Corbyn and Obama would disagree about whether these ventures were crimes or merely mistakes, the upshot places them in the same reality. The application of western military force is repeatedly showing itself in practice to be a futile and destructive endeavour, making the search for negotiated settlements, even in situations as unpromising as Syria, the more attractive or least unattractive proposition. Whether one likes it or not, the west is apparently unable to impose its will militarily on the global south as it once could, forcing a shift of emphasis to diplomacy irrespective of whether that is taken up with reluctance or enthusiasm.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn should back a Final Say on the referendumTrump and Obama’s foreign policies are unexpectedly similarThe deeper trends in international relations are also driving in this direction. The end of the Cold War may have given the west a deceptive notion of its own omnipotence, but the slow and steady return of global south powers such as China and India to the levels of international prestige they enjoyed before the ravages of European colonialism only serves to further underline the point that a reliance on mere strength – military, diplomatic or economic – will not serve the global north states well going forward.\u0026nbspAdjusting to these new realities is proving challenging for some in Washington and London. Senior Obama aide Ben Rhodes referred contemptuously to the US foreign policy establishment as “the Blob”, in his frustration with its resistance to his boss’s approach. Across the Atlantic, one senior British general went so far as to threaten a mutiny if Corbyn made any attempt to “emasculate and shrink” the armed forces. Quite the revealing turn of phrase. But the fact remains that the experience of the “war on terror”\u0026nbsphas been a political disaster for Anglo-American militarism, creating space for less chauvinistic figures –\u0026nbspfrom Obama to Ed Miliband to Corbyn – to emerge from various points on the liberal-to-left spectrum, and raising the prospect of some significant policy changes in the future.\u0026nbspNotwithstanding the current right-wing moment in both the UK and the US, the long-term demographic trends point to an inexorable shift in the political balance of power in favour of the Democratic and Labour parties, both of whom have been experiencing internal left-wing insurgencies to varying degrees. There is now a fair prospect of a future President Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren making some degree of common cause on the international stage with a future Prime Minister Corbyn. And while this would not herald a strictly revolutionary change in Anglo-American foreign relations, it would represent a very real and important departure from the days of Bush and Blair.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/06/09/bunsen-burner-1988.jpg","title":"asbestos bunsen burner heatproof gauze mats schools hse nasuwt","story":"Created with Sketch.Government writes urgent letter to all secondary schools and colleges advising them to \u0027remove and dispose of potentially hazardous mesh gauze used in science lessons\u0027Click to followThe IndependentBritish children conducting an experiment with a Bunsen burner in May 1988. The white heat resistant circles, visible in the middle of the gauze, have been found to comprise up to 30 per cent asbestosPupils at UK secondary schools may have been exposed to asbestos from heatproof gauze mats used with Bunsen burners as far back as 1976, after the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said two companies had been supplying the deadly material to schools for decades.As the new school year begins, science teachers have been warned not to use their stocks of heatproof mats and to remove them from classrooms and “seal them with tape”, until their certification with suppliers has been established, or they have been given the all clear after laboratory tests.The risk of exposure remains “low”, the HSE said, and has told the companies to stop supplying the mats to schools, adding they were working to establish which schools were affected.Childrens\u0027 crayons found to contain asbestos and other toxinsSchools are struggling to manage ‘serious’ threat of asbestosClaire\u0027s makeup kit found to contain asbestos by motherAsbestos in schools \u0027scandal\u0027 is putting pupils and teachers in dangerAs it is impossible to\u0026nbspestablish which of the metal mats contain\u0026nbspthe deadly carcinogen and which do\u0026nbspnot, schools would have had no indication the materials were unsafe.An HSE spokesperson said: “Although the risk of exposure is low, we took action as soon as we were informed.HSE Inspectors ensured supply of the asbestos-containing gauze mats stopped immediately. We got the message out as soon as possible and alerted schools, colleges and others to the issue, providing precautionary advice on how to check if they are affected and if so what to do next.“Our investigation into the circumstances that led to these particular gauze mats coming into circulation is on-going. As part of this, HSE inspectors have served enforcement notices on both companies to ensure that all affected mats are disposed of safely.”But the NASUWT teaching union has written to the Department of Education saying the length of time the companies have been selling products containing asbestos to schools “beggars belief”, and demanded the names of the two suppliers be made public.Chris Keates, the NASUWT General Secretary said: “It is shocking that suppliers, clearly it seems only interested in profit not people, have distributed such life-threatening equipment to schools, putting children and teachers and other staff at risk. “It beggars belief that this situation has been allowed to happen for so long, possibly as far back as 1976.“Whilst it is to be welcomed that the HSE Executive have highlighted this major hazard to the health of children and young people and all those who work on school sites, it is unacceptable that the two suppliers involved have not been named.”She added: “The NASUWT believes that the suppliers must be named immediately, not only to enable schools to identify if they have used the suppliers and therefore may have this potentially deadly material on site, \u0026nbspbut also so that they can be held accountable by those whose health may well have been damaged by using this equipment.“The fact that the HSE has told these suppliers to immediately stop sending the gauze to schools, highlights the seriousness of this issue.”The gauze mats, placed on tripods above Bunsen burners during science lessons, have a white heat-resistant pad at the centre. The presence of tremolite asbestos, which makes up 20-30 per cent of the heat-resistant material, was discovered after testing, HealthandSafetyatWork reports. Tremolite has needle-like fibres and is considered as toxic as chrysotile or white asbestos, the most common form of asbestos in the UK and worldwide.UK news in picturesCounter-terrorism police have released images of the two suspects in connection with the Salisbury attack in March.

She denied Home Office claims that she received a letter\u0026nbspin March stating her son’s passport had been revoked.Critics have branded the case “truly shocking” and said the act of blocking a UK-born child from returning home was “shameful” and “exactly one of the effects” of the government’s hostile environment policy.The boy is currently staying in Brussels with friends of his mother.\u0026nbspMs Keita is in the UK and unable to travel because she was residing in the country based on her son’s British citizenship.Speaking three days after her son was prevented\u0026nbspfrom returning home, Ms Keita said: “When my friend told me what had happened from the airport, I couldn’t believe it. I was very... dead inside. I can’t explain the feeling. It was very difficult.\u0026nbsp“I never received a letter. I called them about the problem on Sunday and they sent me it in an email.

I can’t do anything for my son to see me. I really miss him. I can’t believe it. I keep thinking it must be a dream.”The Home Office letter, which is dated March 2018 but which Ms Keita said she received for the first time\u0026nbspin email\u0026nbspon Sunday, states\u0026nbspthat the child’s claim to British citizenship was no longer valid because it had “come to light” that the man she was married to at the time of his birth was not settled in Britain.But Ms Keita said that this man was her Guinea-based ex-husband whom she was in the process of orcing.

But this shows their reassurances are worthless,” she added.Amnesty International’s head of advocacy, Allan Hogarth, meanwhile said:\u0026nbsp“The refusal to allow six-year-old Mohamed Bangoura to return home to his mother is a deeply disturbing and shameful move by the Home Office.\u0026nbsp“Children across the UK are suffering from the harmful effects of the UK’s hostile immigration system. An estimated 120,000 are currently stuck in limbo, denied their right to citizenship and facing unaffordable and profit-making fees.\u0026nbsp“We urge the Home Office to allow Mohamed to return home to his mother, and urgently review its child citizenship policies and fees.”In response, a Home Office spokesperson said: “A letter was sent to Mohamed’s mother in March advising her that her son’s passport had been revoked. We understand that despite this Mohamed was taken out of the UK in July and last Sunday was unable to re-enter as he did not hold a valid passport.​“The immigration minister has asked officials to

UK would vote 59-41 to stay in EU, according to new pollBritons would choose to stay in the European Union if given the option now, according to a new opinion poll that showed the highest support for European Union (EU) membership since the 2016 referendum.In total, 59 per cent of voters would vote to remain in the bloc, while 41 percent\u0026nbspwould opt to leave, the survey published as part of an academic led report\u0026nbspby research bodies\u0026nbspNatCen\u0026nbspand the UK in a Changing Europe.\u0026nbspJust over two years ago when voters went to polls in June 2016,\u0026nbsp48 per cent voted to remain and 52 per cent voted to leave.\u0026nbspHowever,\u0026nbspthe poll’s author caveated the findings by saying the interview panel was skewed towards remain and some of those who changed their minds did not take part in the original Brexit referendum.\u0026nbspAnalysis of different polls by seen by The Independent\u0026nbspearlier this week found more than 2.6 million people had abandoned their support for Brexit and now back staying in the EU.If that number had voted to remain in 2016, Britain would still be a member of the EU.\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its own campaign for a Final Say on the Brexit deal\u0026nbspand to date, 750,000\u0026nbsppeople have signed our\u0026nbsppetition calling for a second referendum.Polling expert Sir John Curtice, the author of the new report, cautioned that those interviewed reported they had voted 53 per cent in favour of remain in the referendum — a five\u0026nbsppercentage point higher proportion than the actual vote.“Nevertheless, this still means that there has apparently been a six-point swing from Leave to Remain, larger than that registered by any of our previous rounds of interviewing, and a figure that would seemingly point to a 54 per cent (remain) vote in any second referendum held now,” Sir John\u0026nbspsaid in the report.Speaking at an event to launch it, he added the findings were broadly in line with those of other pollsters, whom he said showed an average of 52.5 per cent support for remain.“Don’t get excited as to think this is some poll that shows a dramatic shift to remain,” Sir John said. “The apparent thin lead that remain have is at least in part built on the potential sand of the responses of those who did not vote two years ago.”Britain is due to leave the

Sir John\u0026nbspadded that subsequent polling data, not included in the report, had shown the plan had little support from the public and was unlikely to have reversed voters’ pessimism.He said the results of the polling showed that the most influential factor over whether voters will support the conclusion of the negotiations is their perception of its economic effect rather than the details of any deal.Reuters contributed to this reportThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/04/07/14/manfred-weber.jpg","title":"manfred weber angela merkel eu european parliament elections 2019 lead candidate epp michel barnier","story":"Created with Sketch.German politician aims for EU top jobClick to followIndy PoliticsManfred Weber, the leader of the European Parliament\u0027s biggest political grouping (Getty)The most senior Brussels politician from Angela Merkel’s political alliance has launched a bid to become the next president of the European Commission.Manfred Weber, who leads the largest group in the European Parliament, the centre-right EPP, said he would “bring Europe back to the people” if he was selected as its candidate in the upcoming elections.Mr Weber, the most senior German MEP, is at a domestic level the member of Germany’s CSU political party – the Bavarian sister party that has been in alliance with Ms Merkel’s CDU since 1949.He is entering a crowded field to win the candidacy for president, with EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier also thought to want the role.Representatives from the 50 centre-right EPP parties in the EU will meet in Helsinki in November to decide who their lead candidate – or “spitzencandidate” should be for the 2019 European elections.Whoever is picked as the EPP’s candidate is very likely to become the next Commission president as the EPP is expected to come top in the European elections in 2019.Mr Weber’s candidacy is likely to face opposition from some parties on the grounds that he is a German politician – with many countries anxious about alleged German domination of the EU institutions.Europe is at a turning point. The 2019 European elections will decide the future of the EU“Europe is at a turning point. The 2019 European elections will decide the future of the EU,” Mr Weber said in a statement on social media.“Today is about the self-assertion of Europe and the defence of our values, because we are being challenged from the outside and the inside. It’s about the survival of our European way of life.“We cannot go on as we are now in the EU. I will help bring Europe back to the people and re-establish the bond between citizens and the European Union. I want to kick start a new chapter in the EU.\u0026nbsp“I want to become the EPP\u0027s lead candidate for the 2019 European Elections and be the next President of the European Commission. Europe needs a new beginning and more democracy.”AFPGetty)In recent months Mr Weber has taken a tough rhetorical line on immigration and migration, in an apparent bid to position himself for the role. In January he was forced to apologise for a comment in which he called for a “final solution to the refugee question”. He later said he regretted the choice of words after it was pointed out that they resembled a Nazi slogan.The European Commission president is chosen through a convoluted process based on the most recent set up European Parliament election results.\u0026nbsp The European Council votes by weighted qualified majority for a candidate, taking into account the results of the elections.\u0026nbspEuropean commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations with Britain, French Michel Barnier listens at the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker speaking at the European Parliament in StrasbourgFrank-Walter Steinmeier, President of the Federal Republic of Germany, delivers his speech at the European Parliament in StrasbourgEuropean Union\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, President of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), addresses the European Parliament during a debate on Brexit priorities and the upcomming talks on the UK\u0027s withdrawal from the EUMichel Barnier, European Chief Negotiator for Brexit reacts during a meeting at the European Parliament in StrasbourgMember of the European Parliament and former leader of the anti-EU UK Independence Party (UKIP) Nigel Farage wears socks with Union Jack flag at the European Parliament in StrasbourgNigel Farage, United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) member and MEP, addresses the European Parliament during a debate on Brexit priorities and the upcoming talks on the UK\u0027s withdrawal from the EUEuropean commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations with Britain, French Michel Barnier gestures  during speeches at the European Parliament in StrasbourgThe President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker (L) speaks with European commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations with Britain, French Michel Barnier at the European Parliament in StrasbourgEuropean Union\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, President of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), addresses the European Parliament during a debate on Brexit priorities and the upcomming talks on the UK\u0027s withdrawal from the EUGerman president Frank-Walter Steinmeier delivers a speech during a plenary session at the European Parliament in StrasbourgThe European Parliament in Strasbourg, eastern FranceEuropean commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations with Britain, French Michel Barnier listens at the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker speaking at the European Parliament in StrasbourgFrank-Walter Steinmeier, President of the Federal Republic of Germany, delivers his speech at the European Parliament in StrasbourgEuropean Union\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, President of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), addresses the European Parliament during a debate on Brexit priorities and the upcomming talks on the UK\u0027s withdrawal from the EUMichel Barnier, European Chief Negotiator for Brexit reacts during a meeting at the European Parliament in StrasbourgMember of the European Parliament and former leader of the anti-EU UK Independence Party (UKIP) Nigel Farage wears socks with Union Jack flag at the European Parliament in StrasbourgNigel Farage, United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) member and MEP, addresses the European Parliament during a debate on Brexit priorities and the upcoming talks on the UK\u0027s withdrawal from the EUEuropean commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations with Britain, French Michel Barnier gestures  during speeches at the European Parliament in StrasbourgThe President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker (L) speaks with European commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations with Britain, French Michel Barnier at the European Parliament in StrasbourgEuropean Union\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, President of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), addresses the European Parliament during a debate on Brexit priorities and the upcomming talks on the UK\u0027s withdrawal from the EUGerman president Frank-Walter Steinmeier delivers a speech during a plenary session at the European Parliament in StrasbourgThe European Parliament in Strasbourg, eastern FranceIn 2014 this meant picking the “lead candidate” from the group which won the biggest candidate at the elections – in that case the EPP.

This is a fight for the soul of our party and the future of our democracy, Ms Pressley said. That movement is reshaping a Democratic Party still searching for leaders and identity in the era of Donald Trump.\u0026nbspGrassroots activists on the left have a mixed record in Democratic primaries this election year, but the self-described progressive movement has scored enough victories to suggest its popularity is based on more than just protesting the Trump White House. The movement is also remoulding the Democratic Party into a younger, more erse and decidedly liberal party.\u0026nbspAyanna Pressley and New York\u0027s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, two women of colour, both defeated Democratic incumbent congressmen in their primaries. The progressive movement has helped nominate three black Democrats for governor\u0027s seats, including a clear upset in Florida, where Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum knocked off establishment favourite Gwen Graham. Mr Graham\u0027s establishment credentials could not have been stronger. Her father, Bob, is a Florida icon who served as governor and US senator.\u0026nbspGeorgia\u0027s Stacey Abrams, meanwhile, trounced a primary opponent recruited and backed by much of her state\u0027s Democratic old guard. Ms Abrams would become the first black woman elected governor in any US state.\u0026nbspScores of other down-ballot candidates are running for local, state and federal offices with backing from grassroots groups like Inisible, MoveOn.org, the Working Families Party and the offshoot of Bernie Sanders\u0027 2016 presidential campaign, Our Revolution.\u0026nbspWhy it mattersThe ersifying, more liberal slate will be measured by the outcome in the November vote.\u0026nbspRepublicans — and some Democrats — argue that the party is going too far to the left for American voters, particularly outside of the cities and close-in suburbs where Democrats\u0027 base of white liberals and non-white voters is concentrated.\u0026nbspProgressive nominees like Ms Pressley and Ms Ocasio-Cortez are running in Democratic strongholds, so their wins in November are all but guaranteed. But Republicans will use the rise of the left — and its support for policies like single-payer health care and scrapping US Immigration and Customs Enforcement — to tar all Democratic candidates.\u0026nbspThe counter argument from Democrats and activists on the left is two-fold: 1) Many issues that more liberal candidates support — some gun regulation, expanding Medicaid, raising the minimum wage — actually have widespread public support, even among independents and some Republicans and 2) the more openly liberal candidates from outside the old-guard establishment can bring in new voters who do not regularly cast midterm ballots.\u0026nbspBeyond November, the new generation of Democrats will have a say in how the party governs. Ms Pressley and Ms Ocasio-Cortez will not determine whether Democrats pick up the 23 new House seats they need for a majority, but they will help shape the arguments within the Democratic caucus.\u0026nbspThey and their fellow freshmen will have a say in whether a new Democratic majority returns Nancy Pelosi to the speaker\u0027s chair. They will have leverage — much like the arch-conservative Freedom Caucus does with the House GOP leadership — over every debate, from health care to the potential impeachment of Mr Trump.\u0026nbspSo, for example, while there might not be enough support for a real push toward single-payer health care, the movement could draw the party toward supporting a public health insurance option to compete alongside for-profit companies selling policies in Affordable Care Act exchanges. And, even if an immediate $15 minimum wage is too heavy a lift, perhaps the left-flank forces a compromise of graduated raises over time.\u0026nbspWhat to watch out for\u0026nbspDelaware Democrat challenges incumbent as part of \u0027blue tsunami\u0027Democrats take double-digit lead over Republicans ahead of midtermsDemocrats need to focus on young people in the 2018 midterm elections Trump unprepared for impeachment and Democratic takeover: reportSanders-backed progressive could become Florida\u0027s first black governorBefore primary season concludes, there are a few more key match-ups to measure the left\u0027s influence. In Delaware, military veteran and activist Kerri Evelyn Harris is aiming on Thursday to knock off moderate Democratic Senator Tom Carper. She is a big underdog, but even a competitive finish will serve notice anew that incumbents must at least contend with the left base. Similar dynamics exist in New York, where actress Cynthia Nixon is trying to topple Governor Andrew Cuomo in a 13 September primary.\u0026nbspSome of the most intent observers of the party\u0027s evolution are the gaggle of aspiring presidential candidates. Certainly, some of those figures have helped drive the shift — Mr Sanders and his 2016 campaign, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and her outspoken economic populism.\u0026nbspBut Mr Sanders, Ms Warren and the rest are also careful to watch the base and not get caught flat-footed as it evolves. That is one reason potential candidates like Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris and former Vice President Joe Biden have made sure that their endorsement and campaign finance activity this midterm cycle has ned the spectrum of the party\u0027s down-ballot candidates: If the so-called progressive movement becomes the centre of the party, no one who wants to be the Democratic presidential nominee boxed out.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/04/14/xi-jinping-china-africa.jpg","title":"china africa bejing forum investment interest free loans","story":"Created with Sketch.China\u0027s Xi Jinping\u0026nbspsays\u0026nbspinvestment comes with \u0027no political strings attached\u0027Click to followThe IndependentChinese President Xi Jinping, centre, with South Africa\u0027s Cyril Ramaphosa, centre left, and other leaders behind, attend the 2018 Beijing FOCAC summitRepresentatives from\u0026nbspalmost every country in Africa dined with Xi Jinping on Monday night as they attended what is believed to be the largest gathering of African heads of state ever staged\u0026nbspoutside the continent.They had plenty to toast, after China’s President Xi pledged new infrastructure investments in their countries of $60bn\u0026nbsp(£46bn) ning the next three years.The latest investment\u0026nbspis in addition to the $60bn\u0026nbsppledged back in\u0026nbsp2015, and promises to continue the remarkable growth of China-backed building projects across the African segment, known as the Belt and Road Initiative.China now far outstrips the economic clout and engagement in Africa of either the US or Europe, and its involvement has inevitably sparked criticism.Malaysia’s prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, warned against what he called a “new version of colonialism” last month when he cancelled a $20bn Chinese-backed rail project.And in his speech addressing leaders at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, Mr Xi appeared to acknowledge these concerns, saying Chinese investment came with “no political strings attached”.“China does not interfere in Africa’s internal affairs and does not impose its own will on Africa,” he said. “More than 1.3 billion Chinese people and more than 1.2 million African people have always pursued a shared future.“We respect Africa, love Africa and support Africa.”Since Mr Xi’s announcement, African heads of state have similarly sought to play down any suggestion that China’s interests are in anything other than mutual economic growth.Zimbabwe’s newly elected president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, hit out at critics of China in an interview on state TV.“There is now a transition to a new world order and those who don’t see it are blind,” he said.Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa’s president, said the Forum on China–Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in Beijing was working towards “a vision that has been crafted in Africa, by Africans… of an integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa”.May overlooked a vast humanitarian crisis on her Africa tourNever mind Brexit, the South Africans will love us after May’s dancingTheresa May’s visit to Robben Island is insultingThe UK securing trade deals in Africa doesn’t make much senseMay makes ‘unashamed’ vow to use aid to boost UK firms in Africa“FOCAC refutes the view that a new colonialism is taking hold in Africa, as our detractors would have us believe,” he added.Rwanda’s Paul Kagame, the current African Union chairman and a fierce critic in the past of foreign aid, said he considered China to be a “more respectful partner” than either Europe or America.“The relationship between Africa and China is based on equality, mutual respect and a commitment to a shared well-being,” he said. “Our growing ties with China do not come at anyone’s expense.”Some experts are not so sure. The International Monetary Fund warned in April that at least 40 per cent of low-income countries in Africa are either in debt distress or at high risk. Since the last FOCAC forum in South Africa in 2015, a number of countries have attempted to restructure their debt.But Chinese officials have previously denied taking part in so-called “debt trap” diplomacy, and on Monday Mr Xi said government debt from China’s interest free loans due by the end of 2018 will be written off for indebted poor African countries.“Unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise,” Mr Xi warned, an apparent reference to an ongoing trade war between his country and Donald Trump’s America.“China-Africa cooperation under the BRI (Belt and Road Initiative) is a way to common prosperity that brings benefits to both our peoples.”The only African country not represented in Beijing at the summit, which continued on Tuesday with meetings between business leaders and entrepreneurs, was newly-renamed eSwatini, formerly Swaziland.That’s because it is now the only nation left in Africa still conducting diplomatic relations with Taiwan, the self-ruled territory claimed by China. Beijing refuses to do business with any country that maintains ties to Taipei – business which the rest of the African continent has decided it cannot afford to lose.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/23/13/Gaza-Palestine-fuel-Israel.jpg  width= 2221  height= 1666  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/23/13/Gaza-Palestine-fuel-Israel.jpg","title":"israel embassy paraguay jerusalem tel aviv netanyahu","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027Israel views very seriously Paraguay’s exceptional decision which will strain the relations between the countries,\u0027 says office of\u0026nbspPrime Minister Benjamin\u0026nbspNetanyahuClick to followThe IndependentIsrael hits back at Paraguay after it moves embassy back to Tel Aviv from JerusalemIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered the closure of his country\u0027s\u0026nbspembassy in Paraguay in response to a\u0026nbspdecision by the South American nation to move\u0026nbspits own embassy back to Tel Aviv from JerusalemThe decision by newly-elected President Mario\u0026nbspAbdocomes\u0026nbspcomes\u0026nbspjust months after his\u0026nbsppredecessor, former President Horacio Cartes, opened the embassy in Jerusalem in May.\u0026nbspThe city of Jerusalem has been a fundamental issue in tensions between\u0026nbspIsrael and the Palestinian, and the latest moves will be a set-back to Mr Netanyahu.Donald Trump controversially broke from decades of American policy, when he announced a new US policy last year that recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.

In December it abstained from a vote at the United Nations General Assembly rebuking the US for moving its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Washington’s controversial decision recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s capital despite the fact it is contested city claimed by both Israelis and Palestinians. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Philippine president is also seeking new sources of military hardware and emerged as a significant new customer in 2017 for Israel, with sales of radar and anti-tank equipment worth $21m.Mr Netanyahu has been praised for forging ties with new allies abroad, where Israel has often lost support for its occupation of the Palestinian territories.However, in recent months the Israeli leader has come under fire for the choice of those partners.Why Netanyahu sees Poland as Israel’s most important ally in EuropeIsrael’s Netanyahu criticised for wooing Hungary’s far-right PMWhy has Netanyahu pushed through the Jewish Nation State bill now?Benjamin Netanyahu questioned by police in corruption investigation Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu flies to Europe to lobby May on Iran dealMr Duterte’s visit comes just weeks after Netanyahu welcomed Viktor Orban, Hungary’s four-time prime minister who was criticised last year for praising Miklos Horthy, Hungary’s World War II-era ruler and a Nazi collaborator.Mr Orban was also accused of employing anti-Semitic tropes against George Soros, a Jewish Hungarian-American billionaire philanthropist, during his re-election campaign. During Mr Orban’s visit to Israel in July, Mr\u0026nbspNetanyahu praised him for combatting anti-semitism.Mr Netanyahu was also criticised for striking a deal with Polish President Andrzej Duda over his country’s controversial Holocaust speech law, which would have criminalised blaming the Polish nation for crimes committed against Jews during World War II.Mr\u0026nbspDuterte, who assumed power 2016, did little to assuage fears on Sunday when he kicked off his four-day tour of Israel with a rambling expletive-ladened speech to members of the Filipino community in Jerusalem.During the hour-long talk he justified comments made on Thursday that the high rape rate in a Philippine city was due to the number of “beautiful women”. And he apologised for calling former US president Barack Obama a “son of a whore”.Duterte defended by spokespersonIn 2016, Mr Duterte drew worldwide anger when he said he would kill as many drug addicts as Hitler did Jews, adding “I’d be happy to slaughter them”. \u0026nbspIn the same speech he had also claimed three million Jews were killed in the Holocaust, half the number agreed by historians. The president later apologised, saying he had been misunderstood.But his comments were not forgotten in Israel. Left-leaning daily Haaretz\u0026nbspon Monday published an editorial headlined “A Hitler admirer at Yad Vashem,” while The Times of Israel asked why Israel was “opening its doors” to Mr Duterte in a piece entitled “this man has no place in our country”. Left-wing politicians, meanwhile, questioned why Mr Netanyahu wanted to “whitewash an illegitimate leader”.He “took pride in massacring his citizens and violating human rights… so why?” Tamar Zandberg, head of the leftist Meretz party, wrote on Facebook.“Because Duterte is willing to support the occupation (of the West Bank),” she said.The most controversial quotes from Rodrigo Duterte“These sons of whores are destroying our children.

In the past he has joked about wanting to rape an Australian national who was killed during a prison riot in 1989, he called Pope Francis a “son of a whore” for causing a traffic jam in the capital Manilla, and labelled God a “son of bitch”.He has also advised citizens not to wear condoms despite an HIV crisis, forcibly kissed a woman on stage and told soldiers to shoot female rebels in the vagina.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/183x122/1013217_1.jpg","title":"brexit news theresa may chequers eu michel barrier dominic raab stephen kinnock","story":"Michel Barnier held talks with the Brexit select committee on Monday to discuss progress in the negotiations, and made it crystal clear that the Chequers plan was unacceptable, according to Labour\u0027s Stephen Kinnock.During exchanges with Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, the anti-Brexit campaigner insisted Brussels had spiked the plans.He said: I can tell you absolutely, unequivocally, without a shadow of a doubt that Chequers is dead in the water.Mr Barnier made it crystal clear that Chequer\u0027s is completely unacceptable to the European Union.Mr Raab asked: Can I just check he said \u0027dead in the water\u0027?Mr Kinnock said: Les propositions sont mortes.Mr Raab replied: OK.

He knows now.Last week, Field quit the Labour Party whip amid a barrage of “intolerance, nastiness and intimidation” from Corbyn outriders over his stand against anti-Semitism.Along with other moderate Labour MPs, he was battered by Twitter storms using the vilest language to wish him dead.Field bluntly accuses Jeremy Corbyn of racism and hints he is ready to force a by-election if kicked out of the Labour Party. Others facing deselection may follow suit.Leadership critics have endured relentless bullying and abuse, a trademark of the brutal machine which swept Jezza to power and intends to keep him there. As Frank Field himself now admits, Corbyn is going nowhere.The party might split but the ageing hippy “will lead Labour into the next election”. Corbyn’s sullen anti-Semitism triggered this revolt, but it is only a symptom of the sinister nature of hard-Left politics which brooks no criticism.Labour really is the Nasty Party. Jezza’s pro-Russian, anti-capitalist malcontents loathe everything the UK and other Western democracies stand for.They support some of the world’s most brutal tyrannies and catastrophic economies while railing against free speech and Press freedom.Corbyn sees no evil in these repressive forces and this week shelved an invitation from MI5 chiefs to show him the secret intelligence. On such evidence alone, it is fair to say Corbyn as PM would permanently damage this country, its freedoms and its prosperity.We knew all this when Ed Miliband threw open the party’s leadership to anyone with three quid to buy a vote. Thanks to his stunning act of stupidity, the “broad church” Labour Party of Clem Attlee, Hugh Gaitskell, John Smith and Tony Blair is history.It lives on in name only, an empty husk colonised by Momentum parasites who once fought the party they now own. Corbyn didn’t even want the job, telling supporters: “You’d better make f***ing sure I don’t win.”When he surprised himself by storming to victory in 2015, shell-shocked Blairite MPs assumed they could get rid of him if he stepped too far out of line.They tried that in 2016 — turning Jezza into the unassailable champion of the loony Left and handing over the keys to the asylum. Theresa May bolted him in place with her botched General Election. No wonder the Glastonbury millennials cooed: “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn.”Have we learned from Frank Field’s mistake? Or do we believe, as he did, voters will never be silly enough to give Corbyn the keys to power? Well, look at the polls. They show nobody much rates Jezza, but Labour remains neck and neck with the Tories.Theresa May has yet to navigate her way to a tricky Brexit deal with Brussels — or to a no-deal rejected by Commons Remainers. She has rightly turned her face against a second referendum, a democratic abomination.But who knows who will be leader by then? Boris Johnson is circling, helped by a growing team of sponsors and supporters. Mrs May would do anything to stop BoJo. She is even seeking official advice on another snap election gamble. Good luck with that, Theresa. But Remainers should be careful what they wish for.Corbyn, a fervent fan of arch-Eurosceptic Tony Benn, loathes the EU as much as the angry Labour supporters who voted Leave. But he would conveniently bury that hatred for the time being if it meant riding a Remainer wave into Downing Street.Pro-Brussels campaigner Keir Starmer would emerge, not for the first time, as a “useful idiot”.The Purge will have just begun.At a media event before his referendum, the ex-oil analyst confidently bet the price would not crash below 50 a barrel. It did. He sent me my winnings but they apparently went astray.So he offered double-or-quits. The price stayed below 50 for yet another year – and is still only a bit higher today.

This belief is core to us at Burberry and key to our long-term success.We are committed to applying the same creativity to all parts of Burberry as we do to our products.”It also confirmed it would no longer use real fur.There will be no real fur in Riccardo Tisci’s debut collection for Burberry later this month, and the company will phase out existing real fur products.Burberry, which is valued at £9.6billion by Forbes, today said it was passionate about driving positive change as part of a five-year agenda.It had previously been claimed that shareholders were unhappy with the amount of clothes destroyed, with one asking why the unsold products were not offered to the company’s private investors at a meeting last week.Insiders had also claimed the practise was rife in the fashion industry to prevent them being sold at discount prices on the grey market to the wrong people, The Times reported.But the famous brand faced an uphill battle when EastEnders actress Danniella Westbrook was photographed head to toe in Burberry in 2002.The snap, showing the actress daughter in a matching outfit, was the culmination in the brands fall from exclusive to overexposed.The brand had also become synonymous with footballers wives - with girlfriends and fans of the sport decked out in the famous checked print.Knock-offs also didnt help, with the Burberry check copied across the world.Speaking to the BBC, fashion designer and retailer Alex Eagle said: The print had been too overexposed and that image shows it became synonymous with ostentatious luxury.The brand began a revamp - convicing the fashion world it was again cutting edge with eye-catching bags and new designs.Under the leadership of designer Christopher Bailey, the brands share prices rose 729 per cent.It now pulls in big names like Cara Delevingne and Eddie Redmayne as faces of the brand.Mr Eagle said: Burberry previously was synonymous with bad taste. Now it has an identity which feels very British and can be sold around the world.The newspaper had also contacted a number of brands, including Vivienne Westwood and Victoria Beckham, to find out how their waste was handled.Only Temperley replied, saying its unsold clothes were either donated to charity or sold at a discount outlet.It has previously emerged Richemont, the owner of Cartier and Montblanc, destroyed more than £400million worth of watches in two years.And more than 15 tonnes of H\u0026ampM stock was burnt last year, helping to power a small Swedish city, Vasteras, instead of using coal.Burberry, which has featured famous models including Cara Delevingne, Sienna Miller, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Romeo Beckham in its campaigns, said todays move was an expansion of their attempts to reuse and recycle unsaleable products.The brand has been embraced by famous faces around the world - and Kylie Jenner is no exception.The new mum shared a snap of herself cradling her baby daughter Stormi, with the five-month-old dressed in the designer threads.In the photo, Stormi is wearing a Burberry dress made from the fashion houses iconic checked print and Kylie is shielding her face from the lens.Although perhaps a little classier, the photograph is reminiscent of the day former EastEnders actress Danniella Westbrook dressed herself and her daughter Jo head-to-toe in Burberry.Earlier this year, Danniella proved she is STILL a fan of the designer when she was spotted in London branch of the fashion store.Burberrys lines are traditionally mega expensive, with its cheapest rucksack retailing for £950 in the Far East.The brands iconic Chelsea Heritage Trench Coat costs £1,450, while shirts can cost up to £790.Meanwhile, those hoping to get their hands on a signature bag have to fork out at least £1,390.Bosses have recently vowed to slash prices by four per cent in Chinese markets to help sales.Britons chucked out £12.5 billion worth of clobber last year, sending 300,000 tonnes to landfill."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/to-image-may-chalkbaord-e1536005708747.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"lady not for learning theresa may","story":"Will the headmistress have the authority to impose discipline on her unruly students?Two months ago, the Prime Minister shattered what was left of Conservative Party unity when she produced her plan for Brexit at Chequers.Having said Britain will take back control of our laws, money and borders, and strike our own trade deals around the world, she erased her red lines.At Chequers, she said Britain would follow certain EU laws, accept rulings of the European Court of Justice and adopt a customs policy that casts doubt on our ability to agree trade deals with other countries.Her Brexit Secretary, David Davis, and her Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, resigned in protest, and since then Westminster has waited anxiously to see what happens next.In the coming weeks and months, we will find out.Theresa May insists the choice is ­simple. She says we can leave in a safe and orderly manner through the Chequers plan or we can leave dangerously and chaotically if we don’t agree a departure deal with Europe.In truth, there are other choices. We could surrender less sovereignty by proposing a conventional trade agreement, as Davis suggested in a white paper that was rejected by the PM.But his proposal was never published, and Davis is now on the backbenches.We could join the European Economic Area, like Norway, leaving us subject to European laws, including free movement, and paying into the Brussels budget.Advocates, including the Tory MP Nick Boles, say this would buy us time to sort out our long-term relationship with Europe, but we would risk getting stuck half-in, half-out of the EU for years.Whatever the merits of his case, however, Boles is a backbench MP who cannot impose policy on the Government.Because Theresa May is the Prime Minister, Chequers is the only policy on the table. But Chequers, as bad as it already is, will not be the final deal.Downing Street insiders insist it is “obtainable” without further compromises, while the PM says she will not accept compromises “that are not in our national interest”. But this is the problem: There will be further compromises, which come on top of an already flawed proposal.And this is hardly a surprise, because Chequers is unacceptable to the Europeans.The EU’s number one rule is that the “four freedoms” of its single market — in goods, services, people and capital — cannot be divided.And yet Chequers — as unacceptable as it is to British Eurosceptics — seeks to divide these four freedoms.Britain is effectively asking to stay in the single market for trade in goods but not in services, people and capital.If we want what we have proposed for goods, the Europeans will say we must accept the other obligations.As part of an agreement about services, they will insist on Britain accepting more EU laws and a greater role for the European Court.They are likely to demand financial contributions and access to British waters for their fishing industry.And while they might not call it free movement, they will insist on concessions that grant Europeans almost automatic access to the British labour market.This prediction is not plucked out of thin air. It is based on decades of EU policymaking, and everything European leaders and their negotiators have said since the referendum.It is reflected in the EU’s own negotiating guidelines, issued to the European Commission by the Council of Ministers.And it is why, in her Lancaster House speech last year, Theresa May ruled out single market membership.Having to accept its obligations, she said, “would to all intents and purposes mean not leaving the EU at all”.And yet this is the danger we now face. According to several Government sources, the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, is “itching” to make a “generous offer” on immigration. Some believe he wants to retain free movement rules, because he says we cannot get a good trade deal unless we do so.Theresa May, on the other hand, is adamant that free movement must end.But whether or not we are legally part of EU free movement rules, the question is whether her deal will regain full control of immigration to Britain. And what we know already is alarming.There is nothing wrong with allowing tourists to come here easily, students to attend British universities and business people to travel without bureaucracy.Nor is there a problem with firms moving their workers across borders quickly and easily to provide services.And it makes sense to give Europeans preferential access to Britain compared to people from further away.But few ministers care about reducing immigration, and the Chequers white paper is remarkably open about the options. It proposes, for example, a “youth mobility scheme” that would give young Europeans the right to live and work in Britain for fixed periods.Without strict limits, this alone could destroy meaningful immigration control, because most people who want to migrate are young.Around 64 per cent of EU migrants to Britain are under 30, while 86 per cent are younger than 40.The white paper suggests “other specific mobility areas”, without giving further details. It proposes “social security coordination” which might allow migrants to claim benefits for children living back home in countries like Poland.And it says nothing about our ability to deport or bar European criminals from Britain.Most worryingly, there is no proposal for a visa system for European workers.Without that, unskilled and low-skilled immigration will continue without limit.It does not need to be like this.We are discussing these unacceptable compromises because Chequers proposes partial membership of the EU’s single market.If we want to escape Europe’s laws, its court and its demands for our money — and if we want to control immigration — the Government needs to revive its plans for a free trade agreement, and it needs to do so urgently.Unless it does, Brexit will not mean Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If she hardens it for Brexiteers, it’s even less likely to fly.Whatever Downing Street says, it’s not a plan if it has no possibility of proceeding. And if it’s a non-starter, isn’t it time to accept it and focus on a more basic free trade deal?

But one of ­Parliament’s biggest secrets is that most of the men and women in it are actually pretty decent.What rightly makes voters angry with Parliament is that it doesn’t look like the country it represents, and approves policies that often make the world a worse place. In the current Parliament, 29 per cent of UK-educated MPs went to private schools.This is a record low, but it is out of step with the public, which is around seven per cent privately educated. Only 32 per cent of MPs are women, and 7.8 per cent are from ethnic minorities, while roughly 14 per cent of the general population is black or minority ethnic.The majority of MPs were already working in politics before being elected or held well-paid jobs as lawyers.In my new book, Why We Get The Wrong Politicians, I’ve discovered one of the main reasons why only well-off people become MPs. It’s because they have to spend tens of thousands of pounds of their own money on standing for Parliament.I asked 532 candidates who stood in the 2015 election how much it had cost them, and was shocked by the answers. The average cost for all candidates, whether they were standing in a seat that they’d certainly win, one where they might win or a no-hope constituency, was £11,118.For those who had to fight in marginal seats, the costs were even higher. Conservatives who won their seats spent £121,467. Their colleagues who failed to win still lost an average of £18,701.Labour was no better. If you won your seat, you lost around £19,022, but those who failed to get elected spent even more — £35,843.Some spent money they had saved to buy a home. Others maxed out their credit cards and are still paying off the debts today. This money didn’t go on leaflets or any of the other official campaign spending that is tightly regulated.Instead, it was working for free for up to two years, travelling around and sometimes even moving to the constituency, and attending local events. One broke candidate needed help from members of her party to pay her mortgage. She didn’t even win her seat.Another ex-candidate was delighted when he landed a new job and could afford to buy a house — before he realised he’d spent the deposit on campaigning, ironically for the “party of home ownership”.This ludicrous cost excludes so many people who would make much better MPs than the ones we currently have. MPs do not really do the job they’ve been elected to perform, anyway.The pressure is for them to do as their whips tell them, rather than to look at the legislation going through the House of Commons. Most vote on bills without realising what they might entail.Even when they are appointed to the bill committees scrutinising every line of a law, MPs in the governing party are told to sit quiet and vote with the Government every time. Many write their Christmas cards in these committees.From the “bedroom tax” to interventions in Iraq and Libya, MPs have failed to notice problems before they turn into real crises.It doesn’t have to be like this. The parties could pay their candidates to stand. The Conservatives have already announced a modest bursary fund, and Labour has toyed with the idea too. Other groups should stump up some funding as well.The Women’s Equality Party, for instance, is stunningly well-funded but has little chance of getting an MP elected. It would be much better to use that money to get more women MPs in all the political parties. Currently MPs don’t have to take any responsibility for approving dud policies.My book suggests a new stage for legislation, called “Public Payback Panels” where people directly affected by a government policy could ask the minister and members of the bill committee who approved it to explain why they voted the way they did.This would encourage politicians to take their job seriously and really look at the laws they were approving.If this doesn’t change, MPs will still have the most expensive job interview on Earth — and will then be told when they arrive in Parliament not to do their job.

as well as bacteria linked to sepsis and deadly toxic shock syndrome.Experts analysing food and hygiene standards at the resort identified a high level of E-coli and staphylococcus bacteria.But Thomas Cook insists the results do not shed any light on the still unexplained cause of death of British holidaymakers John and Susan Cooper.The couple, from Burnley, Lancs, died within hours of each other at their Hurghada resort on 21 August.Their deaths were initially recorded as being down to heart and respiratory failure — but a postmortem is due to be carried out.John, 69 died in his room after collapsing on his bed, while wife Susan, 64, was rushed to hospital but later succumbed to the mystery illness.Thomas Cooks commissioned an independent hygiene specialist and air quality specialist to test the hotel amid fears they may have come to harm through the air conditioning food or water.Reporting the results today, the company revealed:The initial results were reviewed by Dr Vanya Gant from University College London Hospitals.In a statement the firm said their specialists did not see a link between the E-coli discovery and the tragic deaths.Thomas Cook said: Neither our independent specialists nor Dr Vanya Gant believe that these results shed any light on the still unexplained cause of death of Mr and Mrs Cooper.We await the results of the autopsies being conducted by the Egyptian authorities.The security and wellbeing of our valued guests around the world is of highest priority.Thomas Cook also committed to carry out specialist hygiene assessments at all their partnered hotels that report a higher-than-average number of customers with sickness.The holiday operator also confirmed customers at the hotel will receive a compensation package.A spokesman for Deutsche Hospitality, which runs the hotel, told The Sun Online: We are deeply saddened by the tragedy in the Aqua Magic Hotel in Hurghada.We are expecting the results of the full investigation being conducted by the Egyptian authorities, who have our full support.We are constantly monitoring the quality by outside independent contractors.So any high level of bacteria would not be acceptable by our high standards.We have taken note of the interim results published by our partner Thomas Cook, which matches with our independent investigations concerning the good results of water and air quality.Our high standards in terms of hygiene are not negotiable and of course apply also to all of our franchise hotels as well.Thomas Cook chief executive Peter Fankhauser added: These results, while not establishing the cause of the tragic deaths of John and Susan Cooper, have prompted us to commit further resource to tackle hygiene standards in those hotels where we identify a higher than average level of sickness.The room where the couple died has since been sealed off and a do not disturb sign hangs from its handle — with guards stationed outside it around the clock.Following the deaths, it emerged the hotel had been hit by dozens of sickness complaints.On Friday guests had a note put under their doors advising them “water pipelines cleansing” would be taking place and advising them not to use taps in their rooms.The Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel remains unavailable for new bookings for Thomas Cook customers until further notice."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000420904786.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"smokers dementia more likely","story":"Those who dont smoke, or had quit smoking, had less chance of developing the degenerative brain condition than those who still smoke cigarettes, according to a Korean study.Those who has smoked long-term but recently quit had a 14 per cent less chance of developing Alzheimers later in life.They also had a 32 per cent reduced chance of developing vascular dementia - one of the most common forms of the disease.While those who had never smoked had 19 per cent less chance of developing Alzheimers and a 29 per cent less chance of developing vascular dementia.The study, published in the Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology followed 46,140 men aged over 60 who took part in a Korean health screening.Smoking cessation was clearly linked with a reduced dementia risk in the long term, indicating that smokers should be encouraged to quit in order to benefit from this decreased risk, said senior author Dr. Sang Min Park, of Seoul National University, in Korea.Smoking has previously been linked to inflammation in the body, which can lead to a number of diseases including heart disease, stroke and cancer.Dementia and Alzheimers have also been linked to inflammation.Vascular dementia is the second most common type of dementia in the UK after Alzheimers disease, where the brain is damaged due to a lack of blood flow.There are several different types of vascular dementia, due to the ying levels of damage on the affected part of the brain.They include stroke-related dementia, single-infarct and multi-infarct dementia, subcortical vascular dementia and mixed dementia - which includes both vascular and Alzheimers disease.Earlier this year new research found smoking could cause dementia by clogging up the part of the brain crucial for memory.Cigarettes create a build up of calcium in the section that stores memories of recent and past experiences, experts found.The area most affected is the gray matter in the hippocampus - the centre of emotion, memory and the nervous system in our brains.A Dutch study of almost 2,000 older people found those who smoked were more likely to have the formations of calcium, which can cause the disease."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000431274186-e1536168035268.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pound soars as angela merkel opens the door to a brexit deal by backing down on europes red lines","story":"But Theresa May hit back to demand a detailed trade deal -

in return for the whopping £38billion divorce bill.The Brexit Secretary warned MPs would be unlikely to back a deal that had an “unclear destination point” and stressed: “We would like to be very clear on the choice of relationship.”And Downing Street said: “There needs to be a meaningful vote on the agreement, based on proper information. Parliament needs to make an informed decision.”The latest row came as the PM prepared a last ditch bid to sell her troubled Chequers plan to Tory faithful with a tour ahead of her party conference next month.The Sun can raveal panicked Mrs May is to dispatch her Cabinet around the country to try talk down fuming local Tory chiefs and members who hate her soft Brexit compromise offer.Amid deep concern in Downing Street that a row over her Brexit plans is to engulf her party conference next month, Mrs May’s Chief of Staff Gavin Barwell has ordered ministers to “sell Chequers” with a script to take directly to sceptical local party bigwigs.Meanwhile there was fresh anger at Downing Street last night after the PM’s Brexit guru confessed he had let Brussels help shape her troubled Chequers plan before she showed her Cabinet.Mrs May’s controversial aide Olly Robbins admitted to MPs that the EU were “sounded out” on the soft exit plan while Ministers including David Davis and Boris Johnson were still in the dark.Last night Jacob Rees-Mogg accused No10 of a “constitutional abuse” by “touting policy decisions to foreign leaders before a Cabinet has agreed to them.”At a testy Commons grilling form the EU Scrutiny Committee, both Mr Raab and Mr Robbins insisted that Mrs Chequers deal was still being studied by EU leaders and rejected calls to put it “out of its misery”.Mr Raab also accused MPs who met Michel Barnier on Monday and were told the Chequers would be rejected by the EU had been used as negotiation pawns.And the Brexit Secretary also risked controversy by accusing Brussels of using the Northern Ireland border to insert “political pressure” on Britain as a negotiation tactic."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000431285235.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"st peters academy stoke on trent trousers uniform","story":"Children were excluded from lessons at St Peters Academy, Stoke-on-Trent, for turning up to class in trousers that did not have purple piping.Irate parents blasted the school complaining that trousers override education and said their children had returned home upset at having been removed from class.Ninety-two children were placed in isolation on Monday and 37 were excluded from class on Tuesday.The school defended the new uniform policy and said it was introduced to raise standards.It said parents and pupils had been told in March, June and July that those who did not have on the correct new uniform including purple piping on trouser pockets would be put in isolation.A reminder was also issued to students on Monday.One angry mum, whose son was put in isolation, said: Its ridiculous.

Now we need to catch them.” His brother Matthew, 47, said: “It’s awful that we can’t hold them on murder charges. I want to know what Theresa May is going to do about it.”A senior security source said: “They’re going to have pay a cost for what they’ve done. Nothing is off the table now.”The two officers – working under the aliases Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov – are suspected of working for the GRU’s Spetsnaz wing.Meaning ‘Special Purpose’, the wing carry out its dangerous missions overseas. On top of foreign assassinations – known as ‘wet jobs’ – they also give covert support to militant groups, and run proxy armies in warzones such as Ukraine and Syria.While the PM didn’t call out the Kremlin boss by name, sources insisted there was “no doubt” on the Joint Intelligence Committee – the overall security body that supervised the long investigation – that the Skrpial “wet job” was authorised by Putin personally.And how did this gangster state react yesterday to being exposed? By sniggering at Theresa May’s dancing.Russia must face tougher sanctions. The international community must demand the suspects be handed over for trial.Britain must hit back at Putin’s spy network and his oligarch mates who launder their dirty money in London.The Sun congratulates our intelligence services and police on their diligence and skill in identifying these hitmen. Some 11,000 hours of CCTV was sifted.But where does this all leave Comrade Cob? Six months ago Corbyn, briefed by his Trotskyite lackey Seumas Milne, parroted Putin’s line. Even yesterday, with hard evidence before him, he still couldn’t condemn the Russian regime.Imagine — with one murdered and three stricken by Novichok — if the Kremlin’s useful idiot had been our Prime Minister.The PM also vowed to build a new coalition across the EU to enforce a biting round of new sanctions against Russia to punish it for the shameful state act.She also blasted Russia for a long litany of “obfuscation and lies” over what happened in Salisbury.Mrs May added: “Their attempts to hide the truth by pushing out a deluge of disinformation simply reinforces their culpability”.Petrov and Boshirov are also known to have been aided by the Russian government on their mission, who provided them with logistical help such as false passports.Saturday, 3 MarchSunday, 4 MarchFriday, June 29 Saturday, June 30Sunday July 8Friday, July 13July 18July 19July 20July 30August 8Whitehall sources also last night revealed that the JIC believe they know the men’s real identities, but are holding the sensitive information back at the moment.MI6 double agent Sergei Skripal was a colonel in the GRU, making the assassination bid on him also a personal revenge mission.The Charge d’Affaires in the Russian Embassy was summoned to the Foreign Office for a dressing down yesterday, standing in for his ambassador who is on holiday.He was told of the charges that the police want to press on Petrov and Boshirov, as well the Government’s determination that the men are eventually hauled to London to face justice.Police also issued a European Arrest Warrant and Interpol red notice on the pair, meaning that while the Kremlion will refuse any attempt to extradite them, they will never be able to leave Russia again.Mrs May spoke to a series of close ally world leaders to brief them on the findings, including US President Donald Trump and Canada PM Justin Trudeau.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied any Russian role in the Salisbury poisoning, and again insisted Britain must hand over the case files so a joint investigation can be launched.And Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokesman also said Moscow has no knowledge of either of the suspects.THE GRU - Russia’s “Main Intelligence Directorate” - is a shadowy organisation with chiefs handpicked by Vladimir Putin.Estimates suggest it has six times as many spies abroad as the FSB - formerly the KGB.It was founded in 1918 by then-Soviet leader Vladmir Lenin who demanded its independence from other secret services.GRU defector Viktor Suvorov said new recruits were shown film of a traitor being burned alive.The GRU has recently been linked with actions in Syria and the downing of a flight in eastern Ukraine.Ex-FSB agent Alexander Litvinenko - murdered in London in 2006 - accused it of bombing four apartments in Moscow in 1999.It has also been accused of hacking and interference in foreign elections.Tory MPs openly mocked the GRU last night for the botched hit as well as allowing itself agents to be identified.Former Army officer-turned-Tory MP Johnny Mercer said: “I hope this toilet tradecraft will help reduce the perception that Russia is some intelligence/military behemoth to be cowered from.“Putin should be treated with the distain he deserves - a dull thug running a mafia state.

The company should be renamed Two-Facedbook.Lucy McHugh’s body was found in Hampshire woodland six weeks ago. She had been stabbed to death.Police arrested Stephen Nicholson, 24, a care worker who had been living with Lucy’s family, on suspicion of murder and sexual activity with a child.Nicholson admits being in contact with Lucy via Facebook on the evening before her disappearance and on the morning of the tragic day. But he refused to give police his Facebook password so they could check what was said.Nicholson was prosecuted for refusing to cooperate with the investigation. His lawyer said his client was afraid cops would find evidence of his involvement with cannabis.The judge dismissed this excuse as “wholly inadequate”, surely putting it mildly.Last week Nicholson was jailed for 14 months for preventing police from checking his messages. In the UK, failing to cooperate with police is an offence under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. He got a much longer term than he would ever get for smoking dope.Meanwhile Facebook — a US company not bound by our laws — refused a police request to divulge Nicholson’s password.Detectives had to apply to the US authorities for an order giving access to Nicholson’s account. That process could take many months.Facebook insists it cannot give police quick access, because of its commitment to privacy and freedom of expression. That excuse sounds even more pathetic than Nicholson’s dopey cannabis story.Yes, privacy and free speech are crucial principles to defend, including online.But in practice, Facebook has as much regard for those freedoms as a police-state apparatchik.Its bosses’ one serious commitment is to their freedom to rake in cash. They monitor our private lives and make money off our likes and desires.Facebook and other tech giants use our online activity to target advertising and allow companies access to our data. As for free speech, Facebook has been busy closing right-wing pages that do not suit its leftie Silicon Valley tastes.It says it will not tolerate “hate speech and harassment”. When it comes to child murder suspects, it apparently takes a more liberal attitude.Facebook has bizarrely chosen the case of Stephen Nicholson to strike a phoney pose as a stalwart defender of privacy and freedom.Double standards don’t come much lower. This looks like a grossly misjudged attempt at moral grandstanding designed to repair Facebook’s right-on reputation.It appears more likely to have the opposite effect, lowering its standing still further.We should never take the issue of privacy and state intervention lightly. In a free society, the police should not be given licence to pry and poke into our affairs and online activities as they see fit.We must be on our guard against the creeping advance of state snooping.But the demand for privacy can also be used to the detriment of a free and civilised society. After Sir Cliff Richard won his privacy case against the BBC over the reporting of a police raid on his home, many have demanded “Cliff’s law” be enforced to prevent the media naming those suspected of serious crimes.In a terrible case such as the murder of Lucy McHugh, it surely ought to be possible to work out a fast way to access the chief suspect’s Facebook account — he having chatted with the victim shortly before she disappeared — without declaring open season for police snoopers.The law must be changed to help police get data in cases like this — so long as that law is tightly framed and properly scrutinised.Facebook can posture and hide behind the US courts but our media is subject to a full book of laws that have empowered police and state agencies to demand news- papers hand over sensitive information and name their confidential sources. No passwords required. Some publishers, it seems, have more freedom than others.Facebook’s two-faced bosses should be brought to book for their double standards on privacy and their blatant disregard for the public good.

That’s why he threw the firebomb in.Or maybe the excuse Corbyn himself comes up with, every time. It wasn’t me! I wasn’t there!Then, when it’s proved that he was: “Oh, um, yes. But I didn’t really know what I was doing.”As I’ve said before, Corbyn’s defence is always to portray himself as a complete moron who doesn’t know where he is or what he’s doing. It doesn’t wash. He’s an anti-Semite.But there’s another group of people who know this only too well. And they’re doing very little about it.That’s the Labour MPs. The ones who cannot abide Corbyn and Momentum and want him gone. The Old Labour Party, the one we used to have before the lefty infants took over.But they do nothing. Not a thing, apart from moan quietly in the background.If ever there was a time for a split, for a new party to be formed which might capture the attention of the voters, this is it.But they don’t have the balls. Or they are scared to lose their safe seats and their nice incomes. That’s probably a false hope too, mind. Corbyn isn’t going anyplace anytime soon.And if he did another lunatic would take over who might conceivably be worse. And Momentum now control the entire party. So, one after another, the moderate Labour MPs will be deselected and lose their seats anyway.The ones who think Israel has a right to exist.The ones who don’t think Cuba and Venezuela have particularly brilliant governments.The ones who don’t want to police newspapers which don’t agree with them.The MPs whose first consideration is poverty and inequality, not identity politics and fatuous agitprop grandstanding.So far only one of these has made a stand — the excellent Frank Field. He has resigned the Labour whip, disgusted at ­Corbyn’s anti-Semitism.All it would take is three or four more and suddenly we would have a new political party.So, what about it, Kate Hoey? And the former Blairite, Caroline Flint? And Ben Bradshaw? And John Mann?Are you telling me you’re happy where you are, in today’s Labour Party? Or are you just waiting for someone to come and rescue you?You’ve got a long wait. You have to do it yourselves.I WAS feeling a bit sorry for Roxanne Pallett.She made a mistake, only a kid really – and now she’s lost everything.And then I saw an interview with her.Dense as a slab of tungsten – although I suppose that’s not her fault.I mean, if you were born with only a five-watt bulb flickering away inside your skull it’s not something that can be changed very easily, is it?But more than that, it was her absolute self-absorption.Everything was about me, me, me.Not the hurt she had caused to others, but the misery she’d inflicted on HERSELF.It’s a common condition these days, I suppose.But Pallett is a pretty extreme example.SEEN what’s been happening in Germany?Huge demonstrations against immigration in Chemnitz, formerly Karl-Marx Stadt.The BBC and others say it’s all the “far right”. Neo Nazis. People with posters of Hitler in their bedrooms.I daresay there are a few nasty types on those marches who wish there was still a Gestapo. But I think the vast majority of those demonstrating are ordinary German citizens, sick of what has happened to their country.And the same thing has been happening across Europe.It’s not the far right at all, no matter how often the liberals tell you it is.GREAT call from the President of the Philippines, a bloke called Rodrigo Duterte.According to him, if women want to avoid being raped they should not be so beautiful.Maybe they should have all their teeth removed? Men won’t want to give one to someone who is totally toothless. It’ll put them off completely.The women could also slice their noses off.Or have facial surgery to make them resemble an anteater or a pipistrelle bat.The world has its fair share of dimbo leaders. But Rodrigo is right there near the top.SO the latest plan is to put road markings on the pavement.It’s so zombies attached to their iPhones, staring at the ground, don’t walk into the middle of a road or off the edge of a cliff.There has been a rise in accidents involving pedestrians who are locked tightly into their own little world.I have been nearly flattened by joggers immersed in some crap pounding through their thick skulls. And nobody talks to anybody any more. We discuss banning the burka from public spaces.But is there anything more antisocial than someone with their head down, oblivious to the world around them?ANNOYED that her partner had allegedly cheated on her, Serena Reynoldson filmed herself pouring bleach into his tropical fish tank while cackling, “Die, die, die!” Which is what they did, of course.I think her ex, Jon Fitzpatrick, is well out of it, frankly.It all seems a bit hard on the poor fish. So far as we know, they hadn’t cheated on Ms Reynoldson. Mr Fitzpatrick also had a snake, which was lucky to get out of the place alive.I think the moral is if you’re going to upset your missus, make sure you have pets that can look after themselves. A Tasmanian devil, say, or a king cobra.WHY has Jose Mourinho not been sacked by Manchester United?I don’t mean because his team are not terribly good. Or about as pleasing to watch as John Prescott eating a curry.But he’s just been handed a one-year suspended prison sentence and hit with whopping fines – for tax evasion running into the millions of pounds.Does Manchester United not have any principles?I’LL be glued to the box watching The Mighty Redcar on BBC2 tonight. Seeing that the town is only a stone’s throw from my gaff in Saltburn.I was worried at first that it was just another poverty-porn film.You know, when the BBC turns up somewhere north of Watford so everyone can have a good old snigger at the people who live there.But having spoken to some of the people who took part, it isn’t like that at all.Redcar’s had it rough and wages are low. Both Labour and the Tories have let down the steelworkers, who are no more.But there are plenty of new businesses thriving, beyond the BBC’s cameras.Redcar will be just fine in the end, just as it was when I lived there in the Seventies.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

How on Earth did he think of it?Justin Welby is right, of course, to highlight the low-paid’s plight. But his ­solutions are standard lazy Labour fare, ignoring inconvenient facts:Inequality has been falling for years. The richest one per cent pay 27 per cent of all income tax, as opposed to just 11 under Labour in the 1970s. Raising the top rate nets LESS money since the wealthiest find ways to avoid it, or leave.Low corporation tax is partly behind the incredible job creation since 2010. Reverse it and see the dole queues grow.And an avalanche of taxes on wealth won’t bring equality. The overall burden is near a 30-year high. Raising it further will kill aspiration, investment and jobs.To help the poor, CUT their taxes instead.WE’RE not swallowing the Treasury scares about jobs being at risk if restaurants are made to put calorie counts on their menu.Food apps can assess a dish’s calories in moments. Totting up a menu is a few hours’ work once in a while.Better that than impose more nanny-state taxes to crowbar diners off grub they like. It’s far more likely to persuade them to pick a healthier option too.The problem is enforcing it. We don’t want council “calorie cops” giving firms a hard time. But someone has to check the figures are accurate. Which DOES sound like a recipe for red tape.It’s a decent idea . . .

Its not a nuclear target. Its not a target for war. Its a place where people seek refuge.”Their top of the range bunker, The Aristocrat costs £8.9 million excluding the installation fee.It has a capacity for more than 50 people in ying degrees of luxury and features bullet proof doors, a solar generated charging system, a swimming poll, bowling lane and gun range, amongst other luxuries.Even an ex- Kiwi Prime Minister has noticed the uptick in interest from wealthy Americans in his country as an escape plan.John Key, who was New Zealand’s PM from 2008-2016, said: “Ive had a lot of people say to me that they would like to own a property in New Zealand if the world goes to hell in a hand basket.”The two most recent 990 square feet bunkers sent to the nation from the States were each taken on 19 trailers having been split into sections.One was installed in the North Island of New Zealand while the other was secreted away in the even more sparsely populated South Island.Paypal co-founder, and Facebook billionaire, Peter Thiel 4.8 million home in Queenstown New Zealand complete with a panic room.His buddy, and fellow entrepreneur, Sam Altman also let slip that he has plans to catch a flight out there if a pandemic ever hits.And LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman told The New Yorker last year that, “saying you’re ‘buying a house in New Zealand’ is kind of a wink, wink, say no more”.Other wealthy US entrepreneurs who have bought properties in the country include film director James Cameron and billionaire hedge fund manager Julian Robinson.A total of 17 Americans took advantage of the New Zealand’s Investor Plus Visa - which requires a 10million investment over 36 months – last year.But it is believed that the rush of investment from billionaires fearing the worst could have been one of the motivating factors behind a new law banning many foreigners from buying homes.Fortunately New Zealand isn’t the only place the super-rich have looked to too ride out the End of Days.Luxurious bolt holes to ride out the nuclear winter have sprung up, or rather burrowed under, across the US and EuropeYour father or grandfathers bunker was not very comfortable, Robert Vicino, the CEO of high-end shelter company Vivos, told CNN.They were grey. They were metal, like a ship or something military. And the truth is mankind cannot survive long-term in such a Spartan, bleak environment.It may seem like an over-the-top purchase designed for the super-paranoid - but sports stars, hedge fund managers and even tech gurus including Bill Gates are rumoured to have invested in bunkers.Trident Lakes survival community and country club offers condos that are 90 per cent sheltered with lagoons, a golf course and equestrian centre above groundBut while some want to bunker down alone with their loved ones, other companies have cashed in on our desire to be in a community - and feel closer to the real world, even in the face of disaster.Missile silos and military bunkers have been transformed into condos and underground villages - complete with cinemas, swimming pools and leisure areas.Vivos Xpoint, in South Dakota, is made up of 575 military bunkers - and is being developed to accommodate 5,000 people.The bomb-proof holiday homes cost between £20,000 and £160,000, while the underground village will include a cinema, classroom, gardens, doctors surgery, spa and gym.The company also offer a modern day Noahs Ark, in a former Cold War-era munitions storage facility in Germany, which includes 34 properties sized between 2,500 and 5,000 square feet.This particular shelter will include a tram network to transport residents to the bunkers restaurants, coffee shops, pool, cinema and game rooms.We have all the comforts of home, but also the comforts that you expect when you leave your home, Robert added."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT0004298380851.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"aly ross x factor ayda","story":"It’s a dangerous half- truth which seriously under-estimates the woman.So it should be pointed out, as a matter of urgency, that Ayda Field was elevated to the hot spot because she’s very close friends with Simon ­Cowell’s girlfriend Laura ­Silverman as well.Understood? Good. Then let’s proceed, in an open-minded fashion, with X Factor, the focus group years, where there are some new faces on the panel.We’ve got Louis “lad” Tomlinson, who brings the experience of taking part in the show.Robbie Williams, who brings the ­experience of over 20 years in the music industry.And Ayda, who brings the ­experience of playing Angela Moroni in Days Of Our Lives.Ironically, though, the newest face of all probably belongs to Simon Cowell, whose head now requires constant fanning and is so curiously swollen they could shove it on a plinth in the FA Museum above a plaque that reads: “1923 Cup Final ­football.”What caused it to balloon, I cannot say for sure, but if it was done to divert attention from the other end of the judging panel, he’s seriously underestimated the attention-seeking and self-absorption of Robbie Williams, which is total.A factor not helped by the adoring presence of Ayda, whose public displays of affection for “Rob” could quickly become the X Factor’s most nauseating ever detail.Enormous as it is, there’s not much Simon’s head can do about the singing either.The problem here, of course, is that almost everyone who wants to audition for a karaoke show has now auditioned, or sung professionally.So we were swamped with re-treads on this weekend’s double-header.Among them were: Danny Tetley, who appeared on Pop Idol, Caribbean ­talent show ­veteran Olatunji Yearwood, who’s already got a record deal, Livin’ Joy’s Janice “Dreamer” Robinson, and Brendan ­Murray from Hometown, a Sony act who were managed by Louis Walsh. Not that anyone was admitting as much.If there was any joy and spontaneity to proceedings, though, it was generally ­provided by those random whack-nut contestants who don’t appear on Simon’s approved list.Acts like Livia and the Elementals, Aaron Denham, who looked like he’d absconded from Guantanamo Bay, and Andy Hofton, who performed a song called Castle Of Love that’s been 20 years in gestation and, to no tune at all, went like this.“All my life, I’ve been building a castle of love. That lifts me to your heart.“Here I am, I’ve built my castle of . . .”“Andy! ANDY!” Simon’s hand of objection went up. He was then asked if he had a second song. Angels kicked in and I think you know what happened next.If someone on the judging panel had their wits about them, obviously, they’d have waited for Andy and Robbie to finish their duet then said: “Actually, let’s try Castle Of Love again.”No chance of that, though, as Cowell set his stall out, day one, when he told Danny Tetley: “The music business should be more open-minded.”The irony of a show that’s spent 14 series steering viewers towards its preferred winner now demanding open-mindedness won’t be lost on anyone, but I think it’s just ­cosmetic.The sort of “let’s-pretend we’re-nice” ­cobblers political parties trot out when they’re in as much trouble as this show.It won’t work, though. ’Cos there were so many things the X Factor urgently needed to ditch — sob stories, manipulation, product-placement, deception, scripted “spontaneity” — yet it sounds like the only element it’s going to discard is the brutal and funny honesty which made it stand out from the competition.Show’s over, folks.Paul Merson: “The one person I feel sorry for is the Newcastle fans.”And Tony Cottee: “Hemed’s had two efforts, Freeman’s had two efforts and all three have been saved.”CELEBRITY Big Brother viewers finally got to see last week why the show paid £75,000 to book actress Roxanne Pallett, whose relationship with the truth could, at best, be described as flexible.Unwitting victim was Corrie’s Ryan Thomas, who engaged her with a spot of the house craze for shadow boxing on Thursday’s show, which everyone could see was entirely playful.Having initially laughed it off, though, Roxanne suddenly decided it was “an assault” and he was “a woman beater”, who had to be removed.It made a mockery of the real thing, obviously, and would have ruined Ryan’s life if there’d been a hint of doubt about the video footage.In the kangaroo court atmosphere of the #MeToo movement, however, and with a £75,000 investment to protect, Channel 5 had to indulge her fantasies and give Ryan an official warning for his “behaviour”.She’s since fled the house, of course, without her fee, and apologised.If anyone’s missing Roxanne’s histrionics, though, there’ll soon be another chance to see the dingbat lose her s**t on Celebrity Island With Bear Grylls, where her stay comes to a tearful climax over the camp fire which, apparently, sparks fevered memories of a teenage house inferno that could’ve killed her entire family. But didn’t.It’s a pattern likely to continue as well.Given the fact then that reality television clearly causes Roxanne Pallett such huge emotional distress and painful memory spasms, it’s probably best if neither she nor the toxic show that booked her ever troubles us again.BBC2’s Eight Go Rallying, in ­CambodiaBBC1’s Bodyguard is a curse, a liability, a Jonah. Norman bloody Wisdom in a bullet-proof vest.He sits on a train, ­suicide bombers appear in the next carriage.He gets in a car with the Home Secretary, a sniper’s killed Terry the driver.He turns up to see her speak? KABOOM! The front three rows of the ­theatre suddenly explode.Where Sergeant David Budd goes, trouble ­immediately follows.And still no one at MI5 or Scotland Yard has made the connection.Mind you, it took the best brains at the Met several days to work out the sniper, who had a shot on him like Yul Brynner in The Magnificent Seven, “might be ex-Forces”.Yeah, well, it’s not a bad theory, I suppose, though you couldn’t rule out the possibility they’ll haul in David Blunkett for questioning next week, as this lot all seem to have trained with Walford CID, the world’s stupidest police force.It’s just one of several reasons why I’m still not buying into Bodyguard.The others being, its idiotic levels of political correctness, the stilted performance of Richard Madden as Budd, and his entirelyunbelievable relationship with Keeley Hawes’ Julia Montague.Mind you, she did conjure up an even more far-fetched and disturbing possibility on Sunday night when she told him: “Sex with the Home Secretary, it’s a heinous crime.”Sex with the Shadow Home Secretary. A lock him up and throw away the key crime.MEANWHILE, on Age Before Beauty, Ivy-Rae: “We need to do something so bad that they’ll still end up sweating in 20 years’ time.”Mission accomplished.

Some 44% of Welsh voters want a say on the outcome of the talks, polling for the People\u0027s Vote campaign found. Welsh voters backed quitting the European Union by 53% to 47%, but now 51% would vote to remain compared to 49%, the YouGov study for the group found. The usual margin of error for polling is 3%. Peter Kellner, former president of YouGov, said: With Wales now opposed to Brexit, albeit narrowly, this now means that all three nations in the UK outside England now back remaining in the European Union. This should concern all politicians who seek to preserve the integrity of the United Kingdom.  The shift has been driven by Labour voters, where the swing to Remain is 6%, double the average for all Welsh voters. In the referendum two years ago, Labour supporters voted 66-34% for Remain. This has now widened to 72-28%. Labour voters also back a People\u0027s Vote by almost three-to-one: 61-22%. This should concern those Labour MPs who are resisting both continued membership of the EU and a fresh referendum to let the people decide the issue.  The People\u0027s Vote campaign is targeting different areas of the UK as part of a summer blitz to set out what it says will be the impact of Brexit locally. It pointed to a draft Government briefing in January that suggested a 9.5% loss of GDP growth over the next decade in a no deal scenario. That could amount to every person in Wales being left \u0026pound1,818 a year worse off, it claimed.

Fishermen from the two nations clashed off the coast of Normandy a week ago, with sailors hurling rocks and vessels crashing into each other. Trouble flared over a long-running row about UK boats harvesting the shellfish in the Seine Bay. French fishermen leave the beds to recover at certain times, but British vessels are not bound by the same rules - unleashing Gallic resentment. A joint statement from the UK and French governments last night revealed concord had been reached. About 35 French boats confronted five British craft off the coast of northern France last week, with UK crews reporting that rocks, smoke bombs and other projectiles were hurled at them during the confrontation.  The clashes have occurred in a scallop-rich area known as the Baie de Seine off the coast of Normandy. National regulations allow British ships to fish legally in the area all year round, but French fishermen are banned from taking the molluscs between May 15 and October 1 to conserve stocks. The clashes came after the breakdown of a 2013 agreement in which larger British vessels agreed not to fish in parts of the area, so they would be abiding by same conditions as the French fleet, in return for gaining more fishing opportunities. It broke down this year after the French industry said they wanted the deal to be extended to smaller British boats.

Security Minister Ben Wallace said the Russian President was to blame ultimately because “it is his government that controls, funds and directs” the GRU intelligence service blamed for the nerve agent poisoning.  His comments go further than Theresa May\u0027s assertion that the attack was almost certainly also approved outside the GRU at a senior level of the Russian state. Mr Wallace told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: I don\u0027t think that anyone can ever say that Mr Putin isn\u0027t in control of his state. The GRU is, without doubt, not rogue, it is led, linked to both the senior members of the Russian general staff and the defence minister and, through that, into the Kremlin and the president\u0027s office.  The two men alleged to have been behind the March nerve agent poisoning - Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov - have been identified by the UK as members of the GRU, Russia\u0027s military intelligence service. Prosecutors deem it futile to apply to Russia for the extradition of the two men, but a European Arrest Warrant has been obtained and the authorities are also seeking the assistance of Interpol.  Mr Wallace said the UK would use whatever means we have within the law and our capabilities to push back the Russian malign activity. Asked whether there would be retaliation for Russia\u0027s activities, particularly in cyber space, Mr Wallace said: We do all the time, but we retaliate in our way. We are not the Russians, we don\u0027t adopt the sort of thuggish, destructive and aggressive behaviour that we have seen. We choose to challenge the Russians in both the overt and the covert space, within the rule of law and in a sophisticated way. As a permanent member of the Security Council, Russia will be represented at Thursday\u0027s meeting - and called on by Britain to update members on progress in the Salisbury investigation - alongside UK allies such as the US and France. Mrs May has been in contact with US President Donald Trump and other leaders as she attempts to build an international alliance in support of her stance.

This was, some said, the Prime Minister at her best. Her delivery needed to be good - she had a lot of sins to hide. Just over the two years’ ago Mrs May had also faced MPs when Home Secretary to deliver a statement on the inquest into the murder of Alexander Litvinenko in 2006. Like the Skripals, Litvinenko had been poisoned  by two Russian agents “probably” acting on the orders of Vladimir Putin. First, it should be noted that Mrs May had tried to block a full public inquiry into this killing on British soil.  In a letter to the Coroner Sir Robert Owen she cited “international relations” as a reason for the Government’s opposition - words which implied she did not want to upset the Putin administration. It was only after a tireless campaign by Mr Litvinenko’s widow, Marina, that the Cameron government relented and agreed to hold the inquiry. Mrs May’s response to the final report in January 2016 is enlightening. Three times she was asked by Conservative and Labour MPs to introduce a Magnitsky Act in response to the murder. This is a US law introduced in 2012 that allows the US Government to freeze the assets and ban the entry of Russians suspected of human rights abuses. Three times Mrs May rejected calls for a UK version of this act, telling MPs: “We already have powers that are at least as robust, if not more so, than the powers in the Magnitsky Act.” Today in the Commons she boasted the Government was now bringing in the Magnitsky Act as part of a raft of measures taken in response to the Salisbury attack. Many believe she should have acted sooner.  In a telling exchange in 2016 she was asked by former Brexit Secretary David Davis, then as now a backbencher, to impose travel sanctions on leading figures in the Putin regime and expel Russian intelligence officers from London. Mrs May replied the Government had “already taken a number of measures” and refused the invitation to take further action. Perhaps then, as now, Mrs May was worried about the health of the Conservative Party finances which have benefited from donations from wealthy Russians.

Its sting is so powerful it can send muscles into spasms and angered hornets can squirt venom into the eyes of enemies. Hornets were seen feasting on wasps near Goonhavern, between Truro and Newquay, Cornwall on August 27. Stephen Jull took a picture while he was with his friend Sarah near some woodland in an unpopulated area. Mr Jull, from Camborne, sent the photo to Cornwall Live and said the insect was one of several measuring up to 50mm . He said: It was one of several individuals all about 40 to 50mm in length. All were mild-mannered and feasting on insects including wasps.  Meanwhile, over the border in Devon, another one was photographed in Newton Abbot by a Paignton resident. The image shows the insect is about the same size as a \u0026pound2 coin, measuring about 3cm in length. The resident was concerned it may have been one of the invasive Asian hornets which have been widely reported this year. But after Cornwall Live contacted an insect expert to find out exactly what the vicious looking critter was, she confirmed it was in fact a European hornet.  Louisa Bartlett, head keeper at Combe Martin Wildlife and Dinosaur Park, said: This is, in fact, a European hornet , which is part of the wasp family . Although they seem big and scary, they are in fact less likely to sting compared to the common wasp . They can range in size from 2-5cm in length and usually nest in holes in trees. European hornets are known to feed on large insects but can also strip off bark from trees to access the sap.  They tend to sting only when they are stepped on or grabbed, but generally avoid conflict. The sting is said to be very painful and anyone stung by these insects is advised to seek medical attention. Rare cases can also be serious, with some casualties displaying symptoms including tingling at the site of the sting, as well as headaches and shortness of breath.

Even though he wasn\u0027t particularly fussed about losing weight, the people who cared about him the most were terrified of the potential health risks. When Nat, 40, met John in 2001 he weighed 28st and wore size 6XL clothes. The couple fell in love and married in 2005, and two years later they became a little family when baby George was born.  But Nat was extremely worried about her husband\u0027s weight, and didn\u0027t know what to do about it. She said: I fell in love with him regardless of his size. For as long as I can remember John talked about losing weight but he was never serious or ready for it. Me and John\u0027s mum were secretly upset, emotional and worried about John\u0027s weight a lot. We often cried to each other about it but didn\u0027t know what we could do.  But then one night seven years ago, John popped out to get fish and chips and his life changed forever. When he pulled up outside the chippy carrying \u0026pound10 to buy his family some dinner, he spotted a sign for Slimming World. Instead of going into the shop, he went into the meeting and enrolled with the weightloss programme. John, who weighed a whopping 26st at the time, decided to keep his decision a secret, telling only Nat, his mum Avril and his auntie Maureen what he was doing. Nat said: I knew that it was down to John to make it work but once he explained what he needed to be eating with Slimming world I got on board with it, getting the right shopping in, making Slimming World meals, and making sure the kids\u0027 treats were out of sight.  John cut out all takeaway food but chocolate was his real weakness so at Easter 2014 he ate about 20,000 calories of Easter Eggs and then went cold turkey and didn\u0027t touch chocolate ever again. In the first month John lost 4lbs, but in the following months he really got to grips with Slimming World, losing a stone in the second month and 10lbs the next. By the following Christmas John had lost an incredible six stones and the Christmas after his weight loss was up to ten stones. In 2012 the couple welcomed their second child, a beautiful little girl called Elsie, and John had dropped to an impressive 16st 2lb. He decided it was time to take up exercise, and quickly built up his fitness by going to spinning classes and playing football.  He also started training for triathlons and more recently has taken up ballroom dancing. Now, John is the healthiest he\u0027s ever been, and can keep up with George, 10, and Elsie, six. Seven weeks ago he had a tummy tuck to remove 3.5lbs of excess skin.

The boy\u0027s parents also later discovered they had met up and exchanged pictures. Robb admitted inciting a child to commit sexual activity and meeting a child following grooming. Wearing a baggy Hawaii t-shirt and blue hoodie, Robb, from Blackpool, Lancashire, appeared emotionless as she was jailed for 16 months.  Prosecuting, Frances McEntee said: There is a degree of rationalisation by the boy who says he felt he had to engage in the relationship. He did willingly engage in what was an inappropriate online relationship. He repeatedly expressed his love for the defendant. Over time Robb responded with a kiss, then turned to explicit chat, with the naive youngster responding he wanted to hold hands. She sent images of herself naked from the waist up and encouraged him to perform sexual acts.  Mr McEntee added: She\u0027s clearly taken advantage of a vulnerable young man. It\u0027s apparent his parents had become aware. His mother was in the practice of checking his phone and discovered some of the exchanges. He became very distressed. Defending, John Woodward said Robb was a totally different lady now to when the offences were committed. He told the court at the time she had been homeless and sofa surfing after her relationship had come to an end. Mr Woodward added: She says her partner had been violent to her towards the end of their relationship. She took comfort from communication with other males on Facebook and other social media. That\u0027s what led her partner to become suspicious about her extramarital flirtations. She was herself quite vulnerable.  He added she now had a stable home and a new partner and asked the court to suspend her jail term. But Judge Heather Lloyd refused, telling Robb that when the boy sent her messages, she should have taken him off your Facebook account, not encourage him. She said: In your pre-sentence report you denied deriving sexual pleasure from this behaviour. I do not accept that. It is an explanation often given by offenders. Of course you derived sexual pleasure from it, otherwise you would not have acted as you did, and it is clear you were flattered by the attention. This was not a moment of madness. This conversation and this behaviour went on for weeks and you went several steps further than talking.

In this dingy two star hotel the Russian pair spent two nights putting finishing touches to their shocking plan. As Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov checked in they would have smirked at the irony of the large Health and Safety poster on the wall behind the tiny front desk. Little did the receptionist know his new guests were actually carrying one of the most deadly poisons on the planet.  Using a cheap green biro they signed the register like all other guests. If they wanted to remain anonymous for as long as possible this was the perfect place to choose. Rooms cost between \u0026pound60 and \u0026pound74 a night and guests are allowed to pay in cash.  The City Stay Hotel sits on busy Bow Road, in east London, and no-one cares who slips in and out. Police found traces of Novichok here when they finally discovered the Russians’ hideout.  And the owner has clearly gone to huge attempts to ensure there is no danger for current guests. The whole building has been freshly painted in a light yellow. Pots of paint prop up the doors to allow fresh air into the hotel. Even the carpets are new.  The entire establishment has been scrubbed clean from top to bottom following the Russian hitmen’s stay. The couple would have been offered the \u0026pound4.90 breakfast or they could help themselves to the continental for free in a basement room.  “But please clean all your plates and cutlery away when you have finished,” said the receptionist under the eagle eye of three politan police officers. “That’s the one thing we would ask.”  The breakfast room is in the basement down a narrow set of stairs. It is dark with a small kitchen and an large array of cereals. The bedrooms are fairly spartan - with many looking out over the noisy A12 outside. An Enteprise rent-a-car parking lot is across the road and Docklands Light Railway trains trundle past every few minutes. The shared bathrooms are basic to say the least. The showers are small but the toilets clean. Each room has a fan, an iron and a spare sheet.  The manager of the hotel, who declined to give his name, read out a statement to the press. He said: “The City Stay Hotel in Bow Road is open for business as usual. “We are fully supporting the police investigation. “We are reassured that the police and Public Health England have confirmed very clearly that there is no health risk whatsoever to our guests or our staff. “We are receiving a lot of media attention and we would kindly ask that you allow our staff and guests to go about their business unhindered.” But the five police officers who were in and around the hotel yesterday showed that things are unlikely to be the same again. And it’s the ultimate irony the two hitmen were able to tune in to Channel 135 in their room – where they could find Russia Today.  Locals were stunned the Russian suspects chose the modest City Stay Hotel on Bow Road in east London as their choice of venue. Two pubs sit within 100 yards either side of it, The Little Driver and The Bow Bells. And within 200 yards is a functioning police station and magistrates’ court. A Texaco garage is opposite, a closed up cafe nearby and a couple of takeaways. There are few amenities to speak of and the pair could easily have flown under the radar. One local worker said: “It’s really bizarre to come here to stay. “There’s not much around. I think that’s why they chose it. No one would think of here.” Another said it was mainly used as a through-road to get to nearby Stratford, which boast cafes, restaurants, pubs and the Olympic Park.  “I’d say it’s quite rough round here, we’ve had a lot of acid attacks and stabbings, and it’s a bad area for drugs,” said Ellie Smith, 22. “People would usually go to Stratford as there’s not much here, it’s a place you pass through.” Abdul Musabbir, who works in the Bow Church DLR station kiosk, which is directly next to the hotel, said the area has remained unchanged in the past decade aside from a rise in stabbings and drug dealings. “It is mostly tourists who stay in that hotel, but I’ve never seen anything there that seems untoward,” he added. Nobody at local pubs, takeaways, shops or cafes recognised the pictures of Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov. A barmaid at The Little Driver boozer said: “Why would you come all the way from Russia to stay on the Bow Road? “It makes no sense.

International netball player Catherine Roberts was travelling around New Zealand when she started suffering from headaches. She then went to see a doctor - and a scan revealed a lump on her brain. Catherine\u0027s mum - also called Catherine - flew out to New Zealand to join her daughter and they flew back to Britain together. But on her return doctors told her she was too ill for treatment, and tragically Catherine died just two weeks after landing back in the UK.  Catherine was with her fianc\u0026eacutee Bryony Powell, also 27, and believed she had an iron deficiency when she began to suffer from headaches. Heartbroken Bryony said: She was very healthy and active so it was not normal for her to have a headache. They thought she was low on iron then a few days later we were on a bike ride and she became really confused. That was the first major sign that something was wrong.” Catherine, of Blackwood, South Wales, had played netball for Wales - and was described as fit and healthy when she set off on the dream trip. Catherine underwent surgery in New Zealand but was told she suffered from glioblastoma - an extremely aggressive form of brain cancer.  Bryony said: Where the tumour was located is the personality part of the brain and while in New Zealand she hadn’t cried, and she was quite an emotional person. She just said it was because she was having a great time, in hindsight that was the only symptom she had. Catherine was fit and healthy, the symptoms were things that people wouldn’t necessarily checked. She was tired, had headaches, confusion and a slight change in personality. Bryony wants people to now get checked as soon as they notice a change in their own symptoms.  She said: It’s really hard to process what happened and to be without her every day. The family is just devastated, we all are. We are trying to get each other through. It was tough. She was such a positive person, we never thought the worst would happen. We got engaged and we were inseparable. It is really hard to be without her.  Friends have now launched a netball tournament in memory of Catherine, of Blackwood, South Wales, which will raise money for The Brain Tumour Charity. Together with other friends they have raised more than \u0026pound3,000 in Catherine\u0027s name since she died in May. Tournament organiser Vicki Randall said: We wanted to something for her and she would have liked a tournament.

Carlington Grant, 41, and partner Khiana Lewis, 34, flaunted their wealth by posing for pictures on lavish trips abroad - including Jamaica - and in front of fancy cars.  But their deadly trade converting blank-firing pistols into lethal weapons, which earned them about \u0026pound150,000, was soon exposed by police and came back to bite them, reports Birmingham Mail .  Grant was the head of a firearms supply network which saw harmless handguns brought into the UK from France before being transformed into working guns. The weapons were shipped and picked up in Cornwall.  This week, Grant, from Wolverhampton, was jailed for 26 years. While Lewis, from Brierley Hill in the West Midlands, was sentenced to 17 years. Police say the crooked Black Country couple paid for their lavish lifestyle, including trips to Jamaica, from their gun dealing. At Birmingham Crown Court on Wednesday, the pair and a third defendant were sentenced after being convicted of conspiring to sell prohibited weapons and ammunition following a three-week trial. The gang\u0027s middleman, Jermaine Dornan, 30, of Bilson, received a nine-year jail term. He was also sentenced for dealing in cannabis. The group\u0027s activities came to light in August 2016 when two of the converted guns were recovered during a covert operation by West Midlands Police.  The guns were in a shoe box and were handed over in a supermarket car park. All of the men involved in this transfer were caught on police surveillance and jailed for a total of 45 years. Serial numbers on the guns led officers to the firm in France – where such firearms can be legally bought – which had dispatched them as part of a larger shipment just days earlier to an address in Cornwall. A review of mobile phone data led officers to Grant and Lewis. Officers discovered the pair had made four trips to Cornwall to collect the guns before storing and converting them at a unit on an industrial estate. It is understood that Grant passed the two converted guns to the men in a meeting arranged by Dornan before the rest of the consignment was intercepted by police.  Police raided the West Bromwich industrial unit in April last year and found two firearms hidden under car bonnets, plus a large bag of ammunition in ious stages of conversion. Lewis’ fingerprints were found on the ammunition packaging. And in May last year another of Grant’s converted pistols was dropped during an armed raid on a carpet shop. Grant had tried to remove the serial number, but ballistic scientists from the National Ballistics Intelligence Service  were able to apply a chemical technique to recover the number which was then matched to an order from France that had been collected by Grant and Lewis. Both Grant and Dornan were arrested during simultaneous armed police raids last December, while Lewis was detained in January this year at Gatwick Airport following a holiday to Jamaica. A stash of drugs was recovered from Dornan’s flat which he initially claimed was in preparation for his 30th birthday party, but later admitted drug dealing.  At court, Grant said he simply joined Lewis on day trips to Cornwall and believed she was collecting beauty products for an Internet business. But Lewis’ defence barrister rubbished his claim, saying Grant spent a matter of minutes in Cornwall on each visit and hardly had enough time to buy a Cornish pasty, let alone go to the seaside, and was instead visiting purely to collect the guns. Speaking after the trio\u0027s conviction, Detective Constable Rory Juss said Grant and Lewis had paid \u0026pound7,370 for 43 blank-firing guns and 1,160 blank-firing cartridges - which would have been worth up to \u0026pound150,000 on the black market after they\u0027d been converted. He said the gang charged criminals between \u0026pound1,500 to \u0026pound3,500 for each converted weapon. Det Con Juss said although they had no way of knowing how many of the 40 or so remaining guns were still on the streets, they were confident the supply chain had been disrupted.

The elite officers of “The Sweeney” remain crooks’ most feared adversaries – and as the Met’s most celebrated branch celebrates its centenary, bosses warn that will not change. Det Chief Supt Mick Gallagher said his officers will continue using old school methods to catch high-tech crooks. The detective said: “We have to remain open so that we don’t resign past tactics and methods to the past. Sometimes it’s often worth revisiting something that worked very successfully. “It might be that we have to start re-establishing some of the older ways that we used to work and not be so heavily reliant on technology. If encryption, for example, is going to start causing a problem.” The London-based branch was formed as the First World War neared its end by veteran detective Frederick Wensley.   Behind the Battle of Heathrow where cops cracked gold bullion gang in spectacular debut success for The Sweeney  It initially had two horse-drawn wagons patrolling the streets with officers hiding inside, ready to pounce. It became known for action-packed take-downs of armed robbers known as a “pavement ambush” and got the name Flying Squad because it operated across London without adhering to borough policing boundaries. The unit was immortalised when it was portrayed in gritty 1970s TV series The Sweeney, starring John Thaw and Dennis Waterman. The nickname is an abbreviation of Sweeney Todd, Cockney rhyming slang for Flying Squad. Today it has 120 officers at two main bases – soon to be 141 as its remit expands to deal with kidnap. Armed robbery remains its key focus, with moped smash-and-grab raids and deliberate gas explosions of cash machines both recent trends. Much of its success has come from building up a wide network of informants. Its swooping eagle emblem is symbolic of the way its officers swoop on criminals with speed.  Many of the most dramatic raids of recent times were carried out by the squad. In 2004, its plain-clothes officers nabbed a gang at Heathrow Airport trying to steal \u0026pound100million in gold bullion. Our exclusive front page showed a cuffed crook sat with a rueful expression, summing up his surprise at being caught. Retired Flying Squad boss Barry Phillips, who led the surveillance operation that got the arrests, said: “They would have got more than \u0026pound100million. In doing that, it drove criminal activity right down. We were watching them for a long time in a van. We were all waiting for the lorry with the bullion on board. It was months of work, developing intelligence.” Flying Squad officers arrested 17 of the 19 thieves responsible for the 1963 Great Train Robbery. The squad investigated the infamous 1983 Brink’s-Mat security depot robbery and the 1987 safe deposit raid in Knightsbridge.  And, in the biggest operation in Flying Squad history, it foiled a plot to steal jewels from a diamond exhibition at the Millennium Dome in 2000. In November that year, five robbers armed with smoke bombs, ammonia and a nail gun, crashed into the dome with a stolen JCB excavator and smashed through to the vault. They had planned to escape on the River Thames by using a speedboat. Some of the officers were positioned behind a dummy wall, and others were dressed as cleaners with their firearms hidden in black bin bags, or rubbish bins, along with officers in dome staff uniforms. A further 60 armed Flying Squad officers were stationed around the Thames, and 20 on the river itself, to hamper any escape attempts.

The law on lights is simple enough: you must use car headlights from half an hour after sunset until half an hour before sunrise. But there is a surprising exception to this rule. If you\u0027re travelling under 30mph in a brightly-lit area, you don\u0027t legally have to have them on - though you do still need your sidelights. It\u0027s an odd quirk of the law, but is it recommended? It\u0027s generally agreed that using dipped headlights at night is always the best option - making you more visible to other road users as well as improving your view of the road ahead. But if you do choose to use just your sidelights, make sure you don\u0027t fall foul of the rules - or you risk a \u0026pound50 fine. Not a bright idea. Make sure you know the rules  It\u0027s absolutely crucial that, at all times of the year, your car has a full set of working lights.  As well as an MOT failure, driving with a faulty or damaged light could mean a fixed penalty notice, or three points on the driving licence plus a bigger fine if it goes to court .   Since 2011, it\u0027s also been a legal requirement for all new cars sold in the EU to have daytime running lights . The new UK MOT rules mean that cars registered after March 2018 will need to have these working to pass the test.  Research has shown that DRLs are likely to reduce multiple vehicle daytime accidents and fatalities by up to 6% once all vehicles are equipped.   If you don\u0027t have DRLs on your car, then it\u0027s acceptable to leave your sidelights on all the time. Many cars will automatically turn sidelights on if they have an auto mode for lights, they will also switch to dipped lights when its sensor feels it\u0027s dark enough. The law states that you need your dipped headlights on between sunset and sunrise - but there\u0027s no harm turning them on early to improve your visibility to other road users. Check your lights regularly  The best way to do this is with a friend who can confirm that the reverse and brake lights are all working. Alternatively, you can use a reflective surface like a garage door. You can check hazard/indicator lights yourself as well as the running lights and dipped/main beam settings. If you notice a bulb isn\u0027t working, then pop to Halfords - they will select and fit replacement bulbs to your car for a small fee, and there\u0027s no need to book beforehand.  For a more comprehensive check that everything is working as it should, make an appointment online or in-store for a Free Car Check . As well as a bulb check, they\u0027ll also check your battery, wiper blades, engine oil level and air conditioning, and check for any windscreen chips. They\u0027ll even give you a free screenwash top-up!  Don\u0027t be dazzled  As nights get earlier we all have to contend with headlights dazzling us. Remember that most rearview mirrors these days offer protection from bright lights from behind. On newer cars you\u0027ll often have an auto-dimming mirror - which means you just let it protect you from being distracted by overly-bright lights. If you find yourself struggling to see, you\u0027ll notice an off switch to disable the feature. On older cars it\u0027s common that your rear view mirror will have a small mechanical switch underneath it. Flip that and the mirror will change angle, without adjusting the view you see. This is used to stop you from being dazzled in the same way a modern electric system works.  If your car has an old manual mirror then why not upgrade to an EchoMaster Dynamic Mirror and Reversing Camera Kit  for \u0026pound149. A reversing camera is fitted behind your number plate by a bracket. This rearview mirror also auto-dims, perfect for autumn driving! Halfords will also fit the whole system for \u0026pound75.  Keep your car clean  A dirty car looks bad, but it might also get you in to trouble. The law states that your number plate needs to be clean and visible at all times. You also need to make sure that brake lights are clean and clearly visible.  As well as using a good car cleaner you should also make sure your windscreen and lights are clean. Use a specialist glass cleaning product like Autoglym Car Glass Polish , \u0026pound8. You can pair that with the Demon Car Valet Pack  - priced \u0026pound24.50  to get every part of your car shiny as new.

Parents are more reluctant to give the go-ahead for a transplant, with just 48% of those for under-17s agreeing. That compares to an average of 66% of relatives of people of all ages. This means children needing an urgent heart transplant will wait two-and-a-half times as long as adults. In the past three years 46 children have died on the waiting list. Of these 30 were waiting for a heart or lung transplant. Harry Clarke, who turns eight months old during Organ Donation Week, is at Newcastle’s Freeman Hospital with a heart condition.  His parents Kerrie and Rob have uprooted their lives in Birmingham to be by Harry’s side while he is treated for dilated cardiomyopathy. They know that their only hope will be the parents of another child saying “yes” to organ donation at a time of personal tragedy. Kerrie said: “We would hope that family can look at it as an \u0026shyopportunity for their heart to live on through our son. Looking at him without his wires, you wouldn’t know he was ill some days. “Until you go through this and see how many babies are suffering, considering organ donation \u0026shyprobably doesn’t cross your mind but it’s important to have those conversations.” The figures are revealed by NHS Blood and Transplant to mark Organ Donation Week. For many children on the waiting list a young donor is their only hope. Hearts and lungs need to be matched by size because of the limited space inside the chest.

Mum-of-two Aimee Louise Evans was found dead at her home on Saturday, April 7. But when police arrived at the property in Port Talbot, south Wales, they found her daughter struggling to survive. The inquest heard the 28-year-old was found hanged in a bedroom. PC Clive Morris, of South Wales Police , told the inquest in Swansea on Wednesday that Ms Evans\u0027 three-year-old daughter was also in the house and was looking unkempt.  Mr Morris said, according to Wales Online : I became increasingly aware of the three-year-old\u0027s wellbeing – the child had been there for three to four days and she was unkempt. She was taken to hospital to be checked by a paediatrician. PC Morris said police believed the little girl survived by eating loaves of bread and some butter. Ms Evans\u0027 son was staying with his father at the time. PC Morris said Ms Evans had sent a text to her mum, Julie Evans, on Wednesday, April 4.  She had asked her to collect her daughter because she was ending it, to which Julie Evans replied by saying do not be daft and asking her daughter what the matter was. That was the last time the two of them spoke, PC Morris added, with Julie Evans repeatedly trying to make contact with her daughter over the following days, including visiting the property, but getting no reply. The inquest heard the single mum was last seen alive on April 3 when she went to her mum\u0027s house. She had been drinking, but wasn\u0027t drunk, and was checking the Facebook profile of a man she had been seeing on and off. PC Morris said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding Ms Evans\u0027 death, adding that she had no history of mental health problems.  The inquest heard the mum-of-two used to drink most evenings and had been subject to domestic violence in previous relationships. PC Morris said: Her mum said Aimee was a happy, outgoing individual that showed no signs of depression. She said her children were always well cared for – that they were were always clean, tidy, and well looked after. This is one of the hardest cases I have dealt with. Senior coroner Colin Phillips said the post-mortem examination report found the cause of death to be hanging with the toxicology report showing a level of 137mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood.

The 52-year-old Alan Partridge star valiantly attempted to persuade the ticket inspector to let commuters without a seat make use of the unoccupied ones in his carriage. And he was filmed exchanging words in a discussion with a ticket inspector. One commuter on the Southern Rail train said: He was saying that it was outrageous that they should face any penalty and that they should have somewhere to sit.  He was being very chivalrous defending the other passengers. There was one woman who was being told to leave even though she had a lot of luggage and wanted to stay with her bags.

Parts of the UK have been warned to brace for intense deluges and major thunderstorms with a wet and windy weekend in store.  Forecasters are even warning of the risk of TORNADOES from Friday. But temperatures are set to soar again after the weekend with the promise of an Indian summer still on the cards.  Met Office Richard Miles said: “From Friday it will be cloudy and showery with some prolonged outbreaks of rain as a low-pressure system moves into the UK from the North Sea. “There will also be some strong winds particularly around western coasts and across northern Britain.  “It is a similar picture for Saturday and Sunday with the heaviest rain expected over high ground in the west although these showers will move eastwards. “Monday is looking like bringing more of the same as frontal systems push across central and southern areas. “However the southeast is likely to stay drier and and warmer as warm air moves in from the west driven by quite a strong jet from the Atlantic.” "},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror tough russia","story":"NewsopinionVoice of The Mirror: Time to get tough on Russia in wake of Novichok attack on British soilPutin is now trying export to the streets of Britain the thuggery and intimidation he has long used as levers of powerShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByVoice of the Mirror22:23, 5 SEP 2018Updated01:38, 6 SEP 2018NewsopinionPrime Minister Theresa May \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFew will be surprised that two Russians have been named as the suspects behind the Salisbury Novichok attacks.

Putin is now trying export to the streets of Britain the thuggery and intimidation he has long used as levers of power. This latest development shows why we were right to expel several Russian diplomats and tighten sanctions against the country.  The Government must maintain the international coalition against Russian aggression. Britain will today press the case for further action at a meeting of the UN security council. We should also do more on a domestic front. For all Theresa May’s tough talk, the Tories have continued to accept lucrative donations from Russian oligarchs with links to Putin.

Instead, they have a Government that’s cut funding while failing to introduce a social-care system allowing all our elderly to live in dignity.

Russian model Kira Mayer was locked up for 18 months after the officers declined her offer and arrested her. The 24-year-old was pulled over while driving her Mercedes after the officers realised she was driving without a licence due to a previous unreported motoring offence.

At least two people have been killed and at least 120 injured while 38 remain missing after homes were engulfed following the 6.7 magnitude tremor. A landslide along a long ridge in the rural town of Atsumi could be seen in aerial footage from public broadcaster NHK. Aerial footage showed dozens of landslides exposing barren hillsides near the town of Atsuma in southern Hokkaido, with mounds of reddish earth and fallen trees piled up at the edge of green fields. The collapsed remains of what appeared to be houses or barns were scattered about. The entire island was without power after Hokkaido Electric Power Co said it conducted an emergency shutdown of all its fossil fuel-fired power plants following the quake.  The utility said it wasn\u0027t clear when electricity would be restored to 2.95 million households. The trade and industry ministry told the utility to restart the coal-fired Tomato-Atsuma power plant within a few hours, Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko said. All trains across the island were also halted. Roof tiles and water could be seen on the floor at Hokkaido\u0027s main airport, New Chitose Airport, which would be closed for at least Thursday. New Chitose is a major tourist gateway to the island, known for its mountains, lakes and abundant farmland and seafood, and more than 200 flights and 40,000 passengers would be affected, Kyodo News Agency said. The closure comes just a couple days after Kansai Airport, an important hub for companies exporting semiconductors near Osaka, in western Japan, was shut after it was hit by Typhoon Jebi.  The quake, which struck at 3.08am local time  posed no tsunami risk, the Japan Meteorological Agency  said. The US Geological Survey said it struck some 68 km  southeast of Sapporo, Hokkaido\u0027s main city.  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, arriving at his office before 6am, told reporters his government had set up a command centre to coordinate relief and rescue. His voice sounding haggard, Abe said saving lives was his government\u0027s top priority. The Tomari Nuclear Power Station suffered a power outage but was cooling its fuel rods safely with emergency power, said Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga.  Operator Hokkaido Electric Power Co reported no radiation irregularities at the plant, which has been shut since shortly after a massive 2011 earthquake, Suga told a news conference. A fire broke out at a Mitsubishi Steel Mfg Co plant in the city of Muroran but has largely been brought under control, NHK said, quoting local officials. A row of houses could be seen slanting at odd angles, leaning against one another in one town, while roof tiles and water covered floors at New Chitose Airport.  Many schools were closed, and some 2.95 million homes were without power, NHK said. A series of smaller shocks, including one with a magnitude of 5.4, followed the initial temblor, the Meteorological Agency said. Agency official Toshiyuki Matsumori, at a early morning news conference, warned residents to take precautions for potential major aftershocks in coming days. Shinkansen bullet trains were halted in some areas of Hokkaido, NHK said. NHK Footage showed a crumbled brick wall and broken glass in a home, and quoted local police as saying some people were trapped in collapsed structures. Soldiers were shown looking for damage on a rural road that was blocked by fallen trees. Japan, situated on the Ring of Fire arc of volcanoes and oceanic trenches that partly encircles the Pacific Basin, accounts for about 20 percent of the world\u0027s earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater.

Jevh Maravilla and Christian Toledo were so frustrated with what they felt was a lack of Asian representation in the fast food giant\u0027s advertising the students took a picture of themselves eating a McDonald\u0027s burger and fries. And Jevh, of Filipino heritage, edited the photo to mimic the style of the posters at the restaurant, added an iconic yellow logo and had the image professionally printed. Jevh, of Houston, Texas, said: We all deserve equality and all races deserve recognition. I don\u0027t know why McDonald\u0027s marketing didn\u0027t include Asians, but often in the media Asian men are not shown as masculine and Asian women are just portrayed as cute and pretty.  When I was growing up, Asian people only appeared in movies as martial artists or funny side characters. We took the photo outside the neighbourhood events centre while a Zumba class was going on.  A video, which has gone viral , shows Jevh put on a McDonald\u0027s uniform he bought from a thrift shop, add a name badge and pose as Jeff Bergara with the title of regional interior coordinator to pull off an audacious stunt.   I wore a jacket covering my uniform and waited until the coast was clear from any employees, the brazen student told The Independent .     Once the coast was clear, I would take off my jacket and I would tell Christian and Cassandra [Batang, another friend who was helping] how to position it. And the determined pals waited for more than an hour before swiftly sticking the poster on a wall in their favourite branch. They ensured they did not vandalise the property by using an adhesive on July 13. Mission accomplished. It was all so very exciting, Jevh said.

Rolf Buchholz now has an astonishing 516 modifications, and even plans to add more, having had his first aged 50. He is among the weird and wonderful recordbreakers to feature in the latest Guinness Book of World Records, which is published today. The 59-year-old, from Dortmund in Germany, said he “started with tattoos and piercings, and added: I liked it and I did more and more.” And he continued: “It is so great to be in the book. It is something special. I am very proud to be in the book.” He has the most body modifications of any man in the world, according to the records. Other unusual entries in the book include... Most fire-breathing backflips in one minute  Ryan Luney, 22, learned to do backflips when he was eight, but has since added an extreme element of danger to his craft. And he earned a place in the records by completing 14 backflips in just 60 seconds. A statement from Guinness World Records said: Ryan Luney first learned how to fire breathe after being approached to perform in a show in Belfast. The show had trained fire breathers who taught Luney the basics of the skill. Luney then bough the necessary materials and regularly practiced his skills. Soon after, Luney was searching for his next world record attempt. He decided on doing the most fire breathing backflips in one minute after seeing someone do a single fire breathing backflip on TV. He figured this record would combine his two talents: fire breathing and parkour. World\u0027s oldest performing trapeze artist  Also making the list was Betty Goedhart, who at 84 became the world\u0027s oldest performing flying trapeze artist. A statement said: From a young age, Betty has always believed that she could accomplish anything with hard work and determination – which is why she began trapeze classes at the age of 78. Fastest speed in a jet-propelled go-kart  And Brit Tom Bagnall, 26, achieved the fastest speed in a jet-propelled go-kart, reaching a terrifying 112.29mph. Highest jump by a dog  A dog named Feather, from Maryland in the US, set a new record for the highest jump by a canine - by leaping 191.7cm, hitting her basement ceiling. Owner Samantha Valle, 31, who adopted her from a rescue centre, said: “Sometimes it takes a certain person to come along and see the potential in a dog to make them even greater. Most double-Dutch style skips by a dog    Another record-breaking pet is Geronimo, a female Border Collie and Kelpie cross, who has set the record for most double Dutch-style skips by a dog in one minute, achieving an incredible 128. She was proving difficult to train, according to her owner, until she had a go on a skipping rope. Oldest professional club DJ  And at 83 years, 188 days, Sumiko Iwamuro is the oldest professional club DJ. Performing as DJ Sumirock, the restaurant owner said she loves “doing something totally different is energising”. Longest knitting needles created  Another Brit to make the book is artist Elizabeth Bond, who created 4.4metre knitting needles for an exhibition. After learning she has set a world record, the 31-year-old, from Wiltshire, said: “Everybody has potential if you just keep striving and pushing forward. Give it a go, what’s the worst that can happen?” Largest rideable hexapod robot  And Matt Denton, from Winchester, now holds a record for creating the world\u0027s largest rideable hexapod robot, which is 2.8m tall and 5m wide.

Sinead McNamara died despite desperate attempts to save her , after being found in a critical condition on the \u0026pound108 million boat.  The 20-year-old, who had 27,000 followers on the social network, had been out dancing and drinking with friends in Argostoli, on the Greek island of Kefalonia, hours before her death. Ms McNamara, from Australia, died on her way to hospital in Athens.  According to CNN , Coroner Elias Boyiokas said there were no visible signs of struggle or physical abuse, although marks from the rope were found on her neck.   The coroner continued: It is not yet possible to say if she was psychologically pushed to act or was under the influence of drugs at the time. But toxicology results are still likely to take several weeks. Ms McNamara was found tangled in ropes on the rear deck of the Mayan Queen IV yacht, but her death remains a mystery. She had been working on the \u0026pound108million boat - owned by Mexican mining magnate Alberto Baill\u0026egraveres - as a member of crew for just four months. A PR company representing his businesses has declined to comment on her death.  She is reported to have spoken to a security guard 15 minutes before the boat\u0027s captain found her at about 1.45am last Friday. Authorities said initial evidence pointed to the possibility of suicide, but an investigation into her death has been launched. The young woman\u0027s body is due to be flown back to Australia today, and it is expected to be accompanied by her mother Kylie and her sister Lauren. They had already flown in from Australia and were due to meet Ms McNamara on the day she died to go on holiday together. The Instagram star, who was originally from Port Macquarie and lived in Sydney, arrived in Greece in mid-June this year after travelling to Bali, Alaska and the Whitsundays.  Her brother, Jake, confirmed his sister\u0027s death on Saturday. I have unfortunately received the worst news of my life, [Sinead] has passed away, he posted to social media. According to local media, billionaire Mr Bailleres left the yacht, which was anchored off the island of Kefalonia, on Tuesday - leaving Ms McNamara alone with the crew. What happened in the 48 hours after his departure in the lead up to Miss McNamara\u0027s death is now the subject of an inquiry by local authorities. The Mayan Queen was scheduled to set sail over the weekend but has been ordered to remain docked in the port of Argostoli until detectives have interviewed all crew members and a forensic examination of the vessel has taken place.

Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov were accused of carrying out an assassination attempt on former comrade Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in what\u0027s thought to be revenge on Skripal for secretly spying for Britain.  Although they may be aliases, after their names were released by British prosecutors yesterday reports surfaced about Petrov’s \u0027grandfather\u0027 Ivan Starchenko. Starchenko served under Stalin as a commander of SMERSH’s 31st shooting brigade during the Second World War on the First Ukrainian Front. SMERSH was set up by Stalin to root out and kill spies but it was also the fictional Soviet counter intelligence agency in James Bond, featuring in the classic From Russia with Love.  Petrov’s \u0027grandmother\u0027 Nadezhda Moroz also worked as clerk-typist for the same rifle division and was awarded a medal For Military Merit in November 1943. The medal was awarded by Major Ivan Ivanovich Starchenko, described as the chief of the Counter-Intelligence Unit of 31st Shooting Division - the man who would become her husband. The claim from investigative reporter Sergey Kanev raises the possibility that Petrov, believed to be aged 39, is from a family of spies engaged in counter-intelligence.  Records show Starchenko was a SMERSH major at the end of the war, later becoming a state security sergeant in Stalin’s counter-intelligence apparatus. He was awarded a succession of top honours including the Red Star Order, 1943, the Patriotic War Order, grade 1, 1944 and the Red Banner Order, 1945. He had been educated at the notorious NKVD spy school in Moscow, graduating in 1937 during the Stalin terror. Another military connection is that Petrov\u0027s maternal uncle 66 year old Valery Starchenko - pictured here and Ivan\u0027s son - was a paratrooper and linguist , who studied at the famous Ryazan military academy. Skripal\u0027s brother Valery, who died in a mysterious road accident two years ago, was also a paratrooper. Theresa May claimed both Petrov and Boshirov are GRU agents and that their mission to plant novichok at the Skripal family home in Salisbury would have been approved at the highest levels in the Kremlin.  There is also evidence that Petrov made a trip to London from 28 February to 5 March 2017, claimed Fontanka based in St Petersburg. With Boshirov, he also made previous trips together to Europe, according to flight records. “From September 2016 to March 2018 they visited Amsterdam, Geneva, Milan and went several times to Paris.” Boshirov and Petrov are known to have non biometric passports with almost identical numbers, suggesting they were issued two years ago at the same time. Petrov is believed to have been born in June or July 1979, making him 39.

We missed two penalties and we were always in the game until the last two goals went in later in the second half.“So, I think the score was harsh on us in the end but you still don’t want to lose five goals in any game and you want to defend better.”Looking forward, he suspects Alloa will not be much changed from the side that drew with United in the Championship last weekend“I think they don’t have a massive squad so it could be similar to the league game against us on Saturday. They are a good, fit and organised outfit. It will be a hard game.”As was the case in the first-round victory over St Johnstone Colts last month, the United ranks at Tannadice on Saturday are likely to be bolstered by several first-team men.And young midfielder Archie Thomas is back in contention for a starting place.He was injured in the first minute of the first-round victory but returned for half an hour of Monday’s game.United have set the entry price for Saturday’s game at £10.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b618c05b50b5-923x564.jpg ","title":"csaba laszlos new boys are showing some promise at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIt remains early days so far as judging new-look Dundee United goes but there is no question Csaba Laszlo’s team are getting to know each other.After a sticky start to the season, there have been definite signs over the last three, unbeaten, Championship outings that the team is coming together.And the Tele takes a look and how the new men have contributed, so far.Matej RakovanAfter joining up on the same day as fellow-goalie Benjamin Siegrist, one of the big questions going into the campaign was which of the pair would get the nod. It was the Slovakian and, so far, he’s justified the faith shown in him with a string of impressive performances. He did make an error for the goal lost against Partick, but by then the game had been comfortably won.Frederic FransThe Belgian was added to the squad to provide steel in central defence and the fact he had experience of the Scottish game from a spell with Partick made him a sensible addition. So far he’s lived up to expectations and looked a strong and calming influence.Paul WatsonProbably the most low key signing, at first it seemed doubtful if the man who was a squad player at Falkirk would feature too often. Given his chance at Queen of the South last month, the powerful centre-half grabbed the opportunity and impressed in each of his three league games to date, scoring three goals in the process. With the arrival of Rachid Bouhenna, he still faces a challenge to keep his place.Christoph RabitschThe Austrian has had a robust start to his United career and a couple of rash tackles when he was already on a booking have seen him subbed to prevent the team being reduced to 10 men. The 22-year-old was publicly slapped down by Csaba for that. He appears to have taken it on board and there’s no question his ability to get in about opponents is an asset.Adam BartonCaptured from Partick Thistle just before the Betfred Cup games kicked off, the tall Englishman has added to United’s new-found aerial strength. Most of his appearances so far have been in midfield, so he’ll face a challenge once skipper Fraser Fyvie returns from injury, but he’s also been used in central defence and that versatility has given the manager more options.Fraser AirdOne of the first signings of the summer, the Canadian has added pace in the wide areas. He earned his move on the strength of performances against United for Dunfermline last term and, so far, he might just have been the best of the new bunch.Yannick LoembaThe winger was an unknown quantity who hadn’t had much football in the last year or so. However, there’s been no evidence of that and he’s made a lightning start to his time with United. The 28-year-old always wants on the ball and his eagerness to get forward has made him a fans’ favourite.Pavol SafrankoThe loan signing from Aalborg marked his debut with an excellent goal in the win at Queen of the South and has looked the part since. Well-known to the manager from their time together in his native Slovakia, Safranko looks to be the centre-forward United have been crying out for.Craig CurranA dead leg picked up in pre-season delayed his involvement until the opening league game when Dunfermline won at Tannadice. As his fitness has improved after that injury, Curran has shown himself to be a hard worker and chipped in with a goal against Partick.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/Df_kHBUXUAAjf__-e1529653308400.jpg ","title":"decision to be made on future of dundees total wipeout watersports park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWatersports park Foxlake will have the licence for its inflatable adventure park in Victoria Dock reviewed at a meeting of Dundee\u0026#8217s licensing committee today. 100vw, 1113px\" /The giant floating obstacle course, reminiscent of the tasks on TV show Total Wipeout, features tunnels, “moon jumps”, tyre runs and a 3.5m tall slide dubbed “The Mountain”.A licence was granted for the park to allow it to open during the summer, on the condition that it would be reviewed at the next committee meeting.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b8f9a77cd8dc-376x564.jpg ","title":"dundee city centre butchers plans to create cafe and cookery school","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAmbitious plans have been outlined for a cafe and cooking school at a Dundee butcher shop.Scott Brothers Butchers is hoping to adapt another level of its Nethergate store as part of a new venture.And co-owner Scott Jarron said the forthcoming opening of the V\u0026ampA has been a factor in the decision to transform the business.Scott said the firm – which has three retail premises across the city – has been planning the changes for three years.He said: “We are planning to turn the first floor of the business into a cafe with the meals served related to food on offer within our store.“With the cooking school element, we felt we had a social responsibilty to help the next generation of youngsters to learn cooking skills.“We also intend to work with local charities and schools on this to promote the benefits of healthy eating.“We will need to close the store and realistically we would be starting work in February or March.”Scott added that the plans are at a very early stage.And he explained how the opening of the V\u0026ampA had influenced the decision to transform the business.He said: “There will be a significant amount of investment in the premises – within the range of £400,000-£500,000.“Given the location of our business in the city centre and the imminent opening of the V\u0026ampA, we feel there is a great opportunity to offer something different.”Dundee-based architect Jon Frullani, who has been working on the project, described the venture as “exciting”.He said: “It’s great to see another use of a city centre premises that adds diversity to what’s on offer.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b8f9a28b769a.jpg ","title":"dundee council hopeful that observatorys main telescope could return to use","story":"\t\t\t\t\tProgress has been made towards repairing the Mills Observatory.Earlier this year the shutter mechanism on the roof dome failed, making it unable to be opened so the main telescope could be used.Staff have been relying on smaller portable telescopes so visitors can still see the sky.After attending a meeting of the Mills Observatory Advisory Group, a Leisure and Culture Dundee spokesman said: “Dundee City Council is looking to have an engineer’s report during the next month to advise on requirements and associated costs to repair the dome.“In terms of Leisure and Culture Dundee’s plans, we are looking to deliver as full a programme as possible – aiming to keep our opening hours as normal for the winter season.”Councillor Fraser Macpherson said he was anxious for repairs to be undertaken and is pleased progress is being made.He said: “Leisure and Culture Dundee is ensuring that as full a programme as possible is run at the observatory while repairs move forward, which is reassuring.“What is now vital is that necessary capital funding is identified so that repairs work can move forward promptly allowing the Mills Observatory to again offer a full service.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee have a real gem in young striker cedwyn scott says berwick boss","story":"\t\t\t\t\tYoung Dundee striker Cedwyn Scott has earned high praise after a brace on his debut for Berwick.Boss Robbie Horn was highly impressed by the teenager.His double came in a 5-3 win at Albion Rovers when he grabbed the third and fifth goals in a dramatic tie.Horn said: “My research had shown that Cedwyn was a good player but he is better than I had hoped for.

over Queen of the South and Partick Thistle saw them, seemingly, turn a corner.United controlled and managed those matches well but all their good work came undone as they laboured to a point at the Indodrill Stadium at the weekend.Csaba had spoken at the start of the season about his side’s need to start grinding out results if they want to win the Championship.And his disappointment and anger was evident as they couldn’t dictate what he called a ‘dirty game’ in Clackmannanshire.“It was a dirty game but one which really, if you want to make the top league, you have to manage all the time

usually.“So I wait for my team and it’s clear, in this case, you have to circulate the ball quicker, you have to move the ball out quicker to have the possibility to move up the pitch.”United had opened the scoring in the second half through a Paul Watson header on 71 minutes, his third goal in two games, and it could have been more.Yannick Loemba had what would have been his first strike for the Tangerines ruled out for offside and Csaba felt 18-year-old Declan Glass could have played in fellow-sub Callum Booth to put the game beyond doubt.As it transpired, the kid gave away possession

They don’t understand how difficult it is to go to places like Alloa and do what you usually do.“Looking at the pitch, compared to Tannadice it’s completely different altogether, so you have to adjust your game.

It’s just the way the game was,” he added.“I’m sure at home it will be a completely different game but we weren’t used to the conditions and the width of the pitch, so it was tough.“I thought we deserved a point. I don’t think we deserved to win the game and fair play to them because they gave everything they’ve got.“We went to Alloa knowing it was not going to be easy. We didn’t underestimate them but they just played their game very well.“Even in midfield I drop in to get the ball and we mostly look like a back three.“We couldn’t do that against Alloa because it would give them a chance to press us and we were unable to do that.“That was one way in which we were affected in the way we like to play but I’m sure a lot of teams will go there and struggle to play their game.”Barton was honest in his assessment of the performance and says United’s players are not used to a more physical game but insists he knows they’ll need to get used to it.“It turned into a bit of a scrap. We don’t set up to play that kind of football and we don’t have the players who do that.“A lot of people would say you need to be able to adapt to most games but even the best players in the world don’t do the scrappy side of things.

Funds from the event will go to children’s charity Help for Kids.Here, Jon Brady and Iqra Farooq speak to two of the couples taking part.Family friends Mark Dunlop, 46, and Kelly Leslie, 39, are going to have a challenge on their hands – because they won’t dance together for the first six weeks of their training. 100vw, 376px\" /Mark Dunlop and partner Kelly LeslieKelly and her family are away to Florida for three weeks, and around the time she comes back Mark heads off to Australia.So, while the pair will be going to their lessons when they can, they won’t actually dance as a couple until halfway through the preparation.Kelly, a hairdresser from Fintry, said: “We both signed up after a couple of drinks. We thought it would just be a laugh but it dawned on us at the launch night how serious it was.“We’ve resolved to throw ourselves into it since it’s for charity and we’ll have fun along the way.”Neither Mark nor Kelly are big Strictly fans, nor are they experienced at dancing.The only time they have danced together is at football dinners, as Mark plays alongside Kelly’s husband Richard – also a Help for Kids Ambassador – at Barnhill AFC.Kelly said: “I’m not worried about dancing in front of Gok Wan or anything but the thought of going out in front of 500 people is a bit scary.“But my husband is also entering the contest – Mark and I are determined to make sure we knock him out.”Quantity surveyor Mark, from Monifieth, said: “I have absolutely no experience of dancing – none, save for after a couple of drinks at some weddings.“I’m quite relaxed because I think they wanted people that don’t have a lot of experience.“But as it gets closer and closer I’m beginning to realise it’s not just something to laugh about in the pub any more – after the launch night it started to feel very real.”Mark isn’t an avid Strictly fan, but says he’s seen a few shows.He said: “I think we can almost certainly say I’ll have a new-found respect for all the dancers on the show once we’ve got through it all.“It’s going to be interesting, and a good laugh. At the end of the day, what’s the worst that could happen?”Long-term friends Derek Miller, 41, from Letham, and Jenni MacFarlane, 43, from Ballumbie, can’t wait to start practising their routine.The pair first met while working in radio in their early 20s.Fast forward to now and Derek works as a foster carer and has previously been involved in fundraising for Help for Kids – the local charity that will receive funds from the event.He said: “I am an ambassador for the charity so I know what benefits it has for kids in the area.“It is very important for us to be part of the event and we are aiming to raise as much money as we can.”He added: “I’m very nervous about it because I have absolutely zero dance experience apart from a Saturday night at a wedding.”Although a newcomer to the world of dance, Derek has dedicated himself to getting in shape for the night by joining a running club in Arbroath.Jenni, who works as a senior operations manager at Openreach, said: “I knew I wanted to do it when Derek asked because I love Strictly.“I have to admit I am a bit nervous about it but I can’t wait to get our training started.“The size of the event is making me nervous. I’m not shy but being taken out of my comfort zone is a bit scary.”As a Strictly fan, Jenni admitted she was in charge of organising the routine.She said: “We have not picked a song to dance to yet but we are definitely going to go for something fun and upbeat – but we’re not telling anybody.“We’re in it to win it.”She added: “I do not know any of the other contestants but I’m looking forward to making friends at training.”Jenni and Derek have already started their fundraising by having their training gear sponsored.Strictly Come Prancing is being supported by the Evening , radio station Wave FM and the Overgate Shopping Centre. During the launch, the 12 couples were announced and received a video message of support from TV star Gok after posing for their first photo shoot.Tickets are on sale at eventbrite/e/strictly-come-prancing-tickets-48946935602.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/01/5a534929a1286.jpg ","title":"under review council to decide on late licence for takeaway in dundee city centre","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA city centre takeaway is set to have its licence reviewed by Dundee’s licensing committee today.German Doner Kebab on Reform Street was granted a late operating licence earlier this year, despite the objections of local residents.It has been able to open to 3am at weekends and midnight during the week since the application was approved in February.

But hopes that work would start in June floundered when a council officer and Historic Environment Scotland voiced disquiet over proposals for a rebuild that would have been lower than the original building.Although talks are still ongoing regarding the rebuild, planning officers using delegated powers have now given permission for the demolition on the condition the stones are numbered and stored for the rebuild.Central ward councillor Bet McAllister who will attend a meeting with other councillors, officials and the\u0026nbspowners tomorrow\u0026nbspis confident of a solution and hopes the project will be completed by this time next year.\"I would like to see work start before the end of this year and then once the better weather comes in March or April to have it rebuilt next year unless they hit any other snags,\" she said. \"That would be my dream.\"She also insisted that the building should be reinstated to the same height.\"We will stick to our guns on that,\" she said. \"It has to be done to what we want.\"Cllr McAllister said a compulsory purchase order could be an option if a resolution was not forthcoming.\"Hopefully, it will not come to that,\" she said. \"I am confident the owners will play ball and that everything we have asked them to do will be done.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA council spokeswoman confirmed discussions were continuing regarding a rebuild and expected details of the project\u0027 programme to be released next week.Asked whether the council was considering a compulsory purchase order if the talks and proposals failed, she replied: \"All options remain under consideration which will enable the High Street being restored to full use.\"Pat Hayden, chairwoman of Crown and City Centre Community Council, said work should start as soon as possible and felt a more contemporary design for the rebuild should be considered if it would speed up progress.\u0026nbsp\"Time is being wasted,\" she said. \"If it is too difficult to rebuild as it was, let\u0027 forget it.

been looking at the possibility of introducing a gift card which can be used at Bid member businesses and encourage more people to support their local economy.Bid manager Mike Smith confirmed the idea was under consideration and he would be reporting to the board on the proposal within the next few weeks.He said: \"There is a fair degree of investment involved and risk attached because you have to meet the cost of setting the whole thing up and there are different ways of doing it.\"But it is something we will have a look at because we need to encourage engagement with our businesses.\"A gift card scheme was launched in Elgin earlier this year by the town\u0027 own Bid, known as Elgin Embrace, and has attracted interest from Inverness.It is one of more than 20 towns and cities around the UK using a gift card developed by former Highland resident Colin Munro and his company Miconex.Perth, the West End district of Glasgow, Sheffield and Cardiff are among the locations which have set up their own schemes.Some 70 businesses, including national chains and local independents, have signed up to the Elgin gift card.However, Elgin Embrace manager Gill Neill warned that a successful gift card scheme required a large initial investment.\"We did it on behalf of all our members because it is an incredibly expensive programme to put together,\" she said.\"Set up costs are in the region of \u0026pound20,000, so you will find that most of the town gift cards are being run by business improvement districts on behalf of their membership.\"The businesses in the town have been really, really responsive and really positive, but I think a big part of that is we are covering the costs.\"I strongly suspect that if we had not and had been asking people to pay, you would not have had the same uptake.\"The initiative has also been well received by shoppers in the town.\"The public see it as a very positive thing,\" she added.\"Rather than being given a specific gift card that they use in one shop, they get an Elgin Gift Card that they can used in one of the 70 places in the town.\"They can use it to buy clothes, get their hair done, have a meal or put it towards a holiday or buying furniture.\"People are still very positive about embracing the Shop Local message and we hope this will encourage people to perhaps visit businesses they have never used before.\"From the point of view of what a Bid is trying to do, it\u0027 meeting its aim.\"Inverness Chamber of Commerce president Liam Christie sees the prospective Inverness card as a good move for the Highland

worries","story":"HIGHLAND Council chiefs are bashing out revised proposals to defer spending, accelerate savings and \u0026ldquorestructure recruitment to avert a \u0026pound5.1 million budget overspend.A bitter political row overshadowed a resources committee debate on it. Detailed measures will be presented next week.Leaders of the minority independent administration said every attempt would be made to minimise the impact on services but \u0026ldquosome impact on service is inevitable.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \u0026ldquoOur  reserves of \u0026pound8 million are well below the minimum recommended by Audit Scotland and it\u0027 vital that they\u0026rsquore not depleted further. The committee agreed stricter controls on recruitment and overtime, a review of all agency appointments and tighter controls on staff travel.The \u0026pound5.1 million figure equates to one per cent of the total budget and compares with a \u0026pound2.7 million estimate at this stage last year. The potential overspend is blamed on high cost placements for \u0026lsquolooked-after children\u0026rsquo, lower income from new parking charges and fewer savings from toilet closures because those two policies have not yet taken full effect.Council chiefs insisted no staff jobs were at risk.Finance director Derek Yule, however, warned there were \u0026ldquono more rabbits to be pulled from hats to tackle the problems.Black Isle Liberal Democrat Gordon Adam blamed Scottish Government grant cuts while SNP city councillor Richard Laird said the crisis was \u0026ldquoentirely of this council\u0027 making.Council leader Margaret Davidson claimed local government services were \u0026ldquonot a priority for the Scottish Government.The budget leader angered the SNP benches, accusing group leader Maxine Smith of not fully participating in budget discussions. He said he invited her to meetings but had been turned down \u0026ldquobecause she views her private commitments more important than reorganising her diary.She was not in the chamber to respond. In a later statement she said: \u0026ldquoOn Friday, I received a request to attend a meeting on Monday to discuss the budget. I had commitments but they were pre-arranged meetings with constituents. I\u0026rsquove sent him a meeting request for tomorrow. I\u0026rsquom available any time, so hopefully he\u0026rsquoll re-arrange his diary. On the budget, our job in opposition is to scrutinise.A spokesman for the Scottish Government said: \u0026ldquoHighland Council has had more this year despite UK government cuts to our budget. It will receive over \u0026pound487 million Scottish Government funding in 2018-19.n Support was voiced for a city councillor who has quit as the SNP\u0027 deputy leader on Highland Council.Richard Laird  cited health reasons for his decision. He will remain a Central Ward councillor. He said: \u0026ldquoMy health isn\u0026rsquot good enough. That\u0027 the reason I\u0026rsquom stepping down. For the last year or so, both my physical health and my mental health have been in decline. I\u0026rsquove been told by the doctor to reduce my workload a bit.SNP group leader Maxine Smith said: \u0026ldquoI am saddened that Richard has had to step down as depute group leader, as we have worked well together. His illness has been creeping up on him for some time and he feels he needs time to rest, so removing the huge responsibility of chairing a strategic committee is a sensible thing to do.

He impressed and held his starting spot for the 1-1 draw at Hibs.That form was recognised by Scotland U21 boss Scot Gemmill who has called the Pittodrie Youth Academy graduate into the squad that will face Andorra tonight in a Uefa European Championship qualifier tie.Ross said: “I don’t think I was ready then when I scored against Rangers.“I needed that loan move to Morton to get me ready – and now I am.“I am ready to play for Aberdeen.“I learned a lot of stuff about myself mentally while at Morton.“In terms of position, I learned a lot and defensively I also learned so much.“When you are at a huge club like Aberdeen and get an opportunity you have to go out and grab it and I aim to do that.”Ross was a late call-up into the Scotland U21 squad as replacement for Pittodrie team-mate Scott Wright, who had to withdraw having suffered ankle ligament damage during training.Midfielder Ross has previously been capped at U19 and U17 level.While on loan at Morton he made 18 appearances and scored twice.He said: “When I came back from the loan at Morton the manager  said I was so close to playing in his team. What he said made me really work on my fitness over the summer and I came back from pre-season flying and extremely fit.“He noticed that and has rewarded me with game time. That has given me a real incentive.“The gaffer is extremely good with the young players.”Scotland also face the Netherlands in Doetinchem on Tuesday in a Group 4 clash.Gemmill’s young Scots sit fourth in group 4, eight points behind leaders England and three behind second-placed Netherlands, who occupy the play-off position.He said: “You keep an eye on every squad, praying you will be selected.“I know a few of the boys and I was delighted when I got the call-up.”Ross is in the U21 squad alongside fellow Don Lewis Ferguson. Ferguson, 19, arrived at Pittodrie in the summer and has made an immediate impact. The teen has started every game this season and netted a sensational overhead kick in the 3-1 extra-time loss to Burnley in the Europa League. Ross said: “Lewis Ferguson is a year younger than me and when you see him play you think, ‘I need to get a move on here’.”While Ferguson was signed from Hamilton, Ross is part of a Pittodrie Youth Academy class that includes Scotland cap Scott McKenna, Bruce Anderson and Scott Wright.Aberdeen recently rejected a £7 million bid from Aston Villa for McKenna and also knocked back a £3.5m move from Celtic.Ross said: “It is great to have Scott McKenna, Bruce Anderson, Scott Wright and myself out on the pitch. I have been at Aberdeen since I was seven years old and I played my first games for the U10s at that age.“I then actually signed when I was eight. My family were all proud when I made my debut.“There would have been myself, Scott, Bruce, Connor McLennan, Dean Campbell, Sam Roscoe in the U20s. There are a lot more good young players in the U20s that, given a chance, can do well.

Devlin will serve a one-game ban. The incident was 40 yards out and Shay Logan was moving across to make a challenge.A three-man panel of ex grade-one officials failed to reach a unanimous decision on whether McGregor’s kick to Celtic’s Kristoffer Ajer should be referred for Fast Track Proceedings.Harper, pictured, said: “The red card for Devlin was ridiculous. It happened 40 yards from goal and they were holding each other’s shirts.“That red should have been overturned yet the SFA have let it stand and he is hit with a ban.“Devlin now misses an important game against St Johnstone when Aberdeen already have players out through injury.“Meanwhile, McGregor gets away scot-free with a blatant kick-out which is absolutely unbelievable.“It is baffling that three former officials can look at the McGregor incident and not agree it was a red card offence. The decision to uphold Devlin’s red and not take any action on McGregor is shocking.“Then you add in the fact the SFA recently rescinded the red card given to Rangers’ Alfredo Morelos for kicking out at Scott McKenna off the ball.“These decisions are giving out the wrong message. We need to have former professionals making these key decisions and not ex-referees.”An Aberdeen FC statement claimed the club were “extremely disappointed” with the outcome of the Devlin appeal.Harper said: “Fans will stop going to games because there are too many bad mistakes by referees which are being made worse by the SFA.“There is also no comeback for referees who make bad mistakes. If referees make bad mistakes they should be relegated to the bottom divisions and do six games there to prove they are good enough before returning.”The SFA have let Scottish football down and set a dangerous precedent with recent decisions by their fast track review system.Scottish football has now entered murky territory where blatant kick-outs at opponents are now apparently acceptable.And where players are hammered for innocuous and even fair challenges.Welcome to the bizarre world of Scottish football.A world where Aberdeen’s Mikey Devlin has an appeal for a red card and ban thrown out for winning a 50-50 challenge 40 yards from goal.Where Kilmarnock’s appeal for a red shown to Gary Dicker for a fair challenge on Hearts’ Callumn Morrison is thrown out – despite winning the ball.Yet a three-man panel of ex-grade one officials failed to agree Allan McGregor’s kick at Celtic’s Kristoffer Ajer was a red card offence.When a referee did get it right by sending off Rangers’ Alfredo Morelos for a petulant off the ball kick on Scott McKenna – the SFA then over-ruled the red on appeal!What message does this give to the young kids playing the game in Scotland?That it is okay to lash out with petulant kicks?How can youth coaches the country over argue with kids the cynical fouls are wrong, when Scotland’s governing body are sending out the conflicting message it is okay?\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/09/Charleston-Cove-2.jpg ","title":"community living at cove2","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStewart Milne Homes has created the perfect place for families looking for the relaxation of rural living but with the buzz of a thriving community of 2, 3 and 4 bedroom homes at Charleston, Cove.Situated near the historical shingle beach, the picturesque new community offers a selection of amenities from seaside walks to a selection of thriving gift shops, Sainsbury’s supermarket and cafes on its doorstep.

However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK  urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ .energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 33","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/08/18, 2:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There has been talk of a new rugby pitch for a while, but plans presented to community councillors on Monday go further than that.We hope everyone involved is as enthusiastic as Mid Argyll Rugby Club and more power to their elbow.This year\u0026#8217s has to go down as one of the best Mid Argyll Shows in recent times.The weather helped bring out the crowds in big numbers, but the real credit must go to the volunteers who organise the show.

To achieve this, he worked for two years with the Beaver Colony, members aged 6 to 8, and took on a senior leadership role.In February 2018, eight young people from the group took part in a selection process to secure a place at either the World Scout Jamboree in North America in July 2019 or to join a major expedition to Malaysia in July 2019.  More than 250 young people attended the selection process with 70 places available. All members of the 19th Argyll were successful and, as far as we are aware, it was the only unit to achieve this feat.Two of the team, Martha Payne and Polly Payne, have secured places at the World Scout Jamboree, a three-week adventure at the Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve in West Virginia, USA. The event is being hosted by the Boy Scouts of America, Scouts Canada and the Scout Association of Mexico.  Seventeen thousand Scouts from across the globe will attend. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to build relationships, explore other cultures and go on life-changing adventures.Six of the team \u0026#8211 Andrew Smart, James Urquhart, Lorne Barrie, Liberty Hampton, Cameron Garrett and Anna Turner \u0026#8211 have secured places in the West Region 2019 expedition to Malaysia.

At the end of the expedition, the team will get the chance to enjoy the heritage and culture of this amazing country.The young people are involved in the planning and organisation of both expeditions. In addition, these young people from the 19th Argyll have committed to raising £10,000 \u0026#8211 30 per cent of the gross cost of their adventures \u0026#8211 during 2018/19.  To date £2,000 has been raised or committed with members of the team also securing part time employment to boost funds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"strut your funky stuff","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/08/18, 1:30 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowFord Line Dancers will soon be back strutting their stuff every Thursday.They will be back from August 30 in the newly-refurbished Ford Village Hall and welcome anyone, male or female, who is interested in joining.Line dancer Sue Grocock said: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s a great way to exercise, and the beauty of this type of dance is that no partner is required neither is any dancing experience necessary as we will be going back to basics.

A glass pane at Belleisle pro Richard Gordon’s shop was smashed in the 4am raid. Titleist and Wilson clubs were taken, in addition to Richard’s Ping bag and clubs. Police told the pro there’s been around 25 similar thefts in Scotland since April. And they are working with the Scottish Professional Golfers’ Association to track down raiders. “It’s absolutely gut-wrenching,” said Richard, 45. “The bag and clubs were presented to me in April in Phoenix, Arizona,” he said. The pro was given the accolade of being named Ping Custom Fitter of the Year for Scotland. His precious set of clubs includes a titanium driver, along with a three-wood, hybrid clubs, a full set of irons and a putter. All are high-end, high-value clubs - as are the other makes taken in the raid. Richard and his staff moved into the new South Ayrshire Council shop facility around two-and-a-half years ago. “It’s fully alarmed, and has CCTV cameras,” he said. “Security is excellent, but these raiders are prepared to go to any lengths.” It’s been reported, in other raids, that thieves have smashed through metal shutters, and even brick walls. The pro shop at Dundonald Links, between Troon and Irvine, was also targeted in a recent raid. Richard praised the way the police are conducting their inquiries. “They’ve been highly forensic in their investigation - even trying to get DNA,” he said. “The CCTV shows hooded figures, but it’s something the police are still looking at,” he added. Richard has been associated with Belleisle for 25 years, and has been head pro for 11 years. Richard’s wife Vikki works with him in the business, and Lee Hughes is his assistant pro. Richard said: “I love Belleisle, and it’s great that South Ayrshire has invested so much in municipal golf facilities.” “I think South Ayrshire runs the best municipal golf course in Britain if you exclude St Andrews.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrGet into GolfAyr NewsSouth Ayrshire CouncilSt AndrewsTroonDundonald"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13191066.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_AYP_290818CHAMPION_11JPG.jpg","title":"hundreds flock welcome back inspirational","story":"NewsHundreds flock to welcome back inspirational world record breakerPupils, parents and teachers surrounded the car park of Kyle Academy to show their appreciation of Gavin Drysdale, who smashed a world record at the European World Para Athletics in Berlin.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet14:05, 4 SEP 2018NewsKyle Academy pupil Gavin Drysdale \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHundreds of people flocked to a school to welcome back an inspirational hero. Pupils, parents and teachers surrounded the car park of Kyle Academy to show their appreciation of Gavin Drysdale, who smashed a world record at the European World Para Athletics in Berlin. S6 pupil Gavin, of Ayr, brought home the gold in the race running 100m category with an incredible time of 17.37 seconds. And he was given a hero’s welcome as he was led in by a bagpipe performance. He made his way round the hundreds of emotional crowd, and there was barely a dry eye to be seen. It was clear to see how much Gavin had brought the community together, and how immensely proud they were of the superstar. A teacher was even seen asking “is my mascara running?”, which summed up the emotional parade for Gavin. And it was so clear to see how delighted Gavin was with the turnout, with pupils even running over to grab selfies with him. A buzzing Gavin said: “The reception I got coming back to school was overwhelming. “I wasn’t expecting anything like that reaction I got, it was great. “Kyle Academy are always very supportive of any competition I am doing.” Gavin, 17, has cerebral palsy and has been race running for 10 years. He trains at Dam Park, and when he started way back in 2008 he was the only race runner from Scotland. Now there are over 100 competitors from the country.  He is part of the race running club which is supported by Blue Rock Insurance Brokers. The race club is a branch of Ayr Seaforth and is coached by David Phee. Gavin also trains at Red Star in Glasgow with Janice Eaglesham. And the race running has came so far since he started, and these games have helped it get well on its way to being a part of the Paralympic games. Gavin competed in a special racing trike, which has impressive Continental tyres on it. Gavin is still on cloud nine after bagging the top prize in Berlin. He said: “When I won I was totally stunned. “I felt like I had already won a gold medal just by being there, so the fact I actually won was amazing!”  All the way through Gavin’s journey, his mum Margaret and dad Peter have been there supporting him. His family and friends have helped him along the way, and his sister Natalie even had banners up at the family home to celebrate his success for when he got back. Dad Peter said: “We are just so proud of Gavin. “We were so relieved when he won the gold - as we knew how much hard work he put into his progress. “The games went great, and it’s incredible to see how well the Scottish athletes done at the games.  “We have to extend our thanks to Kyle Academy for being so supportive and for this spectacular welcome they have given us.” Gavin isn’t just a star on the track, he has just sailed through S5 picking up an impressive five highers at A and B grades. He was also a part of the Commonwealth games baton relay in 2014. Headteacher for Kyle Academy, Mary Byrne said: “The whole school is so proud of Gavin. “We are delighted that we are able to show our support for him, and everyone at the school is delighted for him.” "},{"url":null,"title":"teenager-dialled-999-a-total-of-28-times-in-two-hours","story":"A TEENAGER has admitted dialling 999 a total of 28 times in the space of two hours without a valid reason.\nSentence was deferred at Selkirk Sheriff Court on 18-year-old Glenn Todd of Cuddyside in Peebles until September 10 for the production of a psychiatric report.\nThe offence happened on June 20 He also admitted dialling 999 on three occasions on April 22 and making a false claim that his mother was dead or injured and requested that an ambulance attend.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"opposition-urge-sbcs-fragile-ruling-group-to-focus","story":"THE leader of the opposition has hit out at SBC\u0026rsquos administration \u0026ndash claiming they are more preoccupied with infighting than managing the council\u0026rsquos affairs.\nTweeddale East Councillor Stuart Bell  launched the attack after two elected members, Watson McAteer and Stuart Marshall, were \u0026ldquokicked out of the ruling group last Tuesday.\nHe said: \u0026ldquoI am deeply worried at the fragile state of the current Scottish Borders Council administration, and they are hardly 18 months old.\n\u0026ldquoThe executive committee was in turmoil last Tuesday as a result of a clumsy decision to expel one of their own councillors [Watson McAteer] and remove him from that committee.\n\u0026ldquoThe administration\u0026rsquos executive had on their agenda a number of significant and quite worrying financial reports.\n\u0026ldquoBut because this council\u0026rsquos collapsing administration seem to be more pre-occupied with in-fighting than with managing the council\u0026rsquos affairs, these important reports were given scant attention.\nAnd Cllr Bell, who chairs the scrutiny committee, says he will support an initiative of Councillor Clair Ramage  to \u0026lsquocall-in\u0026rsquo the report on the quarterly monitoring of the council\u0026rsquos revenue budget which was discussed on Tuesday.\nHe added: \u0026ldquoLast Tuesday\u0026rsquos executive had before them a report stating that just four months into the financial year officers are projecting \u0026lsquopressures in excess of budget\u0026rsquo of \u0026pound1.36m and that report added that less than a quarter of the savings being identified can be delivered on a permanent basis in line with the council\u0026rsquos financial plan.\n\u0026ldquoThe council executive has a responsibility, on behalf of the public, to scrutinise officers\u0026rsquo reports and actions, but they were too busy infighting to do this on Tuesday.\nBut leader Shona Haslam  hit back at the claims.

collaborations between Scottish and Barbadian or \u0026ldquoBajan culture.\nMusicians, dancers, drummers and pipers all come together for a fun-filled weekend, accompanied by top chefs, serving up much loved Scottish meals with a distinct Bajan twist.\nThe now popular festival had humble beginnings in the 1990s when a Welsh men\u0026rsquos choir travelled to the island to perform in a local concert hall.\nSince then, the celebration has expanded and has featured Celtic acts from Canada, across the UK, Ireland, the USA and even Australia.\nFestival director Carol Anderson from Edinburgh

dogs \u0026ndash but gave just six advisory notices and five dog control orders to irresponsible owners.\nHowever, following a meeting with Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale MSP Christine Grahame, the council has revealed it has handed out 15 dog control notices over the last 12 months, with two still pending.\nMs Grahame, who introduced the Control of Dogs  Act 2010 as a member\u0026rsquos bill, said: \u0026ldquoI had a very useful discussion with the representatives from Scottish Borders Council and it was important to hear first-hand how this legislation is being used in practice.\n\u0026ldquoIn the last year there have been 15 dog control notices with two pending, although there are some issues with obtaining owner details. Some owners just need to be spoken to and advised of their responsibilities.\nDog control orders allow Scottish Borders Council to impose certain conditions on dog owners. For example, a dog which frequently runs away may be required to be kept on a lead at all times, or an aggressive dog may have to be muzzled when in public spaces.\nThe control orders can also be used to compel dog owners to seek training for themselves and their pet. Failure to adhere to a dog control order could lead to a ban from keeping animals or the dog being put down.\nA Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe council is currently reviewing its responsible dog ownership strategy, which will aim to remind owners of their social and legal responsibilities.\n\u0026ldquoAs part of this strategy, the council works in partnership with local and national charities to promote responsible ownership and dog control by educating the public at ious events across the Borders.\n\u0026ldquoThe council responds to all complaints received concerning out of control dogs, but in order to assist us in investigating each complaint fully, we ideally require the dog owner\u0026rsquos details.\n\u0026ldquoMembers of the public can contact 0300 100 1800 or visit www.scotborders.gov.uk if they have a concern about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour.\nMs Grahame added: \u0026ldquoMy main concern is that members of the public may not be aware that if a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour is causing concern, for example being allowed to be out of control, they can report it to the council through this route.\n\u0026ldquoThe police, of course, deal with the most serious incidents.

that the applicant has demonstrated that a substantial and likely inappropriate development would be required to make the scheme viable.\n\u0026ldquoI am satisfied that the viability argument has been

safety record continuing to be one of the poorest across the UK, FSPS is encouraging those working within the industry to make safety a priority.FSPS, which consists of key industry stakeholders, will focus on different types of farming activities, each quarter, to deliver key messages and encourage those working and living on Scotland’s farms and crofts to take action.This week, the campaign, trailing on from Farm Safety Week in July, is urging people to make an active choice about their safety and will focus on the following between September and November: general maintenance on farm, falls from heights and safety at harvest.Last year there were 33 deaths in the agricultural industry in the UK, with five in Scotland.The most common causes of death in the agricultural industry continues to involve falls, transport, animals and equipment.Over the last five years 38 people have been killed in the UK by a moving vehicle 12 people have been killed by contact with machinery 10 have been killed by asphyxiation or drowning, including in grain stores or pits and slurry pits and eight people have been killed by contact with electricity.This data does not take into account the number of injuries on Scotland’s farms and crofts, a number that is believed to be significantly higher.For those amidst harvest, it is essential that they practice the ‘Safe Stop’ method when working with machinery, equipment and vehicles \u0026#8211 handbrake on, controls in neutral, engine off, keys out.Anyone working with equipment or machinery should also be appropriately trained, with full risk assessments carried out, particularly when working near power lines.Speaking on behalf of FSPS, NFU Scotland chief executive Scott Walker commented: \u0026#8216One death or injury on Scotland’s farms and crofts is frankly one too many and as an industry we need to take action to make a conscious effort to put our safety, and that of those living and working around us as a priority.\u0026#8216Whether it is carrying out maintenance to a roof, checking over a machine, or working in a field with power lines, injuries and deaths through accidents most of the time are preventable by taking simple steps and precautions.\u0026#8216This campaign encourages farmers and crofters to make a point of ensuring their working environment is safe, to help us work together to reduce the death and injury toll on our farms and crofts.\u0026#8216This autumn, it is about your Safety, your Choice, and as the darker nights draw in, and many are rushing to get the job done it is important to take a step back to make sure you are working safely.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter dogs are not sensible cycling accessories","story":"I was interested at your article

Both present geological challenges but they can be overcome.\u0026#8216Today, I\u0026#8217ve asked for a feasibility study to look at these issues and move things forward.\u0026#8217In February, the Courier compared a potential bridge from Kintyre to Northern Ireland, to the Øresund bridge, which connects Copenhagen in Denmark with Malmo in Sweden.Professor Dunlop drew on this comparison during his speech, referencing the fact that the Øresund bridge links two separate countries, each with their own distinct identifies but sharing a cultural heritage, similar to Scotland and Northern Ireland.He pointed out the political benefits of linking the two UK countries, especially post-Brexit.He believes a bridge may re-balance the concentration of power held by Westminster and be an investment in what he considers to be the true north.Argyll and Bute MSP, Michael Russell, said of the plans: \u0026#8216A bridge, together with better road links to the central belt, would open up Argyll in a dramatic new way.\u0026#8216I would be keen to see public bodies investigate the feasibility of such a link.\u0026#8217The Øresund bridge, linking Denmark and Sweden, could be similar to a structure linking Kintyre with Northern Ireland.

Hannah\u0026rsquos world had come crashing down when she tore her ACL last April while fighting in a competition in Berlin, leaving her facing a summer on crutches.  Having binge-watched Love Island while off her feet, the 16-year-old Ross High School pupil was starstruck when Jack \u0026ndash who was already in Tranent to visit family \u0026ndash appeared at her Church Street home to wish her well.  \u0026ldquoIt was mental, Hannah told the Courier.  \u0026ldquoHe was in Tranent and my little sister [Sophie, 12] had messaged him, and I didn\u0026rsquot know.  \u0026ldquoShe told him I\u0026rsquod had surgery and was being really moody! He said he\u0026rsquod be down soon and the next minute he was at the door!  The 22-year-old came sixth with partner Laura Crane on this year\u0026rsquos season of Love Island. Having only entered the show\u0026rsquos Majorcan villa in the fourth week, he proved an immediate hit with viewers.  \u0026ldquoHe was always my favourite, said Hannah.  \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos just dead nice. He has family up here so he was up visiting them.  \u0026ldquoHe stayed for about 20 minutes. He plays sport too, so he was asking about my injury and about judo.  \u0026ldquoI just asked him about Love Island, and what life was like after the villa.  \u0026ldquoHe said that he had a gut feeling he was going to leave, and that they all shared clothes and had a laugh. He said they\u0026rsquore all best friends after the villa.  But what did Hannah\u0026rsquos mum think when a 6ft 3ins-tall personal trainer from London walked in her door?  \u0026ldquoSophie told her before me but I still think she was a bit confused, Hannah laughed.  After posting news of her surprise house guest online, Hannah said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove gained 4,000 followers on Instagram and had loads of people messaging me wishing me well. My friends all said they should\u0026rsquove come round to see me!  Jack\u0026rsquos visit certainly lifted Hannah\u0026rsquos spirits as she now faces another agonising four to six months off the mat through injury.  \u0026ldquoI just fell awkwardly, she said.  \u0026ldquoI actually carried on which probably wasn\u0026rsquot a good idea, and then I got withdrawn from the European Championships.  \u0026ldquoIt was my first big selection which is why I was in denial about being injured.  Even with this bump in the road, Hannah is adamant to make it to the top.  \u0026ldquoI got into [judo] when I was five through my friends doing it, she said.  \u0026ldquoWhen I was about 12 I started doing competitions and this year I\u0026rsquove been travelling loads.  \u0026ldquoI went to Japan for a six-week training programme and trained full-time with the Japanese kids.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance. It is important that the local community has its say and we look forward to engaging with this process."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-when-haddington-was-underwater","story":"  John Hamilton of the Facebook page Lost Haddington got in touch with the Courier to highlight how the floods of 1948 would look in present-day Haddington.  He said: \u0026ldquoUsing the flood mark in the video-still as a reference, I got a friend who has access to a theodolite to use this and project this water level to other landmarks around the river and town centre.  \u0026ldquoRobert Byers from Haddington Camera Club then used his photo editing skills and a photoshop \u0026lsquoflood\u0026rsquo plug-in to reconstruct the photos.  In August 1948, persistent heavy rainfall saw the county face its most serious flooding in history.  Although much of East Lothian was affected, Haddington took a major hit. High Street as far west as the Town House was under several feet of water which stretched to the gates of Amisfield Park, a distance of more than half a mile.  Distillery Park, the Nungate, Peffers Place and Brewery Park were similarly devastated.  The Biel Burn also flooded, submerging all the low-lying land north and west of West Barns.  The flood occurred as the culmination of a period of truly exceptional rainfall \u0026ndash 122 mm of rain fell between August 1 and 8, followed by 153 mm in the next five days.  The saturated ground then received a huge 139 mm of rain in the next 24 hours, bringing severe flooding across the county.  The Haddingtonshire Courier reported on \u0026ldquodisastrous flooding without parallel in living memory \u0026ndash if not in history.  In the August 20, 1948 edition of the Courier, \u0026ldquoserious damage was inflicted on the banks of the River Tyne while other streams burst their banks and \u0026ldquoleft destruction in their wake.  It added: \u0026ldquoSo heavy was the flood of water that the streams made courses for themselves, with the result that many people were flooded out of house and home.  \u0026ldquoOne of the worst areas to suffer was Haddington, where a large number of people were rendered homeless, while shops and business premises were flooded to a depth of several feet.  Meanwhile at West Barns, the Biel Burn overflowed, causing serious damage to houses and shops in the village but fortunately \u0026ldquono loss of life is reported, although some people had narrow escapes, so suddenly did the water levels rise.  The floods also caused serious damage to crops on farms close to the Tyne and extensive damage was also caused to the now-demolished New County Cinema on Hardgate.  Nungate residents who had been enjoying the evening\u0026rsquos film were instructed by cinema management to return home to avoid being cut off as water levels rapidly rose.  And slightly further afield, the electricity supply in Gifford and Saltoun was interrupted, and at the Maltings in Haddington the sub-station was completely swept away. It was anticipated it would take many months for the affected areas to return to normal, and calls for assistance to help with the recovery were issued."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-commodore-of-haddington","story":"  TEENAGERS often get a bad press. To be sure, it\u0026rsquos a time when parents wonder what has happened to their children and feel they have lost them or gone wrong somewhere. This is because teenage years are a time of great change in terms of brain development. Quite literally the teenage brain is being remodelled and new priorities and emotions are created as a result.  It\u0026rsquos a time when peers and their approval become more important than parents or family, or almost anything else. Taking risks, or doing seemingly foolish things, are all part of this. We are familiar with the term \u0026lsquopeer pressure\u0026rsquo, but in our teenage years, approval by our peers and being included by them takes on a massive importance. It is an essential part of growing up and creating a new self-identity.  And a story from over 200 years ago shows that although the word teenager may not have been invented, and that there was no such thing as \u0026lsquoyouth culture\u0026rsquo as we now know it, behaviour was much the same.  It involves a group of young men who we would now call teenagers. They were a group of friends from Haddington. They included George Neill, John and William Haldane who were brothers, Peter Martine, Benjie Hunter and John Davie, whose nickname was \u0026lsquoLettie\u0026rsquo. They were all from Haddington, and their escapade became a story told well into their senior years. The nickname \u0026lsquoCommodore\u0026rsquo was coined for George on this day and stayed with him until he took it to his grave many years later.  Much of the tale is left to the imagination but the essentials were well told. One of the group came up with the idea of hiring a boat and heading out to Fife. These young men were not from poor backgrounds and so had the means to do this. So with the madcap plan devised, they set off as a group to the fishing village of Prestonpans.  The negotiations to hire a boat were concluded and they set off for the foreign shore of Fife, aiming for the town of Kirkcaldy. I cannot comment on their sailing abilities but they must have had some experience for they successfully navigated themselves to the shore of the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo, possibly using the Lomond hills as a marker.  They came ashore like invading Vikings, intent on mischief. No social media in those days, but each town had a drummer who would disseminate news. And so they found Kirkcaldy\u0026rsquos drummer and paid him to announce to the town that at three in the afternoon there would be a spectacular diving and swimming show at the harbour entrance. The drummer set forth announcing the news, creating an air of expectation.  The group chose Lettie to be the performer. He was the best swimmer amongst them. As 3 o\u0026rsquoclock approached, a large excited crowd assembled on the harbour walls. The Haddington lads looked at each other with wry smiles and secret sniggers. Their ruse had worked, perhaps too successfully.  \u0026ldquoShow them what ye can dae, Lettie was told by his friends. And so Lettie stood on the edge of the boat and dived into the sea, from a height of about two feet. The crowd was silent, except for a wee five-year-old girl who clapped. She was the only one impressed by the spectacle.  There were murmurings as the Kirkcaldy folk began to realise they had been duped and were being made a fool of by these young Haddington lads. The mood began to get angry, and boos were followed by threats and words I cannot print here. It was clear it was time to go.  \u0026ldquoThank ye, the lads said, bowing to the crowd and laughing, mocking them for being so gullible. Stones began to fly towards them as they set off back towards Prestonpans, gesturing to the now-furious crowd. The lads in the boat were hysterical with laughter. They had raided and fooled the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo.  But then their laughter stopped. Emerging from the harbour was a boat filled with angry Kirkcaldy lads who were shouting serious threats. The prank looked as if it might end unpleasantly so the Haddington lads had no choice but to row for their lives.  George took command. His friends had nicknamed him the Commodore at the beginning of their voyage, not so much because of his nautical skills but because of his leadership qualities. They were now desperately needed.  \u0026ldquoRow lads, row, he called on them. To be truthful the Haddington lads were at a disadvantage. They were not skilled seamen and in truth they were more bookish than brawn. But fear can do mighty things to a man\u0026rsquos capabilities, and as the adrenaline pumped through their veins they found levels of strength they didn\u0026rsquot know they had. They rowed like true Vikings, heave ho, heave ho. The sea splashed at their feet, their hearts nearly burst, but they kept the pace.  Slowly they began to pull ahead from the Kirkcaldy boat. \u0026ldquoKeep rowing, lads, dinnae look back, dinnae slow doon, called George, who was himself rowing as hard as he could. The tide was strong, the night was drawing in and the weather was beginning to change. The Kirkcaldy boat turned back, but the Haddington lads dare not attempt a Fife landing. They had no choice but to cross the Firth.  Darkness fell, then a thick haar covered them in freezing mist. They rowed through the night not sure in which direction they were headed. They wondered if their parents would ever know what had happened to them if, as now seemed likely, they were lost at sea.  The morning sun slowly burned off the mist. Thankfully they were still in the Firth, and there in front of them was the smoke coming from the lums and salt works of Prestonpans. They wept with relief and summoned up their last drops of energy to row ashore. Their final few hundred metres to the stony beach was watched by village children and women drying clothes.  Some fishermen helped pull the boat to land and the Haddington lads literally collapsed out of the vessel onto the beach, utterly exhausted but elated to be still alive.  George Neill was later to become a well-respected Baillie in Haddington, a bookseller and publisher of great local repute. He outlived his friends who had shared that day of adventure and danger.  He was often asked by those who knew him less well: \u0026ldquoWhy do people call you the Commodore? He never tired of telling the tale of his teenage adventure."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-secondary-schools-delighted-with-pupils-exam-results","story":"  This year saw the best pass rate in Higher exams across East Lothian for five years.  East Lothian Council said that pupils across its six secondary schools \u0026ndash Musselburgh Grammar School Knox Academy, Haddington North Berwick High School Preston Lodge High School in Prestonpans Ross High School, Tranent and Dunbar Grammar School \u0026ndash improved their performances, with the number of Highers passed going up to more than 79 per cent.  Lauren Rodger, headteacher at North Berwick High School, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results are brilliant and we\u0026rsquore really pleased with how all the current sixth year pupils have performed.  \u0026ldquoI know schools are judged on their exam results, but for us it\u0026rsquos also about seeing the pupils develop \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos the most pleasing part.  Similarly pleased was Paul Reynolds, the Ross High School headteacher.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted with the exam results.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results have been record-breaking and the sixth-years who have just left us have got really positive results that will allow them to hopefully go to uni or further education.  Meanwhile, Musselburgh Grammar School is celebrating record attainment levels for S5 and S6 pupils at all levels in this year\u0026rsquos exam results.  Headteacher Colin Gerrie said that there were also many \u0026ldquoexcellent results achieved by pupils in S4.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe results achieved by our students this year are exceptionally good and continue the successes of recent years, with school records broken on an annual basis.  \u0026ldquoWe do not underestimate the hard work of our pupils and the commitment of our teachers to make this happen.  His counterpart at Preston Lodge High School, Gavin Clark, also gave his thoughts.  At PL, four S5 pupils achieved six As at Higher, although the number of pupils gaining one, two, three or four Highers dropped from the last set of results.  Mr Clark added: \u0026ldquoWe expected that to happen, as a result of our regular tracking process.  \u0026ldquoThis dip in no way diminishes the achievements of those who performed so impressively in examinations.  At Knox Academy, new headteacher Susan Cook gave an update on how the school was performing.  She said: \u0026ldquoSeventy-four per cent of S4 pupils attained five or more qualifications at National 3 69 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 4 and 47 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 5 at grades A-C and 55 per cent at grades A-D.  \u0026ldquoThere were some outstanding individual performances in S4, with eight of our candidates achieving seven A passes at N5.  \u0026ldquoThese results are a really strong foundation to build S5 performance upon and I would encourage all parents/carers to continue to support their child to study at home as the transition from S4 to S5 in terms of challenge and pace moves up a few gears and much more study is required, especially at Higher level.  Meanwhile, the performance of S5 pupils in their Higher exams was down on the previous three years.  Ms Cook added: \u0026ldquoFifty-five per cent attained one or more Highers 35 per cent three or more and 16 per cent attained five or more Highers.  \u0026ldquoTwenty-two of our pupils achieved five Highers and some with straights As across all subjects.  \u0026ldquoMany other pupils achieved a mixture of Higher and National 5 awards and will build upon these in their sixth year.  Finally, there was \u0026ldquoan improving trend for S6 pupils over the last four years at Higher level, Ms Cook added.  The headteacher said: \u0026ldquoThose attaining one or more Highers was 62 per cent and then added to their results from S4 and S5  this rose to 76.22 per cent having achieved one or more Highers over S5/S6 \u0026ndash one per cent lower than last year, which in terms of statistics is not significant. However, it\u0026rsquos more than 13 per cent more than pupils attained in 2015 and 2016.  \u0026ldquoThirty per cent of the year group attained three or more Highers and the accumulate total was 66 per cent .  Finally, Claire Slowther, headteacher at Dunbar Grammar School, told the Courier that the staff at the school were \u0026ldquovery pleased with the exam results and said: \u0026ldquoAt Dunbar Grammar we are very pleased with the SQA results our students have achieved.  \u0026ldquoIt is wonderful to see the hard work of our students be rewarded with great results.  \u0026ldquoOur excellent team of teachers always work hard to support and challenge students and we were all really delighted to see them do well.  \u0026ldquoWe are incredibly proud of the achievements of our students and are looking forward to celebrating these at our awards evening, which will be held on September 12."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-longniddry-south-to-go-on-display","story":"  Developers Cruden Homes  and ZeroC will be displaying their proposals for development at the Longniddry Inn on Wednesday from 3pm to 8pm.

That project came about following rising safety concerns from drivers who did not feel confident using the unlit road.  Since then, driver confidence has improved by 78 per cent, with the project, which was undertaken by UK-based Clearview Intelligence in partnership with Transport Scotland and Amey, shortlisted in the Road Safety, Traffic Management and Enforcement category at the National Transport Awards, which take place in October.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, a Dunbar ward councillor and deputy leader of East Lothian Council, as well as chairman of the A1 Action Group, was one of those hailing the project as a big success.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe installation of the studs has, in my view, revolutionised the driving experience on the A1 after dark.  \u0026ldquoThe studs have improved night-time visibility beyond all recognition along certain parts of the route.  Concerns about driving conditions on the unlit road were first raised by the A1 Action Group, which comprises councillors from Scottish Borders and East Lothian Councils, transportation groups and community councils.  Transport Scotland met with the action group and, upon investigating the road, recognised that entering or exiting the A1 during the hours of darkness was a key area of concern due to a lack of visibility, junction definition and consistency in signage and road markings.  Clearview Intelligence was then appointed by Amey to make improvements to the road as part of a wider project and installed the road studs to give a visual consistency to the route by ensuring all major junctions were visible and treated similarly.  This included using white, red, amber and green studs to effectively highlight road edges, the centre of the road and junctions.  Andy Salotti, director of solutions at Clearview Intelligence, said: \u0026ldquoWe are immensely proud of the work we did to improve the driving conditions on the A1 and delighted this has been recognised at a national level. It is an honour that we have been shortlisted as one of eight finalists in this category."},{"url":null,"title":"aberlady-street-to-be-without-power-for-most-of-the-day","story":"  Scottish Power is carrying out work on the village\u0026rsquos Kirk Road, with work to take place until 6pm.

A planning application has been lodged with the local authority for \u0026ldquoalterations, extension to redundant water tank to form one house and associated works.  A planning statement submitted as part of the application for the site, reads: \u0026ldquoThe proposal is to restore and convert a redundant and roofed-over water reservoir into a residential dwelling and improve the quality of this site.  The report adds that the house would be \u0026ldquodesigned so that the proposal provides an acceptable solution, preserving and enhancing the character and appearance of the building, which is category B listed.  The application is for a two-storey house, with disabled access from the first floor and a car park on land adjacent to the ground floor.  It is proposed that the upper floor will contain an entrance hall, family  shower room, three bedrooms and an open-plan kitchen/dining room and sitting room, as well as stairs to the ground floor.

The agricultural land has been earmarked by East Lothian Council for business use but Barratt claimed the council\u0026rsquos vision was financially unviable.  They said the only way to make the \u0026ldquonumbers add up was to create a mixed use site with housing and industry.  But their claims were rejected by councillors after Provost John McMillan , cabinet spokesman on economic development, insisted: \u0026ldquoIf we build it, they will come.  The quote, paraphrasing one made famous in the US baseball movie Field of Dreams starring Kevin Costner, came as he backed council officials who recommended the plans from Barratt and site owners The Co-operative be thrown out.  Jason Watt, from Barratt, told a meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington last Tuesday that site drainage and geology issues meant it would cost \u0026pound1.5m to get ready for development.  Once general costs were taken into account, the total development bill would be \u0026pound2.25m \u0026ndash yet the value of the land was estimated at only \u0026pound1.1m.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe numbers clearly do not add up and never will unless there is cross subsidising with a mixed use development.  Ward councillor Kenny McLeod  backed the Barratt proposal, highlighting the lack of council housing available for rent in Tranent: the proposed Barratt development included 25 per cent affordable housing.  Mr McLeod said: \u0026ldquoWe need to keep the local connection and they are not building housing for rent in this area.  \u0026ldquoIt must be 50 years since a house was put in the area for rent.  However, fellow Tranent, Wallyford and Macmerry councillor Colin McGinn  said he was concerned about the traffic that would be created by more than 100 homes on the site, which is on the opposite side of the town\u0026rsquos Haddington Road from Steading View.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe have a responsibility within Tranent to increase employment and opportunities for our young people.  Councillor Brian Small , opposition leader, told the committee: \u0026ldquoThere is no point in having a [Local Development] Plan if at the first turn we think we can turn it over. We need to give this business land the opportunity to develop.  The committee was told that while the district valuer had agreed with developers that the land was not financially viable as a single business plot, they had said it could be made financially sound by developing it in phases.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoWe have enough land set aside for housing.  \u0026ldquoPeople want \u0026ndashand need \u0026ndash local employment and if we build it they will come. This is a signal to developers we want to grow the number of jobs around the county.  The committee voted by nine votes to two to support the officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to refuse the plans."},{"url":null,"title":"transport-co2-emissions-on-the-rise-in-east-lothian","story":"  The latest data from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has revealed that CO2 emissions from freight and passenger transport rose by 4.2 per cent in the county between 2011 and 2016.  That means traffic was responsible for 18.5 per cent of the total amount of carbon dioxide released in East Lothian in 2016.  But in total, CO2 emissions in the county fell over the same period.  Jason Rose, from East Lothian Greens, blamed more housing developments in East Lothian for the rise in CO2 from emissions relating to transport.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoTo live [in the new developments], you need a car. More houses means more cars.  Mr Rose also highlighted the fact that nearly half of East Lothian residents commute to Edinburgh every day for work.  \u0026ldquoThe main issue is half the people who live in East Lothian work in Edinburgh, so they have to commute, he said.  \u0026ldquoBuses take a long time, you want cheap and reliable.  \u0026ldquoWith trains, there definitely needs to be more of an effort to improve length and frequency.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council should be trying to increase employment in East Lothian, so people don\u0026rsquot need to commute.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove heard some people say, \u0026lsquooh what if you open a bridge here or build another road?\u0026rsquo but creating more roads just increases traffic and spreads the problem around.  Overall, emissions from transport, both private and for business purposes, increased by 3.5 per cent in the UK over the period between 2011 and 2016.  However, total CO2 emissions fell by 4.6 per cent over the five years in East Lothian.  The county was responsible for releasing 1.1 million tonnes of CO2 in 2016 \u0026ndash down from 1.15 million tonnes five years earlier.  But Mr Rose highlighted that it was not just CO2 emissions that needed to be monitored.  \u0026ldquoWe need to watch for NO2  and PM10  \u0026ndash those are the pollutants that can cause health risks, he added.  In East Lothian, industrial and commercial activities are by far the main producer of CO2 emissions, releasing 63.9 per cent of the total. In 2016, households produced 16 per cent of the CO2 in the county, lower than five years earlier.  The Department also takes into account the amount of CO2 produced by farms and through other rural activities and the CO2 removed from the air by trees.  According to its estimates, these agricultural activities produced more greenhouse gases than forests removed, and so were responsible for 1.6 per cent of the carbon emissions in East Lothian in 2016.  Overall, the UK reduced its carbon emissions by 15.4 per cent over the five years."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  We\u0027ll also reveal the Top 25 in this year\u0027s Pet Idol competition.

Duo Gymnastics, based at the Aubigny Sports Centre, Haddington, is keen to buy a new vaulting table, which costs about \u0026pound1,000.  Jane said: \u0026ldquoWhat I have been really impressed with is the way the club and coaches have adapted to him.  \u0026ldquoThere is mainstream gymnastics but they have adapted lessons for his needs.  \u0026ldquoIt has made him not feel different and he still feels part of the club \u0026ndash he really enjoys it.  \u0026ldquoCameron\u0026rsquos disability comes under Global Development Delay.  \u0026ldquoHe has a real difficulty with comprehension and understanding what is being asked of him, following instructions.  \u0026ldquoHe is also very sensitive to noise and sudden loud noises.  \u0026ldquoThat is what they have managed to do really well, break it down into small parts for him.  \u0026ldquoThrough time, it becomes a routine and he understands what is being asked of him.  Jane, who lives near Gifford, has been a keen swimmer for a number of years and represented Scotland in the 1994 Commonwealth Games, in Canada.  However, after a break from swimming she returned to the pool at the beginning of the year before swapping the pool for the sea earlier this summer.  She said: \u0026ldquoI kept swimming as a hobby and to keep fit.  \u0026ldquoI have always swam but it has always been indoor swimming.  \u0026ldquoI started looking about and had always had an interest in open-water swimming but never did it.  \u0026ldquoI came across the Firth of Forth swim and that quite appeals to me and thought I would give it a go.

In preparation for the fundraiser on September 22, Jane has taken to the waters off Dumfries and Galloway\u0026rsquos coast and has also linked up with the Bass Rock Swimmers, who are based in North Berwick.  Despite being an accomplished swimmer, Jane said there were still challenges.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe currents are certainly a big factor.  \u0026ldquoIt is just your awareness and you can go off track very easily and just that anticipation of what is below you and what you are swimming over.  \u0026ldquoI have enjoyed the challenge and it has certainly put me out of my comfort zone.  \u0026ldquoI have really enjoyed it and met some really lovely people.  \u0026ldquoMy thanks go to my husband, Garry, and family for support and encourage to take on the challenge and to Duo Gymnastics Club for the support and help they have given Cameron.  Pamela Fletcher, from the gymnastics club, said: \u0026ldquoThanks to Jane undertaking the swim, the club can purchase a new and much needed vaulting table for the gymnastics at Aubigny Sport Centre. Due to local support we have now met our target however donations continue meaning we can hopefully purchase some more equipment.

I\u0026rsquom now in my late 50s, and 60 is looming ahead of me like a cat waiting to pounce and have cruel fun. Yet I know people who are in their 30s and 40s who are much older than me, and folk in their 60s and above who are younger. My oldest daughter is in her early 20s and is already lamenting the fact she is no longer \u0026lsquoyoung\u0026rsquo.  The truth is that age is a mentality or, as is often said, \u0026lsquojust a number\u0026rsquo. Of course, deteriorating health and pain can come with age, as I have experienced, but even then, getting this far makes me very thankful despite the wear and tear.  I often say that life is like toothpaste: we use it with abandon at first and then, as we realise it\u0026rsquos running out, each squirt becomes increasingly more precious and satisfying.  \u0026ldquoA whole summer seems nothing these days, it\u0026rsquos over before you get used to it, a friend said to me recently. And indeed it is nothing if we measure it by days passed.  Yet if we measure not the passing of hours, days or years but the accumulation of memories and experiences, then time seems longer, both in quantity and quality. The trick, then, is to make those experiences and memories, and to truly live in them as they happen. This means understanding what is truly meaningful to us, and what gives genuine joy and fulfilment.  I think that is the secret to a long life, regardless of what number you reach. It\u0026rsquos not just about how much toothpaste is in your tube, it\u0026rsquos about how much you savour and use the amount you have. All of us savour key moments, of course. The first day at school for our children, our holiday time, time with friends or spent doing things we enjoy.  Yet inevitably such moments are less common than what we might call the daily routine of life. I suppose that\u0026rsquos what makes them stand out. Thus the daily routine of \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo life shoots us by, almost without us noticing. And that\u0026rsquos most of our life.  And so I am now more determined than ever to make my life \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo for as long as I may have left. This isn\u0026rsquot a commitment to hippy living in a campervan  but a conscious decision to savour every day as if it were my last. And what really helped me in this realisation was a conversation one day while waiting for a train. . .  One spring morning just before this summer, I was standing on the platform at Prestonpans station waiting for a train. I was not used to getting this early train and was surprised how busy it was. I was heading into Edinburgh to do some storytelling and so unusually sharing my journey with commuters.  It was a beautiful warm sunny morning, the herald of the heatwave soon to arrive. As I waited for the train I scrolled on my phone. Then I heard a voice behind me saying: \u0026ldquoOn your death bed, will you really look fondly back on the countless hours, equivalent to years of your life, spent scrolling on a phone? Will you remember just one per cent of that activity, or even want to?  I turned round to see who was speaking to me there was nobody. Then I noticed the hawthorn tree.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos better, the hawthorn said. It was resplendent with blossom, leaning over the edge of the side of the bridge which takes the cars below the station.  Perhaps I had seen it before, but this time I really noticed it because it had spoken to me. I studied its flowers and took in the immense beauty of it. It\u0026rsquos perfectly situated to admire, but the hawthorn seemed sad.  \u0026ldquoCan you imagine the effort it takes to get this magnificent and beautiful? it said. \u0026ldquoYet nobody seems to notice me.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure they do, I replied. \u0026ldquoNo, they don\u0026rsquot watch, insisted the tree. And so I did.  The hawthorn was right. People walked past the tree, stood next to it, but nobody seemed to notice it, and certainly nobody took any time to admire it.  \u0026ldquoBut they are busy, I said in our defence.  \u0026ldquoWe are all busy in different ways, said the tree. \u0026ldquoBut we can choose to be \u0026lsquotoo busy\u0026rsquo for some things while being busy doing others. Often you decide what is important to be busy with so you exclude what you think are the less important things.  \u0026ldquoLike looking and admiring you? I replied sarcastically.  \u0026ldquoPrecisely, said the hawthorn, perhaps not understanding a sarcastic tone.  Suddenly the train arrived. People put away their phones and I bade a hasty farewell to the tree. We all crammed into the carriage and it filled up to the brim. I saw the blazing white of the hawthorn\u0026rsquos blossom through the window. Then we headed for Wallyford.  The train ground to a halt and the doors opened. There was a crush and people calling out politely \u0026ldquoplease move up. I wondered if everyone would get on, and I think they did, but only just. Now the train felt overloaded and it literally ground its way out of the station.  When it arrived at Musselburgh, the doors opened to present a human wall made of commuters from the Pans and Wallyford. There was simply no way anyone was getting on. I watched from the privilege of my seat. Two young men with suitcases, obviously going on holiday had no chance, and didn\u0026rsquot even try.  As the train pulled away, leaving dozens of people stranded on the platform, I felt a sense of guilt at having a seat. At Waverley we were trapped in a bottleneck by ticket collectors, ensuring that none of the lucky ones who had actually managed to get onto the train would escape paying for their good fortune.  When I returned I had to cross the bridge to my car. And there was the hawthorn tree, showing off its blossom like a peacock trying to impress a mate with its feather display.  And I have noticed the hawthorn ever since. The blossom faded as summer arrived and now it bears it berries. Its haws glisten where once there was blossom, reminding me that summer has had its course, and asking the question of how I made it memorable.  I am so thankful for the hawthorn\u0026rsquos advice. It was simple but so important. The trick is to live in the moment to notice that which makes the mundane and normal extraordinary or beautiful or special.  We can pepper our daily life with simple but extraordinary moments of connection, so a day never really remains \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo. We just have to truly live in that moment, to come out of our busyness and worries, and savour it.  Maybe the hawthorn tree will speak to you if ever you find yourself at Prestonpans train station. Or maybe someone else will your child, your grandchild, your partner, friends, your grandparents, your work colleague, or perhaps your inner self.  Maybe it wasn\u0026rsquot actually the tree which spoke to me. Perhaps it was my inner self. But then again, perhaps it was a speaking hawthorn, and you have to be \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo to hear it!"},{"url":null,"title":"leader-of-councils-conservative-opposition-steps-down-after-health-issues","story":"  Councillor Brian Small, who has held the position since being one of seven Conservative councillors elected in May 2017, stood down for a brief period last year following a severe bout of sepsis before returning to the post.

Planning permission for a new cemetery to be included next to a housing development currently being built at Dolphingstone, beside Royal Musselburgh Golf Club, was initially approved three years ago. However, environment agency SEPA raised concerns about the impact a burial ground would have on water quality on the site and plans to build there stalled.

What happens to the property on Sanderson\u0026rsquos Wynd has long been a bone of contention, with the building being left empty and unused for the last 10 years after the school shut in 2007.  The site is a popular gathering place for youths in the area and, although covered by CCTV, it has not acted as a deterrent.  There have previously been reports of vandalism and people breaking into the building.  An external inspection in May 2011 found \u0026ldquoa fine former infant school which externally is in generally sound condition but vacant and in need of a new use.

The latest development will be to the east of the site earmarked for a new primary school on the large development area on Haddington\u0026rsquos western edge which is expected to have more than 800 new homes once complete.  Provost John McMillan, ward councillor, raised concerns from local constituents about dust and road washing equipment used on the site over the summer.  Charles Church, from Mactaggart and Mickel Homes, told the committee concerns had been raised about issues with the building contractors used on the site and they were looking at possible penalties for any future breaches of the agreed construction management plan.  Mr McMillan asked if it would be possible for any financial penalties paid to be put towards local community groups or projects. Mr Church told him that was a consideration, adding that Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ldquoalready has a fund called building communities where we invest in local communities.  The revised plans were approved unanimously.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: \u0026ldquoIt is good to see Letham Mains moving forward and the site coming together.

They were also ordered to use plastic glasses in an outdoor marquee at the club and banned from playing music on a planned new patio area.  A Police Scotland request for the club to install CCTV \u0026ldquoof a standard approved by police inside and outside the venue was also granted by the board.

Repeated negotiations convened by the British and Irish governments have failed to persuade former coalition partners the Democratic Unionists and Sinn Fein to reconcile their differences.  Mrs Bradley told Parliament: \u0026ldquoWhile Assembly members continue to perform valuable constituency functions, it is clear that during any such interim period they will not be performing the full range of their legislative functions.  \u0026ldquoSo, in parallel, I will take the steps necessary to reduce Assembly members\u0026rsquo salaries in line with the recommendations made by Trevor Reaney.  \u0026ldquoThe reduction will take effect in two stages, commencing in November \u0026ndash\u0026nbspit would not reduce the allowance for staff as I do not think that MLAs\u0026rsquo [Members of the Legislative Assembly] staff should suffer because of the politicians\u0026rsquo failure to form an Executive.

Instead of glorious failure, events conspired to send Shelley Kerr and her players to next summer\u0026rsquos World Cup in France.  The final whistle, and the players\u0026rsquo unbridled joy on learning that Switzerland had simultaneously failed to win in Poland, confirmed Kerr\u0026rsquos long-held belief that it would be the top seeds who faltered at the last hurdle.  The win over Albania at the Lori Borici Stadium was somewhat laboured, but neither the head coach Shelley Kerr nor her players were concerned about that after the team\u0026rsquos historic achievement.  The two results left Scotland on top of Group 2 for the only time since the qualifying campaign began last September. They can now look forward to next summer\u0026rsquos finals in France while the Swiss contemplate the four nation play-offs.  \u0026ldquoYou could see our energy was zapped tonight after the win over Switzerland on Thursday night and the pitch here wasn\u0026rsquot great, Kerr said. \u0026ldquoBut that\u0026rsquos why I knew it would be the same for the Swiss against Poland.  \u0026ldquoThe team are going to celebrate for sure because they deserve it \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos not every day you get to a World Cup, is it? Nothing compares to this. I\u0026rsquom delighted for all the players, the organisation and all the other people who support us. We had seven or eight good chances, we\u0026rsquove hit the post again and we should have made it more comfortable but I\u0026rsquom no going to dissect the performance.  \u0026ldquoThe whole week has been so tense and I\u0026rsquove tried to keep calm as a coach. I\u0026rsquove just told the players to try and win the games and they\u0026rsquove done it magnificently.  Top scorer Jane Ross, who was left out of the starting line-up for the previous two games, returned, while Manchester United\u0026rsquos Lizzie Arnot was also given her first start since returning from an ACL injury in April.  Christie Murray and Claire Emslie dropped down to the bench.  With the home side expected to get as many bodies as possible behind the ball, Scotland\u0026rsquos game plan was to stretch them on both flanks and it didn\u0026rsquot take long to pay off. After nine minutes of probing, Lisa Evans got clear on the left and sent over a cross to the far post which Arnot sent back into the paths of Kim Little and Erin Cuthbert. The Arsenal captain claimed it and crashed a volley past Viona Rexhepi.  It looked to be a non-contest as the Scots created chance after chance but they lacked the sharpness to take advantage. Rexhapi was also doing her part and made a terrific double save from Cuthbert and Ross six minutes after the goal.  The pattern continued until the half hour when the Albanians started to find some confidence. They found an equaliser just before half time, and just minutes after Rexhepi had made an even better save from Emma Mitchell \u0026ndash Megi Doci sending a low shot past Lee Alexander, who had been redundant for most of the 45 minutes.  Left-back Mitchell came even closer with a shot which hit the post and Cuthbert drew out another fine save from Rexhepi, but it was starting to look fraught midway through the second half when the much-needed goal finally arrived.  Caroline Weir took a free kick which her Manchester City team-mate headed back into the path of Ross and the striker scored her 57th, and most important, Scotland goal.  After that there was no way back for Albania, who spent most of the remaining time pinned back in their own half.

It is important you put this behind you.\"  McIntosh was driving a coach full of Celtic fans which crashed into a car in a road rage incident on the A9. He then parked and got out to punch Mr Wall, from Uphall, in the face.  Mr Wall told the court: \"My wife Alexa was asleep. The bus sped up as I was braking. The chevrons were coming up and the lanes were merging.  \"The bus was driving right behind me. I saw him gesticulating at me.

I thought I should slow down in case anything happened.  \"I was frightened.

I was trying to keep the car straight on the road. The car bounced. I felt it shudder.  \"It was quite clear we had been hit at about 50 miles per hour. My hands were shaking,\" Mr Wall said.  He pulled into a layby and was followed in by the bus full of Celtic fans returning from their match against Ross County in Dingwall.  As the supporters got out and urinated, McIntosh stormed past Mrs Wall and punched her husband in the face and knocked off his glasses.  Mr Wall said: \"I looked up to see the bus driver standing over me. There was a look of anger and the fist came down like a hammer. I saw his raised fist above me and he banged it down on my temple.  \"I hammered backwards into the car. I saw a white light.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be, if not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to return to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But if this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But if Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"standardised-tests-for-primary-pupils-not-compulsory-says-government","story":"  The clarification on the literacy and numeracy assessments - set out in a joint letter from the Scottish Government and council officials - is the latest attempt to clear up confusion over whether parents have the right to opt out.  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon introduced the assessments as a response to concerns over falling standards of literacy and numeracy and a lack of consistent data across the country.  However, critics claim they are too stressful for the youngest pupils with feedback highlighting cases where pupils were left distressed.  As a result a national campaign was launched involving teaching unions, parent bodies and charities to encourage parents to opt out.  The move resulted in confusion over whether families had such a right because, while councils have a wider legal duty to provide education, the curriculum itself is not enshrined in legislation - meaning parents don\u0027t have a specific legal right to opt out.  The joint letter from the Scottish Government and Ades, the body which represents education directors, said the assessments should be seen as a key tool to inform teachers of the needs of pupils.  It adds: \"The ... assessments, in common with virtually all aspects of the Scottish curriculum and its delivery, are not provided for in legislation.  \"This means that they cannot be seen as compulsory, but also that there cannot be a legal right for parents to withdraw their children from the assessments, or indeed any other part of the school curriculum with the exception of some parts of religious observance and instruction.  \"In practice, however, should any parents or carers have any particular concerns about their child\u0026rsquos participation ... they should discuss this with their school with a view to reaching agreement on whether the child will undertake the assessments.\"  The Educational Institute of Scotland  teaching union, which has opposed testing in P1, questioned whether delivery of the assessments fell under the terms of a wider legal duty on councils to provide education.  Larry Flanagan, general secretary, said: \"This letter incorrectly suggests there is a legal duty on local authorities to deliver the Scottish assessments.  \"It also overstates the educational value of assessments, contrary to the weight of evidence supplied by our members.\"  Mr Flanagan said the EIS supported the \"absolute right\" of parents to opt children out through a request to their school or local authority.  Sue Palmer, chair of literacy charity Upstart Scotland, which is leading the opt out campaign, said the guidance clarified the right of parents to withdraw.

But the TUC says its analysis shows that the pressure on household budgets has in fact increased under her government, pushing the JAMs \u0026ldquoeven closer to the financial cliff-edge.  Since Q4 2016 to Q1 2018, the report highlights how families\u0026rsquo outgoings have outstripped incomes in every quarter, resulting in a total household deficit of \u0026pound34 billion.  It notes how in 2017, the Office for National Statistics reported a calendar year shortfall of \u0026pound900 per household the first time in 30 years that the average household spent more than it brought in.  The analysis explains how in the 1980s \u0026ndash the last time families went into the red \u0026ndash household deficits were driven by high spending. However under the current Government, spending has grown by an average of just two per cent a year in the same period, real disposable incomes have declined at an annual rate of -0.4 per cent, driven by falling wages and insecure work.  \u0026ldquoIn other words, families are being forced to borrow simply to maintain a basic standard of living, declared the TUC.  ONS figures showed, it said, that the shortfall was concentrated across the poorest fifth of households with spending outstripping incomes in both the first and second deciles by income.  As a result, debt levels among the poorest households were rising extremely quickly. From 2015 to 2017, the [consumer credit] debt to income ratio for the poorest households rose from around 55 per cent to more than 100 per cent, according to the Centre for Responsible Credit and Jubilee Debt Campaign.  Frances Grady, the TUC General Secretary, said: \u0026ldquoTheresa May has abandoned the promises she made when she moved into Downing Street.  \u0026ldquoTwo years on, working families can\u0026rsquot make ends meet without being forced into the red. And the May Government has done nothing to get wages rising or to crack down on the epidemic of insecure work.  Ms O\u0026rsquoGrady went on: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos time for the Prime Minister to get serious about domestic issues. Families on the edge need more than empty words.  \u0026ldquoFor a start, she must do something to tackle insecure work. More than a year after the Taylor report on modern work was published, it\u0026rsquos still gathering dust, she added.  Ahead of its annual Congress, which starts this coming weekend, the TUC called on Mrs May to:  *crack down on insecure work, ending unfair pay for agency workers and banning zero-hours contracts  *end Universal Credit cuts, which were set to force families further into the red."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-macwhirter-come-what-may-the-snp-stubbornly-refuses-to-split","story":"  I am not and never have been a member of the Scottish National Party, but I\u0026rsquove no difficulty believing it to be the most extraordinary phenomenon in British politics, not least in its preternatural ability to unite in the face of adversity. Other parties are becoming virtuosos in the art of political division. The Conservatives are split at least three ways over Brexit, with their Prime Minister\u0026rsquos authority in ruins and Boris Johnson in open revolt. Labour is bitterly divided over anti-Semitism and Jeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos leadership. The SNP isn\u0026rsquot: it realises that unity works.  With 125,000 members, the SNP is now the second largest party, not just in Scotland, but in the entire UK. Indeed, if the SNP membership were scaled up to UK level, it would have twice the UK Labour Party membership and 12 times that of the Tories. Such numbers might be expected in a radical opposition party, but not a long-in-the-tooth party of government.  Yesterday, Nicola Sturgeon announced the 12th legislative programme since the SNP entered government in 2007. The SNP is now into its second decade in office, yet support appears actually to be rising again, according to YouGov, and is back to 40 per cent. This despite the widely-publicised problems with NHS waiting lists and poor performance in educational league tables. Nor has support for independence flagged, with one poll this week suggesting that, if Brexit happens, more Scottish voters are minded to support Yes than in 2014.  Ms Sturgeon appears to have seen off the threat from Richard Leonard\u0026rsquos newly-Corbynised Scottish Labour, and we are reliably informed that Ruth Davidson is now looking to a political future in Westminster. Much of this success is down not to the Scottish Government, which has made its share of mistakes, but to the resilience of the party itself. Yesterday\u0026rsquos programme was a workmanlike job with important measures on mental health, animal welfare and children\u0026rsquos rights, but it was essentially an addendum to last year\u0026rsquos offerings on tax and the environment. Everyone says Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos administration is looking tired, and in some respects it is. Truth be told, the Scottish Cabinet, Sturgeon aside, has never looked particularly dynamic. But the slide to political disfavour, widely predicted after 2017\u0026rsquos abortive referendum, hasn\u0026rsquot taken place. The party continues to break all the established rules of politics \u0026ndash the pendulum refuses to swing. This is largely because the SNP membership has turned party unity into an article of faith, and turned positive thinking to a potent political weapon.  It\u0026rsquos not as if the SNP lacks issues to split over. There\u0026rsquos Brexit for a start, upon which there are widely differing views. Some back Brexit, some back a People\u0026rsquos Vote against it, most are dismayed at the prospect and feeling powerless.  Ms Sturgeon can\u0026rsquot make up her mind on whether to support a People\u0026rsquos Vote, but unlike in the other main parties, no vociferous factions have emerged to persuade her either way.  Many SNP activists are desperate for an early independence referendum, and believe that if Nicola Sturgeon doesn\u0026rsquot announce one now, the chance might never come again. We have pro-independence marches wending through Scottish cities almost by the week. But Ms Sturgeon has pointedly declined to endorse them, and has given precious little sign of being about to call a referendum. In any normal party, there\u0026rsquod now be two warring camps, like the Leavers and Remainers of Brexit, on this existential question of independence. But not the SNP. You can almost sense it positioning itself for constructive disappointment, not open revolt. The great split over the referendum may never come.  Then there\u0026rsquos the Sustainable Growth Commission Report,with its dismal science of deficit reduction. That caused much dispute on the Scottish left, but the membership has refused to turn it into any recognisable left-right division in the party. There\u0026rsquos no Campaign for SNP Socialism. The will to unity is just too strong \u0026ndash as it has been in the backwash from the resignation of  Alex Salmond \u0026ndash a veritable god in the Nationalist pantheon, who has been cast out of the party after over 40 years.  The row over Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos crowdfunding took place outside the SNP. Faced with the extraordinary prospect of the former First Minister taking the Scottish Government to court, SNP members refused to turn what they see as a personal drama into a political crisis. Many SNP women have concerns about victims of sexual harassment, and Mr Salmond isn\u0026rsquot universally popular, but they chose not to turn this difficult case into an intra-party gender war.  Labour and press commentators often talk about the SNP\u0026rsquos almost unnatural unity as if it is centrally enforced. As if there is some dictatorial party secretariat imposing rigid discipline and suppressing debate. Either that, or the SNP is a \u0026ldquocult, they say, in which star-crossed believers lose their ability to disagree. In truth, it is neither: the SNP is just damned if it will give the hated \u0026ldquomainstream media stories about splits, so it keeps it in the family.  It wasn\u0026rsquot always so. The SNP used to be notorious for its squabbles and divisions. Mr Salmond was expelled from the party in 1979 for leading a left-wing faction. And the party was deeply divided over devolution in the 1990s. It learned the hard way that unity works. Rather like the Tartan Army, the SNP has found a way to insulate itself emotionally from the disillusion and despondency that afflict most political parties once they starts governing in prose. This is what has prevented the Scottish Government from lapsing into mid-term doldrums and disarray. For its many thousands of members, the SNP has become, not so much a political party, more a way of life."},{"url":null,"title":"may-and-corbyn-clash-over-second-brexit-vote-at-prime-ministers-questions","story":"  The Prime Minister said she was clear that Britain would leave the European Union on March 29 2019.

When ministers announced the literacy and numeracy assessments for pupils in P1, P4, P7 and S3 they said the should replace existing tests.  However, teachers who responded to a survey by the Educational Institute of Scotland  said at least eight of Scotland 32 local authorities were continuing with previous standardised assessments - although it is unclear how long this will remain the case.  The EIS warned the practice of \"double-testing\" increases teacher workload and puts too much pressure on pupils.  The survey also suggested at least 25 councils had introduced \"blanket testing\" - where all pupils sit the assessments at the same time.  The Scottish Government has previously said teachers should have the freedom to decide when pupils sit the assessments.  An EIS spokeswoman said: \"For these children, assessment was not an integral part of everyday learning and teaching and was not timed to support their individual learning. This was out of the hands of teachers.\"  The latest concerns over testing came on the day John Swinney, the Education Secretary, gave a statement to Scottish Parliament on the purpose of the assessments and whether parents had the right to opt out, which has caused confusion.  Mr Swinney used the statement to apologise to parliament for a \"misleading\" letter on controversial primary school tests sent by a senior civil servant.  The minister said that while he did not personally sign off on the letter from Graeme Logan, a deputy director at the Scottish Government\u0027s learning directorate, he took full responsibility for it.  However, Mr Swinney said he remained committed to the assessments at all levels, despite cross-party opposition and calls to \"cut his losses\" on the issue.  Mr Swinney said: \"I did not sign off the letter that was issued by the deputy director to directors of education, but I take full responsibility for it because I\u0027m a minister in the Scottish Government and it\u0027s right that I take full responsibility for it.  \"I can only apologise to parliament ... for the events that took place in that respect, but I take responsibility for it because I should take responsibility for it.\"  He stressed that the substance of the letter was consistent with the Scottish Government\u0027s position - that while there is no statutory right for parents to withdraw their child from any aspect of schooling other than some parts of religious education, the tests were not compulsory.  Ross Greer, education spokesman for the Scottish Green Party, urged Mr Swinney to \"cut his losses\".

But it is the jubilant women, not the men, that have been doing the country proud - as they clinched first place in their group and automatic qualification for France 2019 with a dramatic 2-1 victory over Albania.  While the women have qualified for their first ever\u0026nbspWorld Cup, it has been 20 years of hurt for Scotland\u0027s men who last reached a\u0026nbspWorld Cup proper in 1998, and even then only managed one draw before exiting after three group stage games.    No wonder people have been falling over themselves to acclaim the Scotland Women - including the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who is a patron of the team.  And Scotland fans groups said it is time for the whole country to get behind the women as they prepare for the 2019 FIFA Women\u0027s World Cup.

And there will be a few of us planning to go to France next year.  \"I am of a certain vintage that says if the women qualify, then I am going.\"  He said that he felt the women appeared to show more pride in playing for their country than their male counterparts.    \"There are a few sceptics that are not convinced that many of the men take as much pride as the women do,\" he said.  \"Watch them singing the National Anthem, every single one of them does it. They show such commitment. That\u0027s what the fans demand of the men and I am not convinced that we get it.\"  Scottish Football Supporters Association director Paul Goodwin said interest in football amongst women had grown in the past ten years and there can only be an upward trajectory in the wake of the Scotland Women\u0027s success.  READ MORE:\u0026nbsp  He said that in the 60s he would be amazed to see a woman in the crowd at a football match in Scotland. At the last count, 2400 of their 30000 members were women.  When Scotland\u0027s Women beat their Swiss counterparts 2-1 at St Mirren Park last week, 4,098 attended, a record for one of their international matches.    Four years ago when Scotland won 2-0 against Poland at Fir Park, Motherwell in another vital World Cup qualifier, it attracted a crowd of 1551.  Just before the critical Albania game BBC Alba announced a set of new deals that would see the channel become the home of Scottish women\u0026rsquos football in a move that signalled a huge boost for the game\u0027s profile.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe deals include the live broadcast of any Scotland squad World Cup games in 2019.  \"We believe support for women\u0027s football will grow with this fantastic achievement and we have to build on that momentum,\" added Mr Goodwin.  \"More creative marketing should be put in to actually get more people to support the local women\u0027s teams \"There are people who will say that the standards are not the same as with the men\u0027s but it\u0027s like any sport it has to be seen in its own merits.  \"Nobody turns their nose up at [Scots middle-distance runner Laura Muir]. They don\u0027t say that the time she is running now is not as good as what Steve Cram managed in the 80s.\"    He said the fact the Scots team are playing in better teams in some of the biggest women\u0027s football leagues is having an impact.  \"If you look at where the men\u0027s game is, there are very few players in the English Premier League, they are mostly playing in the Championship [the second tier of English football]. But if you look at the women in European terms, they have players at Manchester United and Manchester City and it is playing at that higher level that is no doubt what is propelling them to the World Cup.\"  Alana Watson, who is also an SFSA director said that Shelley Kerr\u0027s Scots team will become role models for the young girls who are increasingly taking up the sport.  \"What they have done is a massive achievement at a time when the men\u0027s team has not qualified for an international tournament in the last 20 years. It shows that the standard of women\u0027s football in this country is going from strength to strength,\" said Ms Watson, who is a former coach.  \"Predominantly football is seen as a man\u0027s game so women are always going to be challenged to be recognised for their accomplishments in that field and with qualifying for the World Cup, that will hopefully change some people\u0027s views about it.  \"The numbers of, especially younger girls, who are involved in playing football and going along to a club and having that structured league that boys grow up with, that has definitely grown massively in the past decade, so for them to have role models who are women, who they can actually watch play football, that is going to inspire them even more.\"  She felt women\u0027s football was attracting those who prefer a more family friendly atmosphere - something they often do not get when attending a Scottish Premiership game.  \"There is less stigma surrounding the women\u0027s game,\" she said. \"That\u0027s why there are a lot of kids that like to go and watch women\u0027s football.\"  Chris Rawlings, Scottish FA\u0027s commercial director said in announcing the BBC Alba deal: \u0026ldquoThis is a partnership we are extremely excited about as the women\u0026rsquos and girls\u0026rsquo game in Scotland continues to develop.  \u0026ldquoHaving a guaranteed broadcast partner allows us to show all the women\u0026rsquos national team home matches which have proven to be an exciting entity.  \u0026ldquoThe record crowd of 4,098 at The Simple Digital Arena in Paisley proves the appetite is there to watch the women\u0026rsquos national team and this deal enables the nation to watch our games, when they can\u0026rsquot make it along to the stadium.\""},{"url":null,"title":"snp-calls-on-david-mundell-to-take-no-deal-brexit-scenario-off-the-table","story":"  Today, the Scottish Secretary is due to appear before Holyrood\u0026rsquos Finance and Constitution Committee to give evidence on the EU Withdrawal Act, which the Nationalists believe is a \u0026ldquopower-grab, a contention the UK Government strongly denies.  The issue of a no-deal was raised at Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Questions in the Commons when Jeremy Corbyn seized on remarks by Dominic Raab, who had suggested there were \u0026ldquocountervailing opportunities should no agreement be reached.  After the Labour leader asked Theresa May what these were, the PM replied: \u0026ldquoThis Government is working to ensure that, whatever the outcome of the negotiations, this country makes a success of coming out of the European Union and that we see a global Britain and a brighter future for people here in this country.  Ahead of Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos appearance at Holyrood, the SNP\u0026rsquos Willie Coffey MSP declared: \u0026ldquoThe Tories think they can do what they want to Scotland and get away with it trashing thousands of jobs and costing every person in Scotland the equivalent of \u0026pound2,300 each if we crash out of the EU without a deal.  \u0026ldquoDisgracefully, there are some extreme voices on the right wing of the Tory Party, who are recklessly talking up this possibility. The Tories are already desperate to drag Scotland out of the EU against our will and they now want the worst possible outcome.  \u0026ldquoWith the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Chequers Plan looking dead as a dodo, David Mundell must now rule out a no-deal disaster altogether and back staying in the single market and customs union.  \u0026ldquoHe has a great opportunity to make clear a no-deal outcome is off the table and that he will finally put Scotland\u0026rsquos national interest before internal party division and back membership of the single market and customs union.  The Secretary of State, who has insisted there is no credible alternative to the Chequers Plan, over summer said a no-deal was preferable to a Brexit deal that \u0026ldquothreatens the integrity of the United Kingdom such as the one put forward by the EU on Northern Ireland, which would see a border down the Irish Sea."},{"url":null,"title":"moscow-accuses-uk-of-manipulating-information-after-salisbury-suspects-named-as-russian-spies","story":"  Police and prosecutors said they now had enough evidence to charge Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov.  In a hushed Commons chamber, the Prime Minister told MPs investigations had concluded the two men suspected of the \u0026ldquobarbaric attack in March were members of the GRU, Russia\u0027s military intelligence service.  \"It was almost certainly also approved outside the GRU at a senior level of the Russian state,\" she declared.  While Mrs May did not explicitly blame the Kremlin for authorising the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal, 67, a former GRU agent, and his daughter Yulia, Tory backbencher Tom Tugendhat said there was \"no doubt it was state ordered and President Putin bears responsibility for a war-like act\".  His Conservative colleague, Dominic Grieve, the former Attorney General, said Britain had become the \u0026ldquovictim of state terrorism by a state, that is run as a gangster organisation.  But Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for Russia\u0026rsquos Foreign Ministry, hit back, claiming the names and photographs of the two suspects \u0026ldquorevealed nothing.  She added: \u0026ldquoOnce again, we ask the British to move from public accusations and manipulating information to practical co-operation via the law enforcement agencies.  In her Commons statement, the PM went through the itinerary of Petrov and Boshirov in the run-up to and in the aftermath of the Salisbury attack, all of which was caught on CCTV cameras.  There was a clear intake of breath in the chamber when she mentioned that traces of the nerve agent Novichok were found in the London hotel room used by the two suspects.  Mrs May told MPs that prosecutors deemed it futile to apply to Moscow for the extradition of the two men as Russia did not allow its citizens to be tried abroad.  But she noted: \u0026ldquoShould either of these individuals ever again travel outside Russia, we will take every possible step to detain them, to extradite them and to bring them to face justice here in the United Kingdom.  A European Arrest Warrant has been obtained and the UK authorities are also seeking the assistance of Interpol.  Ahead of her Commons statement, Mrs May telephoned US President Donald Trump and afterwards spoke to Justin Trudeau, the Canadian premier.

It comes as independent forecasters revealed income tax raised \u0026pound550 million less than expected last year, with opposition figures urging the SNP to rethink its \u0026ldquohigh-tax agenda.  Meanwhile, Finance Secretary Derek Mackay announced a consultation on plans to create a Scottish National Investment Bank to boost the economy by investing in businesses that would otherwise struggle.  A new report by the David Hume Institute said there had been \"no progress\" towards a target set by ministers in 2007 to improve Scotland\u0027s productivity rankings to take it into the top-performing 25% of nations in the OECD.  It raised concerns over a lack of employment growth in Scotland\u0026rsquos most productive industries, as well as low business investment and a shrinking working-age population.  Arguing there has been little productivity growth over the last 15 years, it also pointed to slipping standards in schools and underlined the importance of \"first-rate education and training\".  It warned there are \"no quick policy fixes to Scotland\u0027s productivity challenge\".  Researchers said nations which had successfully boosted this key part of economic performance had done so only after a \"concerted effort to get their act together\".  Scottish Labour\u0027s economy spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said the findings laid bare \u0026ldquothe scale of the SNP\u0026rsquos mismanagement of our economy.  The Wealth of the Nation report \u0026ndash produced with support from the Scottish Policy Foundation, which counts former SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson among its advisers \u0026ndash said Scotland is being outperformed by at least half of the OECD.  It also said that while the UK as a whole was \"at the centre of a so-called \u0027productivity puzzle\u0027\" which had seen growth slump to \"virtually zero\", the slowdown had started earlier in Scotland.  It said: \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos productivity over the past fifteen years has remained broadly stagnant and has underperformed compared with many other European countries.  \u0026ldquoWhile Scotland is more productive than most other regions of the UK, this comparison is limited as the UK as a whole has lower productivity than many other advanced economies.  Among UK regions, Scotland is behind only London and the South East for productivity.  Jane-Frances Kelly, director of the David Hume Institute, insisted \u0026ldquopoliticians and policymakers need to get their act together and make choices guided by evidence.  She added: \u0026ldquoFailing to do this will put the Scottish economy at risk.  It comes as the independent Scottish Fiscal Commission said income tax receipts in Scotland were \u0026pound550 million lower than forecast in 2016/17.  The shortfall was largely down to officials overestimating how many people would pay the highest tax rates, it said.  More than a million Scots pay higher income tax than those earning the same elsewhere in the UK under changes ushered through earlier this year.  Scottish Tory shadow finance secretary Murdo Fraser said the analysis shows \u0026ldquothere are considerably fewer earners on higher and additional rates than the SNP government thought when it was plotting its tax hike.  He added: \u0026ldquoThat means future tax receipts could be badly out, and that will have an impact on the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos ability to pay for hospitals schools and infrastructure.\"  A Scottish Government spokesman stressed the shortfall would have \u0026ldquoabsolutely no impact on the Scottish budget or planned spending.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Fiscal Commission forecast the 2016-17 figure based on HMRC survey evidence of the number of Scottish taxpayers.  \u0026ldquoIt was always to be expected that this forecast would differ from outturn data and is why the Scottish budget is protected from any such change.  SNP public finance minister Kate Forbes argued Scotland\u0026rsquos economy is \u0026ldquofundamentally strong, but said the Government will consider the points raised in the David Hume report.  She said: \u0026ldquoOver the last decade, productivity in Scotland has grown at more than three times the rate it has across the UK as a whole, and our productivity growth has been higher than any other country or region of the UK, including London, with productivity increasing by 1.7% in the first quarter of this year.\"  Outlining her legislative programme earlier this week, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said a Scottish National Investment Bank would be established by 2020.  The Government has committed to providing \u0026pound2 billion over 10 years to fund the publicly-owned bank, which will operate on a commercial basis.  It is thought it will require between 100 and 150 staff, with its annual operation costs pegged at between \u0026pound20 million and \u0026pound30 million."},{"url":null,"title":"children s panel seeks new members","story":"        Young people in Aberdeenshire are being urged to volunteer for the Children\u0026#8217s Panel and help change the lives of thousands of children and young people in Scotland.                Launched across Scotland, the “Force for Good” campaign by Children’s Hearings Scotland , which is responsible for recruiting volunteers to join Scotland’s unique Children’s Panel, aims to encourage more women, men and particularly those aged between 18 and 25 to become Panel Members.                                                    Scotland’s Children’s Panel is made up of 2,500 volunteer Panel Members who give their time to ensure the safety and wellbeing of vulnerable children and young people who may be at risk.                                                    Completely dependent on the time and commitment of these volunteers, CHS is looking to recruit over 500 new Panel Members from all ages, backgrounds and locations across Scotland with a particular focus on attracting more men and young people.        CHS will host an information event at the SCRA offices in Fraserburgh on Tuesday, September 11, at 7pm. The offices can be found at 10 Commerce Street.A second event will be held on Thursday, September 13 at 6pm in Woodhill House, Aberdeen.Boyd McAdam, National Convener of Children’s Hearings Scotland, said: “Children and young people attending hearings have told us that they want to see more diversity among Panel Members. In particular, they’re keen to see more young people to whom they can potentially relate when decisions are being made about their lives.“To ensure we are doing the very best for those who experience the hearings system, we feel it is important to recruit as many young people as possible to volunteer as Panel Members. In addition, this year we are also looking to recruit more men to the Panel and have a national target of around 200.”                                                                                                        Between April 2017 and March 2018, 32,553 children’s hearings took place supporting 14,076 vulnerable children and young people across Scotland at risk of neglect, abuse or who may be involved in the care system.Whilst children and young people can be referred to the Children’s Reporter for a range of different reasons, recently released statistics show that between April 2017 and March 2018, 85% of the cases referred were on the grounds of care and protection. This is the most common ground for referral for children under the age of one.Boyd added: “Panel Members are required to deal with a range of different cases in children’s hearings. These can often be very complex. We are looking for a diverse range of people who can engage with children and young people, make important and difficult decisions and importantly who can ensure that the rights of the child or young person in each hearing are respected.”The new CHS campaign will run for five weeks until the end of September.

They are a force for good and their role is vital.”The Children’s Panel is a system unique to Scotland and last year saw around 1,500 people apply to become members. There are currently 3,000 volunteers across Scotland dedicating around 360,000 hours each year to the Children’s Hearings system.

include universities, higher education colleges and full-time employment.The breakdown of positive destinations showed that54.4 per cent of pupils going on to higher and further Edu-cation in 2014/15

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Thursday 6 Sep 2018 11:51 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the individual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash if it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him returning to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Asleifarson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being knifed in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Thursday 6 Sep 2018 11:51 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

Brian, who was awarded a British Empire Medal in June this year in recognition of his services to military history in Orkney said: “Many people have dedicated time and energy to gathering photos over a period of 20 years or more and would like to see the collection completed as far as possible for the centenary of the Armistice on 11 November this year.“Having a nearly complete set of images of all the Orcadians lost would be a most poignant way for our community to mark this anniversary and a wonderful resource for future generations.”It’s believed 578 Orcadians died serving in the Great War and the Legion’s collection, available to view on their website, contains photos of just over half — 297 — of those lost.The council’s call comes as part of Orkney’s First World War commemoration programme, which is being coordinated by the council with invaluable contributions and support from local organisations community groups and individuals.As part of a series of events, on November 11, Orkney will participate in a national commemorative event that involves as many photos of local lives lost in the war as can be found and the participation of their families, a further reason for trying to complete the collection.Lucy Gibbon from the council’s Library and Archive service said there may well be much sought-after photos in people’s attics and family memorabilia collections: “Whilst very few people had a camera during the Great War, nearly all towns had photo studios. Most servicemen visited one of these while training in the UK.”“If you know you lost an Orcadian relative in the war, now is a great time to find out more about them. The Orkney Library \u0026amp Archive might have some items to help shed light on their story.”The Legion’s photo archive has been made possible thanks to the generosity and hard work of many — for example around half of the photos have been sourced from The Orcadian, which has published photos sent in by families in a feature called Our Roll of Honour during the Great War.Other notable contributors and donators over the years include Tom Gibson of Rousay, Beatrice Thomson of North Ronaldsay, Mabel Eunson of Deerness and the late Margaret Watters of Stenness, Bill Miller of Stronsay, Phyllis Gee of Flotta, and George Esson who spent two decades visiting families in South Ronaldsay and Burray seeking photos of loved ones lost in the war, and with the help of and David Mackie and Colin Rendall made copies for the Orkney Library and Archive.These and many more contributors are noted on the project’s website — where people can also view images in the collection by Parish and by significant battles.Anyone with photos they believe are not already included in the Legion’s collection is urged to contact Brian Budge on phone 01856 872225 and email brian.budge@btinternet or to drop into the Orkney Library and Archive in Kirkwall.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will briefly divert cars onto the adjacent railway track and back again at set windows during the day when trains are not passing by.But motorists who miss one of the windows could face waits of up to two-and-a-half hours for the next one.And this has prompted Highland Council to urge drivers to make sure they plan their journey and allow enough travel time so they are not caught out.A council spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoWe have worked closely with Network Rail and our contractor TRAC Engineering Ltd to keep disruption to road users to a minimum when the road\u0026ldquoBut inevitably there will be times when road users will face longer waits \u0026ndash so we urge people to plan their travel carefully and avoid the periods when the diversion is not going to be available.During the works the road will be closed overnight to all traffic between the two gates between 10pm and 7am.Traffic control measures will operate between 7am and 10pm while the road-to-rail bypass is installed. This could take up to two weeks, but may be finished sooner.Once the temporary bypass is installed, the timetable of opening slots between trains will take effect.Cards showing details of the timetable that will be operating for the road to rail diversion have been distributed among local communities.Copies are also available at the Highland Council website by searching for Stromeferry Bypass at www.highland.gov.ukThe road-to-rail bypass will be available for use between 7am and 10pm, but only by traffic weighing less than seven-and-a-half tonnes .Traffic above those limits will have to divert along the A87, A82, A832 and A890.The council believes the restrictions and roadworks will be finished by November 24, when the A890 will fully reopen.Thursday 6 Sep 2018 11:52 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

He can now use Microsoft Outlook and completed his new CV on Microsoft Word and been applying online for jobs.Alan said: \"I\u0027ve attended workshops on confidence building, and digital skills.\"My confidence is improving a lot and so is my computer skills, I have been job searching online and sending emails, I couldn\u0027t do this before.\"* To find out more and check eligibility for the service visit www.mygov.scot/fairstartThursday 6 Sep 2018 11:52 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The campaign was highlighted earlier this year by the Ross-shire Journal when riders revealed their concerns.After meeting campaigners near Cullicudden, Miss Forbes said: \u0026ldquoIn a rural place like the Black Isle it\u0026rsquos not surprising to see horse riders. Despite that, I was really disappointed to hear that drivers usually drive too close and too fast when passing a horse. There is evidently a lot of work to do in educating drivers about overtaking horses and the serious dangers of scaring horses.\u0026ldquoSadly, horse riders told me that they believe the roads are increasingly dangerous for horse riding, despite horse riders having equal access to the road. I support these horse riders on the Black Isle who want to raise awareness of how to overtake horses and ensure that riders don\u0026rsquot fear for their safety when riding in a rural place like the Black Isle.Since 2010, there have been almost 150 incidents on Scottish roads involving both motorists and horse riders \u0026ndash including two rider fatalities and 50 serious injuries.One local rider earlier told the Ross-shire Journal how she had taken to wearing head-mounted cameras in a bid to protect herself and others. Concern over an increasing number of near misses and alarming incidents has prompted calls to the police to intervene.Nel MacDonald-Rolfe, one of the riders, said: \u0026ldquoRural roads are to be treated with respect even by the locals who become complacent and take chances. You never know what is round the corner nor what can suddenly appear from the side of the roads.\u0026ldquoRural roads are there to be used by all, which includes cycles, walkers and horse riders. Patience and respect for all users and educating is the key. As they say, speed kills.The appeal to drivers to rein in their speed and to be aware of other road users followed near-misses on the B9169 Cullicudden straight. Police say they recognise the vulnerability of horses on roads and encourage motorists and riders to show mutual respect for each other.They say all road users should be able to travel safely and drivers should give horses as much room as possible when passing. They want road users to read the Highway Code for guidance.- Email us at newdesk@spp-groupThursday 6 Sep 2018 11:53 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

That echoes public concerns which prompted a rethink from Highland Council four years ago.Tarbat Community Council is amongst the latest groups backing Craighill, stating that the TRA site \u0026ldquoshould not feature even as a second choice. It has outlined concerns over the lack of space for future expansion, inadequate room to play and the prospect of \u0026ldquotall and ugly buildings more appropriate to terminals at a second-rate airport.It says that \u0026ldquohuge cost advantages could come from using modular building techniques.The new campus will replace Tain Royal Academy, Craighill Primary, Knockbreck and the St Duthus special school. Parent councils have consistently appealed for improved facilities with the existing Craighill building the lowest scoring in the Highlands for educational suitability and condition.Wendy Hennem, of Tain Royal Academy Parent Council, noted that the Craighill site appeared to be the preferred public choice and that the resounding response from young people is: \u0026ldquoJust get it done.Tain and Easter Ross ward councillor Fiona Robertson told the Journal: \u0026ldquoAs we haven\u0026rsquot reached the deadline yet, I am not privy to the results of the consultation. However, I believe from my work with the stakeholder group and from being amongst the communities, that the Craighill site may be the most popular option. This has always been my preferred option as I believe it is much more suitable for a development of the size of a three to 18 campus.\u0026ldquoWhatever the results, it is important that the community works with Highland Council in order to deliver much-needed new schools for Tain. The extremely poor conditions of our primary and secondary schools in Tain is well known and acknowledged by Highland Council, therefore we all need to work hard to prepare an agreed plan in order to be in a position to apply for government funding later in the year.\u0026ldquoI believe the majority of people in Tain and Easter Ross just want to ensure we get fit for purpose schools in Tain to ensure the best possible educational facilities for our children\u0026rsquos futures.Fellow ward councillor Derek Loudon said: \u0026ldquoStudies by the community council, the Highland Council and the Ross-shire Journal have shown a clear preference for Craighill. There is little public support for the TRA site as all three consultations have shown. I hope we can move on now to get a layout on the Craighill site which is along the lines of the study done by Lachie Stewart [chairman of Tain and Easter Ross Civic Trust] and the community council which takes advantage of the space available to deliver great new buildings for primary, secondary, St Duthus, Gaelic and sports and leisure.\u0026ldquoI believe significant savings on cost, quality and time can be made with new construction techniques which are proven and have worked elsewhere. Let\u0026rsquos work with the Scottish Government and the Scottish Future\u0026rsquos Trust to deliver a great result for the people of Easter Ross.The consultation can be accessed at https:www.highland.gov.uk/downloads/file/19305/proposal_paper_tain_final_240518What do you think?

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had a chance to stop the sense of Scottish Government drift in the new Programme for Government, but she blew it, writes Tom Peterkin.                Can a ruling party in Scotland ever have suffered a more anguished summer recess than the one recently endured by the SNP? That – by the way – is a rhetorical question because the answer is a blindingly obvious and resounding “no”.            Of course, the allegations of sexual harassment made against Alex Salmond were responsible for much of that anguish. As was his colossally insensitive “crowd-funding” appeal to fund the legal action he is taking against the Scottish Government.            In contrast to Mr Salmond, Nicola Sturgeon has reacted to this most unfortunate turn of events with a great deal of dignity and professionalism. But that cannot mask the challenges she faces to hold her party together amid talk of SNP splits as Ms Sturgeon is pitted against her predecessor and mentor.Despite his bullish response to the allegations against him and his work for a Kremlin-sponsored broadcaster, Mr Salmond still seems to hold considerable sway within the party. But there is also a big wide world beyond the internal difficulties of the SNP and the personal troubles of Mr Salmond. This is the real world where most people live and it is where the First Minister and her team face a whole host of other problems which require urgent attention.These were apparent during the recess before all political controversies were drowned out by the revelation that two women had made complaints against Mr Salmond. Before the allegations against Salmond broke, education was the dominant theme of the recess with John Swinney under fire over controversial national tests for primary one pupils.            READ MORE: Nicola Sturgeon’s Programme for Government – everything you need to knowAnd thrown into that unhappy mix was the controversy over the 700 teaching posts unfilled before the start of term, a decline in pupils taking foreign languages and a narrowing subject choice under Curriculum for Excellence. No wonder that a picture is being painted of low morale in the classroom, a state of affairs that was graphically illustrated when Mr Swinney was accosted by angry teachers on the radio.A litany of complaints were directed at the Deputy First Minister and Education Secretary including workload, low pay and shortages of specialists to deal with children with learning difficulties. With parliament back from its summer break this week, these concerns are being reprised with EIS General Secretary Larry Flanagan warning that it would take decades to change the culture of Scottish education.            But Ms Sturgeon’s challenges are not confined to education.When faced with an NHS plagued by bed-blocking, missed waiting targets and doctor shortages, Ms Sturgeon does not have her troubles to seek when it comes to Scotland’s public services.This week, the First Minister was preparing to announce her legislative programme for the next 12 months when the above point was made via a Scottish Government survey, illustrating rising dissatisfaction with public services. Therefore it would have reasonable to expect the First Minister to come out fighting on the return to parliament with a legislative programme to get her administration back on to the front foot.The need to seize the initiative is further underlined when it comes to the economy.             READ MORE: Brexit will mean Scottish independence vote, say SNP MPsToday a report by the much-respected David Hume Institute warns that Scottish productivity has all but stalled for the last 15 years and immediate action is required to turn things about.But when the country needing a Government on the front foot, Ms Sturgeon and her ministers spent the summer devising a back-foot Programme for Government. Consisting of a dozen bills, there were aspects that were commendable – notably the commitment to put mental health counsellors in schools and the announcement to bring forward benefit payments to low-income mothers. But there was precious little else and certainly nothing to drive the sort of radical reform required to sort out Scotland’s public services.In fact much of the discussion when Ms Sturgeon unveiled her proposals at Holyrood on Tuesday was the previous year’s Programme for Government. At the heart of last year’s Programme was Mr Swinney’s much vaunted Education Bill.That was the legislation which was supposed to be the “centrepiece” of Ms Sturgeon’s 2017 plan, offering the “biggest and most radical” change to how schools are run in the lifetime of devolution. It was to be the vehicle to deliver more powers to headteachers – the key to Mr Swinney’s reforms. Since then – as Tory leader Ruth Davidson was only too keen to point out – the Bill has been shelved. Mr Swinney has argued that the changes can be better delivered without legislation, but his climbdown has contributed to the impression of a drifting government.  Tuesday’s programme was an opportunity to arrest that sense of drift. Alas it was a missed opportunity.As the controversies over Alex Salmond linger prominently, one seasoned observer in the Holyrood canteen remarked that there was nothing in the legislative programme to grip the politcal narrative over the coming months. Unless the narrative is to be one of a Scottish Government that has run out of steam."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4795825.1536228827!/image/image.jpg","title":"fmqs live first minister s questions returns after summer recess","story":"        First Minister\u0026#8217s Questions returns today following summer recess at the Scottish Parliament.

Scottish productivity has all but stalled in the past 15 years and the health of the economy is at risk unless more consensus is built between government, business and unions.                The verdict on Scotland’s economy has been delivered in a report by the David Hume Institute, which says a turnaround is required if living standards are to improve.             The report says Scotland is outperformed on productivity by many other advanced economies.             Scotland sits mid-table for productivity among OECD countries, and falls below other European economies such as the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany, and Spain.The report’s authors say that if Scotland wanted to move to the top quarter of the table, it would need to become roughly as productive as Denmark.But in 2014, Scotland’s productivity was 20 per cent lower than the Scandinavian country.The report said there had been “no progress” towards a target set by ministers in 2007 to improve Scotland’s productivity rankings to take it into the top-performing 25 per cent of nations in the OECD.The think tank also warned there are “no quick policy fixes to Scotland’s productivity challenge” – saying nations which had successfully boosted this key part of economic performance had done so after a “concerted effort to get their act together”.            The Wealth of the Nation report – produced with support from the Scottish Policy Foundation – said Scotland is being outperformed by at least half of the OECD.Although Scottish Government capital spending has been above the UK average, the report added it still “lagged considerably behind other developed countries” – with government investment in Scotland as a proportion of overall GDP roughly less than half of other OECD nations in 2015.Institute director Jane-Frances Kelly said there needed to be a “turnaround” saying: “We are not the first country to face this challenge but – as our research shows – politicians and policymakers need to get their act together and make choices guided by evidence. Failing to do this will put the Scottish economy at risk.“Our research has looked at London, Manchester, Sweden, Australia and Ireland – and in every case we found that a ruthless focus on evidence, building consensus across the political divide and creating strong institutions were crucial to turn things around.”            While she said attempts at short-term fixes would “only result in this problem being kicked down the road, at the expense of jobs and growth”, Ms Kelly stressed there was “much we can achieve if politicians, policymakers and businesses really turn their minds to it”.Scotland has had higher spending on economic development since the Scottish Parliament was created in 1999, the report said, with the budget for it in 2016-17 at just over £1 billion.The think-tank added: “Despite these intentions to boost productivity, no progress has been made on the 2007 target, with Scotland still far away from the top quarter of the most-productive OECD economies.”It described economic productivity in Scotland as being “only middling when compared with other OECD economies”, adding that “despite sustained attempts by successive Scottish governments to raise productivity, there has been little productivity growth in Scotland over the last 15 years”.The report suggested a number of factors for this, citing low economic growth, low business investment and low spending in research and development.            Tory economy spokesman Dean Lockhart said the study was “a vital and timely contribution to the single biggest challenge facing Scotland’s economy – how to get higher wages and create more jobs by making our economy work better”.Public finance minister Kate Forbes said: “Over the last decade, productivity in Scotland has grown at more than three times the rate it has across the UK as a whole and our productivity growth has been higher than any other country or region of the UK, including London, with productivity increasing by 1.7 per cent in the first quarter of this year.“Scotland’s economy is fundamentally strong but we are determined to strengthen it further and will consider the points raised in this report.”She added that  Brexit was the single biggest threat to Scotland’s economy."},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.  Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself ?  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture.

And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"spurs lose tight highland amateur cup final ","story":"Lerwick Spurs have narrowly lost the Highland Amateur Cup final after taking the tie to extra-time with a late equaliser.\nThe isles side had gone a goal down to Pentland United \u0026#8211 the competition\u0026#8217s most successful team \u0026#8211 in the 18th minute.\nPentland looked set to secure their eight Highland Amateur Cup trophy until a stoppage time equaliser from Spurs brought the game to extra-time.\nThe Lerwick side found themselves 2-1 down in the 6th minute of extra-time and were unfortunately unable to bag an equaliser.\nSpurs won five games on their way to the final including a quarter-final success against 2017 champions Avoch.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"fagradal lower voe ","story":"Offers over £205,000\n\nThe property is conveniently situated for Brae \u0026amp Sullom Voe, yet Lerwick  is still within easy commuting distance.

One of the main benefits of participating is to achieve Best Value in services delivered locally. The Partnership provides an invaluable forum where the partners can co-operate and get this assurance.\nReducing energy costs is just one way to tackle fuel poverty. The insulation and boiler scrappage schemes that local partners have lobbied for, and secured, have also had a positive impact.\nFuel poverty is measured as a percentage of household income so increasing wages can also help. We already have a number of Living Wage employers in Shetland from public agencies to small businesses.\nNobody has said that the named organisations are expected to create 800 jobs. While it would be good to fill vacancies in health and social care, my expectation is that most of these jobs would be in the private sector.\nChanging legislation or mitigating its effects is difficult but it\u0026#8217s been done it before think everything from the ZCC Act through the \u0026#8220Bedroom Tax\u0026#8221 to the Islands Act and the forthcoming National Islands Plan.\nI don\u0026#8217t accept that there\u0026#8217s nothing that can be done locally to have a positive impact.\nGary, do you honestly expect that everything on the \u0026#8216wish list\u0026#8217 will be achieved?

Islands proofing really worked with Sumburgh Airport car parking charges, didn\u0026#8217t it?\nLet’s not forget though that one partner organisation currently does have considerable funds that are at arms length from government and do could do heaps to further progress towards these goals. Shetland Charitable Trust might yet choose to play a full part in community planning, shake up its thinking and really engage with the community it is meant to serve.\nAlternatively it could be about to lock up its  spare charitable cash in a speculative gamble based on massive wind turbines which don’t have public support and haven’t actually been shown to be able to withstand Shetland’s high winds.

Cairngorms Business Partnership chief executive Mark Tate said the global exposure provided by such big-budget movies is a huge boost for the local economy.\nThe film itself tells the untold, true story of 14th Century Robert the Bruce who transforms from defeated nobleman to outlaw hero during the oppressive occupation of medieval Scotland by Edward I of England.\nDespite grave consequences, Robert seizes the Scottish crown and rallies an impassioned group of men to fight back against the mighty army of the king and his volatile son, the prince of Wales.\nAlso starring are Scottish actors James Cosmo, Tony Curran, Steven Cree, Chris Fulton and Alistair Mackenzie.\nAnother big-budget movie, Mary Queen of Scots, was also being shot in the strath at the same time.\nThe film, starring Saoirse Ronan, Margot Robbie and David Tennant, is scheduled to be released at the end of this year.\nThursday 6 Sep 2018 11:53 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117299.jpg","title":"Conservation hub set for expansion","story":"Iain Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nTHERE was a disappointing response to a recent six-week public consultation to gauge local thinking about a proposed extension of Grantown\u0027s conservation area.\nLess than one per cent of residents offered an opinion. Proposed change will bring a greater number of properties into the protected area and, therefore, under stricter planning controls.\nHowever, Andrew Puls, Highland Council\u0027s principal officer for building conservation and environment, told local councillors meeting in Grantown that from 732 local homes, and after a consultation event attended by 50 people, there were only 12 responses. Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval. If adopted, all properties within the conservation area will be notified by letter.\nThursday 6 Sep 2018 11:53 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117295.jpg","title":"Lack of 999 cover for busy Harley weekend","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nAVIEMORE was covered by only a single-manned ambulance for most of the Harley Davidson Thunder in the Glens rally, it has emerged.\nIt means that a casualty could be attended to but not taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness in the event of an emergency until a second ambulance crew had arrived at the scene.\nIt is understood the village only had an ambulance with single crew rather than double crew available last Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday until 5pm.\nThere were an estimated 3000 motorcyclists in the area for the UK\u0027s biggest Harley rally.\nGMB Scotland also said Kingussie only had a single manned crew in operation from just after midnight on Thursday until Sunday morning.\nThe union said the situation is simply not acceptable and poses a real danger.\nAlong with the Strathy, the GMB has been calling for the Scottish Ambulance Service to get rid of the current on-call system and to replace it with 24/7 shifts to bring the Aviemore base into line with most other stations in Scotland.\nJohn Marr, GMB branch secretary, said: \"Only a first responder service would have been able to be provided by an ambulance with single crew.\n\"This would have involved looking after the casualty at the location until back up arrived.\n\"We think it is dangerous and we are stepping up our calls on the government to provide the Scottish Ambulance Service with the funds required to give Badenoch and Strathspey the service the area deserves.\n\"At the moment we are going round in circles asking why there is no 24/7 cover despite Aviemore being one of the busiest tourism spots in the whole of Scotland.\n\"We have repeatedly informed the Scottish Ambulance Service that this is a dangerous situation but nothing is happening.\"\nHighland Council convener and local councillor Bill Lobban, said: \"The current level of ambulance cover is clearly completely unacceptable.\n\"Given our population added to the huge number of visitors we see on a daily basis the Scottish Ambulance Service needs to make sure we have sufficient staff on duty to provide a safe and effective service.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

The document reiterates Sinn Féin’s aim toabolish student contribution fees for apprentices and details how the partywill promote apprenticeship programmes as another tertiary education choice.\n Apprenticeshipis a tried and proven way for employers to develop highly skilled workers fortheir company and industry by using a mixture of coursework and practical onthe job learning.

We want to build on the success of the traditionalcraft trades in Ireland such as plumbing, bricklaying and plastering, andexpand this way of learning, into a host of new fields.\n“Apprenticeships in fields such as green energy, retail, hospitality andfinancial services are hugely popular in other European countries. We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018. In addition, the physically demanding nature of the current availableapprenticeships has resulted in just 1.7% of total apprentices in 2016 beingpeople with disabilities.\n\nSinnFéin aims to increase investment in apprenticeships to over €350 million perannum within five years. \nTheLimerick City TD, Deputy Quinlivan has said that this will “fund the treblingof the number apprenticeship programmes and provide places for 60,000apprentices”.\nDeputy Quinlivan continued: “€5,166,000 of investment will be required overfive years for the development of 63 new apprenticeship programmes, bringingthe total number of craft and new courses to 100.\n“Ireland’sallocation from the EU for training and education of the young is €68 million.Fine Gael was forced to return €19.8 million of this allocation in 2016, asthey failed to submit a payment application.\n“SinnFéin will ensure all EU monies allocated to Ireland would be fully utilised, tobenefit the education and training of our young people.

They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27466  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\n“The policy of this government is failing the homeless, failing those renting and those who strive to own a home.

It will be decision time.  It will be decision time for the government and for Fianna Fáil” she said.\nThe Dáil is due to resume back later this month.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27468  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nThe proposal to retain the right of representation in the European Parliament for Irish citizens resident in the north is an attempt to hold the State to the values its constitution proclaims.  - independent legal report\nThe Irish government should create a new constituency and allocated its two additional European Parliament seats to the north to ensure the democratic rights of all Irish citizens are upheld, a newly published independent legal opinion has said. \nThe report, which was launched today by Sinn Féin MEP Martina Anderson was commissioned by the GUE/NGL group in the European Parliament and authored by barrister Mark Bassett. \nIt finds that continued representation in the European Parliament for Irish citizens in the north is legally and constitutionally possible and only requires the political will of the Irish government to make it happen. \nThe report was launched following Sinn Féin\u0027s strategy and planning days held in Cavan earlier this week. \nIn the legal opinion, barrister Mark Bassett writes that allocating the two additional seats the 26 Counties will receive post Brexit to the north is in line with the Irish constitution. \n\"The proposal to retain the right of representation in the European Parliament for Irish citizens resident in the north is an attempt to hold the State to the values its constitution proclaims,\" the report states. \nIt also says that to allow the denial of rights to Irish citizens would go against the fundamental views of the state. \n\"It is surely anathema to any form of republican democracy to leave fellow citizens without a voice in the decisions that affect them,\" it said. \n\nLaunching the report today, Sinn Féin MEP Martina Anderson said retaining a voice in the European Parliament is vital to the people of the north who will be worst hit by the Tory Brexit. \n\"Today we launched an independent legal opinion that demonstrates beyond a shadow of a doubt that this is both legally possible and permissible. The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit. The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government. This is the first real test of those words. There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise. So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north. Brexit threatens many hard-won rights and protections that we in Sinn Féin will continue to fight to uphold. If the Irish government is serious about joining us in this fight, then they can allocate these two new seats to the north,\" she said. \n\n\ntest\n\n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8623270.1536048798!/image/image.jpg","title":"festival

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread if AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my wife and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gifted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying:

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

We have come close in the past, making it to the quarter-finals and the semi-finals, so to go one better this season is a great feeling.\n\u0026#8220There is a real buzz and a belief in the team that we can go and win the Irish Cup in our first final.\n\u0026#8220We have gone up against teams from all over the Province this season to get to the final.\n\u0026#8220We didn\u0027t know too much about any of them, they were all an unknown quantity, but we played to our strengths and we have been rewarded.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

The Ballymoney man lost his father, Mervyn Robinson, to the\u0026#160 North West 200 in 1980, while in July his cousin, William Dunlop, was killed during free practice at the Skerries 100 near Dublin.\nAll of these setbacks forced a re-think, says Robinson.

After the Act of Remembrance, Bro Ward laid a wreath at the Herron family memorial plaque which was unveiled on the boundary wall of Dromore Orange Hall in April 2016 and is the only tangible memorial in Dromore to the history of the Troubles.  \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nTown draper, William Herron , his wife Elizabeth  and daughter Noeline  died in the blaze after an incendiary device was planted in their Market Square drapery store in April 1976. The fire destroyed much of the shop and the family home above it, where the three victims died from suffocation. Bro William Herron was a member of Closkelt LOL 415 in Rathfriland District LOL No 3.\n\n* A series of commemorative events also took place across Northern Ireland last weekend as the Institution marked its inaugural Orange Victims Day. The Loyal Order formally remember the 335 Orangemen and one Orangewoman murdered by terrorists during the Troubles. The day, which will become an annual event, also highlighted the ongoing plight of the injured and bereaved.\n\n\n   \n                 .

Alliance’s Emmett McDonough-Brown signed the Homes Now pledge.\nHomes Now campaigner Bernie Dobbin said: “The people of the Markets have waited too long for adequate social housing to be built in the area and we are no longer prepared to take verbal assurances from officials and politicians.\n“Time and again, these officials and politicians have broken their word and left residents high and dry. This is why we are asking councillors and officials to sign the Homes Now pledge – for their commitment to become a matter of public record.\n“Belfast City Council have sent out a lot of positive messages since the disgraceful decision of their Planning Committee last September, but still not a brick for new housing has been laid. Meanwhile, families are forced to stay indefinitely in emergency accommodation, share with relatives and ‘sofa surf’ – this cannot continue.\n“Like communities across Belfast and throughout Ireland, we are demanding that those in power recognise the nature of the housing crisis and act accordingly. It’s time to build homes, not carparks.”  \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"movie about british olympic figure skating gold medallists filmed in west belfast school","story":"\n\nTHE\n corridors and classrooms of St Mary’s Christian Brothers’ Grammar School have been transformed from present day to recapture the excitement and adrenalin of 1984 Sarajevo during the winter Olympics for an upcoming Torvill and Dean movie.\nThe film will chart the early years of the British figure skating duo Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean and their journey to achieving Winter Olympic gold with their iconic Bolero.\nThe film, commissioned by ITV and supported by NI Screen has been filming in the Glen Road school while students were off on summer holidays as well as using the Shankill Leisure Centre as the filming schedule continues.\nSchool Principal John Martin said he was very impressed with the attention to detail the film crew put in to recreating the particular period of history.\n“The crew work so quickly to recreate the time and place,” he said. “We have had some of the corridors repainted, signage put up and some of our music rooms have been transformed to look like the Olympic Village were the skaters stayed – complete with itineraries on the walls and training timetables.\n“We are delighted that St Mary’s was chosen for the film project and look forward to seeing the school on the big screen.”\nFilming is continuing on the film with a release date expected in the autumn.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"well not be derailed by latest mod stunt","story":"\n\nTHE\n Ballymurphy Massacre families have said that the latest ‘stunt’ by the British Ministry of Defence will not derail their much anticipated inquest into the murder of there loved ones.\n\nA preliminary inquest into the atrocity takes place at 2pm today  at Belfast’s High Court.\nLast week the MoD handed over a database containing almost 5,000 names of former soldiers to the Coroner’s Office.\n\nThe spreadsheet contains 1,366 names from the Parachute Regiment, 1,542 names from the Queen’s Regiment and eight names from the Queen’s Division. A further 1,492 names appear to be duplicates, meaning ‘when an individual has multiple regiments, or units on their Record of Service. \n\nThe Coroner’s Office had been attempting to trace former soldiers who may have  been in Ballymurphy during the three days in August 1971 when ten people were shot dead and one died of a heart attack.\nHowever, just days before the inquest was due to begin into the killings 47-year-ago the database containing nearly 5,000 names landed on the Coroner’s desk.\n\nSpeaking to the Andersonstown News Ballymurphy Massacre Families spokesperson John Teggart said: “Six working days before the start of our inquest and they  send this letter, this has been done before with the recent UVF story to attempt to delay our inquest.\n\n“Vital inquest resources are being used up here and that shouldn’t be happening, these stunts are nothing but a waste of time. We would now ask for more resources to be released on the back of this. All they  are attempting to do here is swamp the system days before we are due in court.\n\n“The families are devastated, we were and still are working towards this date, the Coroner  has been very focused in the lead up to this, she is now obliged to look at this list. We hope that it can be done in a speedy fashion.\n\n“We were prepared, we knew it wouldn’t be straight forward, when you’re working with the MoD the resources they have and the dirty deals they’ve been up to all along are well known. They’ve been sitting on their hands this entire time probably thinking they’d pull a stunt like this closer to the time [of the inquest], but to do it six days beforehand is utterly despicable.”\n\nMr Teggart continued: “Sure look at the UVF stunt a while ago, that was done to take the focus off the Paras and the Queen’s [regiment] another dirty tactic and I’d be confident that the MoD had a hand in it. \n\n“The UVF certainly weren’t out to help us that time and now the MoD have decided to swamp the inquest.”\n\nDiscussing what now needs to happen Mr Teggart said: “We need to remain focused and keep on track, we’ve had setbacks before and we’ve dealt with them, we will certainly deal with this one.\n\n“I hope there will be no delay we have a preliminary hearing on Thursday, the Coroner is demanding an explanation, she wants to know why this database has suddenly turned up and rightly so. \n\n“Our inquest is set to last 3-4 months, hopefully this database can be looked at in line with this time-frame so we aren’t setback.\n\n“When we were given a date for our inquest 18 months ago we clapped in the court, that’s unheard of. You now have good, independent people within the courts, the MoD have seen this so the only way they could try and delay this is with the dirty deals that they are doing now. \n\n“Bottom line is, the families are ready to go, the Coroner is ready to go, all the work’s done, the schedule has been set out, justice needs to be served.\u0026#8221\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"west belfast teenager signs for fleetwood town","story":"\n\nA\n WEST BELFAST teenager’s dreams of a career as a professional footballer took a huge step in the right direction this week as he began life with English professional club, Feetwood Town.\nBarry Baggley put pen to paper on a deal last week that will see him contracted with the EFL League One side for the next two years.\nThe 16-year-old former St Mary’s CBGS pupil is the son of the Rosario manager, Barry Baggley Snr, so comes from a fine background in the game.\nBarry Jnr began playing for Newhill when he was six-years-old before moving across the city to Glentoran from U-10 where he played his football until being picked up by Fleetwood last week.\n“Last year our team at Glentoran did the league and cup double, so it was a good way to end,” he said.\n“I have also played in internationals and in the Milk Cup. I’m going to the Euro qualifiers in October with the U-17s and won the Milk Cup with County Antrim last year.”\nBarry is usually found either in midfield or playing out on the wing and as a Liverpool fan growing up, looked up to players such as Steven Gerrard and Philippe Coutinho as well as Barcelona legend, Lionel Messi.\nOf course, he has a long way to go to emulate his idols, but he has done everything right so far to have captured the interest of a professional club in England.\n“They saw me playing for Northern Ireland and asked me over for a trial,” explains the Turf Lodge lad.\n“I went over for two weeks and did well, so they brought me back for another two weeks and asked me to sign at the end of it.”\nBeing away from home is not a problem for the rising star as there are some familiar faces also signed to the Lancashire club.\n“There are two boys I would know from the Northern Ireland team living over there already,” he continued.\n“I already knew them before I went over. That makes it far easier for me to settle in.”\nBarry made the journey across to England at the weekend as he begins life at his new club and he is hoping to make his mark early.\nThe hope is to sufficiently impress in the next two years to earn himself another contract when he turns 18.\n “This is a completely new start with a new team and new players,” he acknowledged.\n“The aim is to get offered to stay for longer after these two years and for now I will be playing with the U-18s and hopefully start to climb the ladder.”\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37289307.ece/08e6e/AUTOCROP/w620/bellrhi001.jpg","title":"live rhi inquiry dups jonathan bell says special advisers were taking decisions on many occasions","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We believe that redistributing some of the money earmarked for corporation tax to skills, infrastructure and struggling small businesses will help to stimulate major economic growth.\" \n\nSpeaking at the event, Seamus McKeague, the head of Creagh Concrete in Co Antrim - which employs around 600 people - said the lack of an Executive was a drag on business growth. \n\n\"We need our own ministers to set strategy and guidance,\" he said. \n\n\"It\u0027s like the way you have to be in business - you have to show magnanimity and courage. \n\n\"You can\u0027t always be looking over your shoulder to see what might go wrong - so it should be the same in business. \n\n\"We\u0027d tell politicians to show the same magnanimity and courage that you have to show in business.\" \n\nRichard Hogg, of concrete firm Macrete, and a director of Precision Gear Company, said his business also wanted answers about what Brexit could hold, saying uncertainty was putting future deals for his wind turbine-related operation in doubt. \n\nAnd Nick Whelan, chief executive of Dale Farm, NI\u0027s biggest dairy co-operative, said he also wanted to ask questions about Brexit. \n\n\"I know we may be headed for a no-deal outcome, but there has to be some kind of contingency plan,\" he said. \n\n\"We need to find out what that contingency is because in the short-term at least, a no-deal will be catastrophic.\" \n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed how much dentists earn in northern ireland and how much they claim in expenses","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

I\u0027ve restored a property myself.. but this can\u0027t be allowed. They need to tear it down and tell Primark it should be rebuild to look exactly the same.\"\n\nFire broke out on the roof of the five-storey city centre store last Tuesday . It took three days to extinguish and work is ongoing to assess the structural integrity of what remains. Work was ongoing on a £30m extension to the store and it is thought to be largely untouched.\n\n\n\nBelfast city centre Primark fire cordon to remain for four months\n \n\n\n\"There\u0027s the stink that is driving people away from the city and if you close that area of the city down for four months there is a real fear people won\u0027t come back.\n\n\"It\u0027s called established business because we have worked to build a customer base - shopping is a habit. You can\u0027t close down for at least four months and expect those people to turn up again on the Monday morning.\n\n\"Zara, McDonald\u0027s and Tesco drive big amounts of people into the city as did Primark - and they are all closed.\n\n\"We may be ok, we will look after our staff and as we are in the cordon and our insurance may cover us. But those just outside - some who had seen trade drop 90% - will not get a cent.\n\n\"There is a feeling the preservation of the building is the main priority but at what cost?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Boyle pointed to a similar incident in Derry when the historic Tillie \u0026 Henderson clothing factory was demolished within days after a series of arson attacks at the beginning of the century.\n\nHe added: \"We are nine days after the fire here in Belfast and nothing has been done. They say it is four months for the exclusion zone. You are talking £130,000 for a new shop, I could sign a lease for four months in another part of the city and then they shorten the cordon in November, allow us to open and leave me with two shops?\n\n\"Take my business out of it. Belfast trade is struggling and to close this part of the city down in the run up to Christmas - when 40% of annual trade is done - will put people out of business.\n\n\"We were told as a matter of fact the zone would remain in place for four months - but no one seems to have thought \u0027no that can\u0027t happen\u0027.\n\n\"It is unaccepatable. They need to find another solution.\"\n\nAndrew Webb, chair of Belfast City Centre Management also attended the meeting. He said there was a lot of frustration but did not get the impression the priority was for the preservation of the building and it was more a case no one was in a position to access the building and therefore determine what should or could be done. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimark following last week’s blaze\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is no heritage input at this stage. It is a dangerous building that is why there is a need for the cordon.

tests on meat from Northern Ireland, England and Wales 145 were partly or wholly made up of unspecified meat. \n\nSome samples contained DNA from up to four different animals and others contained no meat from animals that were advertised. \n\nLamb was the meat mostly likely to be contaminated, followed by beef and goat, while cow DNA was the most commonly found contaminant in other meat.  \n\nMince meat as the most commonly contaminated product followed by sausages, kebabs and restaurant curries.\n\nSamples came from 487 different locations including restaurants and supermarkets.\n\nA number of the samples came from Northern Ireland.\n\nThe BBC revealed that 73 of the contaminated samples came from retailers across three supermarkets. 50 samples came from restaurants and 22 from food manufacturing or processing plants.\n\nOstrich DNA was found in one of the samples.\n\nThe majority of samples were tested for common food DNA such as cow, pig, sheep, goat, horse, chicken and turkey.\n\nThe FSA said that other animal DNA could have been prevent but not identified during testing as it was not being looked for.\n\nLocal authorities gathered the samples from businesses before sending them for analysis, this data was then sent to the FSA.\n\nThe FSA said that the level of contamination present suggested it was deliberate, with over 1% of a animal\u0027s DNA counting as deliberate. \n\nHowever the FSA said the results were \"not representative of the wider food industry\".\n"},{"url":null,"title":"salaries of stormont assembly members to be reduced by a

legislature in Belfast has not sat since early last year in a row over identity issues like the Irish language, which has prevented the appointment of ministers.\n\nRepeated negotiations convened by the British and Irish governments have failed to persuade former coalition partners the Democratic Unionists and Sinn Fein to reconcile their differences.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nThe gates at Stormont remain closed \n\n\n\n\nMrs Bradley told Parliament: “While Assembly members continue to perform valuable constituency functions, it is clear that during any such interim period they will not be performing the full range of their legislative functions.\n\n“So, in parallel, I will take the steps necessary to reduce Assembly members’ salaries in line with the recommendations made by Trevor Reaney.\n\n“The reduction will take effect in two stages, commencing in November – it would not reduce the allowance for staff as I do not think that MLAs’ [Members of the Legislative Assembly] staff should suffer because of the politicians’ failure to form an Executive.”\n\nMrs Bradley’s predecessor as Northern Ireland secretary, James Brokenshire, commissioned former Assembly chief executive Mr Reaney to examine the controversial issue of paying Assembly members.\n\nHe recommended the 27.5% cut, a move that would take the standard salary rate of £49,500 down to £35,888 in two stages.\n\nPublic services have suffered because no ministers are in place to make major decisions.\n\nControversial issues like provision of abortion cannot be addressed in the absence of an Assembly.\n\nIn explaining the need for a “stepped approach”, Mr Reaney said the impact of any salary reduction on MLAs’ personal circumstances has been acknowledged.\n\nMr Reaney addded that research shows Assembly members spend 50% to 60% of their time on constituency work.\n\nThe average working week exceeds 50 hours, and sometimes up to 80 hours he added.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"borders railway development considered as it marks third anniversary","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

travel.\n\n“Reaching the milestone figure of more than four million passenger journeys demonstrates the success of what was an ambitious project, and I look forward to its continued growth.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"minister considers law to ensure new build homes have highspeed internet","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

the Government could adopt so new houses are not built without “decent quality” broadband connections.\n\nHe told MPs he would consider “legislative measures if necessary”.\n\nMr Wright made the comments in response to concerns raised by Labour’s Caroline Flint, who said almost a third of her Don Valley constituency suffers from “very slow access or no access at all”.\n\n\n\nIt is important that we don’t build new houses without decent quality broadband connections or the capacity to make those.\nJeremy Wright\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nShe told the Commons during Digital, Culture, Media and Sport questions: “Teachers call me about they can’t mark homework at night, young people buying new housing on a new housing development find that they are not connected to fibre broadband.”\n\nMr Wright replied: “First of all people are coming to expect that they will have good quality broadband connections and they have a right to expect that because there are many areas of activity that need to be carried out now online.\n\n“And the second point she makes is around new builds: it is important that we don’t build new houses without decent quality broadband connections or the capacity to make those.\n\n“And she will understand that I want to look carefully at what measures the Government might be able to take, up to and including legislative measures if necessary.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"10 statistics which might just change your perspective of","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

The PIP assessment process does not have the confidence and trust of claimants or the public. Two months on, despite several requests, we continue to be met with a wall of silence from the Department for Communities. This delay in issuing any response is doing nothing to build the trust, openness and transparency needed in the PIP process. It is leaving worried claimants in the dark. \n\n“PIP claimants and the public need to hear from the Department. They deserve to know its response to each of the 14 recommendations and the time-frame for implementation without any further delay.”\n\n\nPictured above: Derry MLA, Mark H Durkan.\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"get voting young derry regional finalist bic kids young artist competition","story":"\nA young Derry boy’s colourful artwork has been selected from almost 1,000 entries to represent Northern Ireland in the 2018 BIC® KIDS Young Artist Award.\n\nHoly Child Primary School pupil, Liam Dornan, aged eight, has been crowned the regional finalist for Northern Ireland much to the delight of his proud mum, Senga.\n\nHis fabulous wildlife scene depicts creatures of land, sea and sky and has been showcased on billboards throughout the North. \n\nThere were almost 1,000 entries from five to 11-year-olds years throughout the UK and the island of Ireland for this year’s campaign but Liam’s colourful picture stood out to judges and he was chosen as a regional finalist. \n\nLiam’s entry has been put forward for a public vote between the other regional finalists up until Sunday, September 9, so the young artist is counting on some local support to help him clinch the top spot.\n\nIllustrator Phil Corbett, who sat on the judging panel for this year’s campaign, said: “We’re thrilled to announce Liam as our regional finalist for Northern Ireland. \n\n“There’s so much going on in his wildlife scene and we love the detail he’s used, down to a snake eating a watermelon slice at the top of the tree. \n\n“Great work!\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“We hope the billboards being created with Liam’s artwork inspire him to keep on drawing – he certainly has a natural talent for it which we hope he continues to explore. We would encourage the people of Northern Ireland to get behind Liam and cast their vote for this young creative between 27th August and 9th September.”\n\nThe BIC® KIDS Young Artist Award rewards creativity by taking children’s drawings from the fridge door on to massive public billboards returned in July this year. \n\nRegional finalists were chosen via an expert judging panel made up of creatives from the marketing, publishing and illustration industries and they will have their artworks used on 71 billboards across the UK and Republic of Ireland between August 27 and September 9. \n\nLiam’s artwork is up against 13 others in the public vote. The public vote is now open at \nBICKIDS/uk/youngartist\n to decide the overall champion.\n\nIf the young Derry lad wins, his masterpiece will be used on a further 26 billboards from late September.\n\nBe sure to support local lad, Liam, and get voting for him down to a fine art!\n\n\nPictured above: The impressive young Derry artist, Liam, aged 8, with his proud mum, Senga.\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"new radnor pictures knockout fun at new radnor carnival","story":"\nNew Radnor Carnival Queen, Bethan Evans with Princess, Ella Davies, and King, Jo\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtsh Probert, and atte\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtndant Jack Hughes.

field, but Chloe and her dad, Kenny, have been unable to find it after it was taken a second time several weeks ago and have appealed for its return.\n\nChloe raised \u0026pound1,000 for the Hospice

toilet facilities, helping make it a little home from home.\n\nVisitors from as far away as France and Canada stayed at the camp site with Chloe handing out pens and flyers donated by the Hospice so people were aware of how their money was being spent to help others.\n\nDad Kenny said in addition to the banner being stolen, small signs placed along the side of the road to direct people to the facility were also stolen.\n\n\u0026ldquoChloe has been left disappointed at what happened but I have explained to her that there are more good people in the world than bad and that the money she

community service dedicated to eighth century replica monument  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA REPLICA of St Patrick\u0026rsquos Cross at Down Cathedral has been formally unveiled following a cross-community dedication service.\n\nThe replica eighth century cross \u0026mdash which stands an imposing 12-feet high and weighs five tonnes \u0026mdash is located just yards from where the patron saint is buried on the historic Hill of Down, with the Mournes in the distance providing a stunning back.\n\nBishops from the Church of Ireland and Catholic communities took part in last Friday afternoon\u0026rsquos service and they were joined by local clergy and monks from the Holy Cross Monastery in Rostrevor.\n\nFriday\u0026rsquos ceremony had been pencilled in for earlier in the summer but had to be postponed following the discovery of medieval human remains while contractors were preparing the ground for the installation of the cross, carved from Mourne granite excavated from Thomas\u0026rsquo Mountain high up in the mountain range.\n\nThe intricately designed structure was manufactured by the Kilkeel firm of McConnell Brothers and representatives from the firm were joined by Church of Ireland Bishop Harold Miller, Down and Connor Bishop Noel Treanor, the Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, and members of the Cathedral Chapter.\n\nDean Hull, who led the short service of dedication, said the ceremony marked a very special day and was delighted a number of people heavily involved in the project were present, including Dr Mike King from the Down County Museum.\n\nDean Hull explained that Dr King played a key role initiating the replica cross project, financed by Newry, Mourne and Down Council.\n\n\u0026ldquoMike worked hard along with others to bring about the cross which replicates one that was in place around 800AD. Inside Down Cathedral, there are some old stones and through research, Mike discovered they were in fact part of the original St Patrick\u0026rsquos Cross, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoIn some old drawings of the cathedral you can see broken portions of the cross which marked nearby St Patrick\u0026rsquos grave. Obviously this old Celtic cross had fallen down and was broken with some pieces placed inside the church.\n\nDean Hull said Dr King, with the help of Philip Armstrong, redesigned the replica cross based on drawings and sketches and eventually, through the help of McConnell Brothers, the imposing replica cross was produced.\n\nThose in attendance at the dedication ceremony were told that the source of the granite used to make the replica cross was most probably the same as that from which the original was made, Dean Hull said the cross is at the heart of the Christian faith and that because Jesus died on the cross, people are reconciled to God and find forgiveness.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are reconciled to God but through the cross we can be reconciled to each other, with the cross reminding us of our common faith as Christians. It is lovely today that Christians from different traditions are able to stand around this cross today because the cross is a symbol of Christian unity and it reminds us that we have one faith, he continued.\n\nDean Hull said when people look at the cross and reflect back to Patrick and to the days of an undivided church, they are reminded that despite all has happened, \u0026ldquowe are still one in Christ with the cross a symbol of what people have in common\u0026nbsp \u0026mdash Christian unity.\n\nConcluding before the start of a short religious dedication service, Dean Hull thanked the Lecale and Down Historical Society which helped with the restoration project and the former Down Council and current Newry, Mourne and Down Council for their support.\n\nDean Hull\u0026rsquos words were reflected by Bishop Miller, who said a prayer as part of the dedication service along with Bishop Treanor.\n\nThe clerics then gathered at the base of the sculpture where they placed their palms over the imprint of a hand in the cross\u0026rsquos base and were joined by Bishop Grant Le Marque, former Anglican Bishop of the Horn of Africa, who was visiting the Down and Dromore Diocese.\n\n\u0026ldquoHere we have Christian hands together, said Bishop Miller, encouraging other people from all over the world to visit the cathedral to make the same gesture.\n\nHe added: \u0026ldquoThe cross is never just something at a distance it is the very heart of our faith in Christ, our relationship with Christ and our salvation in Christ.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Delight after new Translink bus service is extended to Clough  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA NEW bus service is operating in Clough.\n\nThe Downpatrick to Ballykinlar service is being extended to Clough from this month.

It is something they want to try and address to make the town even more attractive to holidaymakers in particular.\n\nMournes councillor Laura Devlin said that due to the force of nature there was no way of maintaining a sandy beach, which was why s he believed a pop-up beach on top of the promenade was an alternative worth pursuing.\n\nShe believes the move would provide Newcastle with that beachy summer feel and was pleased council officers were to examine if a temporary beach could be provided and the costs involved.\n\n\u0026ldquoTourism is the district\u0026rsquos biggest economic driver so let\u0026rsquos see what more we can do to improve the product we have to offer and provide a new outdoor amenity for people in the resort as well, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe Environment Agency has determined, along with other coastal erosion experts, that due to the construction\u0026nbsp\n\nof the promenade, sand is naturally depleted from Newcastle beach and there will never be enough of it to form a usable beach. In addition, efforts to place sand on the beach would be counterproductive.\n\n\u0026ldquoMany countries have provided artificial beaches which have proved very successful and I think we need to look at all the options and costings for a similar scheme on our own promenade.\n\nCllr Michael Ruane said he had no issue exploring the merits of a temporary beach and pointed to a successful scheme which dumped tonnes of sand on Warrenpoint beach a number of years ago.\n\nHe proposed Environment Agency officials be invited to address politicians about the possibility of adding sand to Newcastle beach with the initial focus on this project and also look at the option for a temporary beach on the promenade.\n\nSupport was also voiced by councillors Glyn Hanna, Henry Reilly, Brian Quinn and Andrew McMurray and the proposal was unanimously endorsed.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Starlet Eoin signs Pompey deal  ","story":"\t\t\t\nFORMER Ballynahinch Youth player Eoin Teggart recently made a little bit of history when he signed a two-year scholarship with Portsmouth FC.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe talented teenager started his footballing career at Ballynahinch Youth when he was just seven years old and spent the next six years playing for the club until the end of his U-13 season.\u0026nbsp\n\nHe was part of an extremely successful Ballynahinch Youth team coached by Paul Allison, Stephen Douglas and Gerry Kinnear, that went undefeated for two years in the South Belfast Youth League.\u0026nbsp\n\nHe then had six month spells at Ridgeway Rovers and Glentoran before spending the last two years at Cliftonville.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, diversity in the church, compassion for the complexities of life and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own life journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by individual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland. The Church showed anything but love to all those they have hurt and damaged.\u0026nbsp\n  They have even now showed a lamentable lack of capacity to lead, to acknowledge, to take ownership of their failings and to take actions rather than deliver honeyed words. This visit was a massive opportunity to reverse the damage caused. The opportunity has been missed.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

The event is also a great chance to interact with 200 dairy related trade exhibitors on the most relevant technological advances, difficulties and solutions in the industry. \u0026nbsp\n  Rhonda Geary, Operations Director, RUAS said: \u0026ldquo2015 saw the move of Winter Fair to our new purpose built exhibition venue, Eikon Exhibition Centre at Balmoral Park. The move has worked brilliantly and attracted one of the largest attendances to date. In preparation for the 31st Winter Fair we have increased the livestock accommodation and now have stalling, washing and milking facilities for 200 cattle. There is 4750m2 of exhibition space and a full house of 200 trade stands. \u0026nbsp\n  During the Winter Fair there is a busy Seminar Suite with talks presented every half hour from 11am until 3.30pm.\n  Dr. John Bailey from AFBI will speak about better phosphorous management, Bobby Irwin of United Feeds presents a paper on getting the lactation to the right start and Roberta Simmons of the YFCU and Barclay Bell, President of the UFU will speak about succession on farms.\n  CAFRE\u0026rsquos Martin Mulholland will be advising on feed efficiency this winter, making optimum use of grass silage \u0026nbspwhile Christopher Osborne form the UFU will speak about dairy commodity markets and the prospects for 2017.\n  Dr. Sam Strain and Sharon Verner from the Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland will look at improved biosecurity and BVD while Jessica Sloss from Red Tractor, speaks about the farm assurance scheme.\n  The live calf rearing demonstration will be making a return for the 2016 Show. \u0026nbspGorteade Cow Care owned by Barry O\u0026rsquoLoughlin will be displaying a fully functioning calf igloo with veranda and Heatwave ad lib calf feeder.\u0026nbsp\n  One of the innovative technological features at next week\u0026rsquos Winter Fair will be the Northern Ireland launch of the CalfApp and Calf Cloud by Volac which won gold at Eurotier in Hannover. It gives information about changes in drinking pattern and fluid intakes and monitors calf health.\n  The launch of the Winter Fair was held at Draynes Farm, near Lisburn, where Michael Drayne led a tour of agricultural journalists and industry representatives around his farm and milk bottling plant. The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres. Cows grazed outdoors using a Lely Grazeway \u0026nbsp\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.
