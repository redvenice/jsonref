Photograph: Alan BetsonOpposition parties are demanding a mini-budget and an increase in the minimum wage to ease the pressure of the cost-of-living crisis. Senior Government figures, including Taoiseach Micheál Martin, have ruled out a mini-budget as the Government prepares a package of measures to help households with rising bills, particularly for energy. Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy said: “Tinkering at the edges is not going to deal with this. “If you’re going to do something that is targeted and meaningful, I think it is probably going to be in the area of a mini-budget.”She suggested measures, such as an increased minimum wage and extending the fuel allowance for people on the working family payment scheme, were needed to help workers on lower incomes. She claimed Mr Fleming’s comments were “insulting” and they “really fall into the Marie Antoinette category”.Labour TD Ged Nash claimed that to date the Government “has only introduced two proposals.”He said the first is €113 off electricity bills and he labelled this as a “gimmick” and the second was Mr Fleming’s suggestion that people should “stop complaining and they should shop around”.Mr Nash argued that this is “very telling and reveals a poverty of imagination from Government in respect of how they plan to deal with this unprecedented crisis for working families across the country”.Mr Nash said comprehensive changes are needed to the social welfare and finance Bills and he gave the example of a VAT cut on fuel and energy costs. He said a mini-budget should be implemented “if the package that is to be presented is going to be meaningful”.Solidarity TD Mick Barry said he will be introducing a Dáil motion on Wednesday calling for an increase in the minimum wage to €15 per hour.He said it must fully compensate low-paid workers not just taking into account rate of inflation “but how it impacts on them disproportionately”.Mr Barry also claimed that Mr Fleming’s remarks shows that Government Ministers are “out of touch with the reality for working people in this cost-of-living crisis”.During an interview in which he sought to reign in expectations about the package of measures the Government is preparing he also said: “So rather than just complaining and saying, ‘What’s the Government going to do for me?’ You could actually have a serious impact on your own finances.”When challenged by Drivetime presenter Sarah McInerney, Mr Fleming argued the targets of his criticism were opposition TDs, and that it “would be more practical” to give people suggestions. Mr Fleming released a statement late last night saying: “I did not intend to imply people shouldn’t complain about the cost of living, that wasn’t my intention and for that I apologise. I was urging people to also shop around for best value, in addition to the measures being taken by the Government.” He insisted: “The Government and Fianna Fáil take the issues around the cost of living very seriously.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"About 2.4 million forced to leave their homes during 13-year-long war with Boko HaramTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"end mass testing now let us return normality","story":"Britain has got itself into a terrible mess on mass testing. A recent study led by Oxford academics, which found that up to a third of people found positive on a PCR test were not contagious, should give the Government cause to reconsider the wisdom of this approach.At an inidual level, knowing your own infection status can be extremely helpful, for example if you are planning to visit a vulnerable relative or friend. However, as we all know, a positive test result can have significant negative impacts, particularly if it entails loss of income and opportunity. If the tests are too sensitive, the problem is even worse.Furthermore, the truth is that we are permanently crawling with germs. Expecting the inidual to bear responsibility for any infection that he or she might pass on risks leaving us all living in a state of permanent guilt. Normally, this guilt is dispersed within the community.This is not to say that, during a pandemic, we should not exercise care to protect the vulnerable by limiting contact with them while we are infectious (in fact, I would highly recommend this) but it is also important to remember that once a disease has become endemic, there is little else we can do other than not visit granny when we have a fulminant cold.But to what extent should we self-isolate upon testing positive or being told that we may have been in contact with someone who tested positive? As we have witnessed over the past few months, these actions do little to stop the spread of infection and create enormous problems for the delivery of healthcare and education. Sanctioning the use of tests that suggest people are contagious even when they are not magnifies the problem.It is, however, important to recognise that things would not have been much different if we had a perfect test, as in some sense we now have with the new generation of LFDs. We would still have vast numbers of key workers unable to function and children being deprived of the safety and intellectual and emotional stimulation that our educational system seeks to provide. We would still have to endure life being endlessly disrupted – all having scant impact on the prevalence of an infection in its endemic state.Testing could have been profitably used at the population scale. Even imperfect measurements of the incidence of infection done randomly could have allowed us to make intelligent assessments regarding the progression of the pandemic and the effects of the restrictions, allowing greater flexibility and better tailoring advice to the vulnerable and the NHS.Some deficiencies in the rigour of testing early in the pandemic, given that we were dealing with an emergency, could be tolerated on the basis that it was important to garner information on the development of the situation. What cannot be forgiven is that, instead, we used a faulty testing scheme to transfer societal responsibilities to the inidual, sentencing many to loss of livelihood, education, social contact and hope – and we still are.Continuing with a mass testing, mass isolation strategy in response to a disease that has become endemic is merely piling up the misery.

Ms Mirza is a brave, principled, straight-dealing person who has an unusual combination of strong intellectual powers and the ability to get things done. Far from being a rat leaving the sinking ship, she was a key figure in the engine room. Boris desperately needs such people near him.I still think that. But I think something else as well, which is that the public cult of the adviser has gone too far. At their best, the special advisers to prime ministers and other ministers, known as “Spads”, are invaluable – the ones at the top, such as Ms Mirza, even more so. They fight for their bosses against suffocation by officialdom and help manage their relationships with the media. Without them, it is hard to develop policy and drive through the central aims of any government.But, as a trainspotting friend informs me, the initials SPAD mean, in railway parlance, “Signal Passed At Danger”. That signal was passed in Tony Blair’s era by Alastair Campbell and, in Boris’s, by Dominic Cummings.However talented, advisers shine only with a “borrowed light”. Their duty is to advise their principal and otherwise to shut up. If their principal wants them out, they must go, without public complaint. If they wish to leave, they should do so, without publishing a letter about it attacking their boss (as Ms Mirza has just done). Nor should they wage war against their former boss forever after, as Mr Cummings does – even saying last year that his intention on coming into office under Boris Johnson had been to work to get Boris Johnson out.It is not relevant here whether their criticisms are right. I think Mr Cummings had a good understanding of Boris’s shortcomings and many good ideas for policy reform. I know that Ms Mirza was always fighting valiantly to improve the coherence of policy against Boris’s temptation to fuzz things up.No, the problem is two-fold. The first is a fact that should be obvious in any organisation – no one can run anything if hisher right to lead is not respected. That includes the right to make the wrong decisions. Advisers, by definition, do not decide. If they cannot accept that basic rule, they should not be doing their jobs.The second is a democratic one. Governments are formed as a result of elections, and largely composed of people whom voters elected. If unelected advisers are trying to run the show, or plotting to depose elected people, they are showing contempt for the voters. They are undermining the legitimacy of the entire system.Mr Cummings’s great Vote Leave slogan was “Take back control”. If he had said “Give me control” instead, the public would never have voted Leave.Something very strange is therefore coming about. One of the main purposes of advisers – particularly in a Conservative government against which Whitehall is biased – is supposed to be to take on the so-called “Blob” of bureaucrats and quangos. The advisers are put in to help break the stranglehold of unelected power. But if they are simply a different unelected power, attempting to gain a stranglehold of their own, what good is that to voters?The Blob and the anti-Blob may hate one another, but they come perilously close to the same thing – a conspiracy against the public.The announcement that the Duchess of Cornwall will become Queen Consort when her husband succeeds to the throne has been well handled.To coincide with her 70 years as monarch, the Queen has expressed this as her wish. Who can challenge her?Not for the first time, the Queen has picked the right moment. It reminds me of when, in 2018, she took advantage of the Commonwealth conference in London to persuade the assembled leaders that the Prince of Wales should be made Head of the Commonwealth on her death. They wanted to grant her wish.If it had been rushed, the decision about the Queen Consort could have caused an explosion. As Editor of this paper at the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997, I remember how vehement many of our readers felt against the then Camilla Parker Bowles.Most of them were not such extreme members of the Diana camp that they wanted the Prince of Wales passed over in favour of Prince William but many were very upset at the way they felt Diana had been treated. Mrs Parker Bowles became the target of their wrath. They did not want her to benefit, as they saw it, from the breakup and the tragedy of Diana’s death.It was because of feelings such as these that, when the couple did eventually marry in 2005, she became only the Duchess of Cornwall, not the Princess of Wales. But, as so often happens with marital break-ups, the sense of taking sides sharply reduces over time. If the new partner politely plays it long, shehe is accepted.Thanks to Camilla’s good sense and good will, that has clearly happened. She will never become – to use Diana’s own phrase about herself – our “Queen of Hearts” and has never for a moment sought such a vainglorious role.All the more reason to think she will be a good Queen Consort.More from NewsBoris Johnson reshuffles his Cabinet ministers: who\u0026#39s in and who\u0026#39s out?Russia-Ukraine latest: Emmanuel Macron says he has \u0026#39prevented\u0026#39 crisis escalating after talks with Vladimir PutinPolitics latest news: Jacob Rees-Mogg secures new Brexit role as Boris Johnson reshuffles CabinetWish you were here?

Specically, not being subject to it. Wedding vows, lockdown rules, basic morality, the Ministerial Code, his own manesto: the default response of the Prime Minister to all of them is PAH! Which is why itaposs interesting that, a week after the worst week in his premiership since the previous worst week, which was only the week before, the PM is now submitting himself to the control of his Chancellor of the Exchequer.In a single weekend, Rishi Sunakaposs mates have moved into No, expensive policy announcements have been binned, and the crime of fraud which has taken £bn off the taxpayer on Covid alone has been downgraded to a harmless infraction of little consequence.  Unfortunately, this whirlwind romance is headed for some very big and pointy rocks.The first is that the cost of living crisis, which is already a crisis, is going to get worse with food costs predicted by millionaires to rise another % in April. No-one knows what to call something worse than a crisis, but the dictionary will probably need updating to include something like crisaster.The second is the energy crisis, in which the taxpayer has been forced to compensate corporate giants for not being able to steal money immediately, and instead letting them steal it over  years. Prices are likely to rise again in the autumn, and because  months was too long for billion-pound firms to wait, the government may allow an extra price rise in the summer to tide them over. Presumably, weaposll be calling this frobbery.If Boris thinks Her Upstairs is dficult to live with, heaposs going to flip when he finds out that Rishi is the sort of spouse whoaposll give him £ towards the housekeeping, and then ask for £ back by exerting some below-inflation fiscal drag on state pensions. On the face of it, their relationship is rooted in shared politics and a mutual love of money. But while one partner is a hedge funder whoaposs got more money than the Queen, the other never carries cash because he canapost hold onto it for more than  minutes.Both of them seem unable to spot a party when it involves  people, soft drinks, beer, renditions of Happy Birthday, a society wallpaperer, an official photographer, a strategically-sly cake, and a police investigation. Both, according to reports, are also capable of enjoying all that in the space of just  minutes before getting on with the job, which is a polite way of saying you burped all afternoon.But thereaposs little  these two have in common. One is a spender, the other a spaffer. One drinks beer, the other power. One is vain enough to arrange photocalls on staircases so he doesnapost look as short, while the other has just one suit and no comb. Read moreToday, weaposre told that a major announcement on Borisapos big promise to use the £bn National Insurance increase to bring down NHS waiting lists has been boiled down to a website, so that you can stop ringing the doctor to find out about your appointment and just throw the computer out of the window instead.Officially, the plan isnapost ready yet, and unofficially Rishiaposs blocking it until heaposs PM and can announce it himself. And therein lies the problem with this partnership: only last week, Johnsonaposs friends were telling him to kick Sunak out, on the grounds he was trying to steal his job.Imagine a bride trying to get the groom sacked, withholding cash while giving it to rich mates, giving Princess Diana eyes in TV interviews whenever sheaposs asked about parties. Picture a groom so desperate to keep the house that heaposll overlook their dferences, let her take total control, and start measuring up for curtains he will never get to see.Think about a relationship in that much trouble before its second anniversary. It might work in an Australian daytime soap, but it ainapost going to last in a world where people donapost come back from the dead after  years lost at sea. Johnson thinks heaposs saved his skin by ceding control to his most ambitious enemy, and boasts it would now take a Panzer ision to get him out of No. Sunak, meanwhile, is quietly lining up his tanks in the Downing Street garden, which he has always had a great view of from his No office. The PM is being infantilised by enemies saying his we wields all the power, and potentially criminalised by his friends claiming that she has nothing to do with his work, but nevertheless attended a lot of work events.And the only PR expert who can be persuaded to enter the fray is someone who considers the PM sexually incontinent, throws Benny Hill salutes at world leaders, quotes Gloria Gaynor, and on his first day gives the press the headline: Heaposs not a COMPLETE clown. But the fundamental flaw with this great reset, which is probably more of a breather to allow Rishi to liquidate assets, is that it involves trying to instil discipline in a man who has spent a letime shucking it. The fact he needs to be taught the self-control of a toddler is why he lives in Errorsborough - a town twinned with Débâcle.Fans may think these two have found the perfect blend of bluster and billionaire, but itaposll last only as long as it takes for Johnson to take back being out-of-control, and Sunak deciding that his tanks are ready to evict.

Mr Green and his we - who did not wish to be named - were born and lived in the UK all their lives before emigrating. Speaking to the End Frozen Pensions campaign, the pensioner said: Our pensions have been frozen for some  years. I receive £., and my we receives £..Are you affected by a pension freeze  Let us know at webnews@mirror This, I believe, is immoral. If we had chosen to live in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo or Turkey, or indeed  other countries with which the UK has a bilateral or reciprocal arrangement, our pensions would not have been frozen. Mr Green appeared to accept the idea the UK Government will not pay backdated pensions to impacted expats across the globe. However, he added: But they could start paying the full and entitled pensions from now. Today. Since leaving their home shores, Mr Green and his we have ed annually for two months. But Mr Green highlighted their pensions undergo a temporary change when they reach Britain. He continued: “During that stay, we received an increased entitlement to our pensions.  “So on Monday, when I set off, my pension is frozen in Australia. On Tuesday, when I arrive, my pension is thawed. “What does it matter where I am ” Mr Green is keen to highlight the issue which is thought to affect hundreds of thousands of people across the world. He concluded by urging the government to take action, and said: “I paraphrase the words from Sir Henry Newbolt’s splendid poem: Vitai Lampada. “Government - pay up! Pay up! And play the game.” A DWP spokesperson previously said: “We understand that people move abroad for many reasons and that this can impact on their finances. “There is information on GOV.UK about what the effect of going abroad will be on entitlement to the UK state pension. “The Government’s policy on the up-rating of the UK state pension for recipients living overseas is a longstanding one of more than  years and we continue to uprate state pensions overseas where there is a legal requirement to do so.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Department for Work and PensionsFrozenState pension\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The current Housing Minister, Chris Pincher, was shunted aside. Until now heaposd been the longest-serving Housing Minister for more than a decade, with two yearsapos service. Housing campaigners have previously reacted with dismay at the constant churn of dferent ministers while England faces a housing crisis.Mr Andrew faces a bitter battle with the Tory grassroots as he and Housing Secretary Michael Gove rework controversial plans to tear up the planning system. Mr Gove shelved the plans to split areas into development loans and theyaposre being examined again.He will be in charge of meeting the target to build , homes a year.

The amendment to the Housing and Planning Bill was voted down - on  January  in a major row. Tory ministers said the amendment would cause unnecessary regulation and cost to landlords, and councils already have strong and effective powers to police poor-quality homes. Minister Marcus Jones said at the time that it would deter further investment and push up rents for tenants. Of course we believe that all homes should be of a decent standard, and that all tenants should have a safe place in which to live regardless of tenure. But local authorities already have strong and effective powers to deal with poor quality and unsafe accommodation, and we expect them to use them. But Labouraposs Teresa Pearce said at the time: Although it is true that the majority of properties are safe and fit to live in, it is unacceptable that, in , we still have people up and down the country living in properties unfit for human habitation. This clause would change the lives of many tenants and provide a more robust, secure and safe private rented sector, which surely we all desire.  It later emerged  of the Tory MPs who voted down the amendment were also landlords.

Heres everything you need to knowThe DVSA has proposed six changes to driving tests Image: Getty Images iStockphotoBySurena ChandeSEO Editor:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsPreparing for driving tests can be daunting, with Highway Code revision to cram into your brain and hopes of a smooth run when out for the test itself. After a range of new Highway Code changes were enforced on January , , it seems budding drivers will have to brush up on their knowledge of the rules. And, with the pandemic causing chaos for driving test and theory test bookings, it seems there could be more trouble ahead for those looking to pass their test and get behind the wheel. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency DVSAhas proposed a range of changes to driving tests due to demand being at the highest it has aposever knownapos. Due to the scarcity of test slots, it has caused many learner drivers to book in tests far earlier than they are ready for.So, here are all of the DVSAaposs proposed changes for driving tests that could be enforced in just months. What are the DVSAaposs six proposals for driving test changes in   . Ensuring learner drivers are prepared for their driving test  Perhaps the most crucial element for budding drivers is that being prepared for your upcoming driving test is more vital than ever. The proposal suggests extending the amount of time you will need to wait before rebooking a car driving test, after failing one, to  days — you currently need to wait just  days.This move is also being pushed to allow for more training time to prevent retakes from being done with no further training. The DVSA states that, due to long waiting lists for lessons, slotting in time for extra training is tricky for driving instructors.With the proposed -day extension, there is a greater window of opportunity for learner drivers to take top-up lessons so they are better prepared for the car driving test.  This change would apply solely to car driving tests. The following would not be affected by this:other types of driving tests, such as motorcycle tests, heavy goods vehicleand bus driving tests theory tests approved driving instructortests. Forcing learners to give more notice for car driving test cancellations Finding time for a driving test booking can be tricky due to shortages of slots, and all sorts of surprises can crop up in day-to-day le leading to test cancellations. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that , driving tests were cancelled between April , , and December , , alone. The new proposal suggests forcing learner drivers to give  days of notice when cancelling their car driving test to avoid losing their fee. They currently only need to give three days of notice when cancelling a car driving test.  This would not be enforced for reasons like bereavement, illness and other circumstances decided by the DVSA. The change would allow for fewer driving test slots being wasted, and therefore it could potentially lead to a higher volume of tests being available to book. When the fee loss policy was temporarily lted during the pandemic, the DVSA found that there was an increase in tests being cancelled at the last minute. This reduced signicantly upon the fee loss police being reintroduced for short notice period cancellations. . Identying data surrounding how well driving instructors prepare learner drivers  The DVSA has proposed a method to easily identy which driving instructors need the most help and support with providing high-quality training. It suggests introducing a legal requirement for them to display their approved driving instructoror trainee driving instructor registration certicate in the windscreen of their car when brining people to driving tests. The DVSA explained the reasoning behind this, and said it would:encourage driving instructors to only bring people for their driving testthey’re confident they will pass help us improve our ability to identy and prioritise which driving instructors most need help and support to provide high-quality training mean that we can treat all driving instructors bringing pupils for tests consistentlyCurrently, driving instructors are only legally required to do this when carrying out driving lessons, but not for driving tests. However, many do so voluntarily.  If enforced, DVSA driving examiners would record the instructoraposs personal reference number and the test results can then be linked back to them. This would then allow the DVSA to identythe driving instructor needed a standards check. The proposal could mean that driving instructors who refuse to display the certicate could lose the approval to teach. It would also help the DVSA to identy and remove instructors from the register who are not offering high-quality training. . Offer more information about driving instructors to learners  While learner drivers can currently see the name, phone number, email address and distance of the driving instructor, the DVSA is pushing for more transparency. The proposed changes are displaying the following information deduced from a rolling -month period:average number of driving faults their pupils make per test average number of serious faults their pupils make per test percentage of the driving instructors’ pupils tests where the driving examiner had to take physical action in the interests of public safety overall pass rate for the driving instructors’ pupils. Changes to learner driver eyesight checks during driving tests  The DVSA has suggested a change in the law surrounding driver eyesight checks during driving tests, with the ability to do eyesight checks in dferent levels of light and use ious methods to test eyesight. At present, the law only allows for eyesight checks in good daylight and the test involves reading a registration plate on a parked vehicle up to  metres away. The changes would apply to car, motorcycle, tractor, specialist vehicle and approved driving instructorand part driving tests.  The move would allow for more flexibility for driving test times offered, and to ensure drivers meet eyesight standards under a range of conditions. Additionally, it would prevent test cancellations when there is poor light. . Swapping paper pass certicates for digital pass certicates The DVSA has proposed paper pass certicates for driving and theory tests should be swapped for digital versions. If passed, this will apply to all driving tests and would be in-line with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agencyefforts to create a digital driving licence.  The move would not only prevent people from losing physical copies, but it is also likely to help the environment with a lack of need for over two million sheets of paper printed annually. Why are the driving test changes being proposed by the DVSA and when would they be enforced  The DVSA has proposed these six driving test changes due to a a range of factors, but it is predominantly due to a vast increase in demand for driving tests. The website states additional reasoning for the change proposals, with the hopes that they will:encourage learner drivers to be better prepared for their driving test help to reduce the number of driving test appointments that are wasted give us more flexibility in how and when we can carry out driving testsWhen will the DVSA driving test changes be decided and how can I have my say The DVSA encourages people across the UK to have their say about the driving test changes on its website.The consultation vegan on January , , and will close at .pm on March , . Following the responses, the next steps will be decided and published within three months of the consultation closing, so by June , .

Poor Nessy has been overlooked by all potential owners at Miracle’s Mission, in Carlisle, despite being a aposvery friendly dog. She has become their longest-staying resident after spending  months in their care - and there has been “very little interest” shown in her in all that time. Although not much is known about Nessy’s le before arriving at Miracle’s Mission, it is thought she was hit by a car in Romania, paralysing both of her back legs. Victoria Bryceson, who set up Miracle’s Mission in , said: “They were so badly injured that they were both amputated - but this doesnapost stop her doing everything a dog with four legs does. to ourTeamDogs newsletterfor your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. “She doesnapost even realise that she is disabled and she races around playing like crazy both in and out of her wheels. She uses her wheels for walks.” The two-year-old dog is currently in foster care in Devon - but can be rehomed anywhere in the UK. “We are trying to find her a home but she has had very little interest which is a real shame as she is such a sweet amazing girl,” said Victoria. “Nessy weighs  kilos and she is incontinent which is why we think she has had little interest as a lot of people donapost realise how easy it is to manage with an incontinent dog through use of bladder expression and nappies.”Nessy has been described as a “really happy” dog who thinks le is one big adventure. She needs to be rehomed to a family with at least one other dog who she can walk with and ideally a playful cat. She can live with children. Victoria added: “She loves making new friends and loves cuddles and toys. She likes to be close to people as she forms lovely bonds with people. She also really loves both dogs and cats.” Miracle’s Mission is a UK registered animal welfare charity who work predominantly in the UK, Borneo and Egypt. A statement reads: “Our mission is to provide a place of safety for animals in danger, to educate on the needs of neutering both pets and strays and to neuter stray dogs and cats to prevent the birth of more animals onto the streets. We also rehabilitate and rehome dogs in need, often with disabilities, from our UK rescue base.”If you’re interested in rehoming Nessy, please contact Miracle’s Mission viainfo@miraclesmission.org.

The Bransholme area in Hull is on paper an area which will benefit from the Government promises delivered by Mr Gove last week to level up some of the Northaposs most deprived towns and cities within the next decade. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said the plans heralded the beginning of the end of decades of deprived areas being forgotten and left behind. The plans, spearheaded by Secretary of State Gove, promises more powers for local areas, better public transport, greater investment and an end to illiteracy and innumeracy.  Levelling up promises to improve parts of the North such as Bransholme, one of the most deprived parts of Hull according to the Index of Multiple Deprivation . The IMD, which scores areas based on education, health, housing, crime, employment, their living environment and access to services, ranks Hull itself as among the most deprived cities in England. In contrast, Office for National Statisticsfigures which compare dferent places on a range of measures exposes the gulf between Hull and Mr Goveaposs southern constituency Surrey Heath. The IMD shows that Madison and other Hull newborns will grow up in a city with the th highest levels of income deprivation affecting children. A baby born in Surrey Heath meanwhile would live in an area which ranks th on the same measure. The Government has promised to close the gap by , but Jamie and Leonnie do not have the luxury of years when it comes to raising Madison. They said they already felt they had been left to bring up their baby daughter on their own, with worries about work, housing and education a part of daily le.For both Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Levelling Up Secretary Mr Gove, their plans for people like Jamie and Leonnie should give them hope.The prime minister said: It is the most comprehensive, ambitious plan of its kind that this country has ever seen and it will ensure that the government continues to rise to the challenge and deliver for the people of the UK. Mr Gove said: Levelling Up and this White Paper is about ending this historic injustice and calling time on the postcode lottery.

NHS Grampian has confirmed that  out-of-date Covid vaccinations were administered in Stonehavenaposs town hall on  February.Those who were affected by the botch are now being contacted directly by the health service. It is believed the doses are safe and will still protect but health bosses say there is a very small possibility of reduced effectiveness.Following an investigation, NHS Grampian have confirmed that this is an isolated incident and all those affected were over , Aberdeen Live reports.A spokesperson said: “We can confirm  people who attended Stonehaven Vaccination Centre on  February were given a COVID- vaccine which was later discovered to be out of date. We are offering re-vaccinationthose affected want this. We are contacting them directly to apologise and to offer them this, according to their personal circumstances. We would like to take this opportunity to apologise publicly for any distress or inconvenience. This comes as Professor Sir Chris Whitty has written to unvaccinated NHS staff telling them it is their professional responsibility to get vaccinated. The chief medical officer for England tweeted out the letter on Tuesday, saying: I have written to NHS colleagues about the professional responsibility to protect patients from Covid-. This includes getting vaccinated, as the great majority have. It has also been signed by chief midwery officer Professor Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent, chief nursing officer Ruth May, and NHS medical director Professor Stephen Powis, among others.Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the Commons last month that ministers plan to scrap a legal requirement for frontline NHS staff in England to be vaccinated against Covid. He said ending the policy, which also affects social care staff, is now under consultation in light of the Omicron iant, which is less severe than the Delta iant.In the letter, Sir Chris and others say that professional responsibility and legal mandate are separate things, adding: Our professional responsibility is to get the Covid- vaccines as recommended, to protect our patients. At the same time, the vaccine protects us. The great majority of healthcare workers have already done so. We hope that those of you who have not will consider doing so now.

The austerity cuts of the last decade from the Tory government gutted local government, leaving public transport, social services and other support dwindling.Now, Boris Johnson has promised to close the gulf and make the UK a country everyone can succeed in. Led by Michael Gove as minister Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, the government has promised to level up these areas.Now, a new tool released by the Office of National Statistics will let you compare your local area to those across the rest of the country.  You can see how you rank across a number of measures across three broad categories: boosting living standards, spreading opportunity and improving public services, and restoring local pride. The ONS used sub-national indicators to work out strengths and weaknesses of an area. The indicators give a good picture of where the country desperately needs to level up, and in what sorts of ways especially. The signicant range around indicators of good public transport services suggest that there is a lot of work to be done in many parts of the country here. Similarly, in the restoring local pride category, there are signicant numbers who are below the median local authority in terms of le satisfaction, feeling le is worthwhile, happiness and anxiety.  Use the tool below to see how your local authority ranks and tell us what you think in the comments below These are undoubtedly affected by the ongoing pandemic, but suggest the government has its work cut out to make people feel satisfied and like they can get ahead in their local areas. Using the tool, the same sorts of wealthier areas appear again and again towards the top end of indicators. Richmond upon Thames, a historically wealthier borough of London, comes out consistently near the top in two of the three categories. In spreading opportunities and public services and boosting living standards, categories measured by economic and social indicators like pay, access to education, and access to health care, the borough came out near the top repeatedly. In terms of access to education, le expectancy, pay and access to public transport and services, the borough ranked very high.  However, when it came to the third category, restoring local pride, which included factors like happiness, anxiety, le satisfaction and feeling le is worthwhile, the borough ranked noticeably below average. Despite this, according to the ONS’ tool, the borough needs little in the way of levelling up. At the other end of the scale, Middlesbrough finds itself often on the opposite side to Richmond upon Thames. The North Yorkshire town ranks flat worst in the country in terms of early access to education and ranks noticeably worse than the median local authority. Middlesbrough in fact ranks worst than the median local authority on every measure apart from anxiety. However, the story of levelling up is not a simple London pulling ahead whilst the north falls behind.  Large parts of the south west are often forgotten in the levelling up conversation, but West Devon is more reminiscent of Middlesbrough than Richmond. When it comes to local pride, the area scores strikingly high above the average local median authority, but it’s indicators in boosting living standards are incredibly low. Typical of south-western local authorities, it ranked especially low amongst public transport services, pay and employment rate, demonstrating that the need for levelling up was not limited to the north. Not all of London ranks like Richmond upon Thames or Kensington and Cha, but due to some of the best public transport links in the country, even the poorer boroughs are dragged higher up the ranks.

Michael Stone is currently serving three le sentences for the killingsLevi Bellfield claims he bludgeoned Lin and Megan Russell to death Image: ShutterstockByTom PettorCrime EditorPeter Kirkham:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb  Former Met murder detective Peter Kirkham has examined monster Levi Bellfield ’s claim that he bludgeoned Lin and Megan Russell to death.Michael Stone is currently serving three le sentences for killing mum Lin and her six-year-old daughter, who were found in a lane to death in Chillenden, Kent, in .Stone, , was also found guilty of trying to murder Megan’s sister Josie, then nine - but claims he is innocent. His solicitor says he has a statement by Bellfield, , describing how he carried out the double murder. He says he was wearing washing up gloves and holding a hammer as he stopped the family on a lane. He claims his intention was to “just attack Lin”, but changed his mind on hearing screams. He claims he threw the hammer in the river near Walton-on-Thames, Surrey. But is Bellfield – serving two whole le orders for the murders of Millie Dowler, Marsha McDonnell and Amelie Delagrange – telling the truth or playing a sick game  Here, ex-Det Chief Insp Kirkham provides his analysis – and verdict. The new statement  This will be the starting point for any potential review and will drive any further action considered necessary. Detectives would look at exactly what the statement contains and compare it with what is already in the public domain. As it runs for four pages, it sounds like it will contain a lot of detail. Bellfield will also know that the police will be expecting detailit is to be believed. The murders of Lin and Megan Russell, and the almost fatal attack on Josie, has received a huge amount of publicity over the last  years. The police would look for anything signicant in the statement which is not already in the public domain. I suspect there are very few facts left in this category, given the number of legal processes through which the case has passed and the amount of media interest and coverage. If there are any signicant dferences between Bellfield’s account and what is objectively known already then the statement will be seriously undermined. Credibility of Bellfield  Whether or not there is any new information in the statement, the credibility of Bellfield will be an important factor. If, as I suspect, there is little or new veriable information in the statement, this aspect will be of central importance. The police would ask “Is Bellfield a reliable source ”. In this case, we know he has a track record of making unreliable claims. In  he denied having anything to do with the Russell murders. He appears to like playing mind games with the police – the senior investigating officer who convicted him of the murders for which he is serving a whole le sentence, DCI Colin Sutton, below, has said as much in the past. This may well just be Bellfield’s latest attempt to confuse, embarrass or undermine the police. They will be extremely cynical and will take a considerable amount of convincing that his claim is true and reliable. Does it fit with Bellfieldaposs pattern of offending   Offenders tend to start off with more minor offences and work up to more serious ones. This also applies to the modus operandi in that they would tend to start with simpler and less dramatic methods and, over time, build to more complex methods. Unusually Bellfield is known to have committed a number of very violent murders and other attacks in the first few years of this century. Each of the offences involved Bellfield attacking a lone female in an urban environment so the circumstances of the Russell murders are very dferent. His potential involvement in these murders has been known for some time and the police have already looked at it and found no evidence linking him to them. Strength of the case against Michael Stone  The flip side of assessment of Bellfield’s admissions is looking at the strength of the case against any other suspects, in this case, Michael Stone. The case against him is not the strongest. It originally involved a number of prisoners saying he had made admissions and at least two of them have now been shown to have been mistaken or lying. The Appeal authorities are aware of this, however, and his conviction stands despite that being the case. There is very little actual, direct evidence against him but, that said, the absence of direct evidence is not evidence that he was not responsible. The circumstances of the Russell murders is such that an experienced investigator would not expect to find much,any, direct evidence. It did not take place in an area where CCTV footage might be expected. Bellfield is seeking to persuade us he is responsible for the murders for which Stone has been convicted. This means he will have to produce a very convincing admission to convince the police, the Courts or anyone  that it is true and Stone is therefore innocent. Credibility and reliability of witnesses  As well as the credibility of Bellfield himself, the police will have to look carefully at the credibility of the others involved in the case. Of central relevance in this regard is Bellfield’s ex-we who is definitely not someone who might be expected to be supportive of him. She has said that she was with Bellfield in the west London area on the day of the Russell murders, more than  miles away in Kent. She has a good reason to remember the exact day as it was her birthday and this helps to underpin her recollection. She is adamant that Bellfield had no opportunity to murder the Russells that day. Her account is about as credible and reliable as these things get. Stone’s lawyers have claimed that there is a witness who says they saw Bellfield in the area of the attack on the Russells. This witness has come forward long after the events and her “recognition” of Bellfield is based on pictures of him she has seen in the papers and on TV. Eyewitness identication is well known to be problematic as evidence. My View  As we do not know exactly what is in the statement produced by Bellfield, it is impossible to make a hard and fast decision as to whether it is likely to be reliable and true. It is, however, possible for me to give an informed professional opinion as to the likelihood of that turning out to be the case. And, in short, I have little doubt that it will turn out to be . Most,not all, of the actual checkable facts in the statement will undoubtedly turn out to be already in the public domain thanks to the acres of coverage that the murder of the Russells has received over the twenty-odd years since it happened. Bellfield has plenty of time on his hands to research the case in great detail and find even the more obscure facts, which have received little focus. He is also capable of constructing a convincing  narrative from the facts he has available and, as a murderer himself, he is well placed to come up with convincing things to fill any gaps.  He is known to lie to the police and run them around the houses. I very much suspect he doesn’t like the police at all and he might therefore be motivated to produce a  account simply to get at them. He is also known to play sick games with investigators which, intentionally or otherwise, have the effect of torturing the families of victims. It would be extremely unusual for the same offender to have committed the Russell murders as a first fatal attack, several years before falling back to a far simpler MO which he then used consistently.It would also be very unusual for him to have committed the murders so far away from the area of West London in whichhe feels confident and safe only tothere for his subsequent offending.The conviction of Stone is not based on the strongest of evidence but it has been subject to long and thorough review. Two juries were satisfied of his guilt having heard the evidence.Because of the nature of the evidence against Stone, I am not giving too much weight to the fact Stone has been convicted whenit comes to assessing the admissions by Bellfield.And, of course, evenStone were innocent, it would not mean that Bellfield is telling the truth. I do not believe that Bellfield’s admissions are convincing, on the basis of what we know right now. He has a track record of saying things and then retracting them and he is known to like playing mind games with the police. There are several “red flags” waving over his admissions. Taken together they make me believe the statement is just the latest in a long line of lies from him. Although I am pretty certain that Bellfield is very likely to have committed other serious offences for which he has not been prosecuted or convicted, I do not think that the  murders of Lin and Megan Russell are amongst them.

But the car salesman was left stunned when his boss called to tell him to switch off his phone because the bill seems a little high. John said he nearly fainted when BT told him how much the GB of data heaposd used would cost. He told The Sun : “My boss called and said you’re going to have to switch off the phone. The bill seems a little high.“I said ‘What is it ’ He said £,. Next day he phoned back and said, ‘Definitely switch it off, it’s now £,’.” Johnaposs boss Paul Trotter, , of AAA Performance in Rainford Merseyside, said he nearly fell off my chair when BT shared the bill. He added: It’s obviously a computer error. I’ve had a look at the bill and it shoots up £ every  seconds or so. That’s just not possible.“EvenJohn was downloading Hollywood blockbusters there’s no way he’d have gone that much over.” Because John is on a business contract, which includes just MB of data, no warning was given when he exceeded the limit. Paul added: “I was worried at first but I’m confident BT will realise it’s just an error. “John had a great holiday so there’s no harm done and we’ve even managed to laugh about it.” A spokesman for BT said they will erase the huge bill after Johnaposs story was made public.He said: “We understand this is a very signicant bill to receive, so, on this occasion, we are waiving the surplus roaming charges. “In this case, the customer was on a BT Business mobile plan which included a monthly data allowance of MB. When travelling in Turkey he far exceeded his agreed limit by consuming GB of data. We alerted him several times that he had exceeded his data allowances, that standard roaming charges were in place and that he was incurring high usage. Our records show that the customer chose not to include a data cap as part of his plan. “We always recommend customers opt for a roaming cap, as the vast majority of our business customers do. We also urge customers to pay attention to any notications we send them around their data allowance.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Energy billsPhone bill\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Levin compared the two women and described Meghan as a dficult woman who is not somebody who wants to work in a team.She said: When [the Duchess of Cornwall] is with Prince Charles, she takes a backwards step and sheaposs there to support him rather like Prince Philip was. She doesnapost try to interfere, she doesnapost try to outsmart him, or rush ahead and shake hands with whoever is there.Levin praised Camilla on GB News for talking to people during the Covid- pandemic using Zoom, allowing the public to see her in a way that they never had before.Sheaposs also never complained about anything, from the time she was most disliked, before she married Prince Charles, people were attacking her in every possible way, Levin said, adding that the Duchess simply got on with her le quietly.  She never blamed anybody and never tried to win people round, she just waited. I believe she felt thatyou give people time, aposThey will see what Iaposm like and then they can make up their minds.aposapos  Presenter Eamonn Holmes then asked whether the Duchess of Sussex should have followed in her step-mother-in-lawaposs footsteps. Levin explained: I think that the Duchess of Sussex needs to prove herself non-stop. She takes on everything she possibly can because she needs to be out there in the front. Sheaposs not somebody who wants to work as a team, where Camilla doesnapost want to put herself out in the front. Levinaposs comments come after the Queen celebrated her Platinum Jubilee of  years as the monarch and gave her blessing for Camilla to become Queen Consort when Prince Charles becomes King.  The Queen said: It is my sincere wish that, when that time comes, Camilla will be known as Queen Consort, the title given to the spouse of a ruling monarch. She works incredibly hard and I think the Queen feels quite rightly that she justies it, Levin said of the news. A spokesman for Clarence House, the official residence of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, said that the couple were touched and honoured by the announcement.

Between September  and , , she broke the mph temporary speed limit, driving between -mph on the M motorway, near Manchester. She tried to convince Tameside Magistrates Court that she needed her car because she clocked up around  miles a week driving to work, taking her children to school and her son to football games. The -year-old claimed that her family “relied” upon her for lts as her -year-old husband Chris, a director of an engineering firm, was “not much assistance” as he was too busy with his own work. Hubble admitted speeding but tried to dodge the driving ban claiming that she and her family would suffer from “exceptional hardship”.But she was disqualied for six months after a magistrate told her: We have heard about inconvenience - but not exceptional hardship. She was also slapped with a £ fine with £ costs. Hubble, of Knowsley, Liverpool, had been driving in her BMW D M Sport Auto when she broke the law. Her lawyer Charles Stansfield told the hearing that she had had a clean driving license for  years up until the offence. He added that: She has completed a speed awareness course for one of these offences and she has now learnt about the importance of following the temporary limit and how it still applies.”Stansfield also argued that she has three dferent drop off points for her five children, aged two, six, ,  and , on the school run. They added the points hanging over her head would be a sufficient punishment and that she regularly drives hundreds of miles a week to take her -year-old to football games. He said: The -year-old is a very good young footballer. In terms of miles per week she says in one week the total was . miles. “She says her son plays football for Blackpool academy and trains at Myerscough College twice per weekly, which is  miles. She said he played a match at Carlisle which that week was  miles. She says she travelled  miles for her academy job,  miles for her sht at the hospital and  miles for her mobile aesthetics plus . miles to take her son to football.  “This is pretty well an average driving week, maybe slightly less because of the trip to Carlisle.” Hubble also used her car to get to work, and for her mobile business, and Stansfield claimed her family le is “seriously in jeopardy”. He added: Her rough net income is about £ per week plus £ per week in child benefit. Her husbandaposs net income is £ per week but this will fluctuate. They pay expenses of around £, per month for their mortgage, council tax, house keeping, insurance, mobile phone contracts etc. That does not include clothing and the odd chocolate bar. I think what comes in goes out and in other circumstances, she would be applauded for what she does in an average week.

She will not commit anymore offences as she knows what she has done. She will not be before the courts again. But JP Maxine Hamer told her: The bench takes speeding very seriously. We have heard a lot about your family circumstances and how you work for yourself and your husband as well as your travel. However, you have failed to meet the threshold needed for exceptional hardship. We have heard hardship and inconvenience but not exceptional hardship.

It will cost us, the taxpayer, £,. That’s the price of the civil service and police time spent probing No parties that should never have happened. The nation is rightly furious that the Prime Minister cared so little for the Covid rules he himself imposed that he put living it up before his duty to protect lives and livelihoods. Our PM gave not one jot about those who were forbidden from saying a final face-to-face goodbye to a dying loved one – or the family get-togethers we all did without because we were obeying his rules. Patsy Stevenson is angry too. She was fined £ for breaking lockdown restrictions to honour the memory of murdered Sarah Everard.  There was no cheese and wine at the vigil Patsy attended on London’s Clapham Common. Yet police pinned her down to arrest her, while ignoring food and booze pouring into No. The cost of the Partygate inquiry would be better spent on shielding women and girls from the kind of predator who snatched Sarah’s le away. And this investigation would not be needed had Mr Johnson and his staff accepted that rules also apply to them. This PM is on borrowed time. We will party – legally – when it finally runs out. A great honour for Camilla Camilla Parker Bowles may have been a skilled horsewoman, but she had a rough ride of it when she became Duchess of Cornwall. Many people could not forgive her for the part she played in the break-up of Prince Charles and Princess Diana’s marriage. But that was nothing compared to the fences the Queen had to jump within her own family while trying to maintain the dignity of royalty and respect for the monarchy. Both were tarnished when grandson Prince Harry turned his back on royal duties and skipped off to America to give a toe-curling interview to Oprah Winfrey, and strike ­embarrassing deals with Netflix.  It pained the Queen greatly when she had to strip her favourite son, Prince Andrew, of his titles as he faces accusations of sexual assault in a US court. But her duty to the nation demanded it, and the Queen has always put that before personal feelings. Throughout, Camilla has been steadfastly by the Queen’s side, her support in times of trouble. And just like the Sovereign, she negotiates the pathways of public le without putting a foot wrong – a ready smile and a kind word are always on her lips. The Queen is not one to ignore such loyalty and dedication. And today, as she becomes the first British monarch to reign for  years, she wants the world to know that when the time comes, Camilla will be called Queen Consort. We are delighted Camilla is to receive the honour. As they say in royal circles, she’s a jolly good fellow. And so say all of us.

In the surprising announcement, Queen Elizabeth II declared it was her “sincere wish” that Camilla take on the title of Queen Consort.The move was hailed as an “extraordinary” gesture by royal watchers.She broke the news in an address to mark the anniversary of her taking the throne  years ago on February . For years insiders were sure Camilla would take the title Princess Consort when Prince Charles became King. But conventional wisdom was brushed aside in the bombshell pm statement from the Palace, announcing the monarch’s wish that Camilla be known as Queen Consort.  The conversation between the Duke of Sussex and his father come after concerns of a rt between the pair, following Harry’s departure from le as a senior working royal.A royal expert last year suggested Prince Charles was hit hard by Prince Harryaposs decision to quit the Royal Family and move to the US. Royal journalist and author Robert Jobson said: I think that he [Charles] was closer to Harry and that’s why it’s hit him quite hard with what’s happened with Harry.The comments came amid claims Harry had broken the ice and taken small steps in healing his rt with Charles and brother Prince William at Prince Philipaposs funeral.Harry is said to have talked briefly with Charles, but issues between the two were thought to have remained unresolved. However, last month it was revealed that Prince Charles has offered an olive branch to Harry by inviting his family to stay with him when they next visit the UK. Royal sources confirmed the Prince of Wales has expressed his firm wish to spend quality time with his grandchildren, having not seen Archie since he was six months old and not ever meeting the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s baby daughter, Lilibet Diana, who was born in June.The offer of bringing the family together for the first time since Harry and his we Meghan decided to quit their royal roles and set up home in Calornia was made by the heir in the lead up to Christmas, it is understood.But Charles’s good-natured plan, in an attempt to heal the rt between him and his son, has been thrown into doubt after Harry suggested awould come at “too great a personal risk” due to his security situation. It was thought that Harry and Meghan would certainly make an effort to attend events to celebrate the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee in June. Harry is understood to have told family members he would attend a memorial service for his late grandfather Prince Philip at Westminster Abbey, which is planned for April.However, it has emerged that the Duke of Sussex claims he is “unable tohome” after a decision following his exit from the Royal Family stripped him of his right to personal security provided by the Met Police. Royal sources have confirmed the Prince of Wales has held several “good-natured and enjoyable” video calls with his son, Meghan and the children during the past few months. One source said: “The Prince of Wales has been saddened that he hasn’t had the opportunity to spend time with his grandchildren, which he really does miss. “He is a fantastic grandfather and loves playing the role immensely and it’s certainly fair to say he feels there is something missing from his le without the ability to get to know Harry’s children. “This is something he is hoping to remedy which is why he made the gesture for Harry, Meghan and the children to stay with himthey wanted to, whenever they may come home for a period of time. “In the meantime, there has been a series of good-natured and enjoyable calls between them all which is something the prince very much look forward to.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Prince HarryPrince Philip, Duke of EdinburghPrince Charles, Prince of WalesPrince WilliamHome Officepolitan PoliceRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

As I look ahead with a sense of hope and optimism to the year of my Platinum Jubilee, I am reminded of how much we can be thankful for. These last seven decades have seen extraordinary progress socially, technologically and culturally that have benefitted us all and I am confident that the future will offer similar opportunities to us and especially to the younger generations in the United Kingdom and throughout the Commonwealth. I am fortunate to have had the steadfast and loving support of my family. I was blessed that in Prince Philip I had a partner willing to carry out the role of consort and unselfishly make the sacrices that go with it. It is a role I saw my own mother perform during my father’s reign.

Heather Prentice was giving evidence at a General Teaching Council for Scotland probe into the behaviour of Melissa Tweedie at the event in Glasgow.

Deputy head Ms Prentice, , told the hearing yesterday: I had concerns about Melissa from the start of the dance regarding her outfit. Later in the evening I saw her up dancing with a glass of wine. She was up with a group of sixth year pupils. She claims she also saw: Pupil A and her taking shots at the bar.When it was time to leave the prom in June , Ms Prentice asked Tweedie how she was getting home. The Deputy Head recounted: She said she was getting a black hack. I told her I would arrange something for her. I told Melissa that there was a lt organised . When it was time for Tweedie - now  and working as a yoga teacher in Dubai - to leave Ms Prentice claimed she was unable to find her: I was told that she had left with sixth year pupils. I caught up to her on Kelvinhaugh Street. She was very reluctant to take advice and come with us. We couldnapost make her come with us, so we had to let her go. The Deputy said she was called by a colleague to a hotel across the river from SWG. She said: I got to the hotel across the river at about :am. Staff were checking CCTV to seeMelissa was there. Pupils had said that they had seen her in a room drinking alcohol. Mr Nicholls [Head Teacher] asked Melissa to send a ping to her location. She did not reply.  When replying to the presenting officeraposs cross examination from Gary Burton, she said in relation to the teacheraposs outfit: I do remember it was quite loose, short, low cut. I do remember that she looked like she was going on a night out. When asked about the nature of the dancing she said: It was all male pupils she was dancing with. I didnapost see any contact between her and any pupil. On her level of inebriation she said: She was not that drunk that she couldnapost walk. She was not that drunk that she was out of control. I told her she needed to be more careful here and the way she was seeing the situation was not the way the pupils were seeing it. I wanted her to recognise that the pupils were getting a bit titillated by it. Hearing convener, Arthur Stewart, then askedshe thought that she had actually spoken to her flatmate on the phone to get them to pick her up. Ms Prentice said: With hindsight, I wasnapost sure it was her flatmate on the phone. Iaposm trying to say I think she was on the phone to the sixth year pupil [Pupil A]. I havenapost got anything to back that up other than that she was blowing kisses and saying aposlove, love.apos Another pupil who was present at the prom was heard by the GTCS this afternoon. The pupil recounted: I was sitting at my table and I remember a chat between teachers that she needed to calm down. She then spoke about what she saw when she was staying at the Premier Inn after the night: I went back into the room as everyone was leaving to get a drink. Pupil A had his arms around the base of her back and she said to me aposCan we just pretend for a minute like Iaposm not your teacherapos. I left because it was quite weird. I went down the stairs for some food and I saw Mr Nicholls. He said aposwhere is she, where is she apos I think he meant Miss Tweedie.

She was competent enough to say aposcan we just pretend for a minute like Iaposm not your teacherapos to me. The pupil also recalled how Mr Nicholls looked quite startled.

Danny Walsh and Rick Webster were driving along the M last month when a lorry moved into their lane before continuing to drt across and crushing the front of the van. Their van was dragged against the central reservation of the motorway and left Danny and Rick fearing for their lives. They said the lorry then drove away without stopping to seethe two dads were hurt by the incident. Dashcam footage from the tradesmenaposs van showed Danny, the driver, moving to the outside lane to avoid a collision.  But they were soon trapped by the large vehicle, with the front of the van on the passenger side being crushed by the lorryaposs impact. The vehicle then slammed them against the central reservation, straightened up, before driving off. Danny and Rick were left stranded and exposed to the busy morning traffic on the motorway as a result, with Danny saying they were a few metres from death. Danny had luckily braked quickly in order to stop the entire van being crushed and thrown over to the other side of the motorway.  Danny said: We were a few metres and a split second away from being crushed. It could have been a whole lot dferent. Weaposre lucky. At first we just thought aposlook at this t***er, not indicating,apos and we thought he just wanted to come into that lane but then he just started coming out again and again. Before we knew it, there was nowhere  to go. People say you see your le flash before your eyes but we didnapost have time for that. We just thought aposOh s***.apos He explained thathe was in a hatchback rather than a van, they wouldnapost have stood a chance, with an HGV driver later telling them thathe hadnapost braked in time, they would have died.  Its a lucky escape. It was just natural instinct to slam on. He must have dragged us  yards along the central reservation then he just drove off. The lorry belongs to British distribution giants Bunzl, who have confirmed that the driver has been suspended while they investigate the accident. However, Danny said: Bunzl said he had a medical incident, buthe did have, he would have stopped, He straightened the wagon and drove off quite competently. Danny and Rick were terried that someone  would drive into them as they couldnapost look out the mirrors. They were luckily able to get across the motorway to safety. He added that he was really shaken up by the incident and that the van has been written off as a result.  He could kill someonehe did that again. I hope itaposs a wake up call for his driving. It could have been a family in that care and they wouldnapost have stood a chance, the dad-of-two said. His co-worker Rick, also a dad-of-two, said that the incident has left him with sleepless nights. If you think about it too much, it can keep you awake at night, but I want to know why he nearly made my kids fatherless. I feel unlucky that it happened but lucky we survived it.  He explained: I thought, aposThis could be it.apos It scared the le out of me.

Burglars are checking whether residents are on holiday by pouring kidney beans over doorsteps at night, a home security expert has revealed. Elizabeth Johns explained that robbers use the ploy to seethe beans are cleaned up by residents in the morning - which indicatestheir hunch is right or wrong. If the kidney beans remain untouched, burglars can see the house as a potential target to break into. People are now being warned to look out for the bizarre mark left on neighbouring doorsteps and clean them up where possible.It seems ridiculous, but we heard a while back that people are putting kidney beans on the front of peopleaposs doors, Ms Johns told The Sun. Obviously,youaposre in youaposd clean them up, butyouaposre away thenthe tin of kidney beans was still there then that suggests that youaposre away. Ms Johns said the tactic was being used in the Manchester area to establishanybody is in the house because that makes it a much more desirable target. She also suggested that homeowners could ask a nearby family member or trusted neighbour to keep an eye on their house when they are away. Other methods previously reported to be used by burglars include leaving a strip of sellotape over the front door keyhole. Thieves or squatters can come to the likely conclusion that its occupants are awaythe tape is still there one or several days later. Stickers on wheelie bins and stones stacked up near doorways are other signs that could suggest burglars are targeting your home. In addition to these secret signs, residents should ensure side and back gates are secure and sheds, garages and outbuildings are locked, according to advice from Crimestoppers. It also warns not to leave garden tools or ladders outside, to fit tamper-proof automatic outside security lights and try not to leave accessible windows open at night, even when at home.

Mason James Cowgill was caught taking both hands off the wheel to crack open a bottle of Bollinger and chugging away at the alcoholic drink as he drove on the A in North Yorkshire.In the same footage, he is later seen rolling up a cigarette, which he puts behind his ear to smoke later, and using his mobile too. During both instances, heaposs distracted and takes his hands off the steering wheel. The terrying footage was captured on June , last year when he crashed into one car and nearly caused another crash. At one point in his journey, the van crashes into the back of a car which was stationary in traffic, police said.  The car was damaged in the collision but thankfully nobody was injured. Cowgill and the car driver exchanged details, but Cowgill left the scene before officers arrived. North Yorkshire Police said he was lucky he didnapost kill anyone as he continued his journey while making more phone calls to friends and almost caused another crash. Cowgill reported the collision to his boss, who owned the van, and he reviewed the in-cab footage. The boss sacked Cowgill, of Skipton, North Yorks., and sent the footage to the police. Cowgill pleaded guilty to dangerous driving in court, where he was disqualied for a period of  months including an extended retest. Speaking after his sentencing, PC Babs Parsons of North Yorkshire Police said: “Cowgill is lucky he did not kill or seriously injure someone that day.  “The manner in which he drove demonstrated a clear danger to other road users and I’m amazed he did not cause any more collisions. “This was not a momentary lapse in concentration, this is a sustained period in which Cowgill paid very little or no attention at all to the road and was clearly not in control of the van he was driving. “I thank the owner of the van for bringing this footage to our attention as it has enabled us to take a very dangerous driver off the road”.

Cambridge University researchers tested seven dferent ways to improve the effectiveness of face masks when it comes to protecting against the virus.The DIY methods included taping the mask to your face to secure it properly, which was effective but uncomfortable or using rubber bands. Other hacks included filling the gaps with bandages or tying the strings for a tighter fit. But the method which showed the most promising results was to wear tights across the bottom half of your face and over your face mask. Face coverings have been criticised for not fitting tightly enough in order to signicantly reduce the viral particles that a person breathes in or out.  But the researchers said this bizarre new hack could close the gaps around the nose and mouth and lower the amount by up to seven times more than a loose face mask. They also noted, however, that it was unlikely to be tolerated for extended periods of time given the physical and social implications of wearing pantyhose on your face in public.The study looked at data from four volunteers who tried the seven dferent methods using both surgical and KN masks, reports MailOnline.While wearing the masks, each of the volunteers did seven minutes of exercises designed to mimic real-le activities such as talking, smiling, bending over, turning their head to the side, nodding and breathing.  The scientists gave them a fit factor score based on how well the masks fit according to the filtration efficiency. They found that better fitting masks have fewer gaps between the edge and the personaposs face, meaning that the air is filtered through the mask. The most effective way of improving the fit of KN masks was using tights and cloth tape which boosted the fit factor by . and . respectively, the findings show. Using gauze to fill the gaps between the face and the KN masks only offered a slight improvement of . while using it on top of the masks only boosted the fit by .. Surgical masks worked betterworn with tights, with a score of ., orthe gaps were sealed with cloth tape, scoring ..  The least effective way of improving their fit was by using rubber bands and tying ear bands with a score of .. But the attempt was still better than wearing a mask alone. Despite the positive benefits and the accessibility of the hacks, the team noted that they were uncomfortable overall. Tights gave the volunteers high levels of discomfort and caused problems with speaking while rubber bands put pressure on the ears and face, they found. Fabric tape was comfortable to wear but not to remove and it could be dislodged over time due to sweat or moving. The researchers said that the results could help designers improve masks and fitting devices.Most scientists agree that wearing a face mask makes a limited contribution to curbing the spread of coronavirus among the wider population.Medical grade masks can be far more resistant than common surgical or cloth masks but they can also be uncomfortable and hard to get hold of. The findings were published in the journal PLOS One.

Sasha Sasheva was propositioned by her boss Ala Uddin via text message and she says he stared at her so much in the office that it made her feel uncomfortable.The tech firm employee blocked his number and had to move home after she saw him hanging around her flat. Sasha was found to be a victim of sexual harassment due to a nasty and serious abuse of power by director Mr Uddin, an employment tribunal has ruled.She has been awarded £,. in compensation.  Sasha started working for the -year-oldaposs software firm All Techmart UK in October  as an administrator, the East London hearing heard. She was the sole employee and while the two of them were in the office Mr Uddin stared at her so much so it made her feel uncomfortable. The director also sent text messages to Sasha in November  saying I wanna hump you and Love...when are you going to f*** , the hearing was told. Sasha said she complained she could not have felt more uncomfortable and became so scared that she started to work from home more often. Mr Uddin also sent Sasha messages saying he missed her, the tribunal heard. In March , Mr Uddin texted her askingshe was alone and Sasha then saw him hanging around her flat, the hearing was told. Sasha says she then started to fear for her safety.for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.Mr Uddin then sent another obvious sexual proposition in the same month, this time asking Sashashe wanted to spend the night with him, it was said. At this point, Sasha told him this was unacceptable harassment and told him to stop. The tribunal heard Mr Uddin then tried calling her numerous times until she blocked his number. Sasha then resigned after the second proposition, because she was upset and angry with the harassment she experienced. Sasha felt so harassed she reported the incident to the police, the tribunal heard. Employment Judge Sarah Moor said: I have no doubt that at first the harassment made [Miss Sasheva] initially feel extremely uncomfortable, and nervous. She was too ashamed to seek support from members of her family initially. Most of them lived in Bulgaria and she did not wish to worry them unduly. I have no doubt that by the time she resigned she was scared, extremely upset and angry. She had been forced to leave her job because of unlawful sexual harassment in the form of propositions from her boss and only other member of staff. [Miss Sasheva] decided to move home because Mr Uddin had her address and she had seen him hanging around her flat. She did not feel safe coming and going. It is practically burdensome to have to move home, to pack, to find somewhere new, to change addresses and so on, but to do so because of harassment is even more upsetting. [She] has regularly had moments when she freezes because of anxiety. She calls these panic attacks and they have happened about three times a week since her resignation. They are attributable, in my view, to the harassment... [She] has had nightmares but these have eased. The behaviour was nasty sexual harassment by Mr Uddin in the form of sexual propositions and standing outside [her] home. It was an abuse of his power as her employer. In addition [Miss Sasheva] was made to feel uncomfortable by Mr Uddin staring at her and sending to her inappropriate texts about missing her. The impact on [her] was increased because she was a lone worker. This exacerbated her discomfort and feelings that she was unsafe. She did not want to be near Mr Uddin.

It was launched last October and has proved so popular orders are already being taken for next year.Makers Jetson, a Swedish-Polish firm, said riders will feel like James Bond when they take to the skies.It adds this is just the beginning – with flying cars this decade. Peter Ternstrom, one half of the brains behind the Jetson One, said: “The first time I flew it, it felt amazing, it’s vibration free so nothing like a helicopter or aeroplane.  “But we have a vision way beyond the Jetson One. By the end of the decade, we want a four-seater flying car on the market, one that can replace a normal family car. “We want to make cities a better place to live and mass transport is going to need to change.” Peter and co-founder Tomasz Patan set up Jetson in  and soon created a prototype.  They developed sensors, backup motors and speed restrictors to make it safe to fly. The Jetson One does not need a runway and has been built to ensure a perfect landing. Peter said he gets a request to buy one every  minutes.  He added: “Imagine turning up to McDonald’s in one of these. People will be thinking is that James Bond  Are they even from Earth ” The Jetson One weighs kg and can fly for  minutes, with a battery charging time of around two hours. It is controlled with a joystick but cannot be flown in cities yet and is only for open land. Peter said this will change and hopes to see % of all wheeled transport moved to the air by . He adds our cities will become greener with less need for parking spaces and roads. Peter’s next plan is to create a two-seater flying car by . He said: “People think it’s crazy, but believe me, evolution happens quickly.

Diego, a black and white Great Dane, is taller than his six-foot owner when standing on hind legs.Almost everyone knows him near his east London home and taking the tube can be a nightmare with large crowds of doggy fans, reports MyLondon.Diego is so popular that even the police have even stopped him in the street to take photographs. Owner Carlos takes Diego with him everywhere, and the pair love riding through central London in a two-wheeled motorbike together. The Great Dane even has a pair of dog goggles that fit his head - so he can ride in style. to ourTeamDogs newsletterfor your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. Carlos, who is originally from Brazil, bought Diego in . His we, Ellie, was terried of dogs, and had taken some persuading . On Christmas Day, they got the call: a breeder had one Great Dane left. And so, at am, Carlos set off for Peterborough to collect Diego. Ellie may have had her reservations, but Diego has won her round. Now,I asked her to choose [between] me or Diego, Diego would stay, says Carlos. She does everything for them - they control the house. At kgs, Diego is taller than six-foot Carlos when standing on his hind legs.  Diego has been known to steal food from strangers. He steals food everywhere - heaposs not very well-behaved with food. If some guys are having lunch and they blink, Diego will grab it, Carlos said. Carlos has tried to put Diego on a diet, but itaposs tricky - strangers in the park will readily dispense treats to their favourite Great Dane, and thereaposs also the issue of pizza. If he sees pizza, his favourite food, he gets crazy - heaposs a dferent dog. Heaposll do anything for pizza, he explains. Six years after getting Diego, he and Carlos are inseparable. Everywhere I go, I take Diego, says Carlos, explaining that when he sits down - on the sofa, on the Tube, to put his shoes on - Diego will always sit on his lap. Docile Diego will happily accompany Carlos to the pub, on the Tube, or join him at a restaurant. At The Bike Shed, a motorcycle club in Shoreditch, Diego is the first dog in the venueaposs history to have become a Gold Member.When we go there, it says on the table: aposThis table is reserved for Diego and his human, Carlos says. Diego is well-liked. In Victoria Park, where he takes his morning walk, he has doting fans whoaposll slip him treats at work at Bravos Motorcycles, people will regularly drop by to see him or take him for a walk. Because of his size and black and white colouring, some children even mistake him for a cow. In East London, almost everyone knows him, says Carlos. If you have a Great Dane, everyone wants to come and talk and take pictures. This can be a liability. The Tube is a nightmare sometimes...one [person] wants to take a photo, and then another one, and then thereaposs a crowd, Carlos said.  Driving together on the motorbike, theyaposve also been stopped by the police. Carlos thought they were in trouble - but it turned out that they too just wanted a photo of the pair together. Sometimes when we stop, people donapost want to pass - they want to see him, and it makes a traffic jam, says Carlos, who has taken to wearing a balaclava to keep a low profile. That said, Carlos is pleased to have Diego by his side, and I sense that he enjoys some of the popularity that Diego and Nelson bring. He says: If you want to meet people and make friends, walk a Great Dane in London. Six year-old Diego has an adopted brother, Nelson, aged two. Currently, itaposs just Diego who travels in the sidecar, but Carlos is keen to teach Nelson to ride with him too. Nelson is a completely dferent dog, says Carlos, explaining that where Diego is calm, Nelson is jittery, afraid of smaller dogs. As a Great Dane, heaposs more active. Heaposs crazy - heaposs the opposite of Diego. In spite of their dferences, the two dogs are best friends, says Carlos - although Nelson, despite being around kgs lighter than Diego, is the alpha.Do you have a story to share  Email webfeatures@reachplc.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TeamDogsDogsAnimalsGreat DaneChristmasVehiclesAdoptionPizza\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The luxurious property, in an upmarket suburb boasts five bedrooms, four bathrooms and world class views views of of one of Australiaaposs most famous landmarks. One of the propertyaposs biggest attractions is a aposmesmerisingapos m tunnel which took miners six months to excavate and even has some secret feature within it. Robert and Wendy Procter, brought underground workers from an opal mine in New South Wales to build the tunnel and during the build on the property in Mosman, Sydney.  The underground feature has attracted the attention of potential buyers after it hit the market with a  millionguide price. It has views over Sydney Opera House and the stone-walled tunnel even houses one of the cityaposs most coveted home gyms complete with a glass wall and wood flooring.Mr Procter told realestate.au : Itaposs a big house and the five of them stayed downstairs … the only thing we didnapost supply was alcohol which would have cost more than the tunnel. Described as very James Bond and high-tech by agent Jacqui Rowland of Di Jones Mosman, the stone tunnel stretches almost theof the entire plot and even has a gym in it. But it is the secret spy tunnel tunnel which has left potential buyers in awe of the property.It’s very James Bond and high-tech,” she told realestate.au. “You come out of the garage and walk into the tunnel, the lights come on and there’s music. It’s mesmerising.” The owners have been in the house for more than four decades but decided to build the underground channel to avoid walking  steps from the street to their house. Mr and Mrs Procter spent all of their million budget to create the game-changing tunnel leading from the double garage to a lt which comes to their home.  It means we donapost have to walk up  steps, which is particularly dficult in the pouring rain, Mr Procter said. Now the tunnel which can be accessed through the double garage goes past a subterannean workout area arriving at a the lt which brings users to their luxury home. In total, the project cost them around  million AUDbut the current owners love the addition.  As well as the wow which the tunnel brings viewers can also imagine themselves on its glorious sun balcony or visiting one of its many rooms or bathrooms.And thereaposs plenty of opportunity to enjoy the glorious weather, as the huge kitchen leads to a garden with a barbecue and entertainment area - as well as a heated pool and spa, sundeck and pond water feature.The estate agents realestate.au. say special equipment was used to bore through the stone.It says: The miners used jackhammers for the vertical lt shaft and a special machine that cut through the rock for the tunnel. He said including the lt and landscaping, there wasn’t much change from m for the work, which he says was well worth it. The views over the city are especially good at night when Sydney Opera House is lit up and can be seen from a distance.The outdoor space allows for some solace and is an oasis of calm in the midst of the bustle of the city.But the couple say the tunnel brings the added value and will see them make a tidy profit from their investment many years ago.  They put the grand mansion on the market for an eye-watering £million but only paid £, when they bought it more than  years ago. The property is on the market with DiJones, with expressions of interest closing on  February.

Several months have now passed since Cleo was reunited with her family but her mum Ellie Smith fears that she will never get over what happened.She said that the four-year-old would wake up shouting and screaming in the night initially.  And now she is scared of being behind locked doors while she insists on sleeping with the lights on. Ellie said how Cleo remembers how she was lured away. “She tells us that she was taken because her baby sister was sick,” she told  Minutes. “And so she needed to be taken away from us to that we could help her baby sister. She just knows a reason as to what he’s told her.”  Cleo’s mum told of the joy when she finally heard the news that she was safe, after receiving a call at am from police. She said: “I was asleep when the phone call came through and I was like ‘this is either good or bad’. I’ve answered it and straight away‘I’ve got someone who wants to say hello to you’ and I was swearing, I was like ‘oh my God, no way’. “Cleo got on to the phone and she’s like ‘hi mummy’ and I was like ‘hi baby’.”Back home Cleo quickly got back to playing with her baby sister Isla but Ellie feels that her child has been changed by what happened. She said how she is “dferent and always will be and that’s just our le now.” The toddler is blocking out what took place with her emotions up and down and Ellie feels that she went into “survivor mode”. Kelly, , was arrested on the same day Cleo was found and he pleaded guilty to forcibly taking a child aged under  at Carnarvon Magistrates Court. Appearing via video link from the high-security prison Casuarina Prison in Perth, he admitted his guilt and was referred to the WA District Court for a sentence mention in March.

The first image of Comet  UN  was spotted nearly eight years ago with shocked experts predicting it was among the biggest ever seen. At the time, early estimates thought it was around - miles wide. Now more precise calculations have indicated it is  miles across - around the same distance from London to Birmingham. It is more than ten times the size of the meteorite believed to have wiped out the dinosaurs more than  million years ago, put at around seven miles. But despite its massive size there is no need for concern as its orbit means Comet  UN will never cross Saturn, about  million miles away.Dr Emmanuel Lellouch of the Paris Observatory told New Scientist : “We have confirmed the estimate.“It’s the biggest comet from the Oort Cloud ever found.”  Dr Lellouch and his team discovered its true size by using the Atacama Large Millimeter submillimeter Arrayin Chile which examined the radiation created by the comet and allowed them to calculate its surface area. The Oort Cloud, according to Nasa, is the most distant region of our solar system and is described as a “big, thick-walled bubble made of icy pieces of space debris.” Some of the pieces are the size of mountains and larger, and there could be trillions of items. The comet is twice the size of the last celestial giant to hold the tile, Hale-Bopp, which was discovered in  by two amateur astronomers, Alan Hale in New Mexico and Thomas Bopp in Arizona. Mr Hale told Time magazine in : “As soon as I looked I saw a fuzzy object nearby. It was strange, because Iaposd looked at M a couple of weeks earlier and the object hadnapost been there.  The comet was visible to the naked eye for around  months, delighting stargazers in the s. Another space object known as P Chiron, which orbits between Saturn and Uranus, is technically larger at  miles but scientists cannot decideit is a comet or a small planet.It comes as NASA revealed it is considering whether to kill off the International Space Stationby crashing it into the ocean within the next ten years.The space agency plans to take the lab out of orbit in January  by sending it to a spacecraft cemetery. Point Nemo, Latin for no-one, is the ideal spot to sink decommissioned satellites, space stations and rockets as it is the furthest point from land on Earth. The nearest humans are the astronauts in the ISS who fly just under km above the zone which has been used as a dumping ground by space agencies since .US PresidentJoe Bidenpromised to keep running the ISS until  but its long term future is undecided as it gets older and unsustainable to repair.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NasaSpace\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Novosibirsk Zoo, in Russia’s third-largest city, announced a public vote to select its mascot after the area was named the country’s ‘New Year Capital’ this year. In thepoll , the city was given the choice between Aisha the cat, Batu the orangutan, Max the Amur tiger, Sayan the snow leopard and Shilka the polar bear cub.But what started as an innocent vote, quickly turned into a political battle that the Kremlin itself waded into. Sergei Boyko, the now exiled former Novosirbirsk coordinator for jailed Putin opposition Alexei Navalny, threw his backing behind Batu the resident orangutan to be chosen for the job. In a YouTube broadcast last month, he said: “Against the backdrop of everything going on in Novosibirsk, I think that the orangutan is absolutely the best option. Therefore, I urge you to support the orangutan.” The surprise addition to the ballot quickly garnered more and more support as a number of Navalny supporters online, as well as other journalists, and bloggers rallied behind him. Independent city council member Igor Ukraintsev alsocame out in support of the orangutan .Popular blogger Ilya Varlamov even dubbed the orange ape “the candidate of the people.”However, as Batu’s popularity skyrocketed, local mediaTayga.infoclaim that Putin’s administration took an interest in the vote.They report that the Kremlin, and Putin, wanted the orangutan to lose and claimed that Putin’s Siberian representative sent an urgent request to the Novosibirsk mayoraposs office to try and stop Batu winning.After this, Shilka the polar club edged into the lead, then Sayan the snow leopard suddenly received , votes in only four hours, despite thepolling websitereceiving only , unique visitors.  According toThe Insider , these votes were fraudulent.Local artist Artyom Loskutov who has long-documented political demonstrations in Russia, said: “The orangutan clearly won. Apparently, the authorities could not come to terms with this victory. Why — well, one can only speculate.” In the end, the zoo decided to scrap the vote the day before it was due to close, saying it would choose the mascot itself. At the time the vote was shutdown, Batu had .% of the votes, meaning the orangutan won the vote, but it is unknown whether it will be selected. Writing on its website, the zoo said: “We hoped for sincere interest and positive attitude towards our idea.“Unfortunately, today we see that our animals have become participants in a farce that people have organised. “The poll is used for purposes far from choosing a symbol of the festive Novosibirsk - a number of bloggers, deputies, journalistscalled on their audience to give the poll for the talisman a political colouring. The negative nature of what is happening towards the end is beyond doubt. “The Novosibirsk zoo is not interested in such attention to our pets, we do not like the creation of offensive memes, so we ask you to stop the survey and do not take into account its results.  “We have sent an official letter to the Deputy Mayor, Head of the Department of Sports Culture and Youth Policy Anna Vasilievna Tereshkova! And we already got support! “Thanks to everyone who took part in the survey without any ulterior motives. Max, Shilka and Aisha, Batu and Sayan are always waiting for you. Of course, they are animals, but to make them an instrument of their ambitions, in our opinion, is wrong.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON SnowZoosAnimalsRussiaVladimir Putin\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

We can be better than this week, and we believe Wales will be better than they showed this week.“Being tough to beat is really important.

In cases of the main Omicron iant, the S Gene is absent.“Encouragingly, there remains no evidence at this stage that the disease caused by this subtype is any more severe than that caused by the main Omicron iant.“Nor does it appear to be any more capable of evading the immunity conferred by either vaccination or prior infection.“However, there is evidence, from more than one country now, of a

and had a good chance to score when Robertson freed John McCallum to play in Andrew Renton.Renton advanced on the left side of the box, but the youngster#s touch when bearing down on goal was just on the heavy side, and allowed the keeper to lunge at his feet and collect the ball at the last moment.Kilsyth made it -

It was the Pupils who would concede it.In another move tinged with disappointment # the match referee failing to spot another offside in the build-up # a ball from the right flank was swung in to a player in an offside position, who held the ball up and worked it back to a central area where Finnart’s captain unleashed a strong strike high into the Pupils’ net.And while the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils continued to work hard to claw their way back into the match they were undone with only a few minutes remaining by a smart counter-attack at the other end, which allowed Finnart’s number  to score from close range with a low, side-footed effort.On reflection, the Pupils were undone by moments of business-like quality – certainly for goals two and four from their hosts # and perhaps their own naivety against a canny and disciplined side who are challenging to win the WoSFL’s Division Four.Nevertheless, the Pupils can reflect on a decent, determined performance for much of this match.

than the hosts would have liked.Finnart battled to repel the Pupils, limiting them to two dangerous efforts from outside the box, first from Casci who forced a save from the away keeper to tip his low shot round the post for a corner, and then from Scott Souden whose deflected effort forced the keeper into a save.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils made some changes late on with youngster Andrew Renton and right-back Michael McKinlay making afrom injury, but it wasn’t enough to turn the tide of the game and the visitors took all three points, to leave themselves two points behind leaders

Its A-listed home has been repaired and upgraded, its environmental performance has been dramatically improved, new displays have been created and thousands of local people were consulted about what they wanted to see. Visitors will be able to see more of the collection, more of the building itself and spend more time in Pollok Country Park.

In total  displays will spread across  galleries. The displays include innovative digital elements such as video walls, interactives and hybrid systems created to help people engage with the stories behind the collection.Sir Angus Grossart, Chairman of The Burrell Renaissance said visitors will soon be able to enjoy its enormous cultural ersity, great beauty and appreciate the scale of Sir William Burrell’s achievement.The Herald has been campaigning for a new funding deal for Glasgows culture and leisure services. We called on both the UK and Scottish governments to appropriately fund the citys cultural collections through A Fair Deal for Glasgow.An Arabesque Carpet being reinstalled at the Burrell Collection The funding for the Burrell revamp is an example of groups coming together and last October the UK Governmnet announced a £million package for the museum.Nearly half of the funding for the £. million project was committed by Glasgow City Council with more than a quarter coming from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, and signicant donations from the Scottish Government, the UK Government, and from many generous trusts and private donors.Caroline Clark, Director for Scotland, The National Lottery Heritage Fund, said the revitalised building now showcases this extraordinary collection in a modern and open space that is accessible to everyone.\"Thanks to National Lottery players, our £. million in funding has secured strong outcomes for The Burrell Collection and the many people who will enjoy visiting in the future, helping to drive tourism to the area and ensure that this wonderful Collection can be enjoyed for many generations to come,\" Ms Clark said:Culture Minister Neil Gray said he was delighted it would reopen to the public again adding: \"The Scottish Government has contributed £. million in funding to the project which includes £, to support cost increases due to the pandemic. This ambitious project will ensure the building, with its greatly expanded exhibition space, will be more accessible to the public for years to come.\"Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said: “It will be a proud moment for Glasgow – and for all of Scotland – to see the iconic Burrell Collection open its doors again on March . The £million UK Government investment, on top of another £million already spent on refurbishment, recognises the Burrell’s rich cultural contribution nationally and internationally. The improvements made will future-proof this stunning space, attract world-class exhibitions and entice visitors totime and time again, boosting the economy.”New displays will give visitors a better understanding of the international signicance of The Burrell Collection’s artworks, as well as the people who made them and some of the people who have owned them. The displays include innovative digital elements such as video walls, interactives and hybrid systems created to help people engage with the stories behind the collection.Since The Burrell Collection closed to the public in October , a comprehensive consulation programme has engaged with more than , local people who have given their ideas, insights and opinions. This input has shaped every aspect of the redesign of the building, access to it and the development of the new displays, galleries and spaces within and around the museum.The Scottish Parliament passed a bill in  which would allow international loans of objects from and to The Burrell Collection. While it was closed, objects from the Collection were seen by more than a million people on loan to museums in New York, Paris, Japan and London. "},{"url":null,"title":"letters-stop-causing-needless-alarm-elderly-pensions","story":"I don’t doubt the complexity, but have the authors overstated the uncertainty The UK Government’s own document “State Pensionyou retire abroad” states in its first sentence “You can claim State Pension abroadyou’ve paid enough UK National Insurance contributions to qualy”, making clear that following payment of contributions there is a liability to pay a state pension, consistent with the terms of the scheme at the time.Of course, these terms can change, “reduce, or even, in principle, eliminate”. Certainly, the state pension has ied in real value over the years, but it is no less clear that, in any post-Yes vote negotiation, pension liability could not be valued on the basis of something that might or might not happen several years later.As for elimination of pensions, the politics of telling the UK’s grey vote, and the expats all over the world, that they are not getting their pension any more is, in terms of political disaster, much worse even than Downing Street parties.Likewise, it is possible that the UK Government might challenge its liability on the basis that “the tax and NICs made by Scottish residents were used to pay for public services that they previously enjoyed”, but this is not what its own website says. Moreover, would this argument be applied to pensioners in the continuing UK Lastly, as the authors point out, “the UK Government can change the qualying rights for state pensions as it sees fit”. However, how can this be done to exclude only Scots. What would a requirement, for instance, to live in the continuing UK mean for British expats living in Spain Many of the uncertainties in the report are therefore just too horrible politically to contemplate, or involve so many dficulties that their complications would surely triumph. The logical solution is surely to negotiate an agreement about ision of assets and liabilities, and secure reciprocal agreements. I don’t doubt the complexity or that certainty is imperfect, but with goodwill on both sides, rather than weaponising the issue to cause fear among the elderly, I am sure a solution agreeable to both sides can be forthcoming.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.SNPS WISHFUL THINKINGI NOTE the debate on the SNP’s assertions that the UK would fund Scottish pensions after independence. This is an extreme case of wishful thinking, as today’s taxes pay pensions, because there is no pension pot to draw on.At present the workers in the  million population pay the pensions of that population. If Scotland were to be independent, surely the workers in the  million population of rUK would pay the pensions of that population and the workers in the six million population of Scotland would pay our pensions Why would the UK Government agree to fund, out of current taxation, the pensions liability of a dferent country, when that country is receiving the tax from their own workers at the same time Scotland has a demographic handicap with fewer working people supporting all forms of benefit. The SNP solution to this is large immigration of young people, which kicks the can down the road as they will all be old and entitled to a pension one day. Pension planning in the UK and Scotland is broadly similar to a Ponzi scheme, where increasing the population gives more workers to pay pensions and benefits. This lets politicians pass the problems associated with us all living longer down to the next generation.Nicola Sturgeon says that people will notice no dference or get a bigger pension this is extremely unlikely, given that it would need the UK politicians to completely capitulate to the SNP viewpoint.The experts writing in your paper on Saturday, David Bell of the University of Stirling and David Eiser of the Fraser of Allander Institute, seemed to suggest that a fudge agreement would be most likely .Certainly more of a drawback to, than an advantage of, independence.John Leonard, Falkirk.HAVE A PLAN BEFORE THE SPLITTHE dissolution of the United Kingdom brought on by Scottish independence means that the two newly-independent entities would have no claim to UK Treasury funding as the UK would have ceased to exist. In other words pensions for England, Wales and Northern Ireland would not be paid by the UK nor would Scotland’s pensions.Arrangements would have to be made prior to the split ensuring that the qualying conditions for pension payments to former UK pensioners apply equally to both new states perhaps continuing to be based on the qualying conditions of the former UK pension scheme.Payments up to the date of the split could be overseen by a joint board of the two new states and financed by the same mechanism as before. In effect all previous UK pensions would continue to be paid as normal and from the same revenue base. This revenue stream would be the same as before but now burcated. Both new states could then review the amount of pension paid within their jurisdictions.Don Ferguson, Kirkintilloch.WE NEED ALL THE ANSWERS EARLYI WOULD sincerely hope that all negotiations regarding finance, pensions, taxation, border controls and so on are satisfactorily settled before any independence vote. Otherwise the Scottish electorate will have no understanding of the effects of voting Yes.No intelligent person votes for something without knowing what they will get as a result.Previous voters were not told of the chaos which would ensue when voting to leave. We need the truth of the outcomes before there is a vote.Barbara Jarvie, Milton of Campsie.NORWAY MADE THE RIGHT CHOICESI ALMOST choked on my Corn Flakes this morning while reading Michael Sheridans letteron the subject of Norway.Norway, in his view it seems, is only a thriving economy thanks \"disproportionately\" to the might of Great Britain and the United States, who apparently have kept the \"free world\" open and alive to capitalist endeavour. That world order, it would appear, has provided infinite pathways, both physical and financial, for Norway to expand and flourish.No mention of the mighty \"free world\" heroes having invaded or plundered other nations, stolen their resources or having killed their indigenous populations throughout history, in pursuit of the great capitalist utopia. Mr Sheridan goes on to deride Norway for pursuing \"a long-standing policy of military neutrality and exclusion of nuclear weapons\". How very dare they!We are urged by Mr Sheridan to believe that the rest of the \"free world\" is to be grateful to the might of Great Britain and the United States for the free flow of capitalism, and that Norway is a political passenger and a fortunate beneficiary of our unparalleled might.Hilarious.Kevin Orr, Bishopbriggs.* I AGREE with Michael Sheridan that Norway is not a legitimate comparator for Scotland but disagree with his reasons for saying so. The crucial dference, which appears to have escaped Mr Sheridans notice, is that Norway is an independent nation and Scotland is not. He employs the blatant oxymoron of explaining thatall the nations of the free world shared Norways aversion to militarism and nuclear weapons there would be no free world.Norway, as a free and independent nation in the s, was able to make its own choices regarding North Sea oil and gas our Scottish nation was in a very dferent situation and it is now clear that great efforts were made by the UK Government at that time to conceal the full potential economic benefits of North Sea resources from the people of Scotland.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.WILL THE SPIN DOC SURVIVE BORIS Johnson’s new Director of Communications, Guto Harri, told the press that our beloved and boisterous PM sang \"I Will Survive\" when they met on Friday. I presume then that Thursday evening’s party was still in full swing.The PM clearly impressed his new flunky, who described him as \"not a complete clown\". I’m not sure that statement would have earned Mr Harri another day in the job, or another day on Earth, had he said it of Henry VIII.John McArthur, Glasgow.Read more: Why Norway can never be a comparator for ScotlandSubscribe now for the latest opinion articles and letters from just £ for one month by clicking here"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-decision-queen-adopt-regnal-title-elizabeth-ii-reawakened-independence-movement","story":"The choiceto adopt the title Elizabeth the Second was controversial and seen as a signicant slight, not to say insult, to her northern kingdom, which had never before had an Elizabeth and could thus hardly have a Second. This helped to fuel republican sentiment and reawaken the independence movement – in the words of the Coronation Coronach, “Nae Liz the yin, nae Lillibet the twa, nae Liz will ever dae, and we’ll mak oor land republican in the Scottish breakaway”. Pillar boxes with the offending EIIR insignia were blown up by “Sky-high Joe” and the use of EIIR was dropped. As far as I am aware, this policy continues to the present day. Salt was rubbed into the wound in  when the name of the Clyde-built Q was revealed to be Queen Elizabeth the Second. My father, a staunch Tory Unionist, was so indignant that he said he hoped it would sink.Times have moved on and one wonderssuch a gratuitous insult would be repeated nowadays.

For example, why have a full catering facility on vessels with passage time of under one hour with all the attendant costs and requirement for crew accommodation  Why build a ferry for £ million when a suitable equivalent may be built in one-third of the cost in one-third of the time  Time for radical change and more careful husbandry of taxpayers money.J Patrick Maclean, Oban.DONT KNOCK SCOTTISH ACCENTI EMPATHISE totally with Amy Kinnairdand we should remember that the Scottish pronunciation of \"Standard English\" has a much closer relationship between spelling and sounds than most English speakers of English. I may get pelters for this, but for example the \"er\" sound at the end of words is often an \"a\" as in \"finga\", \"computa\", and so on. I taught English as a foreign language in three dferent areas in Spain and never encountered any problems with my Scottish accent – Ooviously modied and at a slower pace. The Scottish \"ch\" and our clear use of \"r\" helped their understanding. It also helped with my Spanish communication.So please, do not knock the Scottish language or any other non-Standard English accent. They all have a place to play in our increasingly erse nation. Language is about communication, as we are now seeing with increased interest in British Sign Language. We should also never forget that around  per cent of our communication is by body language.

Pictured is a rare early Ming porcelain vase from the period -, known as Meiping for its distinct style, which has a pronounced ‘waist’ and short neck. It is also one of the earliest styles of blue and white decoration often associated with Chinese art. If you look closely you can see two characters written on the shoulder of the vase, which can be translated as ‘spring longevity’, and a five-clawed dragon over the upper part of the vase, while magic fungus-shaped clouds encircle the lower part. Only four pieces of this kind have ever been found.. The RehearsalThis is one of the best-known works in the Collection, and part of a large group of works by the French master in the museum.

Bedhead of King Henry VIII and Princess Anne of Cleves – Dated : A common object that unites most people is a bed, although the one you sleep in may not be quite as fancy as this one. Carved in oak and decorated in black and gold, this is an extremely rare item of English royal furniture to survive from the Tudor period. It was purchased by Sir William Burrell in , for £.

Here he shows his sister Beatrice on her bike with the family dachshund Fritz, with his short legs, desperately trying to keep up..The Thinker: One of the most recognisable works in The Burrell Collection is this modern bronze work by the French master Auguste Rodin. Of the  pieces by Rodin in the collection the most famous is The Thinker, conceived as the crowning figure to his greatest work, the Gates of Hell. Although the final project was never assembled in Rodin’s letime, many of the figures are famous in their own right.

It’s about Saturday. We’ve started off well, don’t even mention those two words! Honestly, let’s keep our feet on the ground.  “We’ve beaten England before – we beat them last year and we didn’t win anything . “I would like to think Scotland have got a very good chance of winning on Saturday and then we’ll worry about anyone  after that.” Scott was equally exasperated. “I look back to the squads of  and  when nobody was thinking ahead, it was literally about the next game,” said the former centre. “They just concentrated on what was in front of them next. Nobody got carried away, especially the media.” Perhaps there is more hype now than these two legends experienced in their pomp, but the game has moved on from those amateur days of dignied understatement, and they acknowledge that it would be much worsethere was no optimistic chatter surrounding the Scotland team this week because that would mean that they had come up short against England last Saturday. As it is, the Scots are flying high after achieving back-to-back successes against the Auld Enemy for the first time in  yearsand are looking ahead to a trip to Cardf to take on a Wales team reeling from their - drubbing at the hands of Ireland at the weekend. So, this refusal to jump on the hype train should not be mistaken for a lack of admiration for what Scotland have achieved so far – or a lack of belief in what is possiblethe players and coaching team keep their focus. “You look at that performance by Scotland on Saturday and there was a full understanding of everything that happened in that game: from Finn Russell’s kicking to the defensive , to the way they coped with England’s power up-front,” agreed Scott. “In the past, some of their games have been littered with simple mistakes, but there was a unity in that performance. When Scotland go down to Cardf, they must continue to turn the screw. “The Principality Stadium Stadium will be a tough nut to crack, so they just have to knuckle down and concentrate on their own game,” he added. “There have been times in the past few years when they have gone there, played that high-tempo style, and then fallen out the game. “You have to still be in the game in the last  minutes. On Saturday they stayed in the game, stayed confident in the way they carried the ball into contact, and it will have to be the same in Wales. It is going to have to be like Groundhog Day – repeat, repeat, repeat.\"Meanwhile,Gavin is frustrated that his son, stand-off Adam, was not involved in last weekend’s game and is not going to be involved in this coming weekend’s match having been left out of Townsend’s training squad for this campaign, then he was not letting on. “I thought Finn Russell [the incumbent stand-off] had a magnicent game against England and his goalkicking was key to that, as was his kicking from hand,” he said. “His thread-through in the second half when England had lost Luke Cowan-Dickie was a massive moment. His game management was terric.” The Grand Slam Dinner is being held at Edinburgh International Conference Centre on Saturday st May, with tickets now on sale. The event – which is being held to help raise awareness and funds for Hearts + Balls, a charity which supports former players who have suffered serious injuries – was supposed to take place back in  to mark the th anniversary of the  Grand Slam but was postponed due to Covid. “Rugby has sorely missed these big group celebrations - and charities have been hit hard by not being able to utilise vital fundraising streams,” said Scott.  “Of course, the evening will be incredibly enjoyable, but to be able to know that we’re making a real dference to members of the rugby community who need our support makes it all the more special. “Hearts + Balls is an incredible charity that every single one of us is proud to be able to support.”"},{"url":null,"title":"todays-wordle-answer-clues-wordle-234-tuesday-february-8","story":"The aim of the game is to find a  letter word in only six attempts.The game uses the same rules as Scrabble, where only real words are allowed both in guesses and the result.If you get a letter in the right spot and form the correct word, the square turns green.Butthe guessed letter is in the word but not in the right spot, the square turns yellow.Letters that are wrong turn grey to help the process of elimination for the six tries.If you’re still trying to save your streak, then don’t scroll down yet, maybe some hints will send you on your way.Today’s word starts with the letter F.Another clue  Its useful for pictures.If you have given up on today’s game, then we can save you the misery.

Children from P , P  and P  are instead accessing learning from home. Three classes — P, P  and P — and the nursery remain open.On Monday evening, Orkney Islands Council shared hopes to reopen the school fully on Wednesday, with further updates to be confirmed today, Tuesday.Head teacher Islean Gibson has been meeting with representatives from the education service and public health on a daily basis and this will continue as required.She has also been communicating directly with families on the ever-evolving situation and is heartened by the support shown.“We are confident that the home learning on offer to our three classes is working well for families at this time,# Miss Gibson said.#Part of our meeting involved planning for the rest of this week, and I will be writing out to everyone as soon as is possible tomorrow to let parents know what we hope we can provide across the remainder of this week.“It has been an exceptionally tough day for staff and a tricky balance in terms of in class teaching and making sure we have learning going home, so I thank all from the bottom of my heart for the understanding as we all try to get to grips with our new normal for today and tomorrow. To say the team at Dounby have rallied is nowhere near thanks enough.”OIC executive director of education, leisure and housing, James Wylie, added: “The school is experiencing a high number of teaching and support staff absences due to sickness which includes COVID, and this is now coupled with an increasing number of pupils being off across some of the classes too.“Whilst there are  reported COVID-positive LFD and PCR cases within the staff and pupils at the school, it is the combination of all the sickness absences that has led to this decision. We are looking to all measures to try and ensure the school can operate in full from Wednesday, and this will be communicated tomorrow.“Please be assured that we are doing everything we possibly can to get back to normal as soon as possible. I want to also commend the Head Teacher and her team for stepping up in these dficult circumstances.”Despite a relaxation of restrictions nationwide, it remains vital for everyone to continue carrying out lateral flow tests and to report the result, whether positive, negative or void here: https:www.nhsinform.scot # coronavirus-covid-#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There is no place for it in cricket.”PCA chief executive Rob Lynch had earlier been drawn on the issue by DCMS committee chair Julian Knight during the parliamentary session.“This is Yorkshire County Cricket Club, one of,not the most, famous cricket club in the world, and to watch these events unfold is extremely saddening,” Lynch said.“I think the progress Lord Patel is trying to put in place is absolutely the right direction and as we have hopefully shown this morning our objective is to move forward.“I am not across the detail in regard to what the members are doing, the small group of iniduals.“Our focus in Yorkshire is the current players up there and ensuring their welfare and we are spending a lot of time up there because there is a group of iniduals very uncertain about what is going on around them. That is where we will maintain our focus within the environment.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

A good cup tie and perfect way to start a busy run of games. 💪 pic HtfvaKRCr— Harry KaneFebruary , However, he is looking back to his best under Conte and has credited the Italian with improving both his physical condition and the mindset around the club.Conte has called the -year-old “world class” but wants to take him to a new level.“Surely when you have a player like Harry, you have to try to involve him in your tactical idea of football,” Conte said.“He’s an important player for us and he has to be a point of reference when we develop our football offensively.“We’re trying to work with him in many aspects. I think every single player can improve until he decides to stop his career.“We’re talking about a really good person who shows desire every day in training.

He had a little muscular problem in his thigh.“It’s not serious but the problem is in the same place as the last time, so for this reason the doctors told me to be patient and not to take risks with him.“It’s a pity because you know the importance of this player to us.”On Skipp, who has a groin injury, Conte added: “Honestly I hope to have him back very soon. The medical department said to me two weeks but I hope to have him available in one week or  days maximum.“For this reason I try to push my medical department because we need Skipp to be available.

Populations became more economically resilient, he said.The cost of using the Faroese tunnels was at first around the same as a ferry journey but over time as usage increased, tolls were slashed to less than a fth of that.Now, Mr Lamhauge said the debate was about whether to cut the tolls altogether.The meeting also heard questions from pupils at Mid Yell and Whalsay schools as well as input from some of the  or so people viewing the debate.Among the biggest subjects for debate was where would the first tunnel be builtMr Lamhauge said it took around  years to get such projects going.The Shetland Times.Here in Norway toll roads is common to finance such projects#get the funding from the Scottish Gov and get on with it.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of .

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

the largest the city has seen in recent years.Green councillor Aine Groogan said: “For the last seven years, we have managed to keep the rates increase below %, which has been a signicant achievement, and while we are seeing an increase of above that this year, I am pleased that we have been able to keep the rise signicantly below that of inflation.“As councillors, it’s important that we strike a balance between supporting communities, businesses and our most vulnerable as we move forward on our Covid recovery journey, and forge ahead with investing in and enhancing our services.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “We have worked hard to keep the increase to an absolute minimum, and below the level of inflation, while also delivering on our community plan for the city and prioritising action on climate, digital innovation and investment in council facilities.“We have also committed to making further efficiency savings where possible in the next financial year.”Ms Groogan added that tackling climate change is something the council has been working hard to raise awareness on “but more importantly, take action on”.“This new budget estimates that we can reduce our vehicles’ C emissions by % which is a really good news story for our city and its citizens, as well as the environment,” she said.The council statement says it has delivered £m investment in council facilities.That includes £m in new leisure centres, a £m Local Investment Fund, a £.m Belfast Investment Fund, a £m Social Outcomes Fund, as well as a £.m City Centre Investment Fund, £m Neighbourhood Regeneration Fund, and £m with the Belfast Region City Deal, including £m for the Belfast Destination Hub.Most ReadWatch: Surging waves engulf cars at Benone Strand under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs harvesting the fruits of their hard work and endeavour‘Cost to my health of getting a sunbed tan just wasn’t worth it’: Belfast mum with stage four skin cancer in warning over dangers of melanomaLow number of Queen’s University Belfast academics from a Protestant background a ‘cause for concern’BBC NI rejects Arlene Foster’s claim broadcaster is an ‘opponent’ of the DUPTop VideosPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea Playth anniversary commemoration for  Sean Graham#s bookmakers atrocity on Belfast#s Ormeau RoadPlayFamilies of bookies atrocity vow to fight for justice on th anniversaryLatest Northern IrelandBelfast stars Dame Judi Dench and Ciaran Hinds land Oscar nominationsFamilies call for justice after damning police watchdog report on UDA murdersHospitality support payments extended to soft play businessesSir Kenneth Branagh: Policeman scared ‘bejaysus# out of me after I stole Turkish Delight as a childWatch: Northern Ireland TikTok star India Sasha goes viral with over m views on rock, paper, scissors prank videoLatestClause that favours children of past pupils ‘epitome of discrimination’Johnson reshuffles ministers as he refuses to apologise for Starmer ‘slur’Belfast: The joy of six for Kenneth Branagh as film earns a host of Bafta nominationsNo  insists Guto Harri’s Huawei lobbying was within rulesDriver injured as brick thrown at train,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We will only fix that by speaking to the UK Government and to the EU, to get them to understand that feast or famine, to fix the problems that we’ve got.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up All other parties bar the TUV have criticised the DUP’s move, in particular as it means victims and survivors of historical institutional abuse will not receive the planned formal apology from the First and Deputy First Ministers.Sinn Fein’s former Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “The DUP’s actions in unilaterally resigning from the Executive are reckless and they’ve caused concern and uncertainty for businesses, for workers, for families and campaigners on a range of many important issues.“In terms of the victims of historical institutional abuse, it has caused real hurt and trauma.“And while the DUP must bear responsibility for that, I’m also very conscious that those of us who are serious about showing responsible leadership and delivering for people can and should seek to salvage what we can from the chaos the DUP have caused.”DUP Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots said he was surprised other parties couldn’t see the role they played in the First Minister’s resignation.“Because we had a debate in this chamber some time ago when the SDLP, Sinn Fein, Alliance and Green Party all called for the rigorous implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol,” he added.“Now, we got a report from the EU Commission some weeks ago that was put in the Assembly library, which indicates what the rigorous implementation of the protocol is. That for some years those people who would be travelling back from ious parts of the world through Aldergrove Airport would have seen a notice about bringing food in, or anything from third countries, what they’re supposed to do.“And the EU are expecting us to do that on food coming in from Britain. Now, how many planes, how many trucks, how many cars are coming in from Great Britain to Northern Ireland every day “And the EU are demanding that we go in and ask people to open their suitcases, to open their bags, andthere’s a few mandarin oranges that they bought for the children on the way home on the ferry, that’s an at-risk item.”Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson won’t be visiting Northern Ireland imminently, following calls from DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson to do so amid the political crisis.Downing Street said Mr Johnson was monitoring the situation at Stormont closely, but there were no plans for the PM to travel over.Related topicsUlster Unionist PartySinn FéinNorthern Ireland AssemblySDLPNI ProtocolPaul GivanMichelle O#NeillTraditional Unionist VoiceEdwin PootsBoris JohnsonMore On Ulster Unionist PartyBelfast City council set to launch legal action over Poots’ port checks move PremiumLisa SmythOpinionNow it’s up to one man to find a way out of the Covid rules tangleStormont crisis: We must salvage what we can from the chaos caused by reckless DUP, says Michelle O#Neill PremiumJon TongeOpinionGambling with future of NI politics will never pay off PremiumGrassroots unionists back my calls: DonaldsonMost ReadWatch: Surging waves engulf cars at Benone Strand under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs harvesting the fruits of their hard work and endeavour‘Cost to my health of getting a sunbed tan just wasn’t worth it’: Belfast mum with stage four skin cancer in warning over dangers of melanomaLow number of Queen’s University Belfast academics from a Protestant background a ‘cause for concern’BBC NI rejects Arlene Foster’s claim broadcaster is an ‘opponent’ of the DUPTop VideosPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea Playth anniversary commemoration for  Sean Graham#s bookmakers atrocity on Belfast#s Ormeau RoadPlayFamilies of bookies atrocity vow to fight for justice on th anniversaryLatest Northern IrelandCumberbatch and Colman land Oscar nods as The Power Of The Dog leads the pack‘Government seeking to shut down future ombudsman reports on collusion’Belfast stars Dame Judi Dench and Ciaran Hinds land Oscar nominationsFamilies call for justice after damning police watchdog report on UDA murdersHospitality support payments extended to soft play businessesLatestCumberbatch and Colman land Oscar nods as The Power Of The Dog leads the pack‘Government seeking to shut down future ombudsman reports on collusion’Manchester City trio will be fined for not inviting me, jokes Pep GuardiolaClause that favours children of past pupils ‘epitome of discrimination’Johnson reshuffles ministers as he refuses to apologise for Starmer ‘slur’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

to be introduced at westminster before stormont poll","story":"Campaigners call for Irish language legislation  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueCampaigners call for Irish language legislation By Rebecca Black, PAFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailLegislation around culture, identity and language for Northern Ireland will be introduced at Westminster before the Stormont election, Conor Burns has said.The Northern Ireland Office minister indicated it would be better passed before the poll, so it does not “become a contentious element of what is already going to be a pretty contentious election campaign”.Mr Burns also indicated that in terms of controversial proposals over dealing with the past, the Government is “considering next steps incredibly carefully”.The Stormont parties were unable to agree to introduce cultural and language legislation in the Northern Ireland Assembly which was part of the New Decade New Approachdeal.The plans include an Office of Identity and Cultural Expression to promote respect for ersity as well as an Irish Language Commissioner and a commissioner to develop language, arts and literature associated with the Ulster Scots Ulster British tradition.It is very firmly the Government#s intention that we bring the legislation forward before the electionsConor BurnsThe resignation of First Minister Paul Givan means no new legislation can be introduced at Stormont.Giving evidence to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, Mr Burns said Westminster was committed to actStormont did not.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “The legislation is pretty much ready… it remains our commitment but we’re obviously disappointed it wasn’t taken forward as an NDNA commitment where it sat with the Executive and the Assembly,” he told the committee.“I can’t give you a specic time… the Secretary of State was genuine in his desire to bring it forward by the end of October, we didn’t do that for a iety of reasons, other business, timing, matters politically but we remain committed to the undertaking that we’ve given, that were it not legislated for in Stormont, we will do it here in Westminster and that remains the case.“I think what I can say very candidly is that it is our expectation that this is not going to be passed by Stormont before the end of the mandate and that we are absolutely expecting that we are going to have to do this in Westminster and we remain committed to bringing this legislation forward in Westminster.“I think we can all agree, it is definitely the Government’s view that it would be a good thingthis was completed and didn’t become a contentious element of what is already going to be a pretty contentious election campaign.”Pressed further, Mr Burns said: “It is very firmly the Government’s intention that we bring the legislation forward before the elections.”SDLP MP Claire Hanna referred to a Police Ombudsman report which on Tuesday identied signicant failures and evidence of “collusive behaviours” by police following a probe into murders and attempted murders carried out by the Ulster Defence Associationin south Belfast in the s.Last July, the Government published a command paper outlining its intention to prohibit future prosecutions of military veterans and ex-paramilitaries for Troubles incidents pre-dating April .Contending the criminal justice route was not delivering for victims, the Government said it wanted to move to a new truth recovery model to help bereaved families gain information about the deaths of their loved ones.Mr Burns declined to talk about the Ombudsman report, saying he had not had the opportunity to see it.“On the wider legacy proposals, the Government produced the command paper in July and undertook to listen to responses to that,” he told the committee.“We have listened carefully, it’s a very, very complex area and we remain committed to bringing forward legislation in this area.“We’ve taken time to try and get it right, to test dferent options internally and I think that is the right thing to do.“Almost whatever you do in this space, some people are going to be very unhappy, and in my meetings with those who have been either themselves direct victims of terrorism or have lost loved ones, often decades ago, the pain is as real as the day it happened and they live with it every day and often the one thing they want is the one thing that none of us can give them – that’s their loved one back or the experience they had not have have happened.“The victims must be at the heart of what we’re doing and societal understanding and reconciliation must be the objective of what we’re trying to do.“So we remain absolutely committed that we will bring forward legislation, I can’t say too much about where we are at this precise moment on it but we have been testing very strongly dferent options and we remain committed to publishing the legislation.“We are considering genuinely very carefully at this stage what the next steps should be in advance of bringing forward the legislation.”Most ReadWatch: Surging waves engulf cars at Benone StrandLow number of Queen’s University Belfast academics from a Protestant background a

Credit: Jonathan Porter   Press Eye FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueHealth Minister Robin Swann. Credit: Jonathan Porter   Press EyeFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailJust a few weeks ago, the Executive announced the relaxation of a raft of Covid- safety measures and promised more were on the way.Describing his delight at the development, former First Minister Paul Givan said he hoped the Executive would be in a position to review remaining restrictions this Thursday.Read MoreRobin Swann hopes to lt Covid- restrictions in Northern Ireland but warns ‘both hands tied behind back’ on health reform“The February  date will be an important meeting now for those outstanding measures that are still in place,” he said. In particular, he said he wanted to see the removal of the controversial Covid certicate scheme: “The DUP has been opposed to its introduction, today we’ve made big progress in reducing its application and I want to see further progress.”Throughout the pandemic, a number of DUP members have been high-profile opponents to many of the Covid restrictions — think Sammy Wilson describing face coverings as muzzles and Paul Frew leading the charge against offering vaccinations to children and mandatory vaccination of healthcare workers.DUP politicians have increasingly raised concerns about the effects of restrictions on the economy, apparently keen to lt the measures as soon as possible.However, following Mr Givan’s resignation, it has been left to Robin Swann to find a way to lt remaining restrictions as hospitalisations and deaths linked to the virus begin to drop.Despite all its previous posturing about the damage being caused by the Covid restrictions, it appears the fight to rid Northern Ireland of the Protocol is the priority for the DUP.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up As a result, Mr Swann, like all remaining ministers, is having to navigate a unique environment at Stormont. Firstly, he has to ascertain whether he can remove restrictions without the collective support of the Executive.Then,he gets the green light, it has to be established how this can be achieved. But the headache doesn’t stop there — as Mr Swann pointed out on Monday, Northern Ireland is finally moving out of the latest Covid- surge. With fewer people requiring hospital treatment for a Covid infection, it seemed like NI was inching closer to the point where it could begin the long and onerous task of rebuilding our decimated health service.So, last week’s decision by the DUP to remove Mr Givan from his post has been a hammer blow to the thousands of NHS staff crippled by the ravages of the pandemic and the hundreds of thousands of people waiting for hospital treatment.When Mr Swann on Monday said “our health service urgently needs an end to political point scoring”, he was absolutely right.An inclination to put votes before support for much-needed reform has already caused untold damage to the health service, while waiting lists spiralled after the Assembly collapsed in .Mr Swann had the unenviable task of tackling the issue and he admitted on Monday that it was going to be a signicant challenge. Yet now he is not only in a position where he will be solely responsible for bringing to an end Covid restrictions so detested by many, but, as hundreds of thousands of people languish on hospital waiting lists, he will be able to blame the current political instability for their suffering too.Related topicsRobin SwannThe Executive OfficePaul GivanUlster Unionist PartyPaul FrewMore On Robin SwannSignicant danger from Covid- over ‘to a degree’, claims senior Northern Ireland medic PremiumViewpointOpinionNorthern Ireland’s health at risk after broken vowsCovid-: what are the remaining restrictions in Northern Ireland Robin Swann hopes to lt Covid- restrictions in Northern Ireland but warns ‘both hands tied behind back’ on health reformHealth Minister Robin Swann pressing ahead with plans to ease Covid- regulationsMost ReadWatch: Surging waves engulf cars at Benone StrandLow number of Queen’s University Belfast academics from a Protestant background a ‘cause for concern’‘Cost to my health of getting a sunbed tan just wasn’t worth it’: Belfast mum with stage four skin cancer in warning over dangers of melanoma under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs harvesting the fruits of their hard work and endeavourBBC NI rejects Arlene Foster’s claim broadcaster is an ‘opponent’ of the DUPTop VideosPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea Playth anniversary commemoration for  Sean Graham#s bookmakers atrocity on Belfast#s Ormeau RoadPlayMark Thompson on the browning pistol used in the Sean Graham bookies killingsLatest Northern IrelandCumberbatch and Colman land Oscar nods as The Power Of The Dog leads the pack‘Government seeking to shut down future ombudsman reports on collusion’Belfast stars Dame Judi Dench and Ciaran Hinds land Oscar nominationsFamilies call for justice after damning police watchdog report on UDA murdersHospitality support payments extended to soft play businessesLatestTrain company apologises for overcharging passengers since SaturdayAntonio Conte: I am trying to make Harry Kane better and betterList of the main nominees for the th OscarsJulian Metherell gives his backing to Yorkshire chair Lord Kamlesh PatelFukushima operators send robot into worst-hit nuclear reactor,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A lot of people drive down and park on the beach. It was meant to be after high tide,” she said.“We have enough experience on that beach – you think we’d know better, but we walked up to go and get a coffee and the waves were coming right in, past the coffee area right at the top there.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “All the cars were getting completely swamped, there were a few animal baskets getting dragged away, luckily there were no animals in there, all animals were safe.“It was just crazy.“There were a group of ladies going in for a swim and a few of us were a bit concerned. We were saying ‘Be careful, maybe don’t go in or,you are, maybe don’t go too deep’. Then that surge came in, just before they went into the water, thank goodness, it would have been enough to take them off their feetthey had been in.”Anna said people need to be wary of strong currents.“The pull is so strong back out again,” she added.“That is why we have been putting up messages on social media for people to stay out of the water oryou are going into the water make sure you do an appropriate risk assessment and don’t go in far. I would just say don’t go in, to be honest.“When you first drive down you don’t think it is so bad but the waves out far are really big and they are breaking really big.“We drove round to Portstewart as well and because the waves are breaking so close to shore you can see the size of them.“I know the reports are that it is going to be building all day. Hopefully the surges won’t be coming up quite as far with the tide going out.”Locals said the surging waves can happen frequently.A spokesperson for Maritime and Coast Guard Control based in Bangor said further wave surges were expected into the afternoon yesterday, but the worst had passed.They encouraged the public not to put themselves into danger attempting to capture any photographs, never to turn their back on waves and to “stay high and stay dry”, by keeping away from dangerous and rough sea conditions.Most ReadWatch: Surging waves engulf cars at Benone Strand under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs harvesting the fruits of their hard work and endeavour‘Cost to my health of getting a sunbed tan just wasn’t worth it’: Belfast mum with stage four skin cancer in warning over dangers of melanomaLow number of Queen’s University Belfast academics from a Protestant background a ‘cause for concern’BBC NI rejects Arlene Foster’s claim broadcaster is an ‘opponent’ of the DUPTop VideosPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea Playth anniversary commemoration for  Sean Graham#s bookmakers atrocity on Belfast#s Ormeau RoadPlayFamilies of bookies atrocity vow to fight for justice on th anniversaryLatest Northern IrelandBelfast stars Dame Judi Dench and Ciaran Hinds land Oscar nominationsFamilies call for justice after damning police watchdog report on UDA murdersHospitality support payments extended to soft play businessesSir Kenneth Branagh: Policeman scared ‘bejaysus# out of me after I stole Turkish Delight as a childWatch: Northern Ireland TikTok star India Sasha goes viral with over m views on rock, paper, scissors prank videoLatestClause that favours children of past pupils ‘epitome of discrimination’Johnson reshuffles ministers as he refuses to apologise for Starmer ‘slur’Belfast: The joy of six for Kenneth Branagh as film earns a host of Bafta nominationsNo  insists Guto Harri’s Huawei lobbying was within rulesDriver injured as brick thrown at train,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

collapse of the Executive last week, Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald said Mr Lewis should bring forward the Assembly election.DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson did not specically call for one but said his party were ready to fight an election.Other parties however rejected the idea of an early election, with fears that essential legislation could be stymiedStormont goes into an early period of purdah.Mr Lewis said it was already close enough to the current election period.The Assembly under the new rules can continue to , it#s right we allow MLAs time and space to pass legislation, I#ll be

resolved ahead of Stormont electionEarly Stormont election push follows condemnation of resignation of Paul GivanMeanwhile, a Northern Ireland Office minister has said the resignation of Northern Ireland#s first minister will not fundamentally alter the UK#s negotiations with the EU over the Brexit protocol.Conor Burns also repeated the Government#s call for the DUP to reinstate a first minister following the removal of Paul Givan over what the DUP regards as a lack of progress in negotiations to tackle issues with the protocol.I have to say very candidly that the Government is clear on our intentions with thecommission on the protocol and the withdrawal of the first minister will not fundamentally alter the Government#s determination to carry on engaging with the commission to find resolution, to find solutions to the situation in Northern Ireland, recognising the uniqueness of the position of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom single market but also buttressing against the single market of the European Union in the form of the Irish Republic, he told the Northern Ireland Affairs committee.From a UK Government point of view, in terms of protocol conversations, the plan is clear and the plan is continuing to be played out led by the Foreign Secretary.Mr Burns said the Government profoundly regrets the withdrawal of the first minister and have urged the DUP to get the first minister back in.He said we#ve been here before, but added there is a fundamental dference to the position now as ministers are still in place and the Assembly is still sitting.We have not actually witnessed a collapse of the institutions in the way they had before, he said, adding he noted a degree of positioning ahead of the Assembly elections.He said he believed there would be a very dferent reaction from partiesthey were two or more years away from the next election.Related topicsBrandon LewisMore On Brandon LewisNIO’s office move to city centre

They went through a few phases, allowing their out half to burst through a couple of tackles to score and take a - half time lead.Playing with the conditions in the second half, Ballynahinch started the on the front foot but fell foul of the referee at the breakdown, allowing Lurgan to pin them back in their own .The visiting forwards then went to work, carrying hard and scoring another try.The conversion left the home side  points down, but they hit back almost immediately with some great attacking rugby creating space for Callum McCargo to smash his way over.The game was on the line at this point, but a lack of composure allowed the excellent Lurgan full back to punish weak tackling and score a long range try.Left with a mountain to climb, Ballynahinch once again played some superb rugby with great interplay between centres James Graham and Harvey Campbell creating space for Sam Hamilton to dash for the line.He was stopped short but desperate Lurgan defending saw them receive a yellow card before Matthew McAuley reduced the deficit to five points with a try from a quickly taken penalty.A smash-and-grab victory against  men with only a minute on the clock demanded error-free rugby and after an excellent restart Ballynahinch moved upfield.However a knock-on saw the referee blow his whistle for full time and Lurgan earned a deserved victory.Both sides can be proud and the game was played in a superb spirit with the teams having lunch together in the clubhouse..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Mourne.jpg","title":"Beauty of local landscapes feature in exploration events  ","story":"SEVERAL familiar locations in Downpatrick, Newcastle and Strangford are at the heart of this monthrsquos Northern Ireland Science Festival.There will be a selection of events between February  and  with people across the district encouraged to explore something new as ious venues prepare to play host to a series of stirring events.The so-called STEM celebration mdash which has grown to become the largest of its kind in Ireland mdash boasts more than  events over  days.On February , the St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick is the venue for the Patrick  The Pagan Hills event which provides an opportunity to follow in the footsteps of both the patron saint and pagan in an exploration of the landscape that Patrick himself encountered when he ed to Ireland nearly , years ago.On February  and , the Strangford Activity Centre is hosting a ldquopaddle back in time kayak adventure to Mahee Island following a traditional smuggling route undertaken by Daft Eddie and the Merry Hearts.There will also be an opportunity to discover ruins of the monastic site of Nendrum, le in the monastery in the Middle Ages and the role played by the Vikings in the Strangford Lough area between the th and th centuries.The Strangford Activity Centre is also hosting ldquopaddle with a purpose on February  and  with participants invited to do their bit for the environment by joining a clean-up of Strangford Lough.And ldquoforaging afloat on February  and  at the same venue sees people joining with the Centrersquos Rory Martin and Andrea and Graham Gannon of Peninsula Kelp for a unique guide to the sights and flavour of the area as spring arrives on the lough and with it an array of seasonal wild food.On February , therersquos an opportunity to discover the wonders of the Mournes at a range of festival events.During the Diamond Rock Walking Tour on February , guide Peter Rafferty will explains how to identy erse rock types and how the Mournes were formed, alongside learning about the amazing geology and history of the area at the Geology on the Rocks event on February .The following day, the Men of Mourne ndash Stone  Steel hiking tour takes place with an opportunity to hear stories of hardship and endurance as participants take to rocky mountain tracks.During the Mourne Stone Walling ndash A Granite Kingdom event, therersquos a chance to experience the beauty and hard graft behind the ,-year-old craft of dry-stone wall building. A date for the event has yet to be confirmed.On February  at the Newcastle Community Cinema, Film Hub NI is inviting families to a special screening of lsquoThe Snail and the Whalersquo, a joyous, empowering story about the natural wonders of the world and discovering that no matter how small you are, you can make a dference.And to coincide with this special screening, NI Science Festival has organised an interactive seashore adventure with Beach Schools NI which will take place a short walk from the cinema and is included in the ticket price.Festival director, Chris McCreery, said the event exists to engage audiences, stimulate discussion, and ignite interest in the wonders of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.ldquoWe are confident that this yearrsquos erse programming will expand the horizons of festival goers of all ages and abilities across Northern Ireland, he added.The Science Festival is supported by the Department for the Economy, Belfast City Council, Tourism NI, Derry City and Strabane Council, Queenrsquos University,Ulster University, British Council Northern Ireland, MCS Group, The Open University NI, Innovate UK, Matrix NI, Film Hub NI and Arts and Business NI..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_CD.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  February 5%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash The Downe Hospital has been identied as the possible site of a new police station in Downpatrick.The Police Authority has expressed an interest in the large site in a move which would pave the way for the construction of a new Downe Hospital, utilising Lecale House and the Maternity Hospital as the core buildings on the Ardglass Road.The present Downe Hospital, medical assessment unit and nurses home would then be completely demolished to make way for a new police base.Police Authority officials toured the hospital complex before Christmas and are reported to be impressed with both the size of the site and its central location.The officials have also held informal discussions with representatives of the Eastern Health Board who are also believed to be attracted to the plan.The revenue generated by the sale of the massive complex would go a long way to paying for the construction of a new hospital which politicians have called for on numerous occasions.A spokeswoman for the Police Authority said it is not normal policy to comment on such matters, and she added that there is still a commitment to build a new police base on the Ballydugan Road.Although the Authority has obtained outline planning permission for the Ballydugan Road site, it is believed that the nature of the land and the potential size of the highly fortied station is causing concern.Publicly the Authority is pressing ahead with plans to build there, but behind the scenes it has continued to look at possible sites in ious town locations.The Downe Hospital has now emerged as the surprise front-runner although evensuch an ambitious plan is approved, it will be many years before a police station is operational on the site.ARDGLASS ndash A special sub-committee has been set up by Down District Council to consider the European Communityrsquos review of the common fisheries policy.The committee is to be empowered to provide a response to the document.Ardglass SDLP councillor, Mr Dermot Curran, said some of the systems that were being introduced by the EC are not very helpful to the people employed in the fishing industry. Others were, such as decommissioning, but are not being put into action.ldquoIn all of these schemes there is nothing to protect the people employed in the industry. Government must do something to help the plight of these people, said Mr Curran.He complained that these workers are treated as casual labour with no claim to redundancy or national assistance.ldquoThe fishing industry plays a very important part in the economy of Northern Ireland and we must protect it and the people who work in it. Government should set up systems to ensure that everybody is treated fairly, he said.Ulster Unionist, Mr Gerry Douglas, said something has to be done to assist and to at least ensure that the processing industry is retained in Down District.KILLINCHY ndash The  new jobs announced by the Northern Ireland Spinners group as part of a pound.m investment will have no direct impact on its Killinchy factory.A spokesman for the company explained following Thursdayrsquos official announcement that the expansion of the firmrsquos sister factory in Newtownards will have no adverse impact on the Killinchy operation.ldquoThey are sister factories, both concentrating on very similar yarns, he said.ldquoWe have already completed major expansions at Killinchy, virtually replacing all the machinery we had. Killinchy is a very modern mill, as modern as Newtownards, he added.Mr Ray Dinsdale, chief executive of Richards Plc, the Aberdeen-based parent company of Northern Ireland Spinners, said: ldquoThis investment will strengthen the position of Northern Ireland Spinners as the largest United Kingdom spinner of semi-worsted yarns for carpet manufacturers.ldquoOur strategy is based on the expansion of the business into Europe, and the investment will mean that Northern Ireland Spinners will be of the size required to enable it to offer the economies of scale and cost reductions which are required to win business from major carpet manufacturers in these competitive markets, added Mr Dinsdale.CROSSGAR ndash Crossgarrsquos loss has been Bangorrsquos gain with a -job factory picking up an important quality certication.The firm of Dunn and CompanyLtd. was set up in Crossgar in , and it has now picked up the BS quality certication.After four years of trading, the company relocated from its premises in Crossgar to a factory unit based in Balloo industrial estate, Bangor.It manufacturers special purpose valves and precision components for industrial application with  per cent of it business going to the export market.It currently employs  people and has plans for further expansion, explained Mr Ron Dunn, managing director.When asked why the company left Crossgar, Mr Ron Dunn, managing director said: ldquoThere was not enough room in Crossgar.ldquoWe occupied part of the premises of my brother, Sam, but there was just nothing available in the Crossgar area at that time when we employed three of four people.His brother continues his own successful firm manufacturing machine tools on the Saintfield Road, Crossgar.BISHOPSCOURT ndash Planning Service officials have been urged to attend next monthrsquos first bike race at the former Bishopscourt base ndash before reaching a decision on a planning application for a permanent circuit.The plea has been made this week by local SDLP councillor, Mr John Ritchie.ldquoI would expect they will understand the necessity to attend to make an informed judgement on the matter, explained Mr Ritchie.ldquoAfter that date I would hope a decision would not be long delayed.Mr Ritchie said he had read the petition against the proposed race track and seen the comments of those members of the Ballyhornan Development Association who support the proposal. He had also read the details given by the two developers.ldquoThere are a number of issues involved. I understand that there can be up to  meetings without planning permission per year the equivalent of one a month and two a month in two summer months. I would have thought this wasnrsquot unreasonable.SAINTFIELD ndash The centre of Saintfield was sealed off for three hours on Friday afternoon after the discovery of a suspicious package in a telephone box.The area around Crossgar Road and Toddrsquos Hill was closed as army bomb disposal experts carried out an examination of the device.The device which consisted of cassettes, a battery pack and wires, was described as an elaborate hoax and was taken away for examination.NEWCASTLE ndash Mentally handicapped people from all over Northern Ireland will soon be benefitting from a remarkable transformation at Newcastlersquos Ruby House.For the past year passers-by have seen the conversion of the Bryansford Road complex from a row of not-so-attractive seaside resort houses into aspacious and modern residential home which now offers accommodation for  mentally handicapped adults.This year the holiday home is expected to provide upwards of  holidays for mentally handicapped people from all over the Province.The Ruby House Group now has three centres in Newcastle, including a converted house in Main Street and the purpose-built Mary Murray House in the Lawnfield.STRANGFORD ndash A single Strangford Lough management committee is to be launched in the spring by the Environment Department.It will consist of about  representatives of lough users, the community around the lough and those with specialist knowledge of the area.This weekrsquos announcement reflects some of the views expressed by the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Association the body which was set up a few years ago in protest against restrictive DoE proposals.The new body will have the development of management proposals for the lough area as its main task.

Connor Kelly had a chance for the visitors, but Celtic Bhoysrsquo goalkeeper, Nathan Curran, was on form and saved.It was a balanced game as both sides had their chances with Killoughrsquos Kevin Groves coming close in the th minute and Celtic Bhoysrsquo Jordan McCoubrey pushing forwarding search of an opportunity in front of the net.Killoughrsquos Gareth George had to be subbed due to an injury on his ankle and Declan Looney came on in the rd minute of the game. Jack McLaughlin had a one on one chance facing Curran, but the ball went straight at the lsquokeeper before it was cleared.The visitors were keeping up the pressure to level the score, with a surging run up the left wing from Looney, who passed across to find Connor Kelly, but again Nathan Curran saved.The second goal of the game came from a similar scenario to the first ndash a lacklustre kick out that found the feet of Jay Gibney again and Celtic Bhoys went two up going into half-time.Two errors by Killoughrsquos goalkeeper saw the hosts leading at half-time and all of the play was going down the right side of the field.Killough signalled their intentions that the game was not over, as Declan Looney looped the ball into the danger zone, and Nathan Curran somehow got his hand to it to push over the bar.Jay Gibney was set for his hat-trick in the th minute when the Killough custodian came out to stop him in his tracks. Gibney managed to manoeuvre round him, but the ball was cleared by Sean Burns. Celtic Bhoys had another chance to go three up, as three of their players from a free-kick stood looking at one another and the chance went a miss.Killoughrsquos Declan Burns played a great ball from the middle of the field to Declan Looney, who found team-mate Daniel Taggart. The striker saw his shot saved, but the rebound fell to Kevin Groves, who finished to bring his side back into the game with  minutes to go.Celtic Bhoys made a couple of substitutes in the next ten minutes, with Sean McMahon going up front and Sean Ferris ping back into midfield.As the clock ticked to the th minute, Killoughrsquos McLaughlin fired in a free-kick to the head of Eamon Gargan.However, man of the match Nathan Curran pushed the ball at full stretch over the bar.In the final five minutes of play it was all attack by Killough. Kevin Groves had a chance which was denied with Declan Looney quickly following up, although there was no way to find the leveller. It was in the last minute that the Killough goalkeeper made a clearance mistake that saw Shaun Megahey score to break Killough hearts.Celtic Bhoys will be very happy with the win, while Killough will count their missed chances. Nathan Curran made the dference in a tight game, and Killoughrsquos young Crangle will have learnt a lot from the contest for the remaining matches of the season.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, R Fitzpatrick, M Rice, C Doherty, B Tracey, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: E Kelly for P Casey, S McMahon for J McCoubrey, S Ferris for Conaill Kerr.Killough FC: J Crangle, R Burns, E Gargan, C Burns, S Og Burns, D Burns, C Kelly, G George, D Taggart, K Groves, J McLaughlin.Subs: D Looney for G George, K Tierney, C Doyle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Wave.jpg","title":"It’s like a little  safe haven here%2C somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged  ","story":"TEARS still spring easily to the eyes of Dympna Kerr, the sister of Columba McVeigh, one of the lsquoDisappearedrsquo victims.Once she begins to talk about her  year-old brother, whose body has never been recovered after he was abducted and murdered by the IRA in , after nearly  years of dealing with his loss the pain remains.Last weekend, the Donaghmore woman left her home in St Helenrsquos in Merseyside to travel to a welcoming building in the coastal village of Killough.At the newly named Wave By The Sea centre in Castle Street, Dympna spent precious time speaking with longstanding friends who are also relatives of the Disappeared. The main dference is that they have been fortunate to locate the bodies of their loved one. Several searches have yet toher brotherrsquos remains to the family but they remain hopeful.ldquoItrsquos like a little safe haven here, somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged. The people you are crying to know why you are crying as they understand, explained Dympna about her lasting need to connect with people with shared experience.ldquoGoing to the Wave house in Belfast is like going home. Itrsquos like getting a hug as soon as you go across the door. And itrsquos the same here as Irsquove already been several times.The help and support of the iniduals who make up the Wave Trauma Centre quietly helps thousands of people like Dympna who have been bereaved, injured and or traumatised by the decades of conflict in Northern Ireland.The building has been provided by the local trustees of The Kinder Project, a charitable Dutch organisation that began its association with Northern Ireland in the s for the education and social welfare of disadvantaged children and young adults.The hostel now provides residential breaks for a maximum of  people, providing rooms for families and iniduals, who use the time to break away from their lives still traumatised and dealing with the physical and emotional aftermath.Counselling and complimentary therapy sessions are offered and other courses are provided by Wave to help those who come, many of whom have never sought help before.Itrsquos the sixth centre around the province that Wave has established, along with r satellite projects, with support funding from the Victims and Support Service, NI Executive, Special EU Programmes Body and charitable donations.One of the Troubles survivors who wished the service had been available locally for him and his family is Killough man Peter Heathwood.Peter knows the benefit of support from Wave. In September  he was left paralysed after a Loyalist gun attack in his Belfast home as he played with his youngest daughter in his living room mdash bullets missing the baby by inches.His attack was witnessed by his late we and two eldest children. His father Hubert died from a heart attack at the scene when he saw his apparently dead son.As a member of the Wave Injured Group, he has campaigned for years for a state pension for people left physically or psychologically injured from the conflict.He has yet to receive his pension, even though he applied for it last autumn.ldquoI had to travel to Belfast night and day and only discovered Wave when I went on to the Victimsrsquo Forum years after my shooting, said Peter.ldquoMy we died at  with a diagnosis of PTSD and suffered with flashbacks. If I had found Wave earlier, I reckon it could have saved her as she could have met other women and shared stories and experiences.ldquoWhen I was shot, I passed out but she saw me lying there with blood pumping out of me, children screaming and my father dying. She could never deal with the fact that she opened the door to the gunmen. But I told her thatshe hadnrsquot have shouted a warning to me, I would have been dead as I was able to get up and slam the door.ldquoEven in this village, there are people who moved from Belfast and a lot of them lost relatives in the Troubles, uncles, fathers, grandfathers and many of them never speak about it. I didnrsquot really talk about it to my own children as you didnrsquot want them to be filled with hate.Peter said that even on holiday when people asked what happened to him, he would say he was injured skiing in the French Alps, a more sanitised version of his attack mdash purportedly in mistake for another man mdash as he enjoyed an evening at home with his family.ldquoWave is a fantastic organisation. We are completely cross-community. Everyone has been hurt by all groups and thatrsquos the great strength of it, said Peter.ldquoI would really encourage anyone who has affected by the Troubles and has never sought help to come along to Wave. Itrsquos never too late to talk.Waversquos chief executive officer, Sandra Peake, says that the new centre will help  people in the immediate area and around  from the district, in addition to providing weekend residential breaks from families across Northern Ireland, Britain and the Irish Republic.ldquoThis wouldnrsquot have been possible without the generosity of the Kinder Project, explained Sandra, who said that the building has been fitted out to reflect a more comfortable family style accommodation.ldquoWe had initially done some work in Downpatrick about  years ago to see what we could have provided but have always been keen to provide a local base, which Kinder has now provided to us.ldquoThe welcome from the people and the shopkeepers of Killough has been brilliant. They seem to know why our visitors are staying here and give them a respectful place and go beyond and above to help them.ldquoSome of the families have enjoyed paddle boarding lessons on the water with children experiencing this type of activity for the first time. One grandmother got to sleep in a bed for the first time in years as she normally sleeps on the couch to let her grandchildren have the bed.Wave By The Sea is much more than a weekend or holiday break.ldquoWe aim to provide a holistic service here for people. It will start with an outreach case worker working with you to establish what your needs are and then that moves us into seeing what we can provide, whether its counselling, physiotherapy, group support and so on, Sandra continued.ldquoSeventy per cent of Waversquos work is service provision, the remainder is trauma education. We have a whole range of short trauma courses now and we hope to run courses her.ldquoThey deal with how trauma affects families, recognising the impact of trauma and how to build resilience, the intergenerational impact and issues such as trauma addiction as we would see people with issues. We also provide trauma education for healthcare professionals and student doctors, nurses, and social workers.She predicts an increase of demand for services as new referrals increased last year in part due to interest in the Injured Pension scheme and the proposed Legacy proposals.ldquoThe majority of people coming to us now have never gone anyway for help. But dferent things are stirring memories. We hope to provide counselling and complementary therapy sessions in Newcastle within a few months.Sandra is recruiting a Health and Wellbeing caseworker who would be based in Killough but would also work in the Newcastle area and stressed that all services were provided on a confidential basis.One of the trustees of the Kinder Project, local man Dr Finbar McCormick, is delighted that the building is being used by Wave.ldquoKinder was a Dutch charity that took children from troubled areas to Holland in the s and then established a local centre in Killough for breaks, he explained. ldquoChildren from other troubled spots like Kosovo and the Balkans were also taken for holidays here over the years.ldquoWith the peace process, the need for the Kinder House just fell away and we were looking for another group to pass it onto so that they could make good use of it.ldquoI happened to meet Peter, who I know, one day while out for a walk and I said to him that we really needed to find another group to use the hostel. Peter said that he would mention it to Wave and that was about  months and Wave has been using it for the last six months.ldquoIt was an excellent choice for us as we really wanted to keep the place going and Wave will continue the same aims that Kinder had.To apply for the caseworker position or to access services, visit Wave www.wavetraumacentre.org.uk or ring   ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2022_Kilcoo.jpg","title":"Kilcoo set for Croker  ","story":"KILCOO are officially back to back All-Ireland Senior Club Championship finalists after a gruelling clash with Cork side, St Finbarrrsquos, was dramatically settled in extra-time on Saturday.In a thoroughly entertaining contest that had twist after twist, Mickey Moranrsquos men eventually booked their place to contend for the Andy Merrigan Cupwhich has agonisingly eluded the local outfit over the last few years.With the headlines seemingly written in the dying seconds of regulation time, Kilcoorsquos Paul Devlin steadied his frame to send the deciding free between the posts.However, a moment of off-the-ball madness from team-mate Aidan Branagan resulted in a sending off and a further  minutes of added drama.Despite this, the Magpies showed their stamina and experience within this competition and managed to finish comfortably five points adrt from their opponents.The scene was set at a mild Portlaoise venue as sunshine attempted to split through the clouds and past the overshadowing OrsquoMoore Park spectator stands where the Ulster and Munster champions prepared to lock horns.Although the local side won referee Brendan Cawleyrsquos throw-in, it would be The Barrrsquos who would open the scoring from a Cillian Myers-Murray effort.Kilcoo replied rapidly through the reliable Ryan Johnston, who navigated his way past the opposing defence to curl one over the bar to level the tie.The Magpies would soon be soaring when they immediately turned over possession and saw an opportunity for the first goal of the match.Jerome Johnston cleverly spotted his brother, Ryan, and played a quick hand pass into his path where he made no mistake in burying his effort into the top left corner of the net beyond the ing Barrrsquosrsquo custodian, John Kerins.Despite this early blow, the Cork-based outfit remained determined and went on the offensive.Eoin McGreevy took the mark and kicked over before receiving a yellow card for a high tackle on Ryan Johnston.Kilcoorsquos Conor Laverty was rewarded for his tireless work ethic in the form of winning a free, although team-mate Paul Devlin saw his effort uncharacteristically drt wide from what was a very straightforward chance.Colin Lyons was the latest to enter Cawleyrsquos book with  minutes played following a late tackle on Niall Branagan that left the Kilcoo number two worse for wear.Steven Sherlock successfully converted his first of ten frees for The Barrrsquos to bring his side to within a point, but Laverty answered this with a score from play to widen the winning margin once more.St Finbarrrsquos were notably the physically bigger side and it was clear they were initiating a rougher style of play.This was evident after Sherlock again split the posts from a free, when Kilcoorsquos Ceilum Doherty looked to reply and instead was clattered by defender Sam Ryan.This time, Devlin made no mistake with his attempt which would have helped settle his nerves from his earlier miss.Sherlock pointed his third free of the match in retaliation in what was now a tit for tat contest.However, The Barrrsquos managed to swing the tie hugely in their favour when Kilcoorsquos Daryl Branagan forfeited possession close to his goal and the onrushing Eoin Comyns took full advantage.The Barrrsquos number nine quickly passed to team-mate Sherlock, who set up McGreevy for their sidersquos first goal of the match.Despite the efforts of Kilcoo lsquokeeper Niall Kane, McGreevy managed to creep his shot round the custodian to fire his team into the lead minutes before half-time.With seconds to the interval, Denis OrsquoBrien received a yellow to join the growing list of his St Finbarrrsquos team-mates to go into the refereersquos book.As the whistle sounded, both sides engaged in some roughhousing as tensions reached fever pitch.Half time: St Finbarrrsquos - Kilcoo -.The Barrrsquos won the second half throw-in and went on the attack through a surging Sherlock run that resulted in a free - which he duly converted.This sprung The Magpies into action with rising star Shealan Johnston running past three defenders before kicking over the bar for a magnicent solo point.

Tourism currently represents a considerable percentage of Northern Ireland’s GDP, but unsightly rural roads and hedgerows are unlikely to inspire atrip and can damage the perception of our region.”David Brown, Deputy President of Ulster Farmers’ Union said illegal dumping is an increasing issue in rural areas: “Fly-tipping is a scourge on the countryside and one that too many of our farmers have experienced first-hand. Dumping unwanted waste in rural areas is dangerous to human health and harmful to livestock and wildle. In the past, there have been issues where fly-tipping waste polluted watercourses and contaminated land.“When unwanted content is dumped on a farmer’s land, it becomes the responsibility of the landowner to dispose of, while local councils are left to take ownership of waste on public land and highways. This is both costly and time consuming for farmers and ratepayers.“Since the pandemic began, the amount of litter being dumped on farmers’ land has increased, with many rediscovering the outdoors for recreation. I urge all countryside visitors to be more considerate of those living locally, and of animals and to commit to taking their waste home with them.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

After waiting for three golfers to complete the hole they moved on locating their first stile in woodland which led into fields containing sheep as the sun put in an appearance.A descent led them to the ruined buildings and old stable block at Cefncarnau-fawr along with a mysterious ivy clad ruined building, where they deviated along a narrow muddy track in woodland to enter fields, where boots crunched over frozen uneven mud as they approached a stile leading into Coed-y-wenallt.A wide wet and muddy pathway populated with dog walkers led them to a wooden footbridge and across the fast flowing Nant Cwm Nofydd for the climb up to Rhiwbina Hill and a short road walk before turning into Fforestganol.A steep climb past water gushing down the bare hillside in small waterfalls led them through Heol y Forest and along a rough track carpeted with autumnal leaves with shadows of the surrounding bare trees silhouetted on the ground. Then downhill through part of Fforest-fawr where natural resources like limestone, coal and haematite, an iron rich mineral which were abundant in this area were mined. So many of the hollows and mounds to be found within the woodland are the result of shallow workings and spoil tips, many of which are now hidden beneath vegetation.The path eventually brought them out at the bottom of the main driveway leading uphill to Castell Coch, or the red castle and stopping to utilise fallen tree trunks for seating, they enjoyed morning refreshments whilst gazing at the fairy tale castle. Actually built on the remains of a th century castle this th century Gothic style folly, standing above the steep Taff gorge was built by William Burgess for the rd Marquis of Bute, although sadly Burgess died ten years before the project was complete..removeRefreshed, another climb led them uphill and further into Fforest-fawr where they descended a wide pathway to the valley bottom to join part of the Taff Trail along the flat disused railway line. Then another climb, this time on narrow muddy pathways through bracken to zig zag gradually uphill to the open hillside overlooking Taffs Well and Gwaelod y Garth in the valley below and up through the Taff valley towards Rhydfelin and Pontypridd.The last haul brought them to the summit of Craig yr Allt with its panoramic views including towards its sister hill the Garth and the reward of a sit down for lunch under overcast skies, whilst gazing towards the coast at Penarth Head and out across the misty Bristol Channel. Continuing along the ridge and making their descent to a road, a short journey led them back into fields containing passive horses as they trekked through mud to Waun-waelod.One last climb up through a waterlogged narrow track between bramble bushes led them out onto Caerphilly Common as the sun ed, for the short climb to the trig point at m on Caerphilly Mountain to enjoy the views over Caerphilly in the valley below with its ruined castle clearly visible.All that was left was the short descent passing many other people who were out with dogs and children enjoying the afternoon sunshine and views, to make their way back to their start point after a lovely . mile undulating tramp.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We met local women traders and the Chamber of Commerce, as well as MPs from countries across Africa and other key figures. There were lots of discussions about how they view the UK and our mutual partnerships going forward, how we tackle global challenges, and how we fight for human rights and gender justice together.After arriving back in the early hours, I was then straight back into Westminster for anFriday sitting in Parliament – a very important one – as I joined other MPs to support my colleague Rosie Cooper MP’s British Sign Language Bill, which aims to make BSL an official language of the UK.I had a chance to thank local BSL interpreters and deaf community activists, saying: “I add my wholehearted support to this Bill. Like many hon. Members, I have campaigners in my own constituency, such as Stuart Parkinson, an activist for the deaf community with Cardf Deaf Centre, but I also pay tribute to the work of the Association of British Sign Language Teachers and Assessors.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe Headingley outfit were set to hold an extraordinary general meeting on Wednesday which was seen as key in bringing about a culture of change in the wake of the Azeem Rafiq racism crisis, that resulted in the England and Wales Cricket Board taking away the club’s rights to host international matches.It had to be cancelled after the club discovered it had not properly called the meeting, with a Yorkshire statement insisting the former leadership had failed to file amended club rules with the Financial Conduct Authority that would allow for an EGM to be called by electronic means and not just by post.Ex-chair Robin Smith told the Yorkshire Post the same failing meant Lord Patel’s chairmanship of the club was invalid, which resulted in the current chair hitting out at a group of iniduals who are “actively seeking to delay and derail the essential reforms” required, with a legal dispute now ongoing.Metherell appeared in front of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee on Tuesday to discuss the support the PCA provided for Rafiq and when asked about recent events at Yorkshire, he said: “We only know what we read in the press and what Lord Patel has said butthey are accurate, it is abhorrent and totally obstructive.“Frankly these are some of the great barriers we face in trying to make cricket a more inclusive place for the game we love.“These minorities cannot prevail, they won’t win and with your support, and the support of the other key stakeholders, we have got to drive this out of the game. There is no place for it in cricket.”PCA chief executive Rob Lynch had earlier been drawn on the issue by DCMS committee chair Julian Knight during the parliamentary session.“This is Yorkshire County Cricket Club, one of,not the most, famous cricket club in the world, and to watch these events unfold is extremely saddening,” Lynch said..remove“I think the progress Lord Patel is trying to put in place is absolutely the right direction and as we have hopefully shown this morning our objective is to move forward.“I am not across the detail in regard to what the members are doing, the small group of iniduals.“Our focus in Yorkshire is the current players up there and ensuring their welfare and we are spending a lot of time up there because there is a group of iniduals very uncertain about what is going on around them. That is where we will maintain our focus within the environment.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Julian Metherell gives his backing to Yorkshire chair Lord Kamlesh Patel article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe England captain has found a new lease of le under the Italian after a dismal start to the season, scoring seven goals in his last  games in all competitions.Kane’s poor form at the beginning of the campaign was down to a contribution of factors, including his summer exertion in Euro  with England, the disappointment of seeing a move to Manchester City fall through and the tactics of former boss Nuno Espirito Santo, which totally nullied his goal threat.So good to be back out there! A good cup tie and perfect way to start a busy run of games. 💪 pic HtfvaKRCr— Harry KaneFebruary , However, he is looking back to his best under Conte and has credited the Italian with improving both his physical condition and the mindset around the club.Conte has called the -year-old “world class” but wants to take him to a new level.“Surely when you have a player like Harry, you have to try to involve him in your tactical idea of football,” Conte said.“He’s an important player for us and he has to be a point of reference when we develop our football offensively.“We’re trying to work with him in many aspects. I think every single player can improve until he decides to stop his career.“We’re talking about a really good person who shows desire every day in training. He’s available for his team-mates and is always ready to speak about football, to improve and to see new tactical situations.“I repeat: We’re talking about a world-class striker and I’m trying to help him to become also better and better. Me, my staff on the physical aspect are working – but not only with him, with all the team.A Man of the Match performance. ✨👏 @HKane pic jLNdUpYz— Tottenham HotspurFebruary , “To reduce the gap, it’s very important to improve every single player in many aspects..remove“If this player is Kane we’re talking about a world-class striker, but it’s the same withScarlett. We have to improve every single player in this way to be more competitive as a team than before.”Kane scored one goal in nine Premier League games under Nuno and also took a month under Conte to start firing.But the Italian was never in any doubt about his striker’s quality.“Honestly I wasn’t worried before in the past when he didn’t score a lot,” Conte said.“Because his performance was always very, very high, he played very well in every game for the team, he worked a lot for the team and is a fantastic player for me.“He’s not selfish but now that he’s scoring I’m happy for him and the team. Becausehe scores we have more probability to get three points or go to the next round in a trophy competition.“As I said to you before, in the past his performances were very, very, very positive for me, despite him not scoring a lot in the past.“We’re talking about a world-class striker. He’s able to score in every game. We’ve also to try to help him to score.” vw,vw,px, px\"Eric Dier is out injured with a thigh problem Kane will be hoping to continue his scoring streak against Southampton on Wednesday, but Spurs will be without Eric Dier, Oliver Skipp and Japhet Tanganga.Dier is still out with a recurring thigh injury which troubled him before the recent winter break.Conte said: “He had the same problems that he had in the past before playing the last game against Cha. He had a little muscular problem in his thigh.“It’s not serious but the problem is in the same place as the last time, so for this reason the doctors told me to be patient and not to take risks with him.“It’s a pity because you know the importance of this player to us.”On Skipp, who has a groin injury, Conte added: “Honestly I hope to have him back very soon. The medical department said to me two weeks but I hope to have him available in one week or  days maximum.“For this reason I try to push my medical department because we need Skipp to be available.

Patience, it is said, brings its own rewards, and for me it did. It’s how I received my limited knowledge of cooking, like stew. I learned that a pinch of salt enhanced its flavour. Salt has many uses, medicinal, preserving food etc. It was its preservative qualities that made it such a sought-after commodity thousands of years ago. Wars have been fought over salt and some Roman soldiers would have even receive salt as their wages.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Alan MIllarBasically, He was telling them that they were the means whereby the world would be flavoured by God’s love, grace, mercy, compassion, kindness, and forgiveness. In other words, they were to be just like Him. That is how they would add flavour to the lives of people with whom they shared the gospel. The fruits of the spirit, according to the apostle Paul, emanates from God’s love, which we read about in  Corinthians :-b, where he explains how the love of God affects us, and others. First, he tells us that love ‘is patient, love is kind’. Then he tells us what it is not – ‘it is not proud, boastful, doesn’t lie’, and much, much more. What Paul is describing is God’s pure love and it is that kind of love we are to show to the world, to add flavour to the lives of others, to be the salt of the earth. But its preserving qualities are perhaps what the church is all about, because the soul of mankind is rotting through sin and depravity. The quality of salt, spiritually speaking, can ensure that the corruption of the world does not contaminate the church, and the church, while it remains, ensures that society will not decay until Christ comes again. Christians, as the salt of the earth, are vitally important in God’s plans for mankind’s redemption. May all who follow Christ be salt in our homes, communities, places of work, wherever we meet others, and let others taste and see that the Lord is good.Jesus  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularCookstown teacher driving Mercedes caught for speeding...NewsWoman passes away after Glengormley collision...NewsMasked men set home and car on fire in Carnlough...NewsProposed Carn petrol station could attract more than , v...NewsDiamond Centre evacuated...NewsMost PopularBest sofa beds UK : the most comfortable sofas that conv...RecommendedSofas UK: best sofas and couches to furnish your home, whate...RecommendedValentine’s flower delivery UK : roses, Lego, MS - best...RecommendedBest baby car seats UK : best toddler car seats from bir...Recommended best backpacking tents UK : lightweight, one-person te...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

In addition, I learnt on my very first business conference I attended in London over  years ago when I speak I am doing so through the filters of my understanding, and you hear it through the filters of your understanding. Adam Harbinson.Maybe not a great example, but I heard a very funny story the other day, which demonstrates. Old Jimmy overheard a conversation between a young couple as they dined in a restaurant. The man gazed lovingly into the young lady and said, ‘Darling, when I look into your eyes, time stands still’. Well, Jimmy thought that would really impress his Maggie, so later that evening as they feasted on a hastily purchased fish supper, he decided to repeat what he had heard the young man say, and so he looked into Maggie’s bloodshot eyes and whispered:‘Maggie, your face would stop a clock’.Like me, Jimmy knew exactly what he meant, but in the words of the Jim Croce song, ‘Every time I tried to tell you the words just came out wrong...’There’s a much misunderstood quotation in the New Testament where Jesus gave his disciples a ‘new commandment’. It was not another commandment, but properly understood it was to replace all the other  that had morphed out of Moses’ . He said, ‘I am giving you a new commandment: Love each other, just as I have loved you.’So how do we love each other  Is it just by words that can be so easily misunderstood  I don’t think so, I like to think of the word ‘love’ as a verb and not a noun, it’s an action word, reminiscent of the words attributed to Francis of Assisi. ‘Preach at all times, andyou have to, use words’.Actions always speak louder.Read More Read MoreRead more newsJesusLondon  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularCookstown teacher driving Mercedes caught for speeding...NewsWoman passes away after Glengormley collision...NewsMasked men set home and car on fire in Carnlough...NewsProposed Carn petrol station could attract more than , v...NewsDiamond Centre evacuated...NewsMost PopularBest sofa beds UK : the most comfortable sofas that conv...RecommendedSofas UK: best sofas and couches to furnish your home, whate...RecommendedValentine’s flower delivery UK : roses, Lego, MS - best...RecommendedBest baby car seats UK : best toddler car seats from bir...Recommended best backpacking tents UK : lightweight, one-person te...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Currently the Northern Ireland Executive can’t meet following the resignation of First Minister, Paul Givan, last week. The last remaining restrictions were due to be discussed at an Executive meeting on Thursday. However, Mr Swann said he was not prepared to allow a failure of politics to get in the way of lting now unnecessary restrictions. I am now seeking that legal guidance on how I myself can replace the bulk of the remaining restrictions,not all of them, with clear guidance and advice, he said on Monday afternoon. When we had an executive, ministers always said we wouldnt retain restrictions for a day longer than necessary, so that same logic should still apply. While we must move forward carefully, we cant stay locked in emergency restrictions forever. We need to start getting normal back.
