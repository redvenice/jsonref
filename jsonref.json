Prosecutors also showed video of Floyd inside the Cup Foods store before police were called, in which he appeared agitated, distracted and potentially under the influence of drugs.   The second week of the trial was dominated by technical testimony, beginning with senior Minneapolis Police Department officials, including Chief Medaria Arradondo, who testified that Chauvin violated department policy when he restrained Floyd for nine minutes and 29 seconds. Police officials testified that while officers might sometimes use a knee across a person\u0027s back or shoulder to gain or maintain control, they\u0027re also taught the specific dangers for a person in Floyd\u0027s position - prone on his stomach, with his hands cuffed behind him - and how such a person must be turned into a side recovery position as soon as possible. Later in the prosecutors called a string of medical experts to testify that Floyd died due to a lack of oxygen, not from a primary cardiac event. Some of the most powerful testimony came from Dr Martin Tobin, a lung and critical care specialist who told jurors that other factors, not just Chauvin\u0027s knee, made it hard for Floyd to breathe: officers lifting up his handcuffs, the hard pavement, his turned head and a knee on his back. Tobin pinpointed the moment when he said he could see Floyd take his last breath - and said Chauvin\u0027s knee remained on Floyd\u0027s neck another 3 minutes, two seconds. \u0027At the beginning, you can see he\u0027s conscious, you can see slight flickering, and then it disappears,\u0027 Tobin said as he highlighted a still image from police body-camera video. \u0027That\u0027s the moment the life goes out of his body.\u0027  The state rested its case on April 13, at which point all eyes turned to Chauvin\u0027s attorney Nelson. The defense case: Chauvin\u0027s attorneys called just seven witnesses to shift blame away from the ex-cop and onto Floyd\u0027s drug use and health problems  At the center of Nelson\u0027s defense was the argument that Floyd\u0027s death was not caused by Chauvin\u0027s actions but by outside factors - namely Floyd\u0027s drug addiction and underlying health conditions, including a bad heart.  Nelson made two other key arguments: that use of force is an unattractive but essential component of policing, and that the hostile crowd that surrounded Chauvin and fellow officers as they restrained Floyd had distracted them from proper procedure and care.      Nelson called just seven witnesses over two days of testimony. He began by showing the jury video from Floyd\u0027s arrest on May 6, 2019, in an effort to portray that he had a history of feigning medical distress and rapidly ingesting pills when confronted by police through testimony by an officer and a paramedic involved in that arrest. The next two witnesses - Minneapolis Park Police Officer Peter Chang and Floyd\u0027s friend Shawanda Hill - spoke about what they saw on the day of Floyds death as the court was shown new body-camera footage of the chaos. The sixth witness was Barry Brodd, a former cop and use-of-force expert who testified that Chauvin did not use deadly force against Floyd. In fact, Brodd argued that Chauvin\u0027s placing the handcuffed black man in the prone position and kneeling on his neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds did not constitute use of force at all.  \u0027It\u0027s a control technique. It doesn\u0027t hurt,\u0027 Brodd said. \u0027It\u0027s safe for the officer, safe for the suspect and you\u0027re using minimal effort to keep them on the ground.\u0027 During direct examination by Nelson, Brodd said Chauvin was \u0027justified\u0027 and acting \u0027with objective reasonableness\u0027 in his interactions with Floyd.  He also leaned in to the defense narrative that Chauvin and his fellow officers felt \u0027threatened\u0027 by the gathering crowd. But as he looked at the all-too-familiar image of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd\u0027s neck under cross-examination, Brodd was forced to concede that such a restraint would cause pain and thus also \u0027could be use of force\u0027.  The final and perhaps most influential witness called was Dr David Fowler, a former chief medical examiner in Maryland who shared his conclusion that Floyd\u0027s death should have never been classified as a homicide because there were too many competing potential causes of death.  One of the potential causes Fowler presented was exposure to exhaust fumes from the squad car Floyd was pinned next to, which the defense witness said could have caused some degree of carbon monoxide poisoning.  The carbon monoxide point was one of many on which Fowler contradicted the opinions of medical experts who testified before him. Blackwell drilled down on those contradictions while attempting to chip away at Fowler\u0027s credibility during cross-examination, at one point telling him: \u0027You\u0027re not a toxicologist..a pulmonologist.. a cardiologist, a physiologist…You don\u0027t treat patients.\u0027Fowler\u0027s earliest contradiction over more than five hours of testimony on April 14 came when he shared his conclusion that Floyd died from a \u0027sudden cardiac arrhythmia\u0027 due to his underlying heart disease during his restraint by police. That conclusion was refuted by Dr Baker, the Hennepin County chief medical examiner who performed Floyd\u0027s autopsy. Fowler also said that Floyd had an enlarged heart, which meant he needed more oxygen to function, and that methamphetamine use heightened his risk of cardiac arrhythmia. Later in his lengthy and technical testimony, Fowler cited multiple studies which challenged the notion that the prone position - in which Floyd was held for nine minutes and 29 seconds - is inherently dangerous. He also referenced studies which concluded that it doesn\u0027t matter how much a person weighs if they are applying a single knee to another person - and a double knee restraint makes only a modest difference.According to those studies a person transfers just 23 percent of their bodyweight during a double knee restraint. So, Dr Fowler said, Chauvin – who he viewed as applying a single knee restraint for most of the restraint – would have been applying less than 30 to 35 pounds of weight to Floyd.Fowler asserted that none of that weight compromised Floyd\u0027s \u0027vital neck structures\u0027, that there was no evidence of injury to Floyd\u0027s neck and that the pressure applied was less than the amount necessary to bruise him.  Moments before the defense rested Chauvin addressed the court for the first time on the morning of April 15 and invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination, meaning he would not take the stand.  In a brief rebuttal later that morning the prosecution recalled Dr Tobin to refute Fowler\u0027s claims about the potential for carbon monoxide poisoning, with which Tobin said he disagreed entirely.  Judge Cahill barred Tobin from referring to specific test results with Floyd\u0027s carbon monoxide levels, which the prosecution sought to enter into evidence just minutes earlier. But Tobin told the court Floyd\u0027s hemoglobin was 98 percent saturated with oxygen, leaving up to two percent for carbon monoxide. Pressing that point Tobin told the jury: \u0027You and I have somewhere between zero and three.\u0027 Judge Cahill excused the jurors through the weekend, reminding them to pack a bag ahead of sequestration on Monday following closing statements. "},{"url":null,"title":"Confused cops struggled enforce Covid restrictions lack clarity ministers","story":"Share this article \u0027Routine requests for service were more likely to receive a remote response during the pandemic, rather than a police officer or member of staff attending.

Also, Covid-19 vaccine trials involved the same rigorous testing.” What about potential long-term side effects? How effective are the vaccines? The most recent study on the effect of vaccines from Public Health England (PHE) shows that vaccines provide a high level of protection – they decrease your risk of catching Covid-19, and reduce the number of people needing hospital treatment as well as the number of people who die from Covid-19. Can the two doses be mixed and matched? “Because the trials were done using the same vaccine, we’re asking people to have their second dose using the same brand,” says Hussain. A £7m trial was recently launched to examine whether combining jabs could provide better protection. Having your second dose is really important when the time comes. The first dose of the vaccine provides a high level of protection, but for that protection to last longer, everyone needs to get a second dose. Are the vaccines safe for those with long-term health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease or asthma? Yes, says Hussain, who notes the vaccines have been stringently tested on those with underlying illnesses. “It’s important that people with long-term health conditions receive the vaccine because they’re often more at risk of getting Covid-19,” she says. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) had previously advised against anyone with a history of anaphylaxis – a life-threatening reaction caused by allergens – getting the vaccine. However, it has since revised its guidelines to reflect that the vaccine is mostly safe for people who have been affected by anaphylaxis, except those iniduals who have had a severe allergic reaction to any of the vaccine ingredients or if they experience anaphylaxis after the first dose. The MHRA’s current guidance is based on detailed analysis of data up to 7 February 2021. At this date, an estimated 7.5m first doses of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine and 5m doses of the Oxford UniversityAstraZeneca vaccine had been administered, and around 500,000 second doses, mostly the PfizerBioNTech vaccine, had been administered. Can I have the vaccine if I am taking other medicines? Most medicines will not be a problem if taken alongside the Covid vaccine, but anyone in doubt should check with their GP. Patients who are taking anticoagulants (blood thinners) such as warfarin, apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran can receive the vaccine, provided their treatment is stable and they do not have unexplained bruising or bleeding. Are the Covid-19 vaccines safe for people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities? Yes, the vaccines are safe. Hussain says she’s encountered vaccine hesitancy from some patients. “It’s for a variety of reasons, ranging from a historical mistrust of authorities to concerns about animal products,” she says. Is the vaccine halal? “I have South Asian patients worried about the vaccines containing animal products, but there are none in there,” says Hussain. She also notes that both the Muslim Council of Britain and the British Islamic Medical Association endorse the vaccine. What is the most common myth you encounter about the vaccine? Can I still take the vaccine if I’m breastfeeding? I am young and fit, so therefore less likely to die from Covid-19. Why should I get the jab? The vaccine is currently being offered to people in high priority groups, but will soon be available for young people. With this in mind, Hussain says: “It’s true younger people are less likely to die from Covid-19, but we’re seeing more examples of long Covid in young people, a horrid illness that damages organs. Receiving the vaccine will protect you from that.” More than half the UK’s adult population has now been vaccinated. This achievement is testament to the efforts of the NHS and GPs around the country, but it is crucial that everyone gets a vaccine when their time comes. Are the Covid vaccines safe for children? Neither the PfizerBioNTech or OxfordAstraZeneca vaccines are licensed for under-16-year-olds, says Hussain, because trials remain in progress. However, for a very small number of children at a higher risk of catching the virus and serious illness, the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation has advised that vaccination can be appropriate, but that this should be a carefully discussed decision between parentss and their GP. Do I still need to get the vaccine if I’ve already had Covid-19? Yes. “We really don’t know how long immunity lasts after you’ve been infected with Covid-19,” says Hussain, who also points out the rise of new variants. “People who have been previously infected may still catch these variants, but it’s believed the vaccines can offer some protection against them.” How long am I immunised for after receiving the vaccine? “My feeling is it won’t be a once-in-a-lifetime jab,” says Hussain. “It could be a seasonal jab, like the annual booster flu injections.” I’ve got vaccine-sceptical family members. How can I persuade them to take the vaccine? “Remember: there’s probably a very good reason for your family member being reluctant,” says Hussain. “So, first of all – and this is what I’m doing with my patients – listen to them. Try to explore their reasons. Also, get them to speak to another person, such as a friend or family member, who’s had the jab. This makes it more real.” If anybody needs more reassurance on the vaccine, Hussain suggests discussing these with your GP, practice nurse, or even your high-street chemist. “Everybody ought to have questions during this scary time – it’s exactly what people like me are here for,” she says. Marsha McAdam is a mental health advocate living in Manchester. She hopes the vaccine will enable her to resume the volunteering work that helps her manage her borderline personality disorder The footage of intensive care units (ICU) featuring PPE-clad staff lifting patients and machines bleeping eerily away were among the most harrowing scenes from the pandemic. For Marsha McAdam, it was terrifying, bringing back painful memories of being on an ICU unit herself for three weeks after taking a near-fatal overdose. Since her 2008 overdose, McAdam, who has borderline personality disorder, has managed her condition through mentalisation-based therapy and volunteering for the initiative Equally Well. But the horrors of the pandemic combined with shielding (McAdam has fibromyalgia and type 2 diabetes) has put her mental health at risk. “If it wasn’t for carers visiting twice a day, and my son, I wouldn’t see anybody.” This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

We spoke to the experts to find out. Q: If I’m displaying symptoms, do I still need to isolate?“The most important thing is to follow the law, so if you’ve got symptoms you have to self-isolate for 10 days in your home and it’s really important people continue to do this,” says Dr Shaun Fitzgerald, director of the Centre for Climate Repair at the University of Cambridge and a member of the UK government Science Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE). “There may perhaps be people who think: ‘Well, why can’t I go for a walk outside in the countryside if I’m not going to see anybody?’, and I completely understand that argument. But there are millions of people living in apartments and if they were to venture outside, they’d be sharing corridors and stairwells and touching multiple surfaces. We can’t have one rule for one and another rule for others. It’s about the risks to the wider society and my personal view is that the rules are proportionate and very reasonable. Especially when you compare 10 days of isolation with the lockdowns we’ve already been in – it’s a small ask comparatively.” Q: Is it really safe to socialise outside?“When we are outdoors, thinking about the airborne route of transmission, the level of concentration of any virus in our vicinity is much lower and so the risk is lower too,” says Fitzgerald, who also specialises in airflow research. “The amount of outdoor air that’s sweeping away any virus being emanated from a person is enormous, and we can’t begin to practically replicate that kind of environment within an indoor environment.” Q: Won’t opening the windows have the same effect?“Opening the windows is great if you’re indoors but it’s nowhere near as good as being outdoors,” says Fitzgerald. “Think about it, when you’re stood outside, it’s very rare that it’s perfectly still – there’s usually a very small wind and when you run the numbers and figure out the volume flux of air passing you that’s not virus-laden, it’s enormous. When you’re outside, there are fewer surfaces for you to touch which, for example, somebody might have coughed on. Surface touching risks are also lower outdoors because things such as the rain and ultraviolet light from the sun can deactivate the virus more easily than in a dark, indoor environment.” Q: How safe is outdoor swimming or group sports?“Outdoor sports are relatively low risk but I would encourage people to also think about their overall wellbeing, including mental health, when it comes to the risks you’re exposing yourself to as you enter into society,” says Fitzgerald. She adds: “This isn’t purely about the virus – we also need to think about the wider impacts of isolation, loneliness and a lack of socialisation. It’s about balancing those risks.” Q: How can we keep safe as we start to socialise in larger groups?“One of the challenges as we start seeing friends and family is that it’s incredibly difficult for people to maintain a social distance from loved ones,” says Rogers. “And if you have young children it’s very difficult to explain to them why they’re not allowed to crawl over everyone or play with the other children. If you’re meeting up with another household or group, try to plan it in an environment that is as safe as possible. Have those honest conversations now – people are more willing and likely to stick to plans that are made in advance.” Q: If we’ve had the vaccine, do the rules still apply?“The vaccines are amazing and one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs of a generation, but they’re not a silver bullet,” says Rogers. “Think about somebody who has had bypass surgery because their diet and exercise were poor. They can have that medical fix, but if they don’t change their behaviours, they’ll never realise their full potential. I see vaccines in the same way – they’re a powerful weapon we can deploy against the virus but they’re only going to reach their full potential if we wrap these other behavioural elements around them.” Q: How can we make our homes safer for visitors when they’re allowed to pass through to gardens?“Keep the windows open and if you’ve got two bathrooms, have one toilet for guests and one for the household,” suggests Fitzgerald. “If not, can you provide two towels – one for guests, one for others? Ventilating the house before and after your guests have arrived is key – ventilating before they arrive is helpful in case you happen to have an infectious person in your vicinity, therefore reducing the risk to your guests. Ventilating after guests have left is important because if one of them happens to be infectious, this will reduce the risk to your own household.” And remember, it’s not permitted for people to meet indoors until 17 May – when six people or two households will be able to come together. Q: Is there anything else we should remember?“While we’re still in this reasonably precarious state, the most important thing is to think: ‘It’s not about me, it’s about others,’” says Fitzgerald. “It’s about the wider community. Certainly in the first lockdown, we got the sense of real selflessness in society and we need to try to remember these measures aren’t just in place to protect you as an inidual, it’s about thinking of others. Particularly as we emerge from lockdown – since, the more compliant we are now, the quicker the incident rate is going to come down and the sooner society can start functioning again. So it’s really about trying to get out of this as quickly as we can, which means complying with the rules as much as possible.” This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Chris Muntz-Torres is the orchard manager at Myrtle Farm – which is owned by the Thatcher family, of the eponymous cider brand – in Sandford, Somerset, and for him the time of year dictates the entire pace and flow of his work. Popular apples such as katy and dabinett are among the 25 main varieties grown by Thatchers Cider, but there are upwards of 450 in all, many of them heritage varieties, such as the fabulously named slack-ma-girdle and broxwood foxwhelp. Today, as Myrtle Farm begins to bloom, Muntz-Torres reflects on what each season means. “This is the time of year when the trees are waking up. It’s quite exciting seeing everything come back to life,” he says. Late April and early May are when cider varieties typically blossom but, Muntz-Torres says, it can be a worrisome time, as a late frost can wipe out an entire orchard. “It’s not something we generally suffer with in Somerset, but we have been known to in the past.” Spring is also tree-planting time. “You only get one opportunity to establish a tree, so it’s very important to do it right,” he says. For fermentation supervisor Eleanor Thatcher, daughter of fourth generation Martin Thatcher, spring is important in terms of the upcoming harvest. At 21 years old, she is carrying the cider-making torch for the family her great-great grandfather William Thatcher made his first batch in 1904. “It’s a magical time of year,” she says, adding that the number of fruitlets on the trees indicate whether it will be a bountiful harvest. Meanwhile, the farm’s specially planted wildflower meadows attract pollinating insects, and honeybee hives can be found in each orchard. So, too, can a host of other “visitors”. “I often liken driving around our orchards to going on a wildlife safari,” says Muntz-Torres. “They’re a fantastic haven for everything from small invertebrates and insects to birds and mammals.” When spring turns to summer, trees become bushy. It takes many years of pruning to shape the trees in a way that maximises the amount of sunlight reaching the apples. It is important to get this right as their taste is affected by how much light they get. Towards the end of August, the first varieties start to ripen and so begins harvest season. “This is what we’ve been working towards all year, so it’s nice to see the fruits of your labour,” says Muntz-Torres. Apples are left to fall off the trees then collected by a mechanical harvester. Any that remain on the trees are worked loose with an “apple shaker” machine. “It’s quite fun to watch apples flying everywhere!” At the height of the season, 450 tonnes of apples arrive at the mill every day. It’s an incredibly busy time of year, and staff from different departments sometimes lend a hand. Family members, too. “My brother, Peter, is often out late at night getting the apples in,” says Thatcher. “He’s still in college but he helps out when he can.” Ensuring a healthy harvest in autumn means tending to the orchards all year, including in winter. “That’s the main time for pruning,” says Muntz-Torres. “We have 180,000 trees, and they all need to be looked after. Pruning is all done by hand.” From the warmth of summer to the bustle of harvest time, every season has its place in the cider-making process. For Thatcher, though, nothing compares to strolling through the orchards in spring, with the family dog, Myrtle. “It’s the perfect time. The bees are buzzing, the blossoms are out, and everything smells just wonderful.” To discover more about life on Myrtle Farm and Thatchers’ range of Somerset ciders, please visit thatcherscider "},{"url":null,"title":"uk unemployment rate drops payrolls workers stock markets ftse business live","story":"In January 2021 to March 2021, there were an estimated 607,000 job opportunities at UK businesses. Arts, entertainment and recreation, and accommodation and food services continue to be the worst affected, as they are most impacted by the current restrictions. Small companies are also reining in their hiring: More than half of those losing their jobs in the last year were aged below 25, with another quarter in the 25-34 bracket. Of the 813,000 fall in UK employees between March 2020 and March 2021:  That’s based on company payroll data from tax office HMRC, released with the ONS this morning. And worryingly, it shows that 56,000 workers were cut from company payrolls in March alone. That’s the first monthly drop since last November. The UK jobless rate has fallen for the second month in a row, but more workers have left company payrolls in March as the pandemic continues to grip the economy. The ONS says that the jobs market appears to have been ‘broadly stable’ in recent months, a sign that initiative such as the furlough scheme have prevented a larger surge in job losses.  But the report also shows the damage caused by Covid-19: the economic inactivity rate increased (meaning more people stopped looking for work), the employment rate continued to fall. Total hours worked fell too, as some companies were forced to close their doors again to comply with coronavirus restrictions. And worryingly, the number of employees on company payrolls fell by 56,000 between February and March, the ONS says, reversing a recent improvement. Her’s the details: Reaction to follow...

An initial seven cases of the Indian variant were detected in Israel last week among people arriving from abroad and who have since undergone preliminary testing, the health ministry said. “The impression is that the Pfizer vaccine has efficacy against it, albeit a reduced efficacy,” the ministry’s director general, Hezi Levy, told Kan public radio, saying the number of cases of the variant in Israel now stood at eight. The ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for more details on the research into the Indian variant. Britain and Ireland have also said they are investigating the variant after detecting it within their borders. UK education minister Gavin Williamson has this morning been out in the media defending the delay in putting India on the travel “red list” to protect against coronavirus. PA Media reports he told Sky News: “It’s standard practice to give people a sort of short window in order to be able to manage their affairs. It’s the right approach to do, it’s the approach we’ve taken with other countries around the world when they’ve gone on to the red list.” Although the government has announced that India will move to the “red list”, it will not take effect until 4am on Friday 23 April. India has recorded nearly 1.6m new coronavirus cases in a week. Williamson said: “The government continuously reviews the data, continues to review the information we’re getting from the scientific community in terms of what countries should be put onto the red list, and sadly India has been one of those countries that has had to be added.” If you arrive in the UK from India before 4am Friday 23 April, you must self-isolate for 10 days in the place you’re staying and take a Covid-19 test on day two and day eight. From 4am Friday 23 April, if you have been in India in the previous 10 days, you will only be allowed to enter the UK if you are a British, Irish or third-country national with residency rights and will need to quarantine in a managed quarantine hotel.Panu Wongcha-um and Panarat Thepgumpanat remind us for Reuters that Thailand has been implementing a “zero tolerance” policy for people who test positive. Even those without symptoms are immediately hospitalised if they test positive, prompting concern about the health system’s capacity in the event of a surge in the number of patients with severe symptoms. Authorities reported 1,443 new coronavirus cases and 4 new deaths today, bringing total infections to 45,185 with 108 fatalities overall. Thailand has been credited for its swift containment of earlier outbreaks, but has yet to start mass vaccinations. The current wave affecting the country includes the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 or “Kent” variant, which has been blamed for big jumps in infections in many countries, including the Philippines, where hospitals are struggling. The news on jobs this morning is not heartening though. The number of UK workers on payrolls dropped by 56,000 last month and has fallen by 813,000 since March 2020 due to the impact of the pandemic, according to Office for National Statistics figures out today.I’m not sure what qualifies as a “spate” (is there official guidance?), but there has been a spate-adjacent number of incidents of teenagers getting stuck in baby swings in York recently, solemnly reported in the local paper. I’m delighted by these incidents and what they represent: teenagers being teenagers and doing stupid stuff.  The re-emergence of teenagers, lounging around children’s play areas, treading on municipal tulips, mock (or not mock) fighting and abandoning their cans has prompted a panicked surge of disapproval. They are using “foul” language and causing a “nuisance” and gathering in groups of more than six, people tut, swerving to avoid them. The neighbourhood app Nextdoor is full of complaints about youths “causing absolute mayhem”, as one user put it. Let he or she who has not spun a mate dangerously fast on a roundabout for infants cast the first stone.  Long may it continue. Read more of Emma Beddington’s piece here: An outbreak of post-lockdown teenage mayhem? I’m thrilled to see it When reporters visited the Jadid Qabristan Ahle cemetery in the Indian capital – which is in a week-long lockdown – on Friday, 11 bodies arrived within three hours. By sunset, 20 bodies were in the ground. This compares with some days in December and January, when Mohammed Shamim’s earthmoving machine stayed idle and when many thought the pandemic was over. “Now, it looks like the virus has legs,” Shamim, 38, told AFP. “At this rate, I will run out of space in three or four days.” Last year Shamim told reporters: “I’ve been burying the dead for the last two decades. But until now, I’ve never been scared for my own life.” Around the graveyard, white body bags or coffins made out of cheap wood are carried around by people in blue or yellow protective suits and lowered into graves. Small groups of men, some in Islamic skullcaps, look solemnly at the ground as the imam, struggling to be heard as dust laced with rain swirls around, recites final prayers. Sobbing women watch from their closed car windows next to the flashing lights of an ambulance as a yellow digger fills up the graves with the dry brown and grey soil. “Two days ago someone came to me and said he needs to start preparing for his mother because doctors had given up on her,” Shamim said. “It’s unreal. I never thought I’d see the day where I’d have a request for starting the funeral formalities of a living person.” Officially, almost 180,000 Indians have died from coronavirus, 15,000 of them this month, although some believe the real number may be higher. Social media and newspaper reports have been flooded with horrifying images of row upon row of burning pyres and crematoriums unable to cope. In Ghaziabad, outside Delhi, television pictures showed bodies wrapped in shrouds lined up on biers on the pavement with weeping relatives waiting for their slot. In the western state of Gujarat, many crematoriums in Surat, Rajkot, Jamnagar and Ahmedabad are operating around the clock with three to four times more bodies than normal. The chimney of one electric furnace in Ahmedabad cracked and collapsed after being in constant use for up to 20 hours every day for the past two weeks. The iron frames inside another in the industrial diamond hub of Surat melted because there was no time to let the furnaces cool. “Until last month we were cremating 20-odd bodies per day … But since the beginning of April we have been handling over 80 bodies every day,” said a local official at the Ramnath Ghela Crematorium in the city.Roger Green, a British writer who has lived on the Greek island of Hydra since the early 90s, says some older islanders are afraid to leave their homes. “The vaccination process has passed us by,” he said. “I know people like me who are in their eighties and are afraid to go out at all. We’re not complainers, we love Greece but for most foreigners here, at least, the system isn’t working.” Hydra is far from being alone. In a country that has linked its inoculation drive to ownership of a social security (AMKA) number, countless overseas residents have reported being in the same predicament. Although desperate to have the jab, many say without the number they’ve been unable even to get to the stage where they can book a vaccine appointment. An attempt by the Greek government to resolve the oversight – passing legislation earlier this month that allows foreigners to obtain temporary AMKA registration – has largely failed to address the problem. The law applies to permanent residents and those who have elected to see out the pandemic in Greece. “Almost no AMKA numbers granted in the 2021 calendar year actually work on the vaccine website,” said Rebecca Lieb, who moved to Greece from New York under the Golden Visa scheme offering residence in return for real estate investments to non EU-nationals. From her home on the Pelion peninsula, Lieb has become a leading voice in the vociferous campaign to “rectify this wrong”. In the four months since Athens’ centre-right administration launched its online vaccine site, she has petitioned officials and reached out to the EU ombudsman to make clear that inidual member states “have the discretion” to roll out vaccines as they see fit. “Because of my activism and big mouth, my husband and I got a call offering us temporary AMKA numbers and vaccines,” said the digital media analyst. “As we were in the eligible age group we accepted, with the proviso that this privilege would not silence me.” Read more of Helen Smith and Sam Jones’ report here: ‘The system isn’t working’: the British immigrants in Greece who can’t book Covid jabs On Tuesday, hundreds of groups working to combat inequality appealed to governments to respond to increasing levels of hunger caused by “an acute food insecurity situation” around the world. In an open letter to support the UN Call for Action to Avert Famine in 2021, they said millions of people faced starvation, and billions of pounds in investment was urgently needed. Its capital New Delhi was locked down Monday for a week, and the government said all adults would be eligible for a vaccine from May as it tries to get a grip on the spike. Similar measures have been taken in other Indian states, adding to the woes of people already reeling from the economic pressure of the pandemic. India’s daily cases retreated from record levels on Tuesday, but stayed above the 200,000 mark for a sixth straight day, with cases increasing by 259,170 over the last 24 hours. It has reported 1.59m cases in the last week alone.  Deaths rose by a record 1,761 to reach a total of 180,530, health ministry data showed. The looming lockdown in Delhi forced tens of thousands of migrant workers to try and flee on Monday, fuelling fears they could spread the virus to their rural hometowns. “Last year I was stuck here for 50 days,” said tailor Hari Shankar, referring to the strict coronavirus lockdown India imposed last year. “I didn’t have work and couldn’t send money home... I’m not planning on coming back (to Delhi) until Covid is over.” Experts have warned that religious festivals, including the Kumbh Mela attended by millions of pilgrims, and packed state election rallies in India had become “super-spreader” events - and some have said mass vaccinations are the only long-term solution.The United States is also expected to announce its decision on the single-shot J\u0026ampJ vaccine by Friday, as nations around the world try to accelerate their rollouts and revive their pandemic-ravaged economies. The European Medicines Agency was due to hold a press conference from Amsterdam on Tuesday, after reviewing four cases - one fatal - of rare blood clots reported among people who got the J\u0026ampJ shot. But the number of reported clots were “extremely small” compared with the 4.5 million J\u0026ampJ shots administered worldwide, the EMA has said. That comparison echoes the comments by top US pandemic advisor Anthony Fauci, who described the clots as “an extraordinarily rare event”. Fauci said Sunday he believed the US would resume use of the jab, possibly with some restrictions or warnings. The J\u0026ampJ vaccine concerns follow similar reports of blood clots in a very small number of people who received the AstraZeneca shot. The EMA described those clots as a “very rare” side effect, stressing that the AstraZeneca jab’s benefits outweigh the risks. The leaders of Europe are keen to accelerate vaccinations and expand availability after facing intense criticism over a sluggish rollout and with the public desperate for a return to some degree of normality. That desire was on display in EU member Slovakia on Monday, where shops, museums, libraries and swimming pools reopened after a lengthy lockdown, bringing big crowds onto the streets. Hairdressers were in particularly high demand. “We have been very busy since the morning, but I am very happy that we can cut hair again,” said Martin, a Bratislava barber.Europe’s drug regulator was expected to rule Tuesday on the safety of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson Covid-19 vaccine after fears it could be linked to extremely rare blood clots, while India said it will make shots available to all adults as battles a terrifying wave of infections. Meanwhile India’s daily cases retreated from record levels on Tuesday, but stayed above the 200,000 mark for a sixth straight day, with cases increasing by 259,170 over the last 24 hours. Deaths rose by a record 1,761 to reach a total of 180,530, health ministry data showed. Here are the key recent developments:  "},{"url":null,"title":"it s been very different learning to be a teacher in a pandemic","story":"Robyn Lynch, a trainee teacher at Scoil Naomh Fionan Rennies National School in Novohal, Co Cork. Photograph: Michael Mac SweeneyProvisionWhen Robyn Lynch began training to become a teacher prior to the pandemic, it was like she had a mountain to climb. When Covid-19 arrived and shut schools down, suddenly the teaching terrain changed beyond recognition.School placements and the teaching practice element of it is a crucial part of teacher training. It gives students the opportunity to apply educational theories to classroom settings and enables them to gain “hands-on” experience in a variety of school-based contexts.But Covid-19 meant schools, colleges and student teachers were forced rethink the structure and, in many cases, the duration of the programme.“It was very different we were getting a lot of emails from the college about the fact that the tutors weren’t coming in and how it was all going to work,” says Lynch.One key difference was the absence of school visits by inspectors, now known as tutors. In normal times tutors observe the student teacher in the classroom and offer advice and guidance based on these observations. This posed problems for the colleges.“How do we guarantee the integrity around what we do, because we have not been able to conduct school visits to engage in the mentoring and supervision?” is how Dr Neil Ó Conaill, director of school placement at Mary Immaculate College, Limerick, characterises the problem.In response, the college replaced the in-school visits with online one-to-one meetings between the tutor and the students.“We have also developed reciprocal peer tutoring systems for the students in an organised way so that they are a support to each other,” adds Ó Conaill.Lynch says she was apprehensive about not being observed and the impact this might have on her grading, but now believes the online meetings gave her tutor a more comprehensive insight into her teaching practice.“We did a preliminary meeting before placement started,” says Lynch. “It’s such a small thing but it brings down that wall of formality and you are not afraid to admit you made a mistake because you know that they are going to appreciate it.”Being honestCaoimhe Forkan, another student, completed her final school placement this year and was also concerned about not being observed.“I was apprehensive at first, but there is no point in coating it and saying that everything is great,” says Forkan. “You have to be honest it is strange to get used to.”The pandemic has also forced tutors to find new ways to assess and support the student teachers. “How do you support somebody who is having challenges and difficulties around classroom management when you don’t actually see them in there?” asks Ó Conaill.While students were honest about the areas in which they needed support, tutors were relying on the students’ communication skills.Tutors focus on positive aspects of practice, but they also use questioning to ascertain areas that need support or development.“By asking students questions like ‘Describe a lesson that didn’t go well or describe a lesson that you are really glad the tutor wasn’t there to witness’, tutors can help students.” Ó Conaill says this allows the tutor to take on the role of mentor as well as assessor.Lynch says the absence of the on-site visits had a positive impact on her final block of school placement.“When tutors come into the room it is very nerve-racking – you are just hoping it all goes well,” says Lynch. “This time that was gone but it was a lot more than that.”Lynch’s meetings with the tutor were broad and covered all aspects of her teaching practice rather than the focus being on the day of the visit. “He really got a window into the classroom life as well as our teaching,” she says.The removal of the in-school visit had another positive impact, according to Catherine Carragher, principal of Scoil Mochua, Celbridge, Co Kildare. Removing the threat of the inspector, she says, allows student teachers to take more risks.“I think there are benefits to it. It’s freeing. They are not afraid to try the ‘messy’ lesson and that is life experience with teaching,” she says.Class teachers were asked to take on a more supervisory role, and Carragher believes the experience has been mutually beneficial for both teacher and student.“I do think that the teachers stepped up to the mark and took on the role of supervising. Class teachers are very protective of their children, and they don’t want to be picking up the pieces after four, six or eight weeks of a student being in,” she says.Virtual experienceStudent teachers on placement at Scoil Muchua also gained virtual experience by assisting teachers with remote teaching.“Some of the Froebel students did four weeks of their practice in January remotely. It worked really well,” says Carragher, “The student teachers were a dab hand at Google Classrooms and putting together videos and YouTube clips.”The development of meaningful, self-reflection skills was another benefit reported by student teachers.“We would always have done reflection, but this year it really made me think about it,” says Forkan. “You are thinking more about the learning and you get a true experience of what the daily life of a teacher is like.”Ó Conaill says this increase in self-reflection has enhanced the school placement experience.“It has been interesting for us to see the empowerment of the students, rather than them being reliant on the tutor for advice and guidance and next steps,” he says. “Our task is to identify now how to incorporate these practices into the regular supervision once it resumes.”Teachers and principals were also contacted by the colleges to discuss a student’s progress.“The other component to our supervision is direct contact with the school personnel while the student is there,” says Ó Conaill. “This is our means of replicating the conversations that a tutor would have with school personnel during an actual visit. It’s not quite the same but we certainly don’t want schools to feel that they are just left with the students.”Students were also required to provide detailed documentation of their teaching.“For example planning documents, the reflective portfolio and samples of children’s work,” says Ó Conaill.Forkan says there was a notable increase in paperwork. “We had to do weekly assessments and weekly reflections and some of them were fine but others were kind of repetitive,” says Forkan. “There was definitely a lot more paperwork, which was probably a disadvantage.”While school placement is an essential component of a teacher’s education, those with an underlying health condition can postpone their placement.“No student is obliged to go on placement they can take what is known as an ‘I grade’, which means they can step out of that module and take it at another time,” says Ó Conaill."},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been almost a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 200,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,000 people have died.Globally, over 100 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 64 different vaccines in clinical development, with another 173 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva. 351,874 had received their second dose.Some 192,638 of these vaccines had gone to people in long term residential care facilities, while 349,406 had gone to frontline healthcare workers and 566,232 had gone to people over the age of 70. Some\u0026nbsp95,396 people in Cohort 4 - those\u0026nbspaged between 16 and 69 at very high risk of severe Covid-19 disease - received a dose.\u0026nbspGlobally, over 900 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have been administered.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine. \u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?In December the HSE published the provisional order in which people in Ireland will be vaccinated against Covid-19. After over-65s in care homes and frontline health workers, people aged 70 and older and other healthcare workers are next in line to receive the vaccine.\u0026nbspPeople aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions will then be\u0026nbspthe fourth cohort to be vaccinated.On March 30th, the Cabinet agreed to change the National Vaccination Programme to an age-based system, once those aged 70 years and older, people considered vulnerable and those with underlying conditions are immunised. The original programme involved 15 cohorts of people based on age and profession, with key workers prioritised.The vaccination of people aged over 85 began on Monday, February 15th. Those in the 70-84 age bracket began to receive their first dose on March 8th, alongside people aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions.The HSE has said everyone over the age of 70 should have received their second dose by mid-May.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"experts urge caution on extending gap between doses of vaccines","story":"Coalition sources say following changes to the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine, and the uncertainty around Johnson \u0026 Johnson, all options have  to be considered to keep the vaccination programme on track. Photograph: Getty ImagesSenior medics and experts have urged caution on extending the gap between doses of Covid-19 vaccines, saying a significant benefit to the vaccination programme would be needed to justify it.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has sought the advice of deputy chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn and the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) on the possibility. Research has shown good levels of immunity from a single dose.Dr Denis McCauley, GP chair of the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO), said he believed it would not greatly accelerate the vaccination programme. Modelling showing an “enormous, obvious difference” would have to be published to justify such a move. Dr Glynn said there were pros and cons, but “it would mean that the programme overall will finish later, and for a large number of people they’ll be waiting longer to be fully vaccinated”.A decision will not be taken until later in the week once the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issues an opinion on the single-shot Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine. It is studying potential links between the vaccine and rare clotting events. ChangesCoalition sources said following changes to the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine last week, and the uncertainty around Johnson \u0026amp Johnson, all options have to be considered to keep the vaccination programme on track and allow for more restrictions to be lifted. Limitations on the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine would impact on Ireland’s vaccines programme, while the costs associated with lockdown grow.Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Michael McGrath will tell Cabinet today (Tuesday) that spending is €500 million ahead of projections for the first three months of the year. Some €19.5 billion had been spent by the end of March, including €3 billion on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme. There has been a significant draw on contingency funds, cushioned by around €120 million less spent on capital projects.While widespread vaccination should lower pandemic spending demands, senior public health officials believe spacing out doses might only accelerate the vaccination programme by two or three weeks unless it was significantly increased well beyond the manufacturers’ guidelines of up to six weeks. Meanwhile, there could be a risk of proceeding with reopening with lower overall levels of protection, as well as a prospect of confusing the message around the importance of a two-dose regime.“We should be concentrating on how we get people vaccinated properly, not how to get people vaccinated quickly,” said a source. Some experts support increased spacing. Luke O’Neill, professor of immunology at Trinity College Dublin, said more first doses would protect more of the population against severe disease. “Keeping the second shot back will delay the campaign to get to 80 per cent given that we haven’t got enough vaccine to roll out as quickly as we want, so why not use up all the first shot?” Trial researchHowever, vaccine specialist Anne Moore, senior lecturer at UCC’s school of biochemistry, said extending the dose interval was not supported by clinical trial research.“My core belief is that we should stick with the clinical evidence that was generated in the clinical trials by the companies that are manufacturing the vaccines,” she said. Anthony Staines, professor of health systems at Dublin City University, warned that extending the interval would increase the risk of spreading vaccine-resistant coronavirus strains. “It’s not mad, bad or wicked to do something different, but the safer approach is to do what we are doing.” No further deaths associated with Covid-19 were announced on Monday, with 403 more diagnoses confirmed. Three cases of the B1617 variant of Covid-19 first identified in India have now been identified here, it was confirmed on Monday. At least two of the cases are travel-related and the other one is being investigated.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"explainer pros and cons of extending gap between vaccine doses","story":"‘Early data shows that the first dose of the two-dose Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines is highly effective.’To extend or not to extend, that is the question.At a time of scarce Covid-19 vaccine supplies, the debate rages as to whether it is a good idea to delay the intervals between first and second doses in order to get more first jabs into more arms and vaccinate more people, albeit with the reduced level of protection that comes from one dose.Early data shows that the first dose of the two-dose Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines is highly effective, bringing a high level of protection to vaccinated people before the second booster jab tops up the level of immunity after the recommended interval of 28 days.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found in a recent study of almost 4,000 healthcare workers that a single dose of the two vaccines was 80 per cent effective in preventing infections, though it said two doses were better with protection jumping to 90 per cent two weeks after the second jab.A similar study from Israel showed equally beneficial results.The AstraZeneca vaccine, which is being administered to people in their 60s, has also been found to be very effective at preventing severe disease and death from Covid-19 after the first dose. The recommended interval for the two doses of this vaccine is 12 weeks.The UK government decided at the outset to maintain a 12-week gap between the two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to protect a greater number of people, to reduce deaths and ease pressure on the country’s health system as the country battled a third wave of infections.Analysis of data from clinical trials on more than 17,000 participants in the UK, Brazil and South Africa found that the 12-week gap was better than a six-week gap: the vaccine was 81 per cent effective over 12 weeks compared with 55 per cent over six weeks. Even a single dose of the vaccine was 76 per cent effective between three and 12 weeks after it was administered.RecommendationThe decision here rests on the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines. Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly is awaiting a recommendation in the coming days on whether to extend the interval between the two doses from four weeks to a longer period of up to 12 weeks.Experts see upsides and downsides to a change.“As long as the supply of vaccines is secure, we should give all the vaccines out – don’t hold any back,” said Trinity College Dublin immunology professor Luke O’Neill, pushing for a longer interval that will reach the end-of-June first-dose target of 80 per cent of adults by the end of May.“The idea is basically to get to as many people as quickly as possible because it will have a bigger impact, because you are covering more people in a given period of time.”University College Dublin professor and infectious diseases consultant Paddy Mallon sees benefits in extending the interval window but said the overall strategy is to keep transmission low while fully vaccinating (with two doses) as many people as possible to prevent new variants coming in.“I don’t know that there is a right answer because both options have a lot of benefit,” he said.He points out that the State is “well on the way” to fully vaccinating people most at risk of severe disease from Covid-19 and that the benefits from changing the interval period would only amount to a gain of weeks given the projected supply of vaccines due into the country.“If you were wanting to ensure that your population has the best protection against new variants, you would really be wanting to optimise the overall immune response, which would be best achieved by getting people fully vaccinated,” he said.In addition to potentially confusing people by making vaccinations more complicated, Anthony Staines, professor of health systems at Dublin City University, said extending the interval could leave the population more susceptible to vaccine-resistant strains being imported.“If we get vaccine-resistant strains circulating in Europe, a bunch of half-vaccinated people are an ideal place for it to spread,” he said.Vaccine specialist Anne Moore, a senior lecturer at University College Cork’s school of biochemistry, said the Government should stick with the plan and the clinical trial evidence supporting the current dose interval, particularly when mRNA vaccines were going to be supplied in larger numbers.“We may be trying to solve a problem that actually isn’t a problem at all,” she said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"three cases of covid 19 variant discovered in india reported in state","story":"Acting chief medical officer Dr  Ronan Glynn: ‘From what has been published online about this variant you’d be forgiven for thinking the world was coming to an end.’ Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsThe first cases of a variant of Covid-19 first identified in India have been found in Ireland.Three cases of the B1617 variant have been identified through sequencing of cases at the National Virus Reference Laboratory (NVRL).At least two of the cases are travel-related, according to Dr Cillian de Gascun, director of the NVRL, and the other one is being investigated.Dr de Gascun said there was no real-world data to indicate this variant is more transmissible or causes more severe disease.While cases are increasing rapidly in India, he said, it was not clear whether the variant was causing this surge or “riding” it.Reporting of B1617 as a “double mutant” variant was “not terribly helpful or accurate from a virus perspective”, he told a National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) briefing.In England, concern about the rise of the variant led on Monday to India being added to the “red list” of countries for which mandatory hotel quarantine is required.Asked whether a similar move could be made here, acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said Nphet would examine all the data and make a recommendation accordingly.Dr Glynn criticised media coverage of the new variant. “From what has been published online about this variant you’d be forgiven for thinking the world was coming to an end.

Photograph: Conor McCabe Photography¼Publicans in Dublin have called for beer gardens to be opened up across the country from May 24th in line with those in Northern Ireland. So-called “wet pubs”, those that do not serve food, will have been closed in the capital for 400 days on Tuesday as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. They represent approximately a third of all the pubs in Dublin.All pubs in the Republic were closed on March 15th last year. Those that served food in Dublin had a brief reopening during the summer and at Christmas time, but have been closed for most of that time. The Licensed Vintners Association (LVA), which represents pubs in Dublin, has launched a “call to action” on the 400th consecutive day of closure for wet pubs. The LVA is urging publicans across Dublin to mark the day by contacting their local political representatives and urging them to ensure all pubs – traditional and gastro – across the country can start providing outdoor service from the week beginning May 24th. Incoming LVA chairman Noel Anderson said pub-owners and their staff had been through “huge mental torture” since the hospitality industry was closed down. “There is a huge ide in this society. You have a third of us working in travel and hospitality that have been absolutely crucified.”ReasonableHe suggested pubs could open their beer gardens now following the lead of pubs in England, and he said the LVA wanted to be reasonable about reopening and give its members a chance to do so safely. “All the data is suggesting that outside is the safest. Common sense would tell you that everybody is outside now and the cases have not spiked. “It’s the common sense thing to do. We can get staff back to work, we can get our businesses going. We can pay our taxes. We could save the Government a lot of money on supports.” Mr Anderson admitted many LVA members who have no outside space were angry with the suggestion. “We understand that, but we have to start somewhere.” Grogan’s publican Daniel Smith said many of the pub’s staff will have left the industry because of the pandemic. Grogan’s, on South William Street, Dublin, has not opened since March 15th last year. “It’s going to be a massive challenge over the coming years. People thought they had bar work to fall back on if things didn’t work out elsewhere. That security is gone nowadays. We can’t rely on it anymore.” VaccinatedThe LVA argues that pubs should be fully reopened by the end of June, when the Government anticipates that 80 per cent of the adult population will be vaccinated. LVA chief executive Donall O’Keeffe said the “unjust segmentation” between wet pubs and gastropubs needed to stop. “The risk profile is the same for indoor hospitality service in all venues – traditional pubs, gastropubs, restaurants and hotels. With hotels expected to reopen in June, all forms of hospitality should be allowed to resume indoor service from that point.” Many Dublin pubs opened over the weekend for takeaway pints. An LVA spokesman said they were doing so because of the improving weather and also because it has been established that it is not an illegal practice.

Photograph: RTÉScreenshotThe information is contained in a documentary about the Burren, Co Clare broadcast on Sunday. Photograph: RTÉScreenshotPrehistoric Irish people were dark skinned and had blue eyes, a new documentary claims.The hunter gather population that lived in Ireland 10,000 years ago do not have any of the pigmentation profiles associated with light skin.They inhabited the island for 4,000 years before being replaced by settled farmers.According to TCD geneticist Dr Lara Cassidy, techniques normally used in forensic criminal investigations have revealed surprising details about prehistoric Irish people.Scientists have been developing a genetic database of ancient Irish genomes from all periods of pre-history to understand how the modern Irish gene pool came about.She said the hunter-gatherer Irish not only had dark skin, but also bright blue eyes – a combination rarely seen today.They operated mostly along the coast of the Burren gathering shellfish, and then moving inland to hunt wild boar and gather hazelnuts.The Burren’s unique geological landscape means it has preserved evidence of millennia of settlement in the area of west Clare.The hunter gathers were replaced by early farmers. The earliest evidence of farmers in Ireland is in the Burren. They arrived approximately 6,000 years ago in what was known as the Neolithic era.“We know now from ancient genomes that farming was accompanied by a whole group of people moving into the continent from the region now known as modern Turkey, ” she said.They brought cattle, sheep and goats, pottery and new housing structures. They have lighter skin than the hunter gather, but more sallow than today.“There could have been violence. This would have been quite a dramatic colonisation event,” Dr Cassidy added.However, it is more likely that they co-existed peacefully as the remains of one early farmer showed that he had hunter gatherer ancestry.Gene poolThe early farmers began by clearing the trees with polished stone axes to make for arable land. They built the dolmens which populate the area.In 4,000 years the last wave of early settlers came to Ireland. They were at the tail end of a large scale migration in the Steppe region of Russia into western Europe.“Only at that point do we see the establishment of the modern Irish gene pool as we know it today,” Dr Cassidy added.Environmental biologist Carl Wright said the Burren once featured high mountains with a thick forest covering. The mountains were replaced by glaciers during the Ice Age which removed a kilometre of rock off the top of this landscape.The early farmers relentlessly cleared the forests until there was hardly any of the original forest left.“They overgrazed the Burren during the climatic downturn of 3,000 years ago – this led to an environmental disaster on a colossal scale, because over a very short space of time we have massive soil erosion which pretty much left us with the landscape that we have at the end of the last ice age. Literally just bare rock, the soil was washed away,” he said.The Burren: Heart of Stone aired on Sunday, April 18th at 6:30pm, RTÉ One.

File photograph: Mark MarlowPA Wire Stormont First Minister Arlene Foster has denied unionists are boycotting meetings with the Irish Government as part of a plan to overthrow the Northern Ireland protocol.The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader described as “misplaced” and “quite mischievous” claims of an unspoken campaign to scupper NorthSouth Ministerial Council (NSMC) meetings by not putting forward unionist Ministers.On Friday, a meeting involving Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan and his counterpart in the North Nichola Mallon had to be abandoned because, as Ms Foster said, “it did not suit” the nominated unionist Minister to attend.It was the second such meeting in two weeks “to be obstructed in this way”, according to Justice Minister and Alliance Party leader Naomi Long. But speaking in the Northern Ireland Assembly on Monday, Ms Foster rejected allegations “that we are refusing, in inverted commas, to attend meetings between the Northern Ireland Executive and the Government of the Republic of Ireland”.“That is simply not the case,” she said.But she warned NorthSouth relations “will of course be affected by the fact that the protocol is in place, because of its damage to eastwest relationships.”“We need to sort it out and we need to get rid of the protocol so we can continue to have relationships with our nearest neighbour in the appropriate way in the future,” she added.Unionists have united for a five-point plan to get rid of the protocol, a post-Brexit arrangement which puts a de facto trade barrier for goods in the Irish Sea to prevent any need for a hardening of the Border on the island of Ireland.Ms Mallon has accused the DUP of engaging in a “deliberate act” of obstructing North-South co-operation as part of its plan, adding that it was undermining the Belfast Agreement.Responding to remarks by the European Commission vice-president in charge of Brexit, Maros Sefcovic, that the protocol was the only way to protect the peace deal, Ms Foster said Mr Sefcovic “either wilfully misunderstands the Belfast Agreement or is misrepresenting it for his own ends”.“There is a need for those in Europe, in London, in Dublin as well, to listen to the voices of those of us who will not have the protocol, because it is damaging the economy of Northern Ireland,” she said.“But more than that, it is damaging our citizenship here in Northern Ireland as equal citizens of the United Kingdom, because we cannot partake in the internal market of the United Kingdom.”Asked if the North’s DUP Economy Minister Diane Dodds would attend a scheduled NSMC meeting due to take place this week, Ms Foster would only say her party was “fully aware” of its legal ministerial responsibilities.Ms Mallon had gone ahead with last Friday’s meeting “despite the fact she had been told it did not suit the nominated person who would accompany with her” under the cross-community rules of the meetings, she said.Ms Foster said the agenda and papers for the meeting had also not been agreed by her office.NSMC councils have to “proceed by agreement” and “I very much hope agreement and consensus will be sought by those Ministers setting up NorthSouth Ministerial Council meetings in future”, she added.The DUP leader met businesses in the North on Friday to discuss the costs they are suffering as a result of Brexit.“I was, I have to say, alarmed at the extra costs that those businesses are having to incur,” she told the Assembly.“Some of course are passing them on to consumers and to clients, which is very worrying as well.”Ms Foster said there has been a “reduction in choice and an increase in costs”, which she blamed on the protocol “being implemented in the fashion that it has been”.“I mean, the amount of damage being done to our businesses is quite incalculable,” the First Minister added.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald warned any refusal by unionists to participate in NSMC meetings “raises very serious questions, not just for the DUP, but for all of us”.“You can’t cherry pick the Good Friday Agreement,” she said, after meetings with other Stormont Executive parties in Belfast.“Political progress, stability and inclusion relies on all of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement working and working well.“The North-South piece is absolutely essential and that means that unionists of all hues have to participate in those meetings. I think it would obviously be hugely problematic if there was any suggestion that any strand of unionism was stepping back from that or causing a problem with the North-South mechanism.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"vaccine rollout significantly impacted by uncertainty over supplies","story":"HSE chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry: ‘We have faced many planning challenges with changes in supply, cohort definitions and clinical guidance in relation to specific vaccines.’  Photograph: Nick BradshawThe Uncertainty over supplies has remained a “top programme risk” associated with the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines, the Health Service Executive has told the Oireachtas health committee.In a briefing note supplied to members before the appearance of senior HSE officials on Tuesday, the HSE wrote that since the start of the programme, there have been a “significant number of changes to supply forecasts for all four vaccines”.The briefing document for the committee outlines how a decision taken last week to restrict the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine to the over-60s has had “a significant impact on the vaccination programme” as “new intake” healthcare workers and vulnerable cohorts had been earmarked to receive the vaccine in the coming weeks.“As a result of the change most people in those allocation groups cannot now be vaccinated with AZ. This has required a major reorganisation of the vaccination programme.” However, the health service briefing says it will “minimise the impact of this” by targeting mRNA vaccines to people in those groups who are under 60.Out of sequenceThe HSE aims to substantially complete vaccination of those aged 70 and older this week. The document also confirms that those who received their first dose of the vaccine out of sequence will be given a second dose as the HSE is “ethically obliged” to do so.It outlines that 1,502 people have been recruited as vaccinators so far, with an additional 2,404 in the recruitment process, while “no final requirement” for the number needed has been set as it will be “contingent on capacity from other vaccination channels”. At the moment, the recruitment programme is aimed at “targeting new resources and iniduals for vaccinator roles... rather than targeting existing healthcare workers.”While pharmacists are in dialogue with the HSE, the briefing flags that uncertainty around the Johnson\u0026ampJohnson vaccine has impacted on the vaccine distribution plan. It outlines that those aged 59 and under who are key workers to the vaccine programme, as well as those aged 16-59 with medical conditions that place them at a high risk of severe Covid-19, will begin being vaccinated in early May.AdministeringDr Colm Henry, the HSE’s chief clinical officer, will tell the committee that over 1.2 million vaccines have been administered, and the HSE is regularly administering 95 per cent of available vaccine within seven days of delivery.“There has been variability between manufacturers which can cause further complications to our operations team,” he will say. “We have faced many planning challenges with changes in supply, cohort definitions and clinical guidance in relation to specific vaccines.”Of 37 vaccination centres planned, 19 are operating and this will increase to 26 over the remainder of this week. Meanwhile, the early evidence of the positive impact of the vaccine programme has been illustrated through reduced mortality, disease and hospitalisations.Prof Karina Butler, chair of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) will tell the committee that due to the speed of development and rollout of vaccines, “it can be expected that there would be many changes to any recommendations”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"more outdoor activities may be possible in may says harris","story":"  Minister for Further and Higher Education Simon Harris: ‘When the Cabinet meets next week to talk about restrictions, it needs to provide a roadmap that goes beyond May.’ Photograph: Nick BradshawThe country is “on the cusp” of getting ahead of Covid-19 and the Government could look at “doing more” in terms of allowing outdoor activities next month, Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris has said.There was an onus on the Government to outline as clear a plan as possible when it meets next week to decide on what coronavirus measures to relax in May, June and July, he added.Restrictions on GAA intercounty training and high performing athletes were lifted on Monday and golf and tennis will be allowed to resume next week. Zoos, wildlife parks and heritage sites will also be allowed to reopen.Mr Harris was asked at an event on Monday what the plan was for the reopening of outdoor hospitality given comments from Taoiseach Micheál Martin that hotels and guesthouses could reopen in June.“I do think the evidence around outdoor activities, and how they can be done safely, perhaps gives hope that we can do a little bit more in the outdoor space. I think there might be the potential to do a bit more in May.“For example at the moment you can meet up outdoor with one household, is there a possibility you can do more in relation to that? Things like outdoor dining and the likes, I am not in a position to give a definitive view on, but I think we need to start answering those questions next week.”The Cabinet will meet next week to outline what can open in May, June and July subject to public health advice.“When the Cabinet meets next week to talk about restrictions, it needs to provide a roadmap that goes beyond May. We need to try and provide people with as much certainty. So I think we should be able to provide detail on what May, June and July will look like,” Mr Harris said.“If this week continues the way the last couple have, we will be able to meet as a Cabinet next week in a better position on Covid than we have been in many, many months. We are on the cusp of really getting ahead of this virus for the first time in a long time.”Mr Harris also said the Cabinet stands “full square” behind the Minister for Health after reports that his Cabinet colleagues felt blindsided after Stephen Donnelly said over the weekend that younger groups could be vaccinated ahead of time. Mr Donnelly then said the data did not support such a move.“I think it is very important that the Government speaks extremely clearly on this matter and I hope we are today,” Mr Harris said. “The vaccine programme and the order remains unchanged. What people across our country want is certainty. I think what we now need to do is stick with the system we have, get on with the job, get the jabs in the arms as quick as possible.”Mr Harris was speaking at the launch of a five-year action plan for apprenticeships which aims to see 10,000 new apprentice registrations every year by 2025.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"sorry not sorry mcdonald s mountbatten  mark a change of tone","story":"Speaking in an interview on  Britain’s Times Radio, the day after the funeral of Prince Philip, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said she was “sorry” the IRA killed Lord Mountbatten in 1979. Video: Times RadioMary Lou McDonald’s comments were not quite the full-throated apology for IRA actions that many headlines would suggest. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsMary Lou McDonald’s weekend comments on being “sorry” about the death of Lord Mountbatten were not quite the full-throated apology for IRA actions that many headlines, especially in the British press, would suggest. But they did represent a new tone from the Sinn Féin leader.When asked on Times Radio if she would apologise to Prince Charles for the death of his uncle along with two boys and a woman when his boat was blown up off Co Sligo in 1979, McDonald said: “The army and armed forces associated with Prince Charles carried out many, many violent actions on our island. I can say of course I am sorry that happened. Of course, that is heartbreaking.”You can read this either way. Sorry for the killing of Mountbatten, or sorry the whole conflict happened. The ambiguity is hardly unintentional.Asked on Monday if McDonald was apologising, Sinn Féin TD Eoin Ó Broin said it was “an admission of regret and an acknowledgement of the suffering for the family involved”.Pressed as to whether McDonald intended to go further than Sinn Féin has previously on the subject, Ó Broin replied, “I don’t know”.McDonald is a canny enough media operator to have foreseen headlines about the “apology”. That – and the fact she chose the weekend of Prince Philip’s funeral to make the statement – suggests a deliberate attempt to move the dial.Regret and sorrowWhile expressing regret and sorrow for the suffering caused by the conflict in general, Sinn Féin has never disavowed the IRA or its actions and is unlikely to start now. This is part tactical, part theology. Once you start to address inidual incidents, where do you stop?But on a deeper level, it remains a fundamental tenet of republican thinking that the IRA campaign – while admitting inidual mistakes and expressing regret for all deaths in the conflict – was morally and politically justified. That belief is ingrained in the party’s DNA.So McDonald is unlikely to rewrite that theology. But she does appear – and some party sources agree – to be trying to alter the tone, at least a bit.Her comments on Mountbatten followed a tweet expressing sympathy with Queen Elizabeth on the death of her husband. Since McDonald does not expect the queen to be closely following her Twitter account, it is fair to assume the intended audience included those referenced in the second part of the post – “those of a British identity on our island, for whom his death will be felt as a great loss”.It is unlikely, too, that she just dashed off a tweet when she heard the news. This is not the sort of thing that Sinn Féin does on the spur of the moment.Against the background of a ided Northern Executive and increasing loyalist alienation, McDonald seems to be making conciliatory noises. It is an interesting departure."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Boris Johnson poised to raise bar on UK\u0026#39s climate goals Covid-19 variants in the UK: What strains are of concern and under investigation?Tuesday morning UK news briefing: Duke of Cambridge joins Super League condemnationAstrazeneca Covid vaccine Q\u0026ampA: What we know about blood clots, side effects and risks for under-30s Covid lockdown roadmap: key dates for when restrictions will end and what rules will change on May 17Alaska to offer free vaccines at airports in a bid to boost summer tourism\u0026#39The guilt is going to stay with me for the rest of my life’: Rose Paterson’s daughter on the complex nature of suicide bereavement100ft phone masts could be built in national parks and beauty spotsPolice warned they must not abandon face-to-face contact with crime victims after Covid Britain\u0026#39s roads resemble \u0026#39surface of the moon\u0026#39, RAC warnsComment: The IRA says ‘sorry’ but where is the apology?Five big moments the jury are now considering at Derek Chauvin\u0026#39s trialRay Mears: We have forgotten how to \u0026#39be outdoors\u0026#39Derek Chauvin trial judge says \u0026#39abhorrent\u0026#39 comments by US congresswoman Maxine Waters could jeopardise verdictThe quiet making of our future queenJoe Biden orders immigration authorities not to use \u0026#39inhumane\u0026#39 terms like \u0026#39illegal alien\u0026#39Mass fossil site may prove tyrannosaurs lived and hunted in packs like wolvesPrince William: I share fans’ fears for the future of footballBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"five eyes become four new zealand takes different view china","story":"New Zealand has broken with its “Five Eyes” intelligence partners, including the UK, as it pursues a closer alliance with China, its largest trading partner.New Zealand’s attempts to now distance itself from the Five Eyes alliance will inevitably open up Ms Ardern to allegations that her administration is ignoring abuses in Hong Kong and against Uyghur Muslims in order to preserve and grow its trading relationship with China.

She\u0027s dancing in a dance crew, over in Auckland, so finally I left her there. She was 15, she\u0027s 16 now, so it\u0027s a bit emotional for me… I have not seen her for over a year.

For visitors, that’s merely an inconvenience. “But for the people trying to live, work and bring up a family in those areas, it has a negative effect on almost every part of their lives. If we truly want to level up the country, we cannot allow rural communities to become second class citizens in the digital economy.”Mr Dowden added: “We’ve struck a careful balance: we want to remove some unnecessary bureaucracy around planning that is preventing  rural communities from upgrading their mobile coverage, while making sure we protect our precious countryside.”The Government hopes cutting red tape for mobile providers will speed up the rollout of its £1billion Shared Rural Network initiative that will see companies start sharing masts to increase coverage.Only around two thirds of the UK currently has consistent mobile signal coverage, however, the proposals seek to increase that to 95 per cent by 2025.The agreement, signed last year, came after ministers initially threatened to impose a system of ‘national roaming’ on telecoms companies that would force them to share each other’s networks to improve nationwide coverage.But the plans were vociferously opposed by mobile operators who argued they would slow the rollout as they would be reluctant to invest in new infrastructure to expand rivals’ service.Under the current scheme, EE, O2, Three and Vodafone will spend £530million to share masts so users can get signal in areas their providers traditionally had a patchy network coverage.The Government has also pledged £500million to build new masts to improve signal in remote areas. On Tuesday, ministers revealed the final details of the new rules for extending phone masts as part of a short consultation ahead of a bill coming before Parliament.Under the proposals, telecoms companies will also be allowed to extend existing masts by up to 25 metre (82ft) in normal areas and 20 metres (65ft) in protected areas without council permission, and then by up to 30 metres and 25 metres overall with prior permission from local authorities.The new regime will also allow operators to erect building-based masts nearer to roads and motorways to improve signal for motorists.The proposals were welcomed by the Countryside Alliance, who said the “scandalous” lack of mobile coverage in rural areas puts lives at risk and hinders businesses.Sue Lee, head of policy at the Countryside Alliance, said: “The Shared Rural Network will connect many rural communities that are suffering due to poor connectivity and this is to be welcomed but for some communities there will be a trade off where masts need to be extended to provide coverage. “However, in areas of outstanding natural beauty or national parks, we would expect mobile operators to work with those communities to site masts as sensitively as possible to limit the impact on the countryside.”By Oliver Dowden, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and SportThe Government is on a mission to drag rural communities out of the digital dark ages.Right now, too many villages and towns are blighted with patchy and poor coverage, or sometimes no mobile phone signal at all.We’ve all been there: out on a long walk or holidaying in the countryside, you find yourself fruitlessly holding your phone in the air, trying to get a signal.For visitors, that’s merely an inconvenience. But for the people trying to live, work and bring up a family in those areas, it has a negative effect on almost every part of their lives. If we truly want to level up the country, we cannot allow rural communities to become second class citizens in the digital economy.So last year the Government struck a world-leading, £1billion deal with the UK’s major mobile firms to create a shared network of new and existing phone masts, so that we can extend geographic 4G coverage to 95 per cent of the UK. Day by day, that rural network is eliminating \u0027notspots\u0027 in shires and villages across the country.But we want to put even more power in the hands of rural communities to get the connectivity they are crying out for.The  has been a dedicated campaigner on this issue, making sure these areas aren’t left behind in the digital revolution.This week, we are taking some small but practical steps to boost that mission, making it easier for mobile firms such as Vodafone, O2, EE and Three to build, share and upgrade telecoms infrastructure across the entire country.We’ve struck a careful balance: we want to remove some unnecessary bureaucracy around planning that is preventing  rural communities from upgrading their mobile coverage, while making sure we protect our precious countryside.Some of these changes are minor, but they could make a huge difference.Our reforms will allow phone masts to be an extra five metres higher, for example, and up to two metres wider in certain circumstances, so that they can hold more equipment and so mobile operators can share them. The addition of just a few metres could boost the range of a mast by miles – transforming the connectivity of a rural community. This means we’ll get the maximum use out of the masts we already have. In turn, most importantly, it means fewer masts in the long run – helping to protect the countryside we love. Above all, we want to make sure local communities have control over their own destinies. Our proposals give them the power to direct development in their areas as they see fit.Changes will be put to the local planning authority, and there will be strong safeguards in place to protect sensitive places such as national parks, conservation of heritage sites, and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty.New masts will still be subject to certain conditions and limitations, and we’ll be publishing a new code of practice on mobile infrastructure so that planners and operators have clear, up-to-date advice on how to locate and design masts in consultation with local communities. We’ve already heeded The ’s call for action with our £1billion investment in the shared rural network. Now it’s time to bust some of the barriers that are preventing people across the UK from accessing life-changing mobile coverage.With a few practical changes, we can transform the fate of a rural village or town – propelling them straight from the digital dark ages into cutting-edge, 21st century connectivity.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ira says sorry apology","story":"You may have read that the Sinn Fein leader, Mary Lou McDonald, has “apologised” for the IRA’s murder of Prince Philip’s uncle, Lord Mountbatten, in 1979. Prince Charles has described Lord Mountbatten as “the grandfather I never had”.What Ms McDonald actually said was: “The army and the armed forces associated with Prince Charles carried out many, many violent actions on our island. And I can say, of course, I am sorry that that happened.” The “that” Ms McDonald was referring to was the murder of Mountbatten – and of those with him, including two teenage boys, aboard the boat which the IRA blew up – but the context in which she sets it transfers blame to British forces.She went on: “Of course, that is heartbreaking. My job, and I think that Prince Charles … would absolutely appreciate this…is to lead from the front, now, in these times.” It is “all our jobs to ensure that no other child, no other family…face the kind of trauma and heartbreak that was all too common on all sides ... I have an absolute commitment and responsibility to make sure that no family faces that again. And I am happy to reiterate that on the weekend that your queen buried her beloved husband.”Where is the apology?Some will think it in terrible taste for Ms McDonald to speak sweetly of the Queen burying her “beloved husband”. She well knows that the organisation her party has always supported was responsible, in a grimly different sense, for burying his uncle.The media in the Republic of Ireland are sharper on all this than ours are. The  asked Sinn Féin to clarify whether Ms McDonald was making an “apology” over the IRA attack. “Several hours after seeking clarification,” it reported, “there was no response from the party.”“Government to guarantee 95 per cent mortgages” is the headline the Conservatives want, and are getting. But does the measure, which came into effect yesterday, have any wider benefit?It will help some of those young people who take it up, in that they will have the pleasure – earlier than they otherwise would – of possessing a set of keys and coming home in the evening to a house which they feel (erroneously) is theirs. When that house sought costs ten times the annual income of the seeker, as is often the case today, they may think better of a government which seems to assist them getting it. If the market is up when their turn comes to sell, that too will please them.But the guarantee does not solve the problem of housing which is hard for young people to buy. In fact, it compounds it, because it subsidises people to pay more, thus making life all too easy for the big builders who ration the supply in order to keep the prices up. It also encourages young buyers to acquire too much debt, which will land them in negative equity if values fall, or with unaffordable repayments if interest rates rise.Sensing the problem, big banks are being cautious. Several say they will not lend for new-build housing under the scheme because its value is volatile.And so Britain’s housing shortage continues, with price rises made even worse by the current stamp-duty holiday. During Covid, millions have learnt to use their house as a place of work: some of them now look for houses more suitable for that role in future. They won’t get what they want so long as the same Tory Government which is standing partially behind 95 per cent mortgages refuses to free up the supply of actual bricks and mortar.Last Friday, Ampleforth College, won a reprieve. The famous Yorkshire Catholic independent school had been under a “restriction order” from the Education Secretary, Gavin Williamson, until it fully complied with demands from the inspectorate, Ofsted, to improve its safeguarding procedures. This meant it could admit no new pupils until compliance had been secured.The problem was that, if Ofsted’s demands had been followed to the letter, Ampleforth would have run out of time. Parents of independent-school pupils need to know that their children’s school will remain open in the next academic year. If they think it won’t, they have to secure places elsewhere. Since the school was forbidden to admit new pupils, it would run out of money and therefore close. Mr Williamson’s rescue came almost beyond one minute to midnight. He decided there was enough prospective progress for the restriction order to be lifted. The school will be inspected again in the autumn.You can see why Ofsted wanted to be sure that everything was right. But it is literally impossible for schools if they are told to make improvements and then not allowed the time needed to bed those improvements in. The word “safeguarding” has a hollow ring if every single child at a good school has his or her education sacrificed by government edict in the name of upholding safeguarding principles.Now Ampleforth lives to teach another day. With a bit of luck, two good things will emerge. The first is that the school, chastened by past failures, gets safeguarding right. That is already happening fast. The other is that Ofsted acquires a better understanding of the reality of life in schools and, in particular, stops treating independent faith schools with such hostility.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ray mears have forgotten outdoors","story":"Ray Mears has taken aim at the fashionable practices of “forest bathing” and “wild swimming”, suggesting that we have forgotten how to enjoy simply going for a walk.The bushcraft expert, presenter and author has written a new book We Are Nature, which advises readers on reconnecting with the wild.“For a lot of people these days, nature is something that’s seen solely through the television screen.

MPs on the Commons Treasury Committee will call both Tories to give evidence to their inquiry into the fallout from the collapse of the firm Greensill Capital. Mr Cameron has come under sustained criticism after it emerged that he privately texted the Chancellor on behalf of the firm, where he was hired as a paid adviser after leaving No. The Treasury released Mr Sunakaposs texts, showing that he told the ex-PM he would “push the team” to seethere were ways the firm could access emergency Covid support. But Greensillaposs request was ultimately refused and the firm filed for insolvency in March, putting thousands of British steel jobs at risk. The powerful Treasury Committee also wants to question the firmaposs founder Lex Greensill, who was an unpaid adviser in Downing Street during the coalition years. The Bank of England, Financial Conduct Authority and UK Government Investments will also face questions in the probe into the failure of Greensill and its attempts to lobby the Government. Treasury Committee chairman Mel Stride said: There are questions to be answered in relation to Greensill Capital regarding the operation of the UKaposs financial system and its regulation. Also, whether the Treasury responded appropriately to lobbying from Greensill during the pandemic. I will be writing shortly to the Chancellor, the Governor of the Bank of England, chief executive of the FCA, and David Cameron requesting answers to ious initial questions. Mr Cameron, Mr Sunak and Mr Greensill have all indicated that they will cooperate with inquiries into the row. Mr Cameron admitted that he should have used only the most formal of channels to contact ministers but said he had not broken any rules.  Seven inquiries have been launched into the collapse of Greensill Capital and the fallout from Mr Cameronaposs lobbying activities on behalf of the firm. The Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee will look at lobbying rules and whether the penalties are tough enough. It said the Greensill scandal had raised signicant concerns about the propriety of governance in this country which risks undermining public trust. Committee chairman William Wragg MP said: Standards in public le are vitally important, and I think most politicians and civil servants fulfil their roles honourably. Maintaining and defending that honourable position matters - thataposs precisely why this affair has to be scrutinised. We will look into whether the rules need tightening up and clarying and we will make any necessary recommendations without fear or favour. The MPs will examine whether codes of conduct for ministers, special advisers and officials are effective, how conflicts of interest are managed and whether the business appointment rules are broad enough. They will also scrutinise whether lobbying should be regulated and consider the issues around the use of consultants and contractors in government. Boris Johnson sought to play down the links between Whitehall and the private sector, insisting there are not loads of people working as civil servants while also employed by a business.The Prime Minister has asked lawyer Nigel Boardman to investigate after it emerged that former government procurement chief Bill Crothers worked as an adviser for Greensill Capital while in his Whitehall job.

A survey of , people by low-cost airline easyJet showed % said a summer break abroad was what they were most looking forward to when lockdown curbs relax. International travel for non-essential reasons is banned until May  at the earliest, and the Government is yet to say which countries will be placed into red, amber and green categories under its “traffic light” system for reopening the industry.

Mr Lundgren added: “The UK government need to come out as early as possible with final details of the testing regime and let the public know the tiers countries will be put into and the criteria it will use to decide those tiers. “We believe that most European countries should be in the green tier based on the protection the NHS provided Brits through our vaccination rollout and the low presence of iants of concern in most European countries.” Transport Secretary Grant Shapps admitted earlier this month that private PCR tests were “too expensive” and costs should be “driven down” to around half what they are now.

Last week, Heathrow warned that holidaymakers would face queues of more than six hours without e-gates, due to staff having to inspect every single travelleraposs paperwork manually. The new system would allow a computer to instantly check forms when a passport is tapped. “It is not the airlines’ job to check every layer of complexity, an industry insider told The Times. We have fewer staff due to the pandemic, we are already overstretched, so we don’t have resources to handle even more bureaucracy on top of what they already have to.” Long waits at the airport are not the only obstacle between Brits and a pleasant stay overseas this summer. Tests cost on average £, adding £ to the cost of a holiday for a family of four.  Yesterday it was reported that the cost of Covid tests for holidaymakers could be slashed to below £ making trips abroad much more affordable. A source from HMRC told Thethat gold standard PCR tests done at home would be free from VAT, which currently sits at £. This would cut the cheapest from £ to below £, while the most expensive would be around £. Previously the VAT exemption was only in place for PCR tests done or overseen by a registered nurse.

The show drew .million viewers - a million more than the last Queenaposs Speech - and its star Stephen McGann has demanded the MoD abandon its Pooterish nonsense and award a medal. But John, now , was unable to watch the programme. He was just  when he was sent to Christmas Island in  on National Service and believes the Cold War radiation experiments he witnessed cost the le of his son, Steven, at just four months old. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section He and we Betty were accused of killing him in  when they woke up to find he wasnapost breathing. We had put him to bed as normal, perfectly healthy. Next morning he was warm, but not breathing. We rushed him to hospital and the police were there. They took us off in separate cars, and accused us of killing him, smothering him or something,” said John. “You have to face your neighbours, the pub, your friends, all these people asking what happened. And an empty cot.” Eventually John and Betty were told they would not be charged, and were able to bury their son.  The post mortem found he died of bronchopneumonia - which should have caused a fever, loss of appetite, and breathing problems. But he showed none of these symptoms and Betty told police he was breathing normally when she went to sleep. Steven’s heart and lungs were covered in haemorrhages, which could be caused by an infection but also by microscopic malformation of the lung’s surface. Today, it’s known that the children of nuclear test veterans report  times the normal rate of birth defects, and are five times more likely to die as infants.* Read the full story of Britainaposs nuclear weapons tests at DAMNED “Bronchopneumonia is about as likely as me climbing Mount Everest. Itaposs a cover-up,” said John, now . “I’ve had cancer, I’ve got a blood disorder, I’ve lost a child, but I’m one of the lucky ones. I woke up this morning. Other people have suffered worse.” John was a private in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps and among the first , troops sent to the South Pacic to prepare the island for a series of weapons tests as Britain raced to build the bomb. He worked in the camp laundry, and between May and November  witnessed four nuclear explosions. The first three - codenamed Short Granite, Orange Herald, and Purple Granite - were failures, and were lower-yield atom bombs. A fourth, codenamed Grapple X, was prepared in a hurry and exploded with a yield of .megatons, becoming Britain’s first true hydrogen bomb.  For each, John was driven to the beach, ordered to stand with his back to the blast, and cover his eyes with his hands, without protective clothing. He said: “We were about  miles away and the heat blast was incredible. It was like someone had opened an incredibly hot oven on your back.” Between each he washed the unorms of thousands of men, including scientists and engineers who had been into the blast zone, often with recycled water contaminated from previous washing. For more than  years the Mirror has campaigned for justice for the brave men who took part in Britain’s nuclear weapons tests. The Ministry of Defence has fought back every step of the way. We have told countless heartbreaking stories of grieving mums, children with deformities, men aged before their time and widows struggling to hold their families together, all while campaigning for recognition. Two years ago we launched an appeal for a medal for the , survivors. For the first time we were able to prove some were unwittingly used in experiments. Our appeal was backed by then-Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson but his review foundered after he lost his job. It had only six meetings in two years. They never asked to meet veterans. They never questioned the evidence. Instead they asked for information from the MoD, which has a track record of denying what its own paperwork later proves. And as our medal campaign gathered steam, civil servants simultaneously withdrew public documents from the National Archives. Would anyone working in Whitehall today stay there, megatons of plutonium exploded south of the river  The test veterans and their families will never stop fighting. The Mirror will never cease to demand they are heard. Prime Minister, listen to them. Overturn this disgraceful decision. He said: We had an open-air cinema and I can remember a news item about how the engineers had constructed a small village on this sandy island nearby, and then dropped a bomb over it. When they went to assess the damage they couldnapost - the island had gone. They say now it didnapost happen, but the engineers we were stationed with swore theyaposd been the ones who built the village. At  John was diagnosed with pernicious anaemia, caused by a failure of bone marrow to produce red blood cells and a known side-effect of radiation.  He has needed injections every  months for almost  years. He had a further three children, one with fertility problems. Betty died in . “Psychologically it’s always there. I worry that it’s due to me that Steven died,” he said. “When I’ve been to give blood and they heard about the nuclear tests, they told me they didn’t want it. And when I spoke to a consultant about organ donation he said they’d need to check them, first. But yet the government says thereaposs nothing wrong with me.” "},{"url":null,"title":"inside royal vault prince philip","story":"NewsInside the Royal Vault where Prince Philip will be buried until he’s joined by the QueenThe world watched on as the Dukes coffin disappeared from the view of his we the Queen, and the  others at the service, on an electrically-powered lt  before being placed in the vaultmirrorShareCommentsByLorraine King:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video prince-philips-coffin-lowered--,customFields:,clearance:Site Only,source:bcdccbccd,sourceUrl:https:www.dailymail news article- Prince-Philips-coffin-lowered--year-old-vault-St-Georges-Chapel.html,site:Mirror,brandSafety:Undefined,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:vFrbcXE,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The -year-old Duke of Edinburgh died on April  - just two months before his th birthday.His funeral took place at the chapel but due to coronavirus rules just  mourners were allowed to attend.The world watched on as the Dukeaposs coffin disappeared from the view of the Queen, and the  others at the service, on an electrically-powered lt . The coffin then went on a -metre long journey through an underground passageway that leads into the Royal Vault. But the Royal Vault will not Philipaposs final resting place. When the Queen dies, the Duke of Edinburgh will be transferred to the gothic church’s King George VI memorial chapel to lie alongside his devoted we of  years. The vault was built between  and  underneath what is now known as the Albert Memorial Chapel . In  the space underneath held the tomb of Henry VI, then Henry VII and finally Henry VIII before it was abandoned for more than  years.  The vault was finally finished  as a memorial to Prince Albert who was the husband of Queen Victoria. It was first used to bury Queen Charlotte, the we of George III, who died in . Two years later it was the final resting place for George himself. George IV was buried in the vault in  and William IV in .  But despite there being space in there for more royals Queen Victoria built herself a mausoleum at Frogmore, in Windsor Great Park. Edward VII and George V were both interred in freestanding tombs on the floor of St George’s Chapel itself. A small extension-chapel was made to St George’s, with a vault underneath, which holds the coffin of the Queenaposs dad George VI. The Queen Mother and the ashes of Princess Margaret are also there.  During the th and th centuries several less senior members of the Royal Family have been buried in the vault. But more recently they are interred in the Royal Burial Ground at Frogmore and include the Duke of Windsor, the former King Edward VIII, who abdicated in  so he could marry American orcée Wallis Simpson. He died in  and was joined by Mrs Simpson when she passed away in . The vault is the final resting place to one foreign king – the exiled George V of Hanover, a grandson of George III, who died in .  The vault is a stone-lined room with a small altar at the far end which measures around  metres by seven metres. Along each wall are shelves to hold coffins. Close to the entrance of the vault is a plinth on which the latest arrival is placed. The coffin will either be moved to either a side-shelf or final interment where in the room.  It was originally lit with oil-lamps but this was changed to an electric light at the beginning of th century. It has not received a ‘permanent resident’ since  but the vault is used during royal funerals at Windsor.

Natalie Fernando,  and from Hockley, West Midlands, spoke about how people have told dared to tell her that her five-year-old son shouldnapost be allowed out due to him becoming so distressed at times.The mum recollected her experiences as she posted a picture of stranger Ian Shelley helping her son out as he became overwhelmed on April .In a bid to raise awareness of SEN and what those around them tackle on a daily basis, Natalie described the sort of comments received as she brought up Rudy. Weaposve had people tell us he shouldnapost be allowed out, that we should aposTake your child homeapos or people say aposWhat the hell is wrong with you  Why are you letting him behave like that apos, she told EssexLive reports. We have had stares, tuts, mutters. I remember Rudy having a meltdown in the cinema one time. We had been in the High Street and it was pouring down with rain so we went into the cinema lobby to try and get out. People were just standing around staring at this little boy going crazy and not one person said are you okay  Sadly the mum said that wasnapost the only time she was left in tears by other peopleaposs indference.So many times it has been really tough, particularly one incident in Sainsburys, she said. My son loves shopping and he likes the up and down of the aisles and I will never forget one time.Normally we go upstairs to the cafe and then go down to the shop but it was absolutely rammed in the shop.  My son wears nappyaposs and he had wet through so we had quickly changed the nappy and couldnapost stop in the cafe and it all overwhelmed him. He dropped to the floor over the escalators so I went down to his level to hold his arms and he head butted me.Not a single person stopped to askI was okay. It took nine months before Natalie found the courage to go out again, realising that she would rather give Rudy the experiences he deserves than allow judgemental people to stop them. My son is not going to be excluded from le because of peopleaposs judgement. We take him and we plan what we are doing and take him to all dferent types of places. I feel we have a duty to Rudy to help him learn and understand the world around him and I feel I have duty to others to educate them in special needs so Rudy can live in a more inclusive world.  The mum last week took to social media to share how passerby Ian Shelley had brightened her days when he stopped to askeverything was okay as Rudy grew increasingly overwhelmed. Ian had no idea about that and that is why it meant so much to me. Itaposs only a simple gesture but it meant a lot to me, she said. Natalie added: The meltdown is what everyone sees, they perceive it as aposbad behaviourapos or a child aposout of controlapos or a parent who doesnapost know how to handle them - they donapost see the distress that child is in after a tantrum or me cradling him after he has maybe hit me or punched me.

Emma Flynn made the devastating statement during the sentencing of David Logan at Preston Crown Court yesterday.The heartbroken woman lost partner Josh Flynn and two children Coby-Jay, , and Skylar, , when they were out walking the family dog in Dalton on June  last year, Lancashire Live reported. The trio were hit by a car driven by Logan, who was drunk and had been told not to drive. He careered across the carriageway and crashed into the dad, his kids and the dog, who flew into the air, according to witnesses. They died instantly. Logan, of Broughton Road in Dalton, was jailed for  years and  months. He could be released on licence after five years and five months. “One day he is going to get out, his le will go on but I will never get out,” Emma said in her victim impact statement. “I can’t see my le getting better. The minute he got behind the wheel of his car and killed my family was the minute my le stopped.  “My heart is broken and nothing will fix it. The day they died is the day my le stood still.” Emma described how her le had ‘ended’ the moment her husband, children and dog were killed. She said: “That day was just a normal day, I went off to work leaving Josh, Coby-Jay, Skylar and Tory to spend the day together. “I didn’t know that when I left them that would be the last time I saw my family alive the last time my le was normal.” Emma said she cant sleep, always feel tired and can’t eat since her family was killed. “I would do anything to bring them back into my le I feel sick all the time,” she added.  “The little things like watching TV I can’t cope with.” Emma said she was ‘scared’ to remove anything from -year-old Coby-Jay’s bedroom because it will erase the memory. “It’s not fair,” she said. “It is too much for me to handle. I would give anything to have my old le back… My husband, my kids, my dog were brutally ripped away from me by the actions of David Logan.” Emmaaposs mother, Angela, also gave a statement and said there was so much Josh wanted to do with his le.

So, a year on, what do we know  Dr Julian Spinks debunks the most common myths and misconceptions. “It’s no worse than flu” In some years flu outbreaks do cause thousands of deaths annually, but  saw more excess deaths in the UK than at any time since the Second World War. The pattern of symptoms is dferent from flu and risk of severe illness or death is higher for Covid. “It only affects old people” The risk of serious illness and death rises with age, as well as factors such as obesity. However, younger people have ended up in hospital and it can be a very unpleasant disease evenyou are not admitted. Long Covid – ongoing debilitating symptoms after Covid – is becoming more common and can affect people who had mild symptoms during the initial illness. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section “If I don’t have a cough I don’t have coronavirus”The NHS says that the three main symptoms of coronavirus are a high temperature, a new continuous cough and a change to sense of taste and smell. But you should get a testyou have any of these symptoms.“Masks lower your oxygen levels and make you ill” Masks have very little effect on oxygen or carbon dioxide levels. Surgeons have been able to wear masks during long operations without ill effects and they are standard protective equipment in ICUs. Organisations such as Asthma UK and British Lung Foundation say masks can be worn by all but the most severely affected. Adding masks to social distancing signicantly reduces the chance of catching the virus.  The World Health organisation does advise not wearing masks while exercising because it can make it hard to breathe comfortably. “Eating garlic and taking vitamins can prevent Covid”There is no evidence that eating garlic, other herbs and spices, vitamins or micronutrients reduce your chance of catching Covid or keep you out of hospital. It’s also a myth that taking a hot bath can ward off coronavirus, and that ingesting methanol, ethanol or bleach, as former US President Donald Trump once suggested, could be a cure.“Covid is actually caused by G mobile signals”  There is no plausible way that pneumonia and other Covid-related diseases could be caused by the signals from G masts. If it was G then you would expect there to be fewer Covid cases in areas yet to receive G. This is not the case. “Vaccines were rushed and haven’t been properly tested” While the usual development process has been speeded up, vaccines have absolutely all been approved by regulators. The speed of development of vaccines was not achieved by cutting corners with safety testing. The vaccines were still tested on the normal number of volunteers before they were released for general use. It’s also a myth that you can get coronavirus itself from the jab. Nor is there a link to autism or infertility. “The jab injects microchips” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

Charles and William wanted to meet with Harry alone so that they could speak their minds and nothing was misconstrued. A royal insider said: “There was no official wake after the funeral, but Charles, William and Harry took the opportunity to speak and catch-up face to face after many months apart. They were only able to spend a short time together outdoors given Covid restrictions and also without staff, including senior courtiers, overhearing what was being said. It was important to Charles and William that they were both there together. It means nothing spoken about can be misconstrued in the future.

One senior policing source told the paper: Like any high profile inidual an assessment will be made to assess the risk and threat and in the circumstances there will be no question that the Duke is afforded personal protection. Given that he will be in quarantine for most of the time and then is attending a private funeral service, the issue is also a very simple one. It is understood Harry flew back to his home in Santa Barbara, Calornia, on Monday, to reunite with heavily pregnant Meghan and son Archie, one. The Duchess of Sussex,  and who is due to give birth in the next month, was advised by doctors not to make the trip due to her condition and remained at the coupleaposs £million Montecito mansion.

They also alleged the Duchess of Sussex was left to her own devices when she had suicidal thoughts while at the palace and pregnant with Archie. The couple told the chat show star during the CBS interview streamed in March that their security had been stripped away after their move to the US. They accused Buckingham Palace of failing to protect their son by taking away their security.

This is then expected to give way to sunny spells as the day continues. After a cold blast last week, sunseekers have been taking full advantage of the sudden change with the mercury shooting up.  “One or two showers are possible across England and Wales but for the vast majority here dry and fine with sunny spells, said a Met Office forecaster.“It could be quite misty across eastern areas at first and some of these north sea coast [areas] may just stay quite misty throughout the day. He added looking at large swatches of yellow and orange on the map of the UK that temperatures could get close to C in a few places.” The temperatures though are expected to dip slightly as the week continues although it will remain mostly dry and fine.  Looking ahead to the summer and it is predicted to be the hottest for several years with temperatures hitting the s in May. Jim Dale, meteorologist for British Weather Services, told The Sun: “There will definitely be some spikes of heat as we go into summer when I expect to see temperatures in the high Cs or even the low Cs.  “This is largely because of a balancing effect which, after the colder period of weather over the past couple of months, dominated by a northerly airflow, should revert and come from a more southerly direction. This will bring more in the way of hotter weather as we go through the end of spring and into summer. “This summer could be up there with the warmer ones from the past ten years, it is more likely to turn out one of the warmer ones that to be cooler.” "},{"url":null,"title":"wally walrus finally returns uk","story":"NewsWally the Walrus finally s to UK bay after being scared off by touristsThe popular mammal, thought to have come from Greenland, was seen back in the seaside town of Tenby, Pembrokeshire over the weekend for the first time since EastermirrorShareCommentsByJonathan ColesReporter:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsWally has drawn large crowds after reappearing \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

But the Welsh Marine Le Rescue team said some of its volunteers had received verbal abuse after telling people off for getting too close to Wally in the harbour in Pembrokeshire.

The charity is now appealing for extra volunteers who will be able to help look after the walrus and make sure it is out of harmaposs way. They said: Our small team of volunteers are struggling to monitor and maintain the welfare of Tenbyaposs star attraction, Wally the walrus. The girls volunteering their time have received verbal abuse from members of the public.  Wally is being harassed by people on ious watercraft including paddleboards, kayaks, inflatables and larger boats. Unbelievably they [volunteers] have witnessed a RIB tipping something overboard in an attempt to attract Wally closer, people throwing things at him, ious large watercraft going far too fast or too close and a number of drones being flown far too close. The walrus is protected under The Wildle  Countryside Act  and it is a criminal offence to interfere with him. We have received a large number of messages enquiring about volunteering. We need feet on the ground to help maintain Wallyaposs welfare.

Pauline Boyd and her partner bought the luxury property in Blair Drummond near Stirling, Scotland to enjoy a peaceful and quiet le. But the building of a new house next door has left them with privacy concerns - and an eyeful while they eat their dinner. Ms Boyd is particularly furious as she says the local council failed to inform her of planning application details for next door.The council later made a formal apology to the couple following an investigation, reports the Daily Record. Do you have a view on this story  Let us know in the comments belowMs Boyd said: When we first got here, it was quite rural and while we had neighbours, they weren’t really in your face. “We had moved up to Turrf in Aberdeenshire but I was missing family so much that I was down every six weeks so we decided to get a base down here and I had always wanted to stay near Stirling Castle so it seemed like the perfect spot. “In January , the owner decided to sell a bit of his land near us and the property that is there now has a garage that looks right into where we eat. “There is also a shower room in the property and so we can see people through there while we’re eating our dinner, even though the windows are frosted. “It’s got to the stage that it our stress levels are really bad and really impacted our lives - we’re having to keep our shutters closed but we don’t want to be doing that.” Following an initial planning application for the property submitted in March , a second application including the details of the plans was submitted for approval in September that year. This led to Ms Boyd submitting a complaint and a council probe launched into the circumstances of the mix-up. In a letter sent to Ms Boyd in January this year, Stirling Council’s planning and building standards manager, Christina Cox, writes: “I have looked into how this error arose and hope that the following provides some explanation. The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  “The Gateway team within the planning service undertake neighbour notication of all planning applications. “In this instance, the officer correctly identied your property to be neighbour notied, however, the letter was not printed for issue. “It is likely that the officer was distracted by taking a telephone call midway through the task and did not complete the printing of the letter to issue to you.” Left angry and disappointed at the outcome, Ms Boyd has now shared that she plans to sell up and has put her home on the market. “It has been a nightmare with Stirling Council and it has been so badly mishandled in general, she said. “The systems are in place but they just don’t appear to be working becausewe had known about this garage going up, we would have built a fortress or a stronger fence. “We’re looking for a new place to live because this property is impacting our lives. We moved here for rural living but we feel like fish in a bowl and we can’t even sit in our garden because we’re looking directly on to this garage near the road. “It’s a shame that we’re having to sell because we’ve done a lot of work on the house.” In response, a Stirling Council spokesperson said that Ms Boyd’s objections to the property were properly considered in the first application and said her property was three times the minimum privacy distance from her neighbour.

Ashna Ali was caught off guard by the large land-based bird at Sydney Zoo. As the mum-of-two moved closer to aposBert the Emuapos she felt emboldened to take a snap of the pair of them. Rather than posing obligingly, the worldaposs second tallest bird breed lunged at her earlobe and snaffled her designer earring, which cost £ from Tfany. Moments before the photo is taken Bert could be seen eyeing up the sparkly piece of jewellery - while Ashna stands completely unaware of what will shortly happen.  “You can see him eyeing my earring out,” Ashna told Now. “I sat down and as I finished clicking, he just grabbed it, grabbed my ear, I felt a peck. That could have been my daughter’s eye.” Ashna was able to show photos of the suspect bird to staff at the zoo and the brazen robber was identied. Zoo employees reassured her that nature would take its course and that the earring would soon make its way out the other end of the bird. They suggested she would be reunited with the piece of jewellery in a weekaposs time.  After seven days sadly there was still no sign of the Tfany earring, however the zoo stepped in and offered to pay for a replacement. Seven days has passed, the earring has not turned up which is not surprising, weaposve been in contact with Tfanyaposs who said theyaposll make another earring which will take roughly two weeks, said zoo manager Chris Rivett.

Simpson had the perfect paper round as a teenager with Jim McLean and Jerry Kerr on her route.Pipe-smoking Kerr took United from the second tier to an established top-flight side before McLean replaced him and took the club to unimaginable heights.Greta carried her bag of  or so papers every morning but she will never forget one special delivery which summed up the magic of McLean.She went to a match with her friend Gill in .They got the bus back from Tannadice to the Scott Fyfe roundabout before Greta walked Gill to her house on Arbroath Road when the heavens opened.Greta started to walk the final stretch home to Broughty Ferry in the monsoon with her United scarf on when McLean#s car pulled up alongside her.#He stopped on the Arbroath Road and gave me a lt home because he recognised me,# said Greta.#I was in awe of him because he was the Dundee United manager and I think that gesture just summed up the magic of the man.#I remember thinking how nice it was of him to stop and take me home.#He had the common touch.#Greta went to her first match with Gill in April  when United beat Rangers at Tannadice - against all the odds.#After that my friend Gill and I were ‘hooked’ and kept going back,# she said.Greta, who now lives in Highland Perthshire, went to Forthill Primary and Grove Academy and got a paper round from the shop in Claypotts Road in  aged .#I had a paper round in Broughty Ferry where I grew up,# she said.#As an avid Dundee United fan, who attended all the home matches back then, I was proud to deliver papers to Jerry Kerr who was their manager until .#I was in awe of him as well and I used to call him Mr Kerr or Sir!#On Sundays, my paper bag and bike were weighed down just with his papers!#He ordered pretty much every Sunday paper available and had them delivered to him.#He would very rarely come to the door even though I knew he was there because I could smell his pipe smoke.#I suspect there were times when he wouldn#t want to come to the door to speak to meUnited had not played very well on the Saturday afternoon.#It took ages to post them, one at a time, through quite a small letterbox.#He clearly wanted to read every match report available!#Kerr was the man who steered United to their first big European success when they beat Barcelona home and away in the old Fairs Cup in .That amazing success on their European debut was just seven years after he took over a team that were languishing just about the bottom of the old Second Division and got them back to the top flight after an absence of almost  years.#When Jerry retired, the legend Jim McLean took over as manager,# said Greta.#He was also on my round but was less demanding than his predecessor in terms of the volume of Sunday newspapers.#I didn#t see him very often but he was always very polite and very respectful although we would never talk about football at the front door.#I wouldn#t ask about football because I think he had enough on his plate!#He was a nice man away from the touchline.#Jim would always say hellohe saw me in Broughty Ferry.#Greta said the highlight of her paper round back then was delivering papers to the unmarried players’ hostel in Seafield Road.#As a young impressionable teenager, and enthusiastic Arab, I occasionally met some of my football idols and got their autographs,# she said.#These were happy days with early starts and some good ‘tips’ from customers.#It was an early introduction to being independent and working hard.#The only downside was the weather and the sheer weight of the canvas bag which would be stuffed full of papers and slung over one shoulder.#I think still to this day my left shoulder hangs down lower than my right!#Greta would hang up her paper bag in  to become a Saturday girl in Boots although she would continue to see McLean and Kerr in Broughty Ferry.#I stopped going to Tannadice when I got the job in Boots and had to make do with the highlights on a Saturday night although I would always go to the cup finals,# she said.Despite modest resources, McLean led United to a league title and two League Cup successes, a UEFA Cup final, a European Cup semi-final and five Scottish Cup finals.On top of that, he unearthed a succession of great players from Dave Narey to Duncan Ferguson, with a list too many to mention in between.Greta said: #To be a United supporter in the late-s and s was just amazing and you could never have imagined that the club would reach these heady heights when you started going to watch them as your local team back in the s.#For a while Dundee seemed to have the edge over United but Jim McLean took things to another level and the success we enjoyed was unimaginable.#The obvious highlight for me was being at the UEFA Cup Final second leg against Gothenburg.#Despite not lting the cup, the occasion showcased great football as well as an amazingly friendly atmosphere with true camaraderie amongst fans of both teams both during and after the match.#Greta still follows United#s fortunes and said she only has happy memories of her time delivering the news to Jerry Kerr and Jim McLean.We asked news boys and girls, past and present, to share their stories of being the doorstep heroes who get The Courier and Eveningto our readers.Pat Lawrence was born and brought up in Invergowrie and took on her first paper round from Davie Nicoll#s shop with her friend Anne when she was  in .#Virtually everybody in the village got their papers and milk delivered from the local shop in those days,# she said.#We had to be at the shop by am and sort our own papers and we didn’t just deliver The Courier but every other local or national.#Once we got used to it we didn’t have to write the customers’ names on the top of each one which saved time as we only had an hour or so before getting ready for school.#There were no house numbers as such in those days, just dferent ‘lands’ along the Main Street.#We split the round between us.#Anne did the top half of the street and I did the bottom.#She also delivered the Eveningand the Sunday papers until she was .#I can#t remember what I got paid but it was good to earn my own money for the first time

shared memories of his paper round with Blackness Road newsagent Willie Wiseman which paid him  shillings.The round included the top half of Rosefield Street, Peddie Street, Annfield Row and Annfield Street.#To a young lad of , in the dark early mornings, I remember some of the old closes with their gas lights, seemed quite creepy and scary, especiallya dog started barking from behind one of the doors,# he said.#I would be up and down these stairs quite quickly!#Accompanying me was my small transistor radio, listening to the new station, Radio One, with the early morning show presented by Tony Blackburn and his on air dog, Arnold.#At Christmas time, Willie and his we would lay on a wee party for his paper boys.#He was a nice guy.#Fred moved to Ardler where he got another paper round at  shillings a week although he would get five pence deducted for every wrong delivery!#My round was a block of three multis, Cawder, Downfield and Edzell Courts.#The job included delivering two heavy

gin firm, The Teasmith, are raising a glass after securing a six-figure sum as their first export deal.Husband and we team Nick and Emma Smalley, who live in Udny, Aberdeenshire, have spoken of their delight at bagging a signicant deal with the USA#s biggest independent wine retailer.Creating their gin in , The Teasmith, which is the firm#s original recipe, is distilled with hand-picked tea # a botanical inspired by the north-east#s history and links to the tea trade.The award-winning gin uses botanicals associated with Aberdeenshire and is distilled in Perthshire’s Strathearn Distillery.It will be stocked in shops across  Total Wine # More stores across  states from May with , bottles heading west. This is the product’s first-ever export deal and the drinks retailer will look to have further stock shipped stateside over the next three years providing signicant revenues as part of an ongoing partnership.The deal has come at a crucial time for the business which has faced several setbacks due to Covid- restrictions.Nick said: “Our clientele is mostly small independent shops and high-end hospitality venues, both of which have had their operations signicantly disrupted over the last year and will take some time toto the productivity levels we were used to pre-Covid.“This agreement with Total Wine # More is hugely signicant for us as a brand, not only because it positions The Teasmith prominently within the expanding US gin market, but it also gives us the security to continue to develop the business and explore further opportunities.”The Teasmith first attracted the attention of the American retailer at Scotland Food # Drink and Scottish Development International’s Showcasing Scotland event at Gleneagles Hotel in October .James Withers, chief executive of Scotland Food # Drink, added: “The Teasmith is a fantastic example of a local Scottish brand making a big impression at an international level and this deal is an excellent example of the opportunities which are created at events like Showcasing Scotland.“By bringing Scottish producers together with international buyers, Showcasing Scotland gives businesses like The Teasmith the opportunity to make vital connections which can pave the way for deals like this one.“It has been an incredibly tough year for Scotland’s food and drink producers with the impact of Covid- and now real export challenges as a result of Brexit. So, it is great to hear some good news and it is confirmation that there are still new opportunities out there for us to grasp.“We have world-class products and more people wanting to source from Scotland. It is cause for real optimism, despite the current challenges.”The husband and we duo are now targeting export opportunities in Canada and Asia, while deals in the EU look unlikely given ongoing complications following the Brexit transition period concluding on December  .HMRC figures cited by trade body The Gin Guild recently revealed UK exports of gin to the EU dropped by % in , with Brexit causing time consuming and costly logistical dficulties for gin distillers and their suppliers.Nick added: “Our bottles are made in Spain and our corks are produced in Italy so both items were tied up in y delays caused by Brexit. We then faced issues with our packaging supplier who had a shortage of cardboard stock due to increased online shopping sales.“We had to do quite a bit of renegotiating on the timeline with the client, who has been incredibly supportive and understanding of the situation, but it has been a very stressful couple of weeks, and we’re relieved to have fulfilled this initial order.”Isle of Skye businesses team up to bring luxury five-course pop-up experience to sea\" title\"#Isle of Skye businesses team up to bring luxury five-course pop-up experience to sea# # Evening Express\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp lestyle food-and-drink isle-of-skye-businesses-team-up-to-bring-luxury-five-course-pop-up-experience-to-sea embed # secretFLnSNqL\" data-secret\"FLnSNqL\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Seaspiracy # Scottish fisherman on what fishing sustainably in Scotland looks like\" title\"#Seaspiracy # Scottish fisherman on what fishing sustainably in Scotland looks like# # Evening Express\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp lestyle food-and-drink seaspiracy-scottish-fisherman-on-what-fishing-sustainably-in-scotland-looks-like embed # secretUyGiiwns\" data-secret\"UyGiiwns\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/04/2-4.jpg ","title":"graffiti artists new mural aberdeen cat dog home","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remTwo talented graffiti artists have brightened up a play area at Mrs Murray#s Home for Stray Dogs and Cats.After asking its loyal social media following to recommend local artists who could liven up the animal shelter#s outdoor area, graffiti artists Skeps and Hobble Graff got in touch with proposed artworks.Centre manager Marie Simpson said: #We just wanted to brighten up the area and make the space more fun.#It was just a plain wall and the play area is meant to be a fun space.#When we were looking at that blank wall, we always thought that it would be ideal to be jazzed up with some artwork or painting.#It was not something that we could do, so we popped a little note on our Facebook page to askanyone could recommend people who would be willing to give up their time.#Skeps and Hobble got in touch and showed Mrs Murray#s staff the work they#d done in the past # Marie said it was exactly what they were looking for.#It was cartoony, bright and funny,# said the centre manager.The graffiti artists created the mural digitally first and emailed Marie a picture of it.She said: #We thought it was fantastic.

It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began. After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus. The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-.

This is mainly due to massive insecticide use and habitat loss caused by intensication of agriculture.Up to  per cent of flowering plants and  per cent of commercial crops require insects for pollination, with honeybees and hoverflies most often doing the job.But with declining numbers of these species, farmers may employ hives of bees to prevent crop yields falling.Wild honeybees forage within three miles of their nest, and onthey perform the #waggle dance# that advertises the location of productive foraging sites to other bees. Also, odours from scented flowers picked up inside the nest while unloading pollen act as cues to guide nest-mates to specic flowers.Now scientists have articially imprinted bees with flower odours in an attempt to improve crop yields*.In trying to establish long-term memory for flower odours, the scientists offered bees in three separate groups of hives alternative odours:  sucrose solution scented with synthetic sunflower odours,  sucrose solution scented with jasmine odours,  sucrose solution alone. They then relocated the hives to a sunflower plantation and compared the foraging activities of bees exposed to the three solutions.First, scientists decoded waggle dances to identy sunflower-specic dances. Using this information, they observed bees from hives fed with sunflower odours performing sunflower dances one hour after hive relocation.Contrastingly, the control bees fed jasmine odours took - hours and control sucrose-fed bees took  hours to perform sunflower dances.This resulted in the sunflower odour-imprinted bees performing signicantly more sunflower-specic waggle dances during the first day of relocation, peaking at  per cent increase over control hives preferentially visiting sunflowers and bringing in more sunflower pollen loads than the control bees.The scientists then measured the all-important crop yields in five plots containing dferent sunflower hybrid plants pollinated by sunflower odour-imprinted compared to control bees.Seed yields in all five plots were highest when pollinated by sunflower odour-fed bees, with increased production up to  per cent above control bees.They conclude that providing bees pre-programmed to forage on specic crops could circumvent wild pollinator shortages and signicantly increase crop yields.*Current Biology , -.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tons of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m stated by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast-track decision making.John Gurr  Sir,I heard that there was work going on in Lochgilphead town centre, and that some people were complaining, about mess and upheaval. No change there then!When I observed the work, I was so surprised at the dference this will make to the town and to the moaners I say #you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs#.When I spoke to them, the workforce were polite and commented that they were looking forward to the end result.For too long now Lochgilphead has been the Cinderella of Argyll and Bute now it seems she will go to the Ball.From a very satisfied resident.Name and address suppliedSir,Just ahead of WWF’S Earth Hour last year, the country was put into lockdown due to the Covid- pandemic. As we look ahead to this year’s event on Saturday March  at .pm, many of us are reflecting on the future, as we emerge from the latest, and hopefully last #stay at home# period.With that in mind, we are asking people to use Earth Hour by helping us to create the #Great Scottish Canvas#. Switch off your lights and by candlelight or torchlight, use the hour to paint a picture, craft a poem, doodle or write something which illustrates the future Scotland you want to live in.With so many eyes on Scotland this year, due to Scottish Parliament elections in May and the vital COP climate talks in November, we want to show the world the vision of the Scottish people, for a greener and fairer society for us all. Find out more at the www.wwf.org.uk website.I look forward to seeing the things you believe will make Scotland a better place, perhaps changing the way we heat our homes, how we travel around our towns and cities, or even how we grow the food we eat.Lang Banks, director, WWF Scotland, EdinburghSir,Tuesday March  marked the anniversary of the day the UK entered lockdown.

While saving in some areas of expenditure, it has incurred extra costs in tackling the pandemic and faces an uncertain funding future while the national economy tries to recover. The drive to save money in services where bringing in a little more through, for example, parking fees and fines, is understandable up to a point.But when the economy is on le support after a pandemic, surely the relatively paltry sums to be made are not worth the potential damage to Inveraray#s recovery, as seems to be the view of locals Perhaps councillors could look at this a little dferently. If they are determined to push this through for control traffic purposes, why not donate the proceeds, which would be a by-product of well-behaved traffic, to the town  The pier fund could certainly use it. Both the community council and Inspire Inveraray would no doubt welcome the cash and find many uses for public benefit.Just a thought.Congratulations to Cameron on his award. This is a huge achievement among a group of young people who each work hard for others.It is also  a great achievement for MacLeod Construction to be shortlisted for a national award.

However, on further reading, this was yet another unsurprising disappointment. The preferred corridor through Glen Croe is still to be announced and there is still no timetable for completion.Landslips at the Rest and be Thankful have frequently seen much of Argyll isolated from central Scotland, or journeys delayed by endless roadworks or convoys along the old military road. Most of these problems have occurred during the SNP’s  years in government and the continued failure to provide a permanent solution is yet more proof of how little the SNP cares about or understand the needs of people and businesses outside the central belt.It was clear long ago that patchwork schemes were not a solution but, rather than provide a new corridor which would have resulted in major capital expenditure, tens of millions of pounds have instead been wasted on years of ineffective schemes which nature evades in next to no time.In the meantime, the SNP has had no dficulty finding money to prop up central belt vanity projects like the Edinburgh trams.Mike Russell, SNP MSP for Argyll and Bute, has been far more concerned with Indyref and Brexit than the day to day concerns of his constituents and has done nothing to ensure that providing a reliable road connection to Argyll is a top priority for Michael Matheson, the Cabinet Secretary for Transport.The Holyrood elections on May  are an ideal opportunity for the residents and business owners in Argyll, whose daily lives are affected by such an unreliable road, to voice their dissatisfaction and vote for anyone other than the SNP or the Greens who oppose any road building on principle.A dferent government might not guarantee a speedy resolution, but after  years of failed sticking-plaster attempts to patch up the existing road, it certainly couldn’t be worse.Donald McCallum, Strathaven.Sir,Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signage.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples. In my opinion in the future Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs.Road signs help to regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important previews, especially during night-time conditions.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I write further to correspondence on Lochgilphead#s expensive new pavements.When they are finally finished, could somebody seethey have a bucket or two of tarry stones left over that could be chucked into the tank trap that passes for a roundabout, next to the Tesco garage David Hay, MinardSir,I have immense pleasure in communicating to your readers our new address following our successful relocation of our main office premises.Our email, website and telephone numbers remain the same as before.Email: info@abcab.org.uk and phone  .We have had no break in service and continue to provide advice and support to clients across Argyll and Bute, with our advisers all working from home under current government guidance.We are also available to provide advice to those who find themselves in a vulnerable position and require face-to-face advice by appointment in our Helensburgh and Lochgilphead offices.We commence our second volunteer adviser training programme next month and look forward to welcoming our new trainees.Jen Broadhurst, Bureau Manager, Argyll and Bute Citizens Advice BureauSir,Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year. Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.James O’Connell, Unite regional officer for Scotland.Sir,I work for a TV company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who are wanting to live a simpler le.

When we hear of something that is dficult to believe, we want the evidence of our own eyes.Jesus#s disciple Thomas was like that. It was the week after the crucixion had destroyed their dreams. The disciples were huddled indoors in fear of their lives when suddenly the resurrected Jesus was there among them.Thomas hadn#t been with the others when it happened. He just could not bring himself to believe without seeing him for himself. Thomas gets a bad press because of this.We often react to this wee excerpt from Thomas#s story aswe would have been less reluctant to believe. We carry our willingness to believe as a badge of faith. Poor old Doubting Thomas.But is doubt a weakness  Or is it simply an opportunity, a space, a fertile ground in which faith might grow and ultimately blossom A week later, the disciples were gathered again in the same house where they had last seen Jesus. This time, Thomas was with them. Once again, Jesus came and stood among them. He greeted them again, #Peace be with you,# before turning and addressing Thomas directly.He said to him: #Put your finger here and see my hands. Put your hand in my side. Do not doubt but believe.#Jesus#s words are aimed not only at Thomas, but at everyone who encounters this story, and struggles to believe that God is capable of doing the very thing that God has promised — call our world into new and unending, resurrected le.#Do not doubt but believe.#"},{"url":null,"title":"american dream continues for bob","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

You can also plant the first early potatoes, weather dependent.For beginners, some of the easiest fruits to grow are berries. Strawberries and blueberries love containers or open ground and both will crop heavily once established.A simple garden solution for April is to create your very own veg patch. Mark out the area well, prepare the soil, dig in compost and then sow a iety of seeds that will provide you with veg all year round.It’s a common misconception that you need a lot of space to be able to grow vegetables. You can still achieve real success with container grown plants. Tomatoes will thrive in pots and grow bags and can also be grown in the ground.Another plant that loves container leis Lavender – and it’s the perfect time to plant it so that you can enjoy it throughout the summer. It’s a favourite with gardeners not just for its beautul form and fragrance but also because it attracts essential pollinators such as bees and butterflies.It’s considered a romantic flower that most gardeners get the urge to plant in their garden sooner or later and can add real value with its scent and shades of purple flowers and silver leaf backdrop. To successfully grow lavender, it needs to be planted in a warm, well drained soil with full sun. It is often planted as an edging plant with roses or grown as an informal hedge. However, lavender does not like ‘wet feet’ as it promotes root rot and dampness is often the reason that it doesn’t perform well. It’s a tough plant though and once established only requires regular pruning after flowering has finished in the autumn.April not only sees the start of National Gardening Week , but it really kicks off the gardening season.Top April tips from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 9 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of .  The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we’re delighted this funding means they can continue. Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet. This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le. It’s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans’ community give each other, helping each other through dficult time. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we’d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.Brian Sloan, Age Scotland chief executive "},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures april 9 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Online records showed his birthplace as #Inchial Argileshire#, which turned out to be the parish of Glenorchy and Inishail at the head of Loch Awe.Alexander McNab was born there to Alexander senior and Margaret McNab in  # one of a family of three brothers and four sisters # and moved south to Burnley in Lancashire in the s. In Lancashire in , he married Janet Wardrope, who came from Milngavie outside Glasgow, and they went on to have  children.Going back a few generations, Clare#s research has traced Alexander#s great grandfather, John McNab, born in Kilbrandon in the area around Loch Melfort in .His son Peter, born around , went on to farm in Connel and is recorded in the  census as an -year-old farming  acres at South Ledaig, though is described as a #smith# in an earlier record.Born in , Peter#s son Alexander grew up to work in farming around Glenorchy. In the  census he is recorded as a ploughman at Barbreck.#Our# Alexander seems to have been a blacksmith when he moved from Argyll to Burnley to start a new le.Sadly, two of Alexander and Janet#s family died as young children.Later, however, they found themselves # like so many other families # caught up in the horrors of the First World War.They lost three sons # Andrew, aged , missing in action,  Alex, , missing in action  and John, , missing in action  # during the war.The grief the family must have borne is unimagineable.

A short newspaper report from the time describes him as a #retired blacksmith#.Clare was born in Blackpool and moved to Tees-side, via a spell in Dumfries, through her husband David#s employment.Though her great grandmother Grace passed away in , Clare believes she can detect echoes of the past in her own family today.She explained: #My son, who is in army, has just trained in music and learnt the bagpipes.#Little bits keep popping up. My other son is into blacksmithing, which is also in the family.#And while she has never visited Argyll, Clare would love to at some point once Covid restrictions have eased.#I had a look at images of Loch Awe and have been reading up about the area.

It was not the practice to make public the particulars in cases where those responsible for criminal investigation were satisfied that no crime had been committed but he might mention, for the satisfaction of the honourable member and those on whose behalf the question was put, that on recovery of the body what was observed tended strongly to confirm the accuracy of the statements which had been made at the time by those who were with the deceased when the accident took place.#PICS:Alexander McNab, born Argyll in , at two stages in le. no_aMcNab_story_AlexClare#s great grandmother, Grace McNab Bridge, as a young woman in the early th century. no_aMcNab_story_GraceGrace in later years. no_aMcNab_story_GraceClare Frith has been researching her family history. no_aMcNab_story_ClarePrivate Andrew McNab, one of three McNab brothers killed during the First World War. no_aMcNab_story_Andrew"},{"url":null,"title":"ian pops up with new ball","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This has allowed us to concentrate on a purely on-the-water racing event which reduces contact possibilities. It is also important we reduce the movement of crew as much as possible.#By moving the event to the Clyde, we have taken a massive step towards achieving this goal, however, it is clear we need to take measures a bit further.

Each route takes visitors on a real pilgrimage to ancient Christian landmarks, through remote and impressive landscapes.#Whilst Faith in Cowal is a Christian organisation, the routes are open to people of all faiths and none and provide the perfect way to connect with the wild beauty Cowal has to offer. Some of the sites that book-end each trail date as far back as the th and th centuries as well as more ancient landmarks such as Auchnaha Cairn that are thought to be Neolithic in origin.#The walks take in locations close to the major settlements and population centres of Cowal including Strachur, Dunoon, Kilfinan and Colintraive but they#re unlike any other path you#ll find. These are not all neatly manicured and waymarked trails. We have deliberately kept them dynamic and wild by making use of forestry roads and ancient heritage paths. Many of the routes require short, improvised hikes between paths so you#ll feel like a real pilgrim forging your way through the landscape.#There are detailed guides on our website as well as downloadable GPS tracks. We hope as many visitors to Cowal as possible will take this opportunity to step in the footsteps of ancient pilgrims and travellers, enjoy the wonderful scenery of Argyll and explore fascinating sites of genuine spiritual and religious importance,# added Dan.PICS:A map of the routes. no_aFootstepsFaithPhotos: subtlesensorHistoric Kilmun church, on the shores of the Holy Loch. no_aFootstepsFaith_©subtlesensor_Kilmorich graveyard, Cairndow. no_aFootstepsFaith_KilmorichGraveyard©subtlesensor"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 16 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

One of the highlights from last year’s event included celebrity supporters dressing up as much-loved characters to recreate tea party scenes from the world of film. Phyllis Logan was Mary Poppins, music producer Naughty Boy was Jay Gatsby, Emma Barton was Holly Golightly and Jess and Natalya Wright were Alice in Wonderland and the Queen of Hearts.Families with dementia have been adversely affected by the lockdown for just over a year. Care home visiting restrictions, the closure of support and respite services and the resulting social isolation and loneliness has disproportionately affected people living with dementia and their family carers.Whilst Time for a Cuppa will be slightly dferent this year, we know dementia support is needed more than ever. We are so grateful to all of our fundraisers who will be whipping up treats, enthusiasm, funds and giving their time for others – in a socially distanced way, of course – in what will be a very special and important Time for a Cuppa.For more information about Time for a Cuppa and how to host a tea party with our free fundraising pack, visit the dementiauk.org timeforacuppa webpage.Dr Hilda Hayo, Chief Admiral Nurse and Chief Executive Officer of Dementia UK."},{"url":null,"title":"outdoor centres to help argyll schools","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The good news though is that itrsquos very much less likelythat you will get covidyoursquore vaccinated, compared to someone who isnrsquot.Even better, in the unlikely event that you do catch Covid after being vaccinated, you are much less likely to get severe symptoms or be hospitalised thanyou had not been vaccinated.The clinical trials for the Pfizer vaccine reported a % efficacy, which means that the number of people who showed symptoms of covid during the time of the trial was % lower in the vaccinated group than in a comparison group who were not vaccinated.Data collected since the trials, as the vaccines have begun to be used widely, has confirmed these numbers, so the vaccines are very effective on a population scale. On a inidual scale, though, there is still a chance that you might be one of the very few people who is vaccinated and still gets infected it is possible, just very much less likely than without a vaccine.One extra point to add here is that the vaccines take time to work.The vaccine is not a instant shot of protectionit is a way to train your immune system, so that your immune system will then protect you. It takes - weeks or so for the immune system to respond so, evenyou are someone who has a superb immune response to the vaccine, you are still not protected until - weeks after the jag.Some cases of people being infected with covid after the vaccination are because they were exposed to the virus during this - week window. Be especially cautious during this time.Can I still infect other people Just as the vaccines make it much less likely that yoursquoll get infected, they also make it much less likely that you will be able to infect others ndash but in both cases the answer is that the chances are much reduced, but not zero.We donrsquot fully understand why some people are fully protected and others are not it might be that you have a slightly quirky immune system, or are immunosuppressed it might be that you are exposed to an unusually high dose of the virus.It might be something in your genes or environment that makes you a particularly good target for the virus.When the first trials were conducted to test how well the vaccines work, the data that was collected measured the number of people who showed symptoms of disease. This number was reduced % in the Pfizer trial.The trials did not attempt to measure whether vaccinated people could still be infectious. We have some really encouraging data now, collected after the trials from countries where vaccines have been used widely, showing that vaccination does also reduce transmission ndash meaning that vaccinated people are less likely to infect othersthan people who are not vaccinated.This is what we expected and hoped for, and itrsquos really good to see. This is why being vaccinated not only protects ourselves, but also others.Viruses cannot live for long periods on their ownthey need a person to provide a home.If you are successfully vaccinated, then your body is trained to refuse entry to the virus, denying it that home.When only a few people are vaccinated, the virus can fairly easily find another person, another home to occupy. When very many people are vaccinated, finding a home becomes much more of a challenge, and the virus is condemned to a lonely death outside.The idea of working together by using our immune systems to reduce the number of opportunities that the virus has to gain a foothold and spread is whatrsquos called ldquoherd immunity.Even the rare people in whom the vaccine didnrsquot work very well can be protected this way, as other peoplersquos vaccinations mean that they too are less likely to encounter the virus.Can I stop wearing a facemask when Irsquom vaccinated No. The importance of a face mask is that it is a barrier to stop you infecting other people.We still need to be cautious to avoid infection, and to avoid infecting others, until the amount of virus circulating in our communities falls.The Covid vaccines are one part of our toolkit for reducing the amount of virus circulating. They make it less likely yoursquoll get infected, less likely yoursquoll get sick, and less likely yoursquoll breathe out the virus and spread it to others.But there is still a small chance that each of these steps can happen, and so facemasks, space and distance are all still needed just now.The gradual easing of restrictions that is beginning just now is possible because wersquove successfully driven case numbers down, in part through the vaccination programme.If we can keep this up, then we will get to a point when case numbers are low enough that restrictions will ease yet further, and facemasks might then become optionalin more places.Will immunity last We are optimisticthat immunity will last ndash but not yet certain.The first people to receive the Covid vaccines were only vaccinated  months ago, so we know that vaccines can generate immunity that lasts at least  months.We know that the majority of people who have been infected with the SARS-CoV virus, that causes Covid, also have persistent immune cells and good antibody levels, even a year after infection.There was a lot of fear that immunity would not last, and there are been some prominent cases where people have been shown to be infected twice ndash so in those particualr people, immunity was either not persistent or not ever good enough.But for the majority of people, infection has led to persistent immunity, so far.Another piece of encouraging news is that particular immune cells, essential for protection, were still detectable last year in people who were infected in  with SARS, which was a severe infection caused by a similar coronavirus to the one that causes Covid.So we are optimistic, but will only know for certain when more time has passed.Another twisthere, is whether immunity generated by having one of the current vaccines will be effective against any virus iants: lasting immunity might not be useful,the virus mutates and can escape that immunity. But there are grounds for optimism here toohellipWill I need a booster ... There are two situations in which a booster might be useful.The first one is immunity doesnrsquot last long enoughwithout a booster, and in that case a third jag is definitely a possible solution.The second one is the virus mutates or ies, and we need to update our vaccines to match the new iants. The coronavirus that causes Covid is one that is known to mutate ndash thatrsquos a normal part of its biology.The flu virus is another example of a virus that we know mutates, and thatrsquos why flu vaccines are updated and given every year.But the Covid vaccines have held up well so far: the vaccines currently being used in the UK were designed against the original version of the virus, but have done very well in reducing disease and blocking transmission of the B.. Kent iant, for example.The immune response generated by the vaccines is strong, and evenit is two fold less effective against a new iant, there is a good chance the remaining immune response will still be enough to prevent severe disease and slow the spread of the virus.Another piece of good news is the way that these new vaccines have been designed makes it a relatively simple process to update them,new iants make that necessary.If we do need boosters, that too should be achievable.Will everything go back to normal once everyone has had both doses The gradual easing of restrictionsthat have begun now reflects the success of our collective ability to reduce the amount of virus circulating, and getting people fully vaccinated is a large part of this success.I hope that this gradual process will continue as the vaccination programme is completed, and more normality will be achieved in each step.That said, we are still a long way away from everyone having both doses, as we need vaccinations to be completed globally before any inidual country can fully relax.Within the UK, the vaccination programme is currently planned for all adults, but vaccines for teenagers and younger children are only in the stage of clinical trials.Globally, some restrictions on international travelmight need to persist until global vaccination rates increase, and those gobal vaccination rates depend on politics and cooperation between nations.Another aspect to this question is what normal really means.The pandemic hit us hard and for people whorsquove been bereaved, who have persistent symptoms or Long Covid, or whose jobs and livelihoods have been affected, normal wonrsquot ever be as it was.And as communities, there are also changes both good and bad.Will hand sanitiser provision in supermarkets continue  Will working from home always be more possible  Will high streets rejuvenate  There are opportunities for change here,we want to grasp them but there may also need to be time to heal and recover."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-peeblesshire-tests-people-without-symptoms","story":"CORONAVIRUS tests for people without symptoms are being offered in Peeblesshire again from today.In a press release issued by NHS Borders last week, the health board outlined plans for rapid testing sites toacross the region.Tests will be offered in West Lintontodayand tomorrow.COVIDtesting will alsoin Peeblesand Innerleithenover the weekend.:Fire started deliberately in Peeblesshire, suspect police ndash appeal issuedTesting will take place at the fire stations of all the above locations between .am-pm.NHS Bordersrsquo director of public health, Dr Tim Patterson, said: ldquoCommunity testing of those who feel well and do not have any typical COVID- symptoms is one of the key ways that we can keep each other safe.

It underlines the fact that it is communities who know best what is best for them.Argyll and Bute Council was at the centre of ensuring our resilience teams got support and Scottish Government funding dispersed quickly and efficiently.That is why I find the decision of the Tory Lib Dem Independent ruling administration to remove the recycling service from Kintyre Recycling Ltdand taking it in-house as short-sighted. And giving them only six months notice is disgraceful.KRL has provided a reliable service for the community since  and given employment opportunities to people with barriers to work. It has a committed board and management team who have ersied the projects it does to ensure sustainability. But this decision leaves a gaping hole in its business plan and a workforce unsurethey will still have jobs.There is a projected increase in cost of £, to supply recycling bins across Kintyre. But this does not take account of the possible social and welfare cost of the impact on the workforce. This is yet another blow to the community already hammered by unemployment.I urge the council to work closely with KRL to find a solution that ensures that all of the KRL employees at risk of redundancy are found suitable employment and that this valuable organisation can continue to employ vulnerable people providing services from which everyone benefits.In , the SNP published a coloured map showing options for the route of the A at the Rest and Be Thankful. Nine years later, all they have done is colour in the map slightly dferently. We are no further forward.Whoever is in government after the election must stump up the money needed to construct a road protected from landslides. This must be done a lot quicker than the  years the SNP say it will take them.Without urgent action, many businesses in Argyll will not survive.Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signs.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside of Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples.In my opinion, in the future, Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs. Road signs help regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important preview especially during night-time conditions.I will continue to campaign for more frequent road sign maintenance for every corner of my ward.Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason, Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year.Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.I work for a television company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who want to live a simpler le. The filming will take place over a number of months this year in rural Britain.The idea behind the series is about saying goodbye to smartphones, Zoom calls, social media # all the distractions and pressures of normal le # to go and live a simpler le, experience the #good le# fantasy and think about what our modern le and its multitude of choices has really given us. We will explore the idea of whether, in fact, less is more.We are looking for people of all ages to apply families, couples, single people # to take time out from their normal le and step into a dferent way of living.If any of your readers are interested in finding out more, they should email simplele@fivemilefilms, telling us briefly why you would like to live a simpler le.Since the UK was first officially plunged into lockdown, we have lived through what is probably the most extraordinary year in most people#s letimes.Blind and partially sighted people have had to adjust like everyone  to the daily challenges this has created. Thankfully, there#s now light at the end of the tunnel. But some ongoing measures could continue to be barriers to their independence and confidence.People with sight-loss can sometimes find it dficult to judge space, so we#re asking everyone to maintain their own distance, be patient and be helpful.Just getting out and about can be more hazardous for those without sight. The government#s #Spaces for People# initiative has already transformed many of our streets and thoroughfares.We must take care that this doesn#t inadvertently create new obstacles for those with disabilities.The Covid crisis has given all of us a sense of uncertainty and vulnerability, of what it#s like to depend more on others. So let#s make one positive legacy of this crisis a resolve to make sure we re-emerge as a society in which no one is left at the margins.Following publication of his poem #On Distant Shore# in last week#s Courier, Jim McRobert, originally from Campbeltown but now living in Musselburgh, has sent in another one of his self-penned verses.

It is not depression it is more subtle and has spiritual overtones – I would say it is most profoundly a spiritual phenomenon.Looking into it, I clearly identied aspects of it in myself today! It appears to be the most #underdiagnosed# and unacknowledged spiritual illness of this age.I found that Pope Francis also came across it. Commenting in the context of healing the paralytic by the pool, he said the #first illness# is the one afflicting the paralysed man. He had #resigned himself to it,# the Pope said, #perhaps saying to himself: #Le is unfair, others are more fortunate than I am#. There is a plaintive tone in this way of speaking # there is resignation but there is also bitterness.#He added that it is an attitude reminiscent of #many [Christians] who lack enthusiasm and who are bitter#, who repeatedly say to themselves: #I go to [church] every Sunday but it is better not to become involved! I believe for my own sake, but I don#t feel the need to give it to others: each one peacefully at his own home.#These people, the Pope added, also take the attitude that # you do something well in le, they#ll reprove you: so, it#s better not to take the risk#.Good Friday, Easter Sunday # excellent days to take the risk and resolve to do something well in le, to set sensible goals to be better than I am now.

In summary, the society was to promote the study of the archaeology of Kintyre and adjacent islands, to investigate the history and antiquities of the area and to preserve and publish relevant records and documents.The office-bearers were: President, Macdonald of Largie Vice-presidents, Sherf Macmaster Campbell, Colonel Mactaggart and Thomas Lindsay Galloway Hon secretary and treasurer, Duncan Colville Council, Mrs T L Galloway , Latimer MacInnes, Dean of Guild Neil McArthur, Major W Macalister Hall of Torrisdale, Mrs Macneal of Lossit , Archibald Dunlop Armour and Rev Norman Mackenzie.Of these, Macmaster Campbell, Mactaggart, MacInnes and Colville would power the research engine of the society in the early decades of its existence with studies on archaeology, history, place-names and local dialect.The scholarly talents of two of the founder-members, Macdonald of Largie and Lindsay Galloway, were almost immediately annulled by the time of the society#s first annual general meeting on November  , both were dead.Macdonald, a product of Eton and Oxford, was the author of a three-volume History of France, and Galloway, a distinguished mining engineer and protégé of Lord Kelvin, in  graduated MA at Glasgow University with first class honours in mathematics and natural philosophy, #a very rare distinction#."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Sadly we have all heard of someone who has been affected by stroke and many people like me have tragically lost someone too.Almost five years ago, my wonderful mum, Diana, suffered a severe stroke. She died four weeks later. My mum was the most active, #full of le# person I knew. She LOVED le. She was my best friend and I miss her every day. That#s why I want to ask your readers to take part in the Stroke Association#s A Walk to Remember.This wonderful event is a special way to celebrate the le of your loved one whilst raising money in their memory.Simply pick a special place that is filled with memories, create your route, and on June  take part in your own walk to remember to raise funds for the Stroke Association.Stroke strikes every five minutes in the UK, and there are around , survivors in Scotland living with its devastating effects who really need our help.Like so many charities, the pandemic has drastically affected the Stroke Association#s income.However the charity has still been supporting stroke survivors as much as they can with support and advice, while continuing to fund vital research into the condition.Please join me and do something amazing in your loved one#s memory by taking part in A Walk to Remember.It#s bound to be an emotional but amazing day for all of us that have lost someone to stroke. Walk in their memory and raise funds to rebuild more lives after stroke.To sign up, please visit https:www.stroke.org.uk fundraising a-walk-to-rememberChildren#s lives have been turned upside over the last year due to challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, with many spending extended periods of time out of school and behind closed doors.The NSPCC#s Childline service has heard from thousands of children who have found this time really challenging.Some have felt overwhelmed with home schooling and struggled to access their learning due to a lack of technology, whilst others have missed their friends and family and many have seen their mental health deteriorate.The NSPCC and Childline adapted during the pandemic so our frontline staff could continue to be here as a vital source of support for those children who felt like they had nowhere  to turn.Even though many children in Scotland are now back at school, it remains vital that we are still here to support those who are struggling with the impact that the pandemic has had on them.To help us be here for children and to remind them that Childline is a source of support they can turn to, we are encouraging schools across the country to get involved in the NSPCC#s Number Day.This annual fundraising day, which is based around fun maths activities, will take place in primary and secondary schools across the country on May  in aid of the children#s charity.As part of the day, schools can sign up to enjoy puzzles, games and challenges to raise vital funds.There are a range of activities for dferent age groups and teachers will also be provided with resources including information on supporting their school#s safeguarding.It#s now more essential than ever that children aren#t left alone, isolated and unsupported with their worries, and the money raised from Number Day will help the NSPCC in its mission to make  a better year for children.To sign up, visit the NSPCC#s website and search for Number Day and fill in your school#s details using the registration form.Age Scotland has won a £, grant for an innovative telephone friendship service which links older members of the ex-services community.Our Comradeship Circles service has helped to connect hundreds of older veterans for regular group calls since the pilot scheme was launched six months ago.The funding from the Armed Forces Covenant Fund Trust#s Tackling Loneliness Programme will enable our service to expand and continue until autumn , reaching even more older people. We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of . The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we#re delighted this funding means they can continue.Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet.This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le.It#s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans# community gives each other, helping each other through dficult times. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we#d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.I have been contacted by many of my constituents about the concerning condition of Ballymartin road on Islay.It has gradually been getting worse over the years but is now as bad as it has ever been and is getting to the stage that it#s nearly not passable for a small car without risking damage.I have raised this with our roads department and although funds are stretched, this road is clearly in need of some desperate repairs and,left unmaintained for any longer, will only end up costing the hard-pressed council taxpayer more to fix in the long-run."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The disciples were huddled indoors in fear of their lives when suddenly the resurrected Jesus was there among them.Thomas hadn#t been with the others when it happened. He just could not bring himself to believe without seeing him for himself. Thomas gets a bad press because of this.We often react to this wee excerpt from Thomas#s story aswe would have been less reluctant to believe. We carry our willingness to believe as a badge of faith. Poor old Doubting Thomas.But is doubt a weakness  Or is it simply an opportunity, a space, a fertile ground in which faith might grow and ultimately blossom A week later, the disciples were gathered again in the same house where they had last seen Jesus. This time, Thomas was with them. Once again, Jesus came and stood among them. He greeted them again, #Peace be with you,# before turning and addressing Thomas directly.He said to him: #Put your finger here and see my hands. Put your hand in my side. Do not doubt but believe.#Jesus#s words are aimed not only at Thomas, but at everyone who encounters this story, and struggles to believe that God is capable of doing the very thing that God has promised — call our world into new and unending, resurrected le.#Do not doubt but believe.#"},{"url":null,"title":"two pairs triumph at dunaverty","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

These devices have blocked an estimated , calls, of which , will have been scam phone calls prevented at least  scams and saved vulnerable households an estimated £, in NHS and health and social care costs.PC Laura Evans of Argyll and Dunbartonshire Policing Division said: #The most common types of scams at the moment are telephone and internet scams whereby the caller or person emailing, pretends to be someone , for example, someone from your bank, BT, Amazon or Sky.#We have a large number of telephone frauds where the caller is told their bank has set up a new account for them and has asked them to transfer their money to this new account. Your bank will never ask you to do this and I would encourage people to simply hang up the telephoneyou think you are being scammed or,you are concerned about someone  receiving scam calls, then consider a call-blocker device.#The most common calls being blocked by trueCall units are misleading sales of insurance for white goods, appliances or Sky equipment and attempts to sell cover for domestic home repairs.As more people signed up to streaming services during lockdown, there was an increase in scam calls purportedly from Amazon Prime, where cold callers said that the recipient#s subscription was due for renewal or that their account had been hacked.Another type of nuisance call which emerged towards the end of  was the sale of timeshares, possibly in response to widespread issues with travel and accommodation during the pandemic.An Argyll and Bute Council spokesperson said: #Scammers are unscrupulous with the sole intention of identying and exploiting the most vulnerable in our communities by obtaining people#s personal data and to encourage them to give the caller their bank details. This is often achieved by implying that urgent action is required – a tactic which particularly targets elderly and more vulnerable people.#The trueCall call-blocking unit can give our residents peace of mind, knowing thatthe phone rings it will be someone they want to talk to.#If you are being pestered by nuisance calls or you know a family member or friend that could benefit from having a call-blocker, please contact Argyll and Bute Trading Standards on    or tradingstandards.office@argyll-bute.gov.uk to apply for a free device.#"},{"url":null,"title":"announcements april 16 2021","story":"ProductionUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

There was mention the flat had not been used much for the purpose of respite for islanders.However, a report before IJB members said the lack of consultation over it closing had caused community concern. The meeting was told there had been #a mix up# over communicating what was happening with islanders.Councillor Mulvaney said he did not feel the flat merited still being in the budget. #We should have saved this [the money] a number of years ago,# he said.Councillor Currie said: #The flat has been used, not much, but it has been used. Everyone is accepting it could have been advertised better.#It was Mid Argyll councillor Sandy Taylor who asked for the service level agreement for the advocacy service to be spared from the savings option list as #a contribution to mental health.#MID ARGYLL AND ISLAY:People across Mid Argyll and Islay have had their mental health boosted thanks to the innovative #Take  Challenge# which began in Kintyre.Inspired by Campbeltown Tesco manager David Brown#s personal K-a-day challenge in , mental health network ACUMEN, in conjunction with Kintyre Link Club, organised the initiative encouraging more people to #take five# each day –  five minutes of walking, five deep breaths of fresh air or a five-kilometre walk or run – with the aim of boosting wellbeing.After success in Kintyre, ACUMEN mental health development worker Sarah McFadzean rolled the challenge out across Mid Argyll and Islay, where people are encouraged to support one another in their challenges by way of a dedicated Facebook group.Where possible, people have been able to meet in twos and, as restrictions change, it is hoped opportunities for groups to Take  together will increase as the initiative moves to the Oban, Lorn and the Isles area in June.Sarah said: #Being involved and enjoying the challenge is as important as the activities themselves.#I would like to thank everyone who supported and got involved in Take  for their enthusiasm and assistance.#We are in the process of developing a Mental Health Forum and Lived Experience Group in the Mid Argyll, Kintyre and the Isles, the purpose of which will be to gather thoughts on current service provision, listen to others# experiences and inform future planning, along with providing information from a range of services and peer support.#For more information contact sarah.mcfadzean@acumennetwork"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Meantime, however, with the exception of the magazine, all society activities remain in a state of suspension."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And now, more than a week later and despite updates in the interim about the reopening of schools, they#re still waiting – and it#s not acceptable.Like everyone , islanders are desperate to know when they can reconnect with family and friends. Island businesses are equally frantic to know when and how they can make plans for the weeks ahead.But, unlike everyone , our islands are at a complete disadvantage. They still don#t know what is happening, or when. They deserve better. The Scottish Government needs to respond to our islands# call for clarity and let them, like the rest of the country, start to think and plan ahead.Now in its nd year, the Big Garden Birdwatch is a chance for people of all ages to count the number of birds that visit their garden helping the Royal Society for the Protection of Birdsto build up a picture of how they are doing.This year, more than a million people across the UK, including more than , in Scotland, took part, counting  million birds.The event, held over the last weekend in January, revealed the house sparrow held on to its number one spot. But  out of the top  bird species showed declines in average numbers in Scotland compared to last year.Starlings remained in second place, but numbers were down  per cent compared to . Goldfinches saw the greatest decline in Scotland’s top , falling four places from sixth position last year, with reported numbers  per cent fewer than .I am absolutely delighted with the number of people who have taken part, making it the biggest year ever for RSPB Scotland.This has generated a massive amount of data which will help our scientists with important conservation work, but it also shows how many of us have turned to nature after what has been a dficult  months.We need every voice raised to stand up for nature. The wildle that brings us so much interest and solace is now just a fraction of what should be there.Big Garden Birdwatch has shown that people across Scotland have a real passion for their wildle. We now need government to take the global leadership, policy and legislative opportunities open to it this year to reverse the decline and restore nature.It#s no exaggeration to say that when a dog goes missing or is stolen, it is heart-breaking.Dogs for Good has put together some tips to reduce the likelihood of your dog being taken.If the unthinkable happens and your dog is taken, remember, you are not alone.

DogLost is an excellent charity which provides a free lost and found service.You should also noty police, dog wardens, vets and local rescue centres.Tables for Dementia UK#s annual cake and tea event, Time for a Cuppa, have been reset.Dementia UK is the only charity dedicated to supporting the whole family through dementia specialist Admiral Nurses.The charity#s annual fundraising event takes place between May  and May .Since its launch, it has raised more than £ million with the support of fundraisers, Dementia UK staff and celebrities.One of the highlights of last year#s event was celebrity supporters dressing up as much-loved characters to recreate tea party scenes from the world of film. Phyllis Logan was Mary Poppins, music producer Naughty Boy was Jay Gatsby, Emma Barton was Holly Golightly and Jess and Natalya Wright were Alice in Wonderland and the Queen of Hearts.Families with dementia have been adversely affected by lockdown for just over a year now. Care home visiting restrictions, the closure of support and respite services and the resulting social isolation and loneliness have disproportionately affected people living with dementia and their family carers.Whilst Time for a Cuppa will be slightly dferent this year, we know dementia support is needed more than ever. We are so grateful to all our fundraisers who will be whipping up treats, enthusiasm, funds and who are giving their time for others – in a socially distanced way of course – in what will be a special and important Time for a Cuppa.For more information about Time for a Cuppa and how to host your own tea party with our free fundraising pack, visit the dementiauk.org timeforacuppa webpage."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

There has been laughter and sadness, fun, hope and joy.It was  when the seeds were planted at the South Kintyre Fit Communities about the need to develop a shopping service to help older people on discharge from hospital, no longer able to drive or to carry heavy bags.Since then, we have provided not just a shopping service but a number of social activities and housekeeping throughout Kintyre. We have developed the #Making Kintyre Dementia Friendly# project to help all parts of the community to have an understanding of dementia and how it can be managed. We have worked with children of all ages, meeting and helping the older generation and look forward to doing so again.Covid- has changed all our lives and we have had to adapt to dferent ways of keeping in touch and keeping busy.

Positioned a little to the right of Taurus, they are an unmistakable sight in the winter sky.Even a modest pair of binoculars will reveal that there are many more stars in that cluster than the naked eye can discern.

more than a decade in the role, with East Lothian residents electing their new representative next month.Four candidates - Euan Davidson , Craig Hoy , Paul McLennanand Martin Whitfield- are in the running for the role.Each week, theEast Lothian Courierwill give each of the candidates the chance to speak about what theyve been up to and why you should vote for them.Euan Davidson THIS week, the Liberal Democrats have been highlighting the shocking state of mental health services across Scotland.Right now, adults can wait up to two years for necessary treatments.Even prior to the pandemic, waiting times for these vital community services were getting worse.Earlier this year, Lib Dems in the Scottish Parliament finally persuaded the Scottish Government to declare this awful situation a national crisis.Now we need to elect more MSPs that will treat it as that.We immediately need to see a resumption of mental health First Aid training.This was suspended for the pandemic, yet physical First Aid courses were allowed to continue.During the recent budget negotiations, my party was able to secure pound million for community services and we need to see much more going towards these early help services.The impact on our families, communities and economy of failing to take this crisis seriously cannot be overstated.Under the current SNP Government, it is not just mental health services which have suffered.Nicola Sturgeon has broken her waiting times guarantee, failing , patients, meaning they have to wait longer than  weeks for vital services.The mismanagement of hospital construction has meant that the new Sick Kids building in Edinburgh has opened  years after it was promised.Now she is threatening closure of the vital Eye Pavilion, which has provided such fantastic treatment for so many across the Lothians.It appears that her Government wishes to move the service to St Johnrsquos in Livingston, making it extremely dficult for many communities across East Lothian.In a few weeksrsquo time, we need to elect someone who will fight tooth and nail for investment in our health services and push to keep them as local as possible.This wonrsquot be possiblewe spend the next five years bickering over another referendum.Craig Hoy PARTY politics were rightly set aside last weekend when we suspended campaigning to mark the sad passing of the Duke of Edinburgh.Seeing our communities come together to remember someone who gave over eight decades of military and public service was a poignant reminder of what is important.As parties resume campaigning as postal ballots arrive this week, it is time for East Lothianrsquos candidates to outline how they plan to make a dference for our communities.My campaign is focusing on our recovery from Covid-.I am presenting positive commitments to our towns and villages while, at the same time, warning of the risks of breaking up the United Kingdom.One of my top campaign priorities is education and this reflects local peoplersquos priorities too.We must do more to support our young people who have been devastated by the effects of Covid-.In East Lothian, the pupil-to-teacher ratio ranks alongside Edinburgh as the worst in Scotland.The SNP have failed to deliver on their promise of reducing class sizes and pupils are suffering restricted subject choice.Thatrsquos why the Scottish Conservatives are committed to delivering , extra teachers nationally.The SNP have made only limited progress in closing the attainment gap in our schools ndash despite saying it was their defining mission.Alongside the local Labour council administration, the SNP are failing pupils from the poorest backgrounds in East Lothian.Our countyrsquos attainment gap grew by three per cent between  and .It is unacceptable that the SNP Government have excluded local schools from receiving attainment challenge funding to address this.If elected as your MSP, I will press the case for more investment and more teachers for our schools, to help give all our young people the very best start in le.Only a vote for me in the constituency vote, and only by casting your hugely important lsquoparty listrsquo vote for the Scottish Conservatives, can you guarantee education will be a top priority ndash rather than the fresh drive for another isive independence referendum.To find out more about my priorities visit www.craigforeastlothian prioritiesPaul McLennan THIS election is about trust: which party do you, as a voter, trust to act in the best interests of your community in East Lothian and where across Scotland The SNP is committed to public services: wersquoll give NHS staff a four per cent pay rise and introduce both a National Care Service and a National Wage for Carers.Nicola Sturgeon recently set out her aims to ldquobring on stream underused theatre capacity in community and general hospitals to treat more patients as day cases... including in East Lothian Community Hospital in Haddington.That is an immediate benefit, on our doorstep.Wersquore helping children to learn by ensuring they donrsquot go hungry at school and investing in social housing and fair rents in the private sector.Meeting housing needs must be guided by principles of social justice, equality and human rights: everyone is entitled to a home that supports health, wellbeing, job prospects and le chances.The SNPrsquos lsquoHousing to rsquo plan was initiated before the pandemic.Having consulted widely across Scotland, it is delivering a housing strategy putting people and communities first, with , affordable homes by  , including  per cent for social housing.The construction industry can benefit the economy and good-quality housing can transform lives.I believe voters trust the SNP to build the post-Covid recovery of public services.They have already rejected Boris Johnsonrsquos Brexit shambles and its  promise to spend billions more on the NHS.I believe East Lothian voters will similarly reject the Labour and Tory recent support of stockpiling even more nuclear weapons, rather than spending those billions on health, housing and education.Broken promises undermine public trust, and trust is fundamental in this election.Which leader do you trust to form a government that represents your values and prioritises public services meeting your communityrsquos needs Rebuilding an economy supporting public services will make Scotland the country we know it can be it needs the full powers of independence and I trust Nicola Sturgeonrsquos experienced leadership.To elect me as MSP and Nicola Sturgeon as First Minister, itrsquos lsquoBoth Votes SNPrsquo in East Lothian.Martin Whitfield FOLLOWING the death of the Duke of Edinburgh, we suspended our campaigning as a mark of respect for HM The Queen and the Royal Family.Prince Philip was a remarkable public servant and we will again suspend campaigning on Saturday for his funeral to reflect on his contribution to public le.Before campaigning was suspended, Scottish Labour unveiled its recovery plan for the economy and jobs.At its heart is a pound. billion jobs recovery plan, the biggest job creation scheme in the history of devolution.This recognises the scale of the looming jobs crisis the country faces.It includes guaranteeing a job or training for every under-, as well as those over- who are long-term unemployed, , new apprenticeships and a skills revolution.The party also launched plans for an ambitious climate recovery, something Scottish Labour believes should go hand in hand with our economic recovery.This includes investing in green transport, safer walking and cycling routes, free bus travel for under-s, making all homes energy efficient to reduce living costs, create jobs and help to reduce our carbon emissions.These innovative national plans will translate well to a local level, providing a framework to support East Lothianrsquos recovery.However, Irsquom very clear that our local recovery, while backed by national guidance and funding, must be designed and delivered locally, not by ministers and civil servants in Edinburgh.Over the last year, our communities have demonstrated how they can come together in times of need and look after each other.Local communities, businesses and organisations should be empowered to show the same drive and determination in recovering from Covid- that they have shown throughout the crisis.Finally, on a more personal note, I have pledged my support for several important campaigns and initiatives so far during the campaign.Among them are the Teach the Future pledge on making the climate emergency part of the curriculum the More for Scotlandrsquos Animals pledge on animal welfare the Walk, Wheel, Cycle, Vote

has been there for us ndash sometimes at great personal cost.I believe that offering our NHS staff an inflation-busting four per cent pay rise is well deserved, although I wish it could be more.South of the Border, one per cent is being imposed.This is simply an insult.There is a perception that our NHS is lsquobrokenrsquo in some way.I do not believe this, but I do see a huge organisation which now needs to re-invent itself, not for the first time, into an efficient, modern support for us all.However, our NHS is genuinely under threat.Privatisation is not just a scare word.The Transatlantic Trade Deal being negotiated with the USA leaves our NHS vulnerable and available for sale.Our SNP MPs proposed an amendment which would have ensured that our NHS remained in the public ownership.The Westminster Government rejected that safeguard.Since GP surgeries are independent contractors, not run by the NHS, they are vulnerable to being sold to the highest bidder.This is how the system was set up in .It may have made sense at the time but no longer.We must review the deal with doctors and ensure that creeping privatisation cannot take place.In Scotland, we have control over our NHS.However, the UK Government passed the Internal Markets Act, which allows UK Government ministers to arbitrarily enforce a lsquolevelling outrsquo of regulations and dferences between the nations of the UK.This would allow London to make NHS Scotland available for sale regardless of our wishes.I will fight to prevent the loss of our NHS and the best way to be sure of that is to take back control of our own affairs.Please give me an opportunity on May  to continue to serve our community and to protect our NHS.Stevie Curran IrsquoD LIKE to begin by expressing my sadness at the passing of the Duke of Edinburgh ndash a dedicated public servant.I send my condolences to Her Majesty The Queen and her family.The quality of our social care system should be a key issue at this election.The speed with which the failings of our social care system were exposed last spring was ghastly.The Covid crisis didnrsquot bring about the crisis in social care, it was already there.It simply brought it to the top of the agenda.The challenge of Covid- has made the crisis in care even more acute.The movement of people from hospital settings, without consultation and without being tested, into care homes to accommodate Covid patients was a human rights scandal.This contributed to the devastating reality of care homes becoming the epicentre of the pandemic and almost a third of deaths across the country being people from care homes.Scotlandrsquos social care workers have also been on the frontline in the fight against Covid.Their commitment, alongside all our other frontline workers, to help keep us safe during this public health emergency has been heroic.Scottish Labour has been calling for a National Care Service for some years now, a service that will include local governmentrsquos social care staff as partners in the service delivery.It will put the dignity of iniduals and the quality of services before profit.We must address the inequalities in the sector as it deals with the shortcomings highlighted in the recent Feeley Report, which I donrsquot think goes far enough.Scotland urgently needs a plan to transform social care. Scottish Labour knows that urgent reform and investment is needed and thatrsquos why we are working with the public to make our vision for a National Care Service a reality.We donrsquot want to just talk about the problems, we want a plan for how things could be better.Charles Dundas A QUESTION which I keep being asked during this campaign is what will the Scottish Liberal Democrats do for those in our communities who are struggling to make ends meet, especially those with children I know that all parties are committed to reducing child poverty, but here is what I want to do about it.Willie Rennie and the Scottish Liberal Democrats will commit to doubling the Scottish Child Payment.This is currently available at pound per week to eligible children under six.This will rise to take in under-s in the next few years and we will pay pound per week.We are also keen to listen to campaigners who want to extend the payments to include disabled children or those with disabled parents.It was Liberal Democrats who reintroduced free school meals and targeted extra money to schools who needed it most in England, and in Scotland we will extend free school meals to cover all primary school pupils all through the year, including school holidays.This will also help these children with their education since a hungry child finds it dficult to focus and learn.The Scottish Lib Dems also pledge to increase the amount of free childcare Scotland offers, increasing it to a full , hours for every two-year-old.At the moment only some twoyear-olds are eligible, and takeup of the places is very low.By expanding the scheme, wersquod hope it would be more useful to more and more working parents, helping them get back to work and all the benefits that brings to society and the economy.We will also extend the number of summer clubs on offer to eligible children to help parents on low incomes with the costs of childcare during the school holidays.Plus, our manesto pledge on fuel poverty will also help us with child poverty.Warm homes with lower heating costs undoubtedly help the families who need it most, and I think that Midlothian North and Musselburgh would benefit from more Liberal Democrat policies like these in place after the election.Iain Whyte AS PART of my campaign, I have been highlighting the need for more local policing and ato locally based crime prevention across the constituency.This should be backed by visible local police patrols in our neighbourhoods to deter and detect crime.So, it was disappointing to read news articles this week highlighting police advice to Musselburgh householders about securing their garden sheds due to a spate of breakins.The crimes seem to have been concentrated in the Stoneybank area but the advice is valuable for everyone.Police say you should make sure your shed is secure and should fit an alarmthere is anything valuable inside.The alarms can be provided free to elderly and vulnerable residents: email MusselburghWestCPT@scotland.pnn.police.ukSince Police Scotland was formed, there has been a centralisation of our policing that I want to see reversed.During that time, public awareness of police patrols fell from  to  per cent.I know from my time as chair of Lothian and Borders Police Board that locally based crime prevention had a really positive impact.Crime fell and communities felt far more connected to their local officers, who they knew were working on their priorities.Thatrsquos why I want to see beefed-up neighbourhood policing teams and theirin the parts of the constituency where they have been reduced or removed.These teams work well on a preventative agenda.They solve problem issues and work with the community sorting things like housebreaking sprees and anti-social behaviour.I also strongly support the wider Scottish Conservative campaign to introduce a Local Policing Act to boost local police patrols and increase community engagement with policing decisions.This goes alongside our plan to tackle more serious crime by introducing a Victims Law to end the SNPrsquos soft-touch justice system.This would give judges the ability to put the very worst criminals behind bars for le.It would also end automatic early release, so that criminals must earn parole.Musselburgh residents need to see a more visible, local and responsive police service.That would be my aimyou elect me as your MSP."},{"url":null,"title":"boxing-world-champion-josh-taylor-vows-visit-aidan-hogg","story":"Josh will step into the ring with Jose Ramirez for the most important

If yoursquove never tried growing tomatoes, this could be the year to have a go!Getting startedSome gardeners begin with seed but ensuring the correct temperatures for germinating tomato seeds can be tricky. We find that most people prefer to buy their tomatoes as young plants, and these are available in pots at this time of year. Buying tomatoes as young plants also gives gardeners the opportunity to mix and match dferent ieties.Therersquos a vast range of ieties to choose from, which at first may seem quite disconcerting. So start by considering the type of tomato you prefer and the space you have available to grow them.Generally speaking, tomatoes are either grown on a single, upright stemor as a bush.If itrsquos your first time growing tomatoes, it might be easier to begin with one of the bush ieties, but read on and decide for yourself!Bush tomatoesTwo of our most popular bush-type ieties are lsquoTumblerrsquo and lsquoTumbling Tom Redrsquo but seedsmen are always improving ieties so take time to read the labels on the plants in the garden centre before making your choice.Bush tomatoes tend to have a slightly weeping habit, making them well-suited to being grown in pots, window boxes or hanging baskets. They tend to be relatively compact plants with numerous sideshoots producing clusters of tomatoes.Upright tomatoesAmongst the upright ieties lsquoAlicantersquo, lsquoMoneymakerrsquo and lsquoShirleyrsquo are well tried-and-tested, producing a good crop of full size, red tomatoes.For cherry tomatoes, lsquoGardenerrsquos Delightrsquo is by far the most popular choice amongst our customers.Upright tomatoes can be grown in pots, grow-bags or directly into the ground. As the plant grows, the stem needs to be kept straight so that it can bear the weight of the tomatoes and will require support either by canes or string.To maintain the strength of the main stem, sideshoots need to be nipped out. Sideshoots are the little shoots that appear in the angle between the leaf and the main stem and, as any tomato grower will tell you, itrsquos a job that requires to be done very regularly!Other ietiesTherersquos also a wide selection of yellow, beef-steak, plum and other distinctive ieties to choose from, so take your time to read the labels and choose the ieties that will best suit you, your garden and your family.CultivationAll tomatoes like a warm, sunny location to grow. Outdoor-grown tomatoeswill have to be well-sheltered, although there still needs to be some movement of air to avoid disease.Watering needs to be consistent and regular, and tomatoes growing in pots or growbags will benefit from having a tray underneath to provide a reservoir that they can draw from between waterings. Avoid irregular watering, as it results in uneven growth and may cause the tomatoes to split.Once you see the first bunch of yellow flowers appear, thatrsquos your first tomatoes on they way!

the site where legend tells he was killed by a giant.Then, at Finnrsquos request, they walked to nearby Finlarig Castle.Izzy had always felt the castle had a sombre atmosphere, and so it did, even on this sun-drenched afternoon.Maybe itrsquos because it is quietly hidden away from the tourist trail, its unstable ruins concealed by old trees.Normally a tranquil place feels magical, but the grim deeds said to have been committed here darken the feelings.Izzy had already told Finn of the castle and he wanted to see the beheading pit and hanging tree.It was another built by the Campbell chief lsquoBlack Duncan of the castlesrsquo at the beginning of the s ndash such a ruthless man, andaccounts of him were true, very cruel even for his time.At Finlarig, it is said, he enacted his lsquojusticersquo, in particular against the MacGregors, whose land he had taken and whom he hunted mercilessly.Finn stood in the pit where, according to tradition, noble victims were executed.Their Campbell persecutors could watch and gloat from a window above in the tower.Nearby was the hanging tree, where people of lesser status were said to have met their end.Finn found the overgrown steps that led to the summit of the small hill on which the tree grew.They stood on the spot where so many condemned men would have had their last view of this world.ldquoYoursquore right, aunty, this place does have a bit of a gothic atmosphere, especially when you know that so many people were hanged on the branches of this tree.Izzy nodded: ldquoBut remember, Finn, eventhis is the original hanging tree, then it is innocent, she said as they stood under its boughs.ldquoThe poor thing was used to commit terrible crimes, she put her hand on its trunk, ldquobut it wasnrsquot the treersquos fault.Finn wasnrsquot sureshe was joking itrsquos just a tree, how could it be blamed He put it down to his auntrsquos love of nature.She often spoke asplants and animals were like people.Finn looked around.ldquoCan you tell me a story about this place  he asked.Izzy thought for a moment, then agreed.They sat on a stone by an old holly tree in the sunshine and Izzy told two stories.First, the tale of a wedding at the castle interrupted by MacDonalds lting cattle.Then she told the tale of Marion Campbell, a daughter of a powerful Campbell chief.She had been promised to a man she didnrsquot love, but instead she eloped with Gregor Roy MacGregor, the chief of the MacGregors.ldquoThe sad thing is, explained Izzy, ldquothat beforehand the MacGregors and Campbells had been close allies for many generations, but then a feud over land and power developed.So Gregor Roy was forced into the hills as an outlaw, and Marion willingly joined him, marrying him against her fatherrsquos wishes.ldquoDespite their tough le, said Izzy, ldquothey deeply loved each other.Finn was fascinated as Izzy told Finn stories of their adventures of how they lived in the wilds, living in secret hideouts, hunted by the warriors of Marionrsquos father.She told the tale of how Gregor once escaped his pursuers by leaping over a river and how Marion gave birth to their first son in a cave.ldquoThey wrought vengeance on the Campbells, lting their cattle, said Izzy, ldquobut eventually they were found and Gregor was beheaded by a Campbell chief called Grey Colin in .ldquoIn the beheading pit  asked Finn.ldquoNo, not here, said Izzy, ldquobut at another castle at the east end of Loch Tay.\"Some accounts say poor Marion was forced to watch, and afterwards she composed a beautul lament, which is a sad song.\"She wrote it for her son, to explain to him what had happened to his father.Izzy recited a verse she could remember: ldquoEven in snow and blizzards, And days with all the seasons, Gregor would find a hollow for me, In which we would sleep cosily.ldquoWow, what a story. What happened to her after  asked Finn.Izzy shook her head: ldquoNobody knows, she disappears from history, but her son Alistair later avenged his fatherrsquos death and so the feuding continued, which explains the grim deeds at this castle.ldquoMaybe her son protected her after and hid her to keep her safe, wondered Finn.ldquoThatrsquos a nice thought, maybe.Finn stood up and walked around.ldquoIt would be betterfolks could just get on, donrsquot you think! he announced.ldquoAgreed! said Izzy.They walked back to the village.They had a much-needed wash with hot water and Finn called his mum.After a while, he poked his head out of the phone box: ldquoMum wants to talk to you.Izzy knew how dficult this time was for her sister, being separated from her son overnight for the first time in four years.But Izzy was trusted by her and Finnrsquos attachment to his aunt was very strong and made him feel safe.He was obviously missing his mother, but he seemed to be enjoying the journey and his moods had been better, so it was decided the journey could continue.ldquoRemember, mumrsquos back from Spain on Monday eve.ldquoI know, smiled Izzy, ldquowe will be there to meet her, I promise.After the call, they did some shopping and made a quick visit to the Folk Museum, which was housed in the old mill by the side of the river.Izzy wanted to show Finn St Fillanrsquos Stones, which were on display there ndash a tale to tell later when they went for a swim in his pool.As they walked back onto the bridge, Izzy had a surprise.She unlocked the gate which led to the old MacNab burial ground, where chiefs of the clan lie in a walled enclosure, their clan folk in the surrounding ground.ldquoItrsquos actually an island in the middle of the river, explained Izzy.ldquoIts name means yellow island. It was a prehistoric fort before it was a burial ground.Finn nodded as he walked round the edge, looking through the trees down at the river as it roared, then calmed its way to Loch Tay.Izzy spotted a carving of the MacNab crest, with an image of the head of a MacNeish chief, a reminder of a famous incident in the clanrsquos history.ldquoIrsquom getting hungry, aunty, said Finn.She had a plan for tea.They would eat within the ruins of Rob Royrsquos house at Auchinchisallen in Glen Dochart.It was a -minute drive west of Killin.They parked at a small layby just past the small bridge that took the busy traffic over the burn called Allt Coire Chaorach.ldquoThat there  asked Finn, pointing at the ruins.ldquoLooks like mostly a pile of stones with a chimney.ldquoItrsquos called Rob Royrsquos house, letrsquos have our tea there, said Izzy.ldquoReally, it was his house  How do we get to it It was a good question.Once they got over the gate, they followed a narrow bracken-covered path.They got scratched as they scrambled up a steep slope, but suddenly they were on the top and the ruined house was in front of them.They were only a short distance from the road, but it felt like a dferent world.Finn stood on a large stone that once formed part of the foundations and looked up at the one gable end that was still standing.No, it wasnrsquot just a pile of stones, he thought, he could see it had been a house.Finn scanned the landscape around him.Occasional traffic could be heard not far below, but the road seemed engulfed and made insignicant by the mountains and hills that dominated the view.A herd of highland cattle were grazing nearby.ldquoLook, look! We have our own Highland cows! Finn called to his aunt.ldquoPerfect, she said as she her puffed her way to the house.Finn jumped from the stone down to his aunt.ldquoSorry, let me help, he said.ldquoLetrsquos get set up said Izzy, laying the heavy rucksack down.Finn went for a closer look at the cattle while Izzy found a safe place to sit within the ruins.She got out the camping stove and began to cook.Finn joined her and they stared at the pasta as it twirled in the boiling water.The cows came to watch, standing in a row, tails twitching with a fascinated look on their faces.ldquoYoursquore right in what you said, aunty, remarked Finn between mouthfuls of pasta.Izzy curled her eyebrows not sure what he was referring to.ldquoFood tastes much better when itrsquos cooked outside, in a place like this, he explained with a big sauce-covered grin.The sun was now lowering in the sky and Izzy could feel the air finally cooling.The huge presence of Ben More was casting shadows in the glen.She took out her small fire dish, screwed on its legs and placed it carefully within the ruins, away from any vegetation.Finn suggested moving some stones to make more comfortable seats.ldquoWe are guests here, said Izzy, ldquowe are sitting amongst old ruins, and we must leave them exactly as we found them. Even our wee fire must leave no trace. There used to be a sign here telling people about this place, but people just didnrsquot respect it, theyrsquod damaged it or trash it, so the sign was taken away. We know better, so we are welcome guests.Finn nodded. He initially felt upbraided, but his aunt gave him a kind smile which changed the meaning of her words.Instead of feeling scolded, he felt a strange sense of privilege that hersquod been taught something important.ldquoThink how long this house has been here, said Izzy, who looked up at the gable end with the chimney.ldquoThat standing wall was added later, but it is said Rob built the original house here in . It was a time when he was a hunted outlaw. This was Campbell country when he lived here, but he was under the protection of a Campbell chief, how ironic was that  Robrsquos mother had been a Campbell, and yoursquove seen how MacGregors could be both enemies and family with Campbells.She pointed at the base of the ruins: ldquoThose stones are the foundations of the old walls. Now close your eyes for a moment, Finn. Imagine we are in the house in Robrsquos time. There are no windows, a thatched roof above us and a peat fire is in the middle, with a smoky heat filling the room. Now open your eyes, can you see the house as it used to be Finn opened his eyes and looked around.ldquoYes, I think so.ldquoCan you smell the peat smoke in your imagination ldquoI donrsquot know what it smells like aunty.ldquoItrsquos a sweet smoke.ldquoI smell it now.ldquoNow look up, can you see how the soot from the fire has made the rafters of the roof all black ldquoYeah, itrsquos all sooty.ldquoWe are sitting in the very place of the story, said Izzy. ldquoRight where you are, sat Rob Roy himself.ldquoNo aunty, hersquos next to me, otherwise hersquoll be on my knee, joked Finn.ldquoAll right then, of course, hersquos next to you, chuckled his aunt. She pointed to the small fire crackling in the fire dish.ldquoHersquos looking into the peat fire, thinking about his we and children.

On a inidual scale, though, there is still a chance that you might be one of the very few people who is vaccinated and still gets infected it is possible, just very much less likely than without a vaccine.One extra point to add here is that the vaccines take time to work.The vaccine is not a instant shot of protection it is a way to train your immune system, so that your immune system will then protect you. It takes - weeks or so for the immune system to respond so, evenyou are someone who has a superb immune response to the vaccine, you are still not protected until - weeks after the jag.Some cases of people being infected with covid after the vaccination are because they were exposed to the virus during this - week window. Be especially cautious during this time.Just as the vaccines make it much less likely that yoursquoll get infected, they also make it much less likely that you will be able to infect others ndash but in both cases the answer is that the chances are much reduced, but not zero.We donrsquot fully understand why some people are fully protected and others are not it might be that you have a slightly quirky immune system, or are immunosuppressed it might be that you are exposed to an unusually high dose of the virus.It might be something in your genes or environment that makes you a particularly good target for the virus.When the first trials were conducted to test how well the vaccines work, the data that was collected measured the number of people who showed symptoms of disease. This number was reduced % in the Pfizer trial.The trials did not attempt to measure whether vaccinated people could still be infectious. We have some really encouraging data now, collected after the trials from countries where vaccines have been used widely, showing that vaccination does also reduce transmission ndash meaning that vaccinated people are less likely to infect others than people who are not vaccinated.This is what we expected and hoped for, and itrsquos really good to see. This is why being vaccinated not only protects ourselves, but also others.Viruses cannot live for long periods on their own they need a person to provide a home.If you are successfully vaccinated, then your body is trained to refuse entry to the virus, denying it that home.When only a few people are vaccinated, the virus can fairly easily find another person, another home to occupy. When very many people are vaccinated, finding a home becomes much more of a challenge, and the virus is condemned to a lonely death outside.The idea of working together by using our immune systems to reduce the number of opportunities that the virus has to gain a foothold and spread is whatrsquos called ldquoherd immunity.Even the rare people in whom the vaccine didnrsquot work very well can be protected this way, as other peoplersquos vaccinations mean that they too are less likely to encounter the virus.No. The importance of a face mask is that it is a barrier to stop you infecting other people.We still need to be cautious to avoid infection, and to avoid infecting others, until the amount of virus circulating in our communities falls.The Covid vaccines are one part of our toolkit for reducing the amount of virus circulating. They make it less likely yoursquoll get infected, less likely yoursquoll get sick, and less likely yoursquoll breathe out the virus and spread it to others.But there is still a small chance that each of these steps can happen, and so facemasks, space and distance are all still needed just now.The gradual easing of restrictions that is beginning just now is possible because wersquove successfully driven case numbers down, in part through the vaccination programme.If we can keep this up, then we will get to a point when case numbers are low enough that restrictions will ease yet further, and facemasks might then become optional in more places.We are optimistic that immunity will last ndash but not yet certain.The first people to receive the Covid vaccines were only vaccinated  months ago, so we know that vaccines can generate immunity that lasts at least  months.We know that the majority of people who have been infected with the SARS-CoV virus, that causes Covid, also have persistent immune cells and good antibody levels, even a year after infection.There was a lot of fear that immunity would not last, and there are been some prominent cases where people have been shown to be infected twice ndash so in those particualr people, immunity was either not persistent or not ever good enough.But for the majority of people, infection has led to persistent immunity, so far.Another piece of encouraging news is that particular immune cells, essential for protection, were still detectable last year in people who were infected in  with SARS, which was a severe infection caused by a similar coronavirus to the one that causes Covid.So we are optimistic, but will only know for certain when more time has passed.Another twist here, is whether immunity generated by having one of the current vaccines will be effective against any virus iants: lasting immunity might not be useful,the virus mutates and can escape that immunity. But there are grounds for optimism here toohellip... There are two situations in which a booster might be useful.The first one isimmunity doesnrsquot last long enough without a booster, and in that case a third jag is definitely a possible solution.The second one isthe virus mutates or ies, and we need to update our vaccines to match the new iants. The coronavirus that causes Covid is one that is known to mutate ndash thatrsquos a normal part of its biology.The flu virus is another example of a virus that we know mutates, and thatrsquos why flu vaccines are updated and given every year.But the Covid vaccines have held up well so far: the vaccines currently being used in the UK were designed against the original version of the virus, but have done very well in reducing disease and blocking transmission of the B.. Kent iant, for example.The immune response generated by the vaccines is strong, and evenit is two fold less effective against a new iant, there is a good chance the remaining immune response will still be enough to prevent severe disease and slow the spread of the virus.Another piece of good news is the way that these new vaccines have been designed makes it a relatively simple process to update them,new iants make that necessary.If we do need boosters, that too should be achievable.The gradual easing of restrictions that have begun now reflects the success of our collective ability to reduce the amount of virus circulating, and getting people fully vaccinated is a large part of this success.I hope that this gradual process will continue as the vaccination programme is completed, and more normality will be achieved in each step.That said, we are still a long way away from everyone having both doses, as we need vaccinations to be completed globally before any inidual country can fully relax.Within the UK, the vaccination programme is currently planned for all adults, but vaccines for teenagers and younger children are only in the stage of clinical trials.Globally, some restrictions on international travel might need to persist until global vaccination rates increase, and those gobal vaccination rates depend on politics and cooperation between nations.Another aspect to this question is what normal really means.The pandemic hit us hard and for people whorsquove been bereaved, who have persistent symptoms or Long Covid, or whose jobs and livelihoods have been affected, normal wonrsquot ever be as it was.And as communities, there are also changes both good and bad.Will hand sanitiser provision in supermarkets continue  Will working from home always be more possible  Will high streets rejuvenate  There are opportunities for change here,we want to grasp them but there may also need to be time to heal and recover."},{"url":null,"title":"inveresk-street-branded-unremarkable-glazing-firm","story":"East Lothian planners refused planning permission for the new windows in the house on Wedderburn Terrace, Inveresk.Planning officers argued that the modern window frames were harmful to the character of the Inveresk conservation area.However agents for CR Smith, who were supported by the home owner in the appeal, argued that the locale of the property was ldquounremarkable.In an appeal statement to East Lothian Councilrsquos local review body, they said: ldquoWhilst the Inveresk Conservation Area in its entirety is undoubtedly worthy of its conservation area status, this stretch of Wedderburn Terrace is comparably unremarkable, without any buildings or vistas that would warrant protection in their own right.Inveresk is a conservation areaThe appeal came after planners refused retrospective permission for the windows and doors of the property to be replaced using PVC.Agents argued that the new material was not only more energy efficient than the original timber frames but offered more security given ldquoa number of house burglaries in the area.They pointed to other properties on the street which had similar window frames, producing a montage of images of other homes in the area to back them up.And they said of the house itself: ldquoIt is a reasonable attempt by a homeowner to improve the energy efficiency and security of his modest and unremarkable home.At the local review body meeting, Councillor Norman Hampshire, chairing, agreed that the new windows on the house, which dates back to the s, did not have an impact on the conservation area.He said: ldquoIf it had been a listed building, I would be minded to go with the officers however, on this building I do not think its impact on the conservation area will be signicant.His view was backed by fellow body members Councillor Jeremy Findlay and Councillor Kenny McLeod, who agreed unanimously to uphold the CR Smith appeal and allow the windows to remain."},{"url":null,"title":"north-berwick-become-mini-blackpool-claim","story":"Stirling Stewart, owner of The Rocketeerin North Berwick, has applied for a series of occasional licences to allow him to serve alcohol at an outside seating area from the end of this month.However, the move has brought more than a dozen complaints from local residents after his proposal suggested using Anchor Green, which borders the restaurant.

Born in Warwickshire to a gentry family in , she moved down to London where she immersed herself in the bohemian world of Bright Young Things. She made many artistic connections ndash she modelled for Augustus John, worked alongside Evelyn Waugh, and was a friendof George Orwell ndash embraced socialism, and earned a living as both a novelist and a journalist. However, by the time of her death in , she had faded from view, her name barely known, her books out of print.Two years ago, Handheld Press, an independent publisher specialising in long-neglected books, launched something of a literary salvage operation by reissuing two of Holdenrsquos short works in one volume. Blitz Writing comprised It Was Dferent at the Time, an account of Holdenrsquos le from  to , and Night Sht, a novella which drew on her wartime experience working in an aircraft factory.Now, three years on, comes a companion piece to that novella. Originally published in , Therersquos No Story There is a richly absorbing novel about conscripted workers at a huge factory in the north of England. Holdenrsquos characters in Night Sht produced camera parts for war planes in this book there is more at stake, for the workers at Statevale make bombs and shells. Careless talk might cost lives across the home front but in this munitions factory it is careless movements which prove fatal.Holden opens with a horde of workers arriving to start their morning sht. ldquoThe cloud of humanity approached the first factory gates and broke up into iniduals. Holden then picks out a select few and follows them as they go about their duties. As she jumps from one to the other, she highlights their contribution, relays their discussions and taps into their thoughts and emotions. A vivid composite picture takes shape, one depicting not only collective effort but also personal struggles, hopes and fears.We meet characters of all stripes. Linnet grafts in the detonator workshop while counting down the hours until she can be reunited with her husband Willie, who is due back soon on home leave. Gluckstein, the overseer of a big bomb group, is plagued by recollections of anti-Semitic violence carried out by ldquoMosleyrsquos men in London. Doran, a ldquoOne-Man-Mass-Observation-Centre, wanders the factory with his notebook out, jotting down choice snippets from overheard conversations in the name of social research.Some of the characters in senior positions provide comic moments. Jameson, the factoryrsquos officious police inspector, gets a nasty shock when his random stop-and-search policy backfires on him and security chief Captain Quantock is surprised when ldquothe very distinguished personage whose visit he is organising turns out to be not King George but Lancashire funny-man George King.As the narrative unfolds, we come to see the characters in new lights and from dferent angles. The one we get to know most intimately is Julian, a ldquotruck-man who, having been rendered mute by PTSD, now ldquothought in words and ldquotalked in silence. Holden allows that silence to speak volumes, amplying both Julianrsquos trauma and his desire to be heard.Whether with dialogue on the factory floor or streams of consciousness in Julianrsquos head, Holden captivates her reader. No single protagonist emerges to steer the proceedings but the snapshot portraits and potted histories of the rotating cast members add up to a satisfying whole.This book also includes three of Holdenrsquos stories about wartime le. They show that she could achieve remarkable results with short-form fiction as well as long. With luck, more of her lost-and-found work will see the light of day."},{"url":null,"title":"food-phil-vickery-shares-food-memories","story":"Food: Phil Vickery shares his food memoriesPhil VickeryWe caught up with him about his latest cookbook, Diabetes Meal Planner, written with food scientist Bea Harling BSc, and mined his memory for his culinary highs and lows too...His earliest food memory...\"We used to go to Blackpool, because my mums family were there, and wed go down to the seaside in Folkestone, and wed always have whelks with salt, pepper and vinegar.

What a smart move to get the nurses onside to vote for the governing party. That promise made the Westminster offer of one per cent look a pretty measly and miserable offer. Plaudits would have to go to the SNP and allow the party to take a bow as the champion of the medical fraternity and sorority in that circumstance.Then Jeane Freeman came out with a confession that the Government made a serious mistake by sending discharged NHS elderly patients into care homes, whose presence there most likely seeded the spread of the virus so devastatingly.Ms Freeman, who is standing down at this election looks like she will escape scot-free from any culpability in this matter while our Teflon FM will most probably suffer no fallout from this admission.Meanwhile still festering under wraps is the report on education by the OECD and that will not see the light of day until after May , which will be too late for the electorate to take into account to pass judgment on the record she said she should be judged on as FM.After  years in government poll ratings suggest the SNP is untouchable.

Then, the SNP was given every possible advantage ndash perhaps the pro-UK side was over-confident. The nationalists were given the choice of wording ndash which many found slanted towards those proposing breaking up the UK. They were given the crucial Yes choice, which many experts claim gives about an automatic five per cent advantage, as well as choice of age eligibility and date and other give-aways. That the nationalists contrived to lose after all that says much.In Canada, beset for years by a separatist movement in Quebec similar to the SNP, the central government eventually acted. It had to ndash two lost referendums and continuing calls for another that were destroying Quebecrsquos economy. It decided to alter the wording of any future referendum to reflect what was actually involved in breaking up Canada. It became instead of a Yes or No, a Stay or Leave choice. The people were forced to think and the separatist movement has stalled, perhaps aware of the answer it would get in another referendum. Many think the present situation there is permanent.A recent Survation poll, taken March -, found that when Scots were askedthere was a referendum with the question: \"Should Scotland leave or remain part of the UK rsquorsquo,  per cent voted to remain and % to leave.The infinitely clearer Leave-Remain choice will reflect much more the true feelings of the people of this country.

I am well aware of the consequences of Brexit on business and people and did not mention Brexit.He goes onto ask why would employers train our young people in career development when \"oven-ready\" well-educated immigrants were ready available. Maybe he should be asking why our young people are not \"oven-ready\". There can be no excuse for the failure of the educational shambles today for which I would hold this Government accountable and not, as it would have us believe, another problem caused by immigration.His assumption that our young people in the future will only be offered harvesting and fruit picking is so pathetic it could be coming from the mouth of Ms Patel as she makes her case for her answer to the immigration problems caused mainly by her party. It also suggests that our young people are incapable of making a success of le as they see it and have no ambition. Anyone who pays attention when young people speak will realise that is not the case.His implication that jobs working the land as somehow beneath us is deplorable. This work was open to everyone but our young people mainly declined the offer.If Mr. Maclean really thinks that every young person is interested in a career and further education, maybe he could advise all those with a degree working in pubs, or worse still, without a job, where exactly all these career jobs are.Michael Tolland, Glasgow.LETS HAVE A LOCAL COMMUNITY CHARGEHAVING read Martin Williamss exclusiveit struck me that rather than revisiting the old domestic rates system to fund council spending, could we not consider a fairer system based upon a basic standard charge for services such as bin collections, road   pavement maintenance, street lighting and the like ndash common services which we all use, which could be set by local councils This should be set at a fairly low ratewhich would be paid by everyone over school age regardless of income level. If a council had to spend more money regarding exceptional costs, for example, tidying up litter andalism, it would increase the charge the following year to recoup the money. This would have the added advantage of focusing peoples minds that these services have a cost and could possibly lead to a change of mentality ndash you might be less inclined to litteryou are paying for it to be cleaned up.We could call this the Local Community Charge.The second part of funding for the councils would be based on ability to pay. This could be achieved by the Scottish Government increasing income tax by anything up to the devolved three per cent and earmarking this amount to be shared by the local councils, possibly based on council area population, or some other fair system could be devised. This could also be topped up from central government grants.Although I am not an expert in local government finance, I would imagine that this would be a fairly simple system to operate .A fair business rates system is another matter.B Bennie, Renfrew.THE MAN FROM MORAYI WOULD have hoped that someone with the very northern name Ron McKay would have known that the person he referred to in the poemis the Bonnie Earl OrsquoMoray, the north-east shire, not a Glaswegian Earlamurray, or even from the Murray lands in Southern Perthshire as he was a Stewart.

There is John Muir Wood, an early pioneer of photography in Scotland who made hundreds of images of Arranrsquos mountainous landscape. There is Alasdair Gray, who spent holidays at Pirnmill as a child and wrote the first story of his debut collection on the island. His marker is placed on the tourist trail up Goatfell, from where he painted his view, Bay.There is the eminent Victorian landscape painter Horatio McCulloch, whose aim was ldquoto paint the silence of the Highland wilderness where the wild deer roam ndash he obviously hadnrsquot been there during the rut ndash a putative silence which, of course, was occasioned by the Clearances.William McTaggartrsquos June Day, Arran , showed young children clambering over an ancient stone, again at Machrie. The th century brought the Corrie Summer School, the brainchild of Jessie M King and her husband EA Taylor, artists based in Paris who, from the summer of  to , attracted wider European artists and locals, including Charles Rennie Mackintosh, to stay with islanders all over Arran for their hugely successful art summer school in High Corrie. The Colourist Samuel Peploe, a friend of King, also painted here.But of all the painters, it is Eardley who is the best known modern artist associated with Arran. The pioneering mid-th painter spent the summers of her formative student years in Corrie, where she painted the shore in all weathers. If artists previously had frequently been inspired by the dramatically changeable weather on Arran, Eardley painted in it, the weather frequently marking her paintings, as was to be seen to mature effect in her later works at Catterline in Aberdeenshire.ldquoThe picture I painted yesterday was of a fir tree in the castle wood from the shore part of the Brodick road, she wrote from Corrie in  to her friend and fellow painter Margot Sandeman, with whom she often shared a but and ben named the Tabernacle in the village.ldquoI tried hard to finish it ndash but I havenrsquot, quite.

Seriously, Ms Sturgeon was making a pertinent point. Which is that a staged fight over who is the most avid for independence might momentarily amuse the zealous, as they formed a ring, chanting ldquofight, fight, fight.She noted, however, that it would do nothing to impress those who remain unpersuaded by the merits of independence in the first place. They might simply turn away, faintly nauseated.Which is why the leitmot of Ms Sturgeonrsquos launch was continuity. As it has been for the entire campaign thus far.That seems to me particularly apt this week. Today brings the funeral service for the Duke of Edinburgh. The arrangements are, inevitably and rightly, suppressed by Covid.But, still, the gathering at Windsor offers a visible reminder of the core constitutional continuity presented by the Royal Family, alongside the collective desire to give thanks for a le of long and devoted service.Events occasionally conspire, Oprah Winfrey et al, to make many of us contemplate the Royal Family asthey were stars in a soap opera, a source of innocent merriment or exaggerated empathy.They are, of course, much more. They are ldquothe firm. They are the much-altered but still salient Royal prerogative. They are the palpable core of the United Kingdom.When party leaders at Holyrood paid tribute this week, it was left to Patrick Harvie of the Greens to note, en passant, that support for the institution of Monarchy was not universal in Scotland. However, he subsumed this Republican thought beneath personal sympathy for the Queen and her family.:Coronavirus: From Indias double mutant to vaccine hesitancy and the supply slowdownNicola Sturgeon sounded a genuine, personal note as she evinced admiration for the wit and intellect of the Duke, whom she met frequently at Balmoral and where. They shared, she disclosed, an intense interest in books.But her general theme was, again, one of continuity. The Dukersquos role as a constant companion to the Queen, the cherry trees they planted in the grounds of Canongate Kirk, which she hoped would thrive and bloom for many years.Of all the sundry institutions which comprise the UK State, it has long struck me that the Palace gets devolution best. Perhaps alongside the Foreign and Commonwealth Office which, as one mandarin once told me with a wry grin, is well used to dealing with troublesome colonies.The Palace appreciates the need to work with the UKrsquos devolved apparatus. For example, the Sovereign regularly travels to her palace of Holyroodhouse to welcome new First Ministers from over the road, rather than obliging them to sojourn to London.While representing continuity, the Palace is adaptable. Within limits, it moves with the times, often cajoled down the decades by the Duke of Edinburgh. The Queenrsquos own speeches to the Scottish Parliament constantly endorse devolved governance.However, the Queen has also been known, very occasionally, to express disquiet at potential constitutional change.In , as Scottish devolution was under active discourse, the Sovereign said she could readily understand such aspirations but could not forget that she was ldquocrowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.More recently, in , days before the independence referendum, the Queen was also in contemplative mood, perhaps prompted by advisers. Asked about the ballot by a by-stander outside Crathie Kirk, she said that she hoped people would think very carefully about the future.Nicola Sturgeon thoroughly understands this nuanced approach by the wary Palace to the malleable UK constitution.She studiously avoids placing any question marks against the Regal Union of . She is not about to pick a fight, arm wrestling or otherwise, with the Monarchy.However, she does maintain a standing challenge to the Parliamentary Union of . She does want, in the word of the moment, to affect transformational change there.Yet she also understands that, right now, the people of Scotland remain deeply, deeply apprehensive and unsure about their future.:Kevin McKenna: Recover from the virus and a referendum  We can do bothThey contemplate the pandemic, this hideous plague, and they fret. They also cast their minds back to the banking crisis of , from which we have yet to recover. They consider too the disruption of Brexit, which may or may not resolve itself.Folk need reassurance. Which is precisely what Nicola Sturgeon was attempting to offer this week, most notably with regard to indyref but also in her policies on income tax.Ms Sturgeon declared that tackling Covid must come first, with indyref on hold until the middle of the new Parliament. She opts for popular pragmatism. She calculates that there is little to be gained from evoking the spirit of William Wallace, or even Robert the Bruce.Once more, it is easy to understand why this might exasperate the most eager adherents of the independence cause. Incidentally, it also irks the Conservatives who yearn for constitutional wrestling arms, feet, whatever.This week, also, there was some passing interest in a poll which suggested that fewer than one in five of the Scottish population ranked independence as among the most important issues at this election.That did not surprise me. Constitutional questions, even independence, are generally second order matters, unless a population is actively experiencing oppression, either physical or spiritual.By ldquosecond order, I do not remotely intend to say that such matters are unimportant. Merely that they are dferent, that they are regarded by the people as conduits towards the issues which dominate their thoughts, such as employment, health and security.That is the error the Tories previously made when they used to say that devolution was never raised on the doorsteps. They needed to ask a second question: how best might you address the concerns you have raised Nicola Sturgeon gets that distinction. She understands the yearning for stability in a time of turmoil. That is why her offer, for the most enthusiastic fans of independence, is Paradise Deferred.Our columns are s for writers to express their opinions.They do not necessarily represent the views of The Herald"},{"url":null,"title":"issue-day-pandemic-fuels-interest-ufos","story":"What revelations The Pentagon has confirmed that a series of pictures and videos showing UFOs buzzing over US Navy warships off the coast of Calornia, taken in , are real and were taken by Navy personnel.The photos were leaked Yes, from a Pentagon investigation of UFOs by a task force created to gather evidence for a report to be presented to Congress in June.

But councils were always allowed to select bids based on quality, risk, social value, food miles and other factors besides price.The proof of that pudding is Preston Council which used the Cleveland Model to double its spending with local businesses in the pre-Brexit period of -. It used a weighting system that scored local labour recruitment and skills training to award contracts to local firms. In  Preston was declared the most improved city in the UK, by an independent Demos report and the cityrsquos unemployment rate halved as local procurement spending rose in the five years to .In Scotland, innovative councils like Aberdeen have also awarded public contracts to local food producers by inserting food miles into their selection criteria whilst remaining ldquoEU compliant.Where therersquos a will therersquos a way.So, does the absence of a Scottish Cleveland or Preston suggest a lack of political will here Community Wealth Building made an appearance in the SNPrsquos programme for government last year prompting councils like Glasgow City to trial small, pilot projects. According to leader Susan Aitken, the council now intends to build on its experience and announce a city-wide Circular Economy Action Plan.This is the scale of ambition neededthe Covid recovery and Green transition ndash more empty buzzwords during this election campaign ndash are not to become disappointing missed opportunities.We lack the \"patient capital\" that allowed Cleveland to set about transforming itself. But with this election, Scotland has a political opportunity to radically change procurement policy so that our council tax millions invest in local people to deliver local services.We need pump-priming councils who think like local economic dynamos, so that what goes around in taxpayer cash, comes around in locally sourced jobs.And we need a new Holyrood Government willing to lead by example.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

For proof of our collective schmuckhood, we once again, for the umpteenth time, find ourselves in the middle of a lobbying scandal: this time the Greensill affair.Itrsquos a vile swamp. Former Prime Minister David Cameron became an adviser for the finance firm Greensill after he left office. He was reportedly given share options worth tens of millions. Cameron contacted ministers, included chancellor Rishi Sunak, trying to get Greensill the largest possible allocation of government-backed loans under the Covid corporate financing facility. Cameron also took company boss Lex Greensill to private drinks with health secretary Matt Hancock. Lex Greensill previously had a role as lsquosenior advisorrsquo to Cameron when he was PM ndash a role in which Greensill was reportedly allowed to pitch financial projects across Whitehall.: Democracy in dangerThe scandal has thrown up all sorts of unpleasant truths, including the fact that civil servants are allowed to work for private industry while in office. Bill Crothers, former head of Whitehall procurement, became an adviser to Greensill while still employed by the civil service. John Manzoni, chief executive of the civil service, was allowed to keep a poundk a year job as a non-executive director of the company SABMiller.The stink isnrsquot confined to Westminster. Fergus Ewing, SNP rural economy secretary, had an unrecorded dinner with Lex Greensill, and steel billionaire Sanjeev Gupta. Wersquore told there were no officials with Ewing, no notes were taken. The government claims to have no emails, texts or phone records about happened. Deals struck between the SNP government, Gupta and Greensill exposed taxpayers to hundreds of millions of pounds of debt after Greensill collapsed. The ministerial code states that officials should be present for any discussions relating to government business, with facts recorded. Nicola Sturgeon claimsthat dinners which Fergus Ewing attended are ldquovery dferent from David Cameronrsquos antics and the SNP said that \"attempts to make mischief around this issue are utterly baseless.Inevitably, therersquos going to be a Greensill inquiry ndash there always is when one of these scandals erupts. But donrsquot expect anything to change. It never does. After all,wersquod learned anything from previous scandals, Greensill wouldnrsquot have happened. Nigel Boardman, appointed by Boris Johnson to run the inquiry, is on the board of a private bank with close ties to the Tory party and a number of former civil servants in its ranks.We can, however, nip all this in the bud immediately, and end the scandal of political lobbying once and for all. The one simple way to stop this gross exploitation of the public is to ban anyone whorsquos ever held political office from lobbying on behalf of business interests for le. Soyoursquove served one single day as an elected representative, yoursquore barred from lobbying your former colleagues on behalf of any corporate interest. No more Sir Nick Clegg working as Facebookrsquos lobbyist, for instance. We could go as far as banning politicians from all lobbying, but some has decent intent. It would be draconian to prevent lobbying for a charity, for instance ndash as long as that lobbying is done openly and without profit.: Where is the vision Therersquos some other changes we also need to clean up public le. The definition of what lobbying is needs to be claried in Scotland to ensure that all forms of communication are covered, and that politicians canrsquot wriggle out of scrutiny by playing semantics around what a lsquomeetingrsquo actually means. At the moment thatrsquos not clear, and lobbyists have been exploiting loopholes which require only lsquovisual interactionsrsquo to be registered. Phone calls and emails donrsquot have to be registered. Lobbying rules should also extend to civil servants ndash theyrsquore not covered by the register.So is change likely  The omens donrsquot look good. The SNP has a host of former big wigs working as lobbyists so I wouldnrsquot set any store in the party suddenly finding its moral conscience. The Tories basically invented the revolving door between lobbying and public le. When it comes to Labour, the MSP who led the charge in Holyrood against lobbying scandals, Neil Findlay, appeared to court companies to hire him as a lobbyist in advance of him standing down at this election.However, change is down to us. If we donrsquot order the politicians ndash whose salaries we pay ndash to legislate for the public standards we expect, then wersquoll have nobody to blame but ourselves when the next Greensill scandal inevitably happens.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The clubs are: Liverpool, Manchester United, Manchester City, Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal, Cha, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid, Juventus, AC Milan and Inter Milan. In a statement the nascent Super League envisaged a further three clubs soon joining that line-up, so therersquos hope yet for . There are also plans for a womenrsquos version.Doesnrsquot sound like much of a shake up ...So itrsquos all about money Bingo. The Super League statement brazenly stresses how much more lucre the clubs will earn under the terms of the new format than they do currently. Founding clubs will receive a payment of pound billion ldquosolely to support their infrastructure investment plans and to offset the impact of the COVID pandemic. For hundreds of football clubs who can only dream of European football and who have been driven to the brink of extinction by the pandemic it all makes unpleasant reading. Needless to say football governing bodies UEFA and FIFA arenrsquot happy either.What are the fans saying A statement about the Super League from Football Supporters Europe doesnrsquot mince its words: ldquoIt is driven exclusively by greed. The only ones who stand to gain are hedge funds, oligarchs, and a handful of already wealthy clubs, many of which perform poorly in their own domestic leagues despite their in-built advantage. On that last point, take note: Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool are currently lying in ninth, seventh and sixth places respectively and look unlikely to quality for next seasonrsquos Champions League. Oh, and Spurs have just sacked their manager.Sounds like a political hot potato ...Right again.

The most striking feature is the patch of white at their rump. Males are slightly smaller and pale grey with black wingtips. Both have a round, owl-like face.Hen harriers are the UK#s most persecuted bird of prey relative to its population size. Their Scottish population is of global importance, yet it remains far from stable largely as a result of illegal killing by humans.The RSPB’s Jenni Burrell said: “We are calling on the public to email our Hen Harrier Hotlinethey believe they’ve seen a hen harrier. This helps us build a picture of where these birds are. Please don’t hesitate to contact usyou see them # we welcome any sightings and appreciate your time.“Hen harriers are beautul and elusive raptors and, unlike peregrines and kestrels, they are rarely seen in urban environments. Soit’s perched on your fence, it’s probably a sparrowhawk,it’s in a tree by the roadside, it’s probably a kestrel or a buzzard… butit’s over rough pasture or moorland, and matches the description above, then you might have seen a hen harrier.“Sadly hen harriers are a long way from reaching a healthy, self-sustaining population, and this is largely down to persecution by humans. Particularly where land is managed for the purpose of driven grouse shooting, natural predators like hen harriers can be viewed as pests and, despite being legally protected, the shooting, trapping and poisoning of hen harriers is a serious and ongoing problem.”If you think you’ve seen a hen harrier, you are asked to email henharriers@rspb.org.uk and to include the date, time, location grid reference and a description of the bird.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Yetwe continue using coal, oil and gas at the current rate, estimates show that reserves will be gone in around  years. But this is the least of our worries. If we want to slow rising global temperatures we need to stop burning these fuels their combustion, and subsequent release of greenhouse gases, is the main driver behind global warming.In , the Scottish Government pledged to end the use of all fossil fuels by  in order to reach their zero net emissions target. And in their place  Renewables.The traditional options such as wind farms and hydro schemes have now been joined by green hydrogen. Although still in its infancy, this renewable gas is expected to be a leading source of future energy production. Naturally occurring hydrogen is obtained by passing electricity through waterthis electricity is renewably sourced the gas is labelled as ‘green’ hydrogen, as opposed to ‘grey’. Once extracted it can be used in existing gas pipelines to heat and power homes, fuel vehicles and drive heavy machinery.And unlike traditional gas, when burned it produces no harmful emissions, only water.Keith Masson, climate change and energy team manager at Highland Council, said: “We’re in the process of recruiting a project manager to lead on the delivery of new hydrogen and low carbon heat strategies, to ensure that the council and the wider Highland region benefits from the energy-systems transformation that these technologies will bring.”In Highland region, plans are underway for a ‘hydrogen hub’ in the Cromarty Firth. Electricity generated from wind turbines in the area will be used to produce hydrogen gas for use in local industries.But progress towards the net zero emissions target is also happening even closer to home. In the last few months plans have been confirmed for two community hydro developments in Skye and Lochalsh.Construction of a community owned kW micro hydro development in Sleat is due to begin this month. Electricity produced will be sold to the national grid with over £, expected to be generated in the first  years. All money generated will be used to fund sustainable projects in the local community.Kenny Nicolson, project officer for Sleat Community Hydro, said: “Despite the Gàidhealtachd being a huge exporter of renewable energy, we pay the highest prices for electricity with some of the worst rates of fuel poverty in the UK. On Skye we have issues with inequality, young people unable to find secure employment and housing, and a dying language and culture.“Community-owned renewable energy projects are not just a means for reducing carbon emissions, there is a massive potential to create community wealth and address some of these underlying issues.”We as iniduals can also take steps towards installing renewable energy sources. The process may seem complicated or costly but thanks to an initiative launched by the Scottish Government, homeowners can apply for  per cent cashback, up to £,, for a renewable heating system. Small and medium sized businesses are also eligible for a similar cashback grant scheme. And the options for renewable heating systems are vast, from biomassboilers to solar  and ground source heat pumps.Iain Stewart and Shelagh Parlane have a ground source heat pump which sits just below the surface in their garden in Edinbane, extracting warmth from the ground to heat their radiators, underfloor heating and water. Shelagh said: “I would absolutely recommend it. It is certainly a very efficient system. If you were trying to heat water in a standard way I think it would be much more expensive.”Renewable heating systems can also be a source of income with the UK government’s Renewable Heat Initiative scheme. If you install, or have installed in the last year, an eligible system you could receive quarterly cash payments over seven years.Of course, no energy source is completely harmless. Whether it is birds flying into wind turbines or the destruction of fish spawning grounds with a hydro scheme, everything has a cost. Butwe want to continue using electricity, fossil fuels are not the way forward.No birds or fish will be able to survive at allwe continue to exacerbate the greenhouse gas effect by burning coal, oil and gas.Green alternatives are no longer trials for the future of energy production, they are the future."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MV-Glenachulish2.jpg","title":"glenelg ferry back in service in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine• Bittersweetafter death of founding directorFerry company directors took the decision not to operate the service for the  season in the interests of public and crew safety during the Covid pandemic.The vessel, MV Glenachulish, which normally runs from Easter to mid-October, has been tied up at the Kishorn boat yard since the autumn of .This week, general manager Jo Crawford from Glenelg said the boat was undergoing final checks and it was hoped to resume the service on Saturday st May.“It was a big miss last year, for locals and visitors alike,” said Ms Crawford.“We have put in additional measures to comply with Covid regulations including sanitising stations at both slipways and all the crew have been issued with PPE.“We have secured some grant assistance for opening up again and the ferry’s  employees will be taken out of furlough.

Walter Alexander’s family had Bogston Farm in Greenock and eventually Marion and Walter met and married. Walter was to live with sight and hearing loss and they were, understandably, huge influences –clearly demonstrated in Alastair’s subsequent voluntary work with the Rex Blind Parties, while he developed a remarkable affection for shinty through his connection with Skye.Incidentally, Marion’s father moved to Renton, won the football pools, bought the show house in Dumbuck Crescent, Dumbarton and called it Tarskavaig. It was there that Alastair’s grandmother Jessie died in  when he was seven years old. Her sister Annie MacPherson , whom Alastair Alexander visited in Skye, was known locally as ‘Annag Alasdair’ denoting her father’s identity, and was single all her le. She lived at No. Tarskavaig, and is well remembered by people in the area today.Alastair met his family circumstances head on with a resilience and fortitude, marking him out as a thoroughly decent human inidual, as well as a consummate professional in more than one area of le.He went to the Glasgow School of Art to train as an architect and pursued a career in the building industry, while maintaining his other interests – moving seamlessly in all his dferent spheres of activity.Forty years of Alastair’s le were spent commentating on more than , football matches and describing bowls, hockey at the Kelvin Hall, and athletics for BBC Scotland, as well as the shinty. He first started commentating for people with vision loss at Love Street, Paisley in .Six years later he asked the BBC for an audition and was on television the following week.It was a great privilege to share commentary duties with the great man in my own early days as a commentator, beginning in  in Oban on a blisteringly hot day. I learned a great deal from him over the next few years and he was fantastic to work with.Technology, or more accurately a digger, failed us together one famous day in  when Fort William scored a goal in less than ten seconds and went on to win the Camanachd Cup -. Few in Fort William were aware of the outcome until much later in the day —there were no mobile phones — as a digger had uprooted the cable which connected Old Anniesland to the BBC studios at Queen Margaret Drive. Alastair and I blethered away for the whole match not knowing that only a few minutes had been broadcast and Tiger Tim had filled the rest of the afternoon with records.One of Alastair’s cousins, Ann McCarron, recalled: “My brother and Alastair spent a lot of their youth together on the Skye holidays and at Gran and Grandpa Smith’s in Dumbuck Crescent. Apparently my brother Alistair had a Subbuteo football game and when they played he [Alastair] used to do the commentating, so he must have had the commentating in his blood!”Such was the family’s affection for Skye that Ann’s brother Alistair’s ashes were scattered on Skye following his death a few years ago.Tributes have been fulsome and sincere. The plaudits and anecdotes could fill Hampden. Alastair was a “gentleman and a true professional” according to Ken MacQuarrie who made the formal presentation to him on behalf of the BBC in .It was singularly appropriate that he commentated on Skye’s greatest triumph in . In that famous final Alastair described Skye’s Calum Murchison on the radio as “leaping around like a salmon”. That of course meant an awful lot more to anyone knowing the shape and size of Calum and also his family’srelationship with the local salmon fishing river in Bernisdale.Alastair was a great man and is a huge loss to our collective knowledge of our history, sport and broadcasting. Meticulous in his presentation and fastidious when it came to detail, he was a total professional. The BBC bid him farewell with the traditional microphone presentation in October  when he retired.We shall not see his like again and we know that Alastair will of course be most sorely missed by his daughters Shirley, Susan and Joyce, her husband Mark, granddaughter Alex and grandson Callum."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/POT-HOLES-KYLE-1-scaled.jpg","title":"kyle womans petition targets","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIona MacLachlan says people are being forced to drive in the opposite carriageway in Kyle’s Main Street to avoid huge potholes and believes a bad accident is waiting to happen.Ms MacLachlan, of Heathmount, is asking people to sign her petition on the change.org online petitions , urging Highland Council to improve the roads in the busy village.The health and social care frontline worker said: “I’ve raised this petition because of an experience I had at the weekend as an L-driver.“I was driving down to the village and I was confronted with this car in the middle of the road. I nearly hit it. I understand why the car was there – the driver was trying to avoid the massive potholes all along the street. I was able to avoid the vehicle but it gave me a scare and this situation could easily result in a bad accident.”Ms MacLachlan has reported the potholes in the road to Highland Council on multiple occasions.She said: “All you get is for the potholes to be filled with gravel and with the bad weather we’ve had over the past few months that lasts only two or three days and then they’re as bad as ever. The road needs to be properly repaired.“I’ve had to replace coil springs and tyres on my car because of the state of the roads in Kyle and I’m fed up with it. I hope as many people as possible will sign the petition to send a strong message to the council.”Ms MacLachlan’s petition is on the change.org site and calls for “All B roads in Kyle of Lochalsh to be repaired”.Local Highland councillor Biz Campbell said she was aware of the petition and agreed the road was in a poor state.“I don’t blame people,” said Councillor Campbell. “The roads are horrendous. We fight for funds for roads all the time and make the case when the budget comes up, but council doesn’t have the money.”However, she said councillors in Ward  — Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh — had been allocated an extra £, for local projects and members had discussed buying a “hot box” tar machine.She explained: “Currently the potholes in this ward are filled with cold tar and it’s a complete waste of money because the tar is simply washed out and the repair doesn’t last.“This machine would allow hot tar repairs to be made to potholes and it would last longer. We have discussed it at a meeting and I think this could achieve better road repairs which would help road users at least in the short term.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/salmon_farmJPG-1.jpg","title":"region should be more than a playground for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWhat is also very clear is that the impacts of the pandemic are extremely unequal, with the young having their prospects most severely impaired and those working in the private sector suffering the most severe economic consequences, yet to be felt in full, while the elderly and those with underlying health issues bearing the most risk to le, which has been tragic.Many people working in the front line have worked heroically. Of course, this includes those in the health service who have had to battle to save lives, but it also includes those who kept the boilers running, the ambulances and delivery vehicles on the road and the PPE arriving where required. That includes those in supply chains up and down the country, drivers, engineers, and tradesmen keeping our homes and critical facilities operational. It also includes those who have produced our food and those who distributed it and indeed those who kept the wheels and machinery of production and distribution of le’s essentials turning. Not least in the supply chain required to put food on our plates.A great many of our population, however — which is a blessing for them, whether wealthy, retired or working in the public sector or government, local or national — have neither had their economic situation nor their future employment prospects impaired, though of course, everyone has suffered the social deprivations and mental health challenges of lockdown. For those fortunate enough to be working in secure public sector employment or retired, perhaps on a secure pension, they do not have the financial concerns of those in the private sector whose jobs and livelihoods depend on viable economic activity.This imbalance of the bearing of the economic consequences of the pandemic is not given coverage or widely recognised, though our politicians at a national and local level are actively involved in formulating policy, actions, and funding programmes to sustain the economy and build back greener, better, and more fairly.Never has it been more critical for government at all levels, locally and nationally, to do everything possible to create and support sustainable jobs across our nation.We all have an obligation to recognise and understand this fundamental fact and do what we can to support economic growth and sustain people in, as well as create new jobs. The lack of a job, and the want of it, is fundamentally one of the most damaging situations to the long-term prospects, an inidual, their family and therefore society at large can suffer from.Economic growth and development,we are to sustain ourselves as a society, must be front and centre of government policy and action at national and local level. Local authorities and local politicians have a duty and an obligation too, not only to support development but make sure that they actively seek out and promote economic development opportunities within their areas of responsibility as a minimum. There needs to be some maturity in decision making and joined-up thinking in policy and action. You simply cannot have development without some impact, but neither can you have social progression without economic development.How can we call for building back our economy and protecting jobs, yet fail to support compliant job-creating planning applications  For example, the recent decision to refuse planning for an organic sea farm in Skye, which was recommended for approval, was in my view a dereliction of responsibility. It was to create nine new jobs directly. However, just the cancelling of the equipment orders required by this development and to be built here in the Highlands by our company, Gael Force Group, has caused the redundancy of over  people immediately and directly, just in this one company alone. This is a shocking narrowness in consideration and a failure of process and joined up thinking.We have become anti-development, anti-business in this country, yet we want all the benefits that depend on a strong, successful, and growing economy. It seems that we are prepared in this country now to tolerate someone dying from hunger and homelessness and the lack of a job, but not prepared to tolerate ‘our’ view or environment being altered. In the view of some people, all other forms of nature now have precedence over their fellow human beings. Like the clearances, once again the welfare of the local people who work the land and the sea is being considered as secondary to the narrow interests of a minority, often not rooted in the area, who care not for the economic wellbeing of other local people. We need to put people, their livelihoods, and their wellbeing first.The depressing familiarity of narrow interest groups’ objections to developments, often by an outspoken, sometimes fanatical, minority, often prejudiced on misinformation fuelled on social media but not supported by the scientic facts, is reaching a crisis across the Highlands and Islands and needs to be addressed. It requires local and national political leadership to speak out and stand up for the greater good, for the peoples of the Highlands and Islands welfare and livelihoods and retake the economic development agenda that has made the rural Highlands and Islands such a turnaround success over the past  to  years.If we do not see a change of behaviour in the support of development and growing the economy by all of us, we will be a failing nation, with rural areas becoming very largely inactive economically a playground for tourists, who are very welcome but who come and who go. A place again, where the will of the few suppress the opportunity of the many. If we do not change direction, we will leave no fine place, which in rural Scotland it should be, to raise a young family as our legacy. Shame on us."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MURAL-BIRCH-2.jpg","title":"donnie munro unveils sight for storr","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe landscape of the iconic island attraction is situated in Bayfield Road directly opposite Birch Cafe.The work was commissioned by Donnie’s son Niall who runs the coffee house.Niall said he wanted to bring an artistic flourish to the area for the enjoyment of both locals and visitors to the village., Niall Munro said: “The idea came about because the wall across from the cafe was in a total state of disrepair and there was a nice area that I thought was well suited for having a mural on it.“I mentioned it to my dad, but then didn’t really think much of it, but then I prompted him again and looked at it a bit more. He thought the landscape idea would be fitting.“We were thinking of locations and the Storr is quite an obvious one. We actually had an image of that particular view and thought that it would work really well.“It took a good few months to arrange because the wall belongs to Boots, so it took a bit of time to get the go ahead but we have got there.”He added: “From an arts point of view it is great to do something like this because it engages local interest as well as being for visitors.“It was very much just a way of brighting up the lane that we’re on anda by-product of it is that it benefits the other businesses here then great.”Like most business owners, Niall has experienced his fair share of obstacles due to the uncertainty brought by the pandemic. However, with Birch set to reopen at the end of April, he is excited about welcoming back customers with the cafe set to embark on a new venture.He said: “We are reopening at the end of the month and starting our own coffee roastery. We#ll start it on a small scale to begin with – by supplying Birch and a few other establishments on the island, and then a couple of months down the line I’ll open it up to online sales.“I have a passion for coffee and it is so much more exciting to be part of the whole process – from sourcing, importing, and now roasting, to then serving the final product.“It creates a much better story, and it is also an ethical way of doing it as we have direct links with the farmers that we are getting the coffee from.”Assessing the season ahead, he added: “It’s a mixed bag of feelings, it is dficult to have complete faith that this is the final lockdown – I think everybody needs to err on the side of caution and respect the rules that are in place.“The added benefit of Skye is that it is rural so there is lots of space for people to socially distance. And, thankfully, with the exception of Home Farm there hasn’t been any major outbreaks – and I think that was because people were being safe and able to be outdoors.“As long as people are following the rules then that’s the best we can do.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3746987.jpg--.jpg?1618485362000\n","title":"martinstown post office temporary closure for modernisation work","story":"Martinstown Post Office will temporarily close for modernisation.

Arrangements will be kept under review and collated data may be published at a later point.The Department of Health on Monday opened up limited appointment slots to those aged  to , mainly at the mass vaccination centre at the SSE Arena, ahead of schedule in the latest sign of the success of the programme.Appointments in community pharmacies will be made available to the age cohort later this month as vaccine supplies permit.According to the Department of Health, ,, doses of vaccine have been administered in Northern Ireland, of which , were first doses and , were second doses.Announcing the latest development on Monday, Health Minister Robin Swann said: I have always been clear that we would move through the vaccine programme as quickly as vaccine deliveries and capacity allows as recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation .I recently announced that we successfully administered over one million vaccines across Northern Ireland to the highest priority groups. This figure is expected to rise exponentially as the trust vaccine centres and GP practices continue to deliver second doses while the vaccine centre at the SSE Arena and the community pharmacists push ahead to deliver first doses.Opening up to  to -year-olds earlier than expected is a testament to the hard work and dedication of all staff who are delivering the vaccination programme in Northern Ireland. I encourage those who are eligible to seize this opportunity and take up the offer of vaccination. Getting the vaccine not only protects you but also those close to you.I would also strongly encourage anyone aged  years or over who hasn#t booked themselves a vaccination appointment yet to do so as soon as possible.In line with recent JCVI advice, those living in the same house with someone who is severely immuno-suppressed will also be able to access the programme shortly, once their household has received a letter from their GP.The Department of Health has said appointments at this stage are limited and has asked the public for patience when trying to book a slot.

Rebecca Mitchellsaid she chose to base her latest look on Northern Ireland actor Adrian Dunbar#s character after becoming hooked on Jed Mercurio#s police procedural drama. The latest instalment in the series saw PC Ryan Pilkington and DI Kate Fleming engage in an armed stand-off during which screens faded to black as two gunshots rang out, leaving viewers to wait until next week until any questions are answered.Ms Mitchell said she couldn#t resist basing her latest transformation on the famous gaffer, who was also the subject of a clfhanger himself in the latest episode after it was revealed he had blown the cover of undercover cop John Corbett to members of an organised crime gang.The latest season has been fantastic, I think everyone#s hooked on Line of Duty at the moment, she said. I#m loving it and was screaming at the television last night, what a clfhanger.Ms Mitchell uses a iety of tools to transform herself into famous celebrities, figures from current affairs and characters on her Instagram page @rebeccamitchellmua and on TikTok. She said it took hours to create her Superintendent Ted Hastings transformation. He was really dficult to do but I had to give it a go because he#s such an icon. Each look takes between two and four hours on average, she said.

I also take photographs and film video content. I would plan a week or two in advance and watch videos of the person on YouTube or the television to study them and their facial expressions, she said. Ted Hastings has a certain type of personality and dferent mannerisms and it could make or break the lookI didn#t get that right. I couldn#t do it from just a photograph.The makeup and brow artist, who lives in Gracehill with her fiance and her dog, started developing her skills after she had to shield at home since the first lockdown last year.I had never planned for this to happen but when the pandemic hit I wasn#t able to work as a makeup artist any more and on top of that I had to shield because I have an auto-immune disorder called lupus.It#s been pretty tough and I couldn#t do anything or leave the house. Even when everything started opening up and people were going back to work, I couldn#t leave and I thought I would go insane. I had to try and think of something to focus on, she said.But isolating offered the opportunity to throw herself into her social media accounts and celebrity transformations, which go further than the looks she usually creates for clients.While she usually focusses on making clients look beautul, Ms Mitchell said she#s now using dferent techniques. From the first lockdown, my posts on social media started changing. You#re not going too out there most of the time, you#re working on brown smokey eyes or more natural looks, but now I#m playing with textures and colours and moving into illusion makeup. It was around Halloween I did my first transformation, I#ve kept going and I#ve loved the challenge - I love turning myself into someone , she said.At the beginning it was sort of for selfish reasons and to learn something new but the response from people has been amazing and it#s been making people happy, making them laugh and brightening their day during a horrible time.Ms Mitchell said she thinks of random ideas for celebrity transformations but is also sent requests from many people who ask her to try dferent characters. People like a big iconic character - I#ve done Kim Woodburn, Gemma Collins, she said.When you look through my grid on Instagram, it#s so random. I plan based on current events or whatever I#m watching on TV or Netflix, so sometimes they#re planned for ages or other times they can be quite spontaneous. I find it easier to turn myself into a man, I don#t know why. I#m not afraid to put on a bald cap and make myself look like Dr Evil. I turned myself into Joe Exotic at one point.Her new hobby has also distracted her from the stress of wedding planning after expecting to get married next month and having to reschedule for May next year. For her next look, she#ll take on another big name from a BBC TV series. I have all my props ready to do Thomas Shelby from Peaky Blinders, she said.

Yet the DUP has tabled an amendment #recognising that legitimate religious activities such as preaching, prayer and pastoral support do not constitute conversion therapy, cannot be defined as such and must be protected.#For a minister or a priest to pray with someone, with the idea thatthey pray hard enough they will change that person#s sexuality, is demeaning and beyond scientic reason.It is not the thin end of the wedge, it is a dferent part of the very same wedge. #Praying away the gay# can lead to some victims taking their own lives.Mr Smyrl, who lost his position at Sandymount Christ Church in Dublin in , said that conversion therapy should enjoy the same universal sense of revulsion as female genital mutilation. Belfast Beat Newsletter Receive the big stories from across Belfast directly to your inbox  Enter email address   This field is required  Sign Up      He described those practising it, in any form, as religious thugs. He added: It#s high time that conversion therapy was stopped in all its forms in Northern Ireland. I urge the Assembly to reject the DUP amendment and pass the motion in its original form.Sinn Fein MLA Caral Ni Chuilin said conversion therapy must be consigned to history. She welcomed the UUP motion to ban this cruel and unjust practice and described the DUP amendment as an insult to the LGBT+ community.Amnesty International#s Patrick Corrigan also opposed the DUP amendment. #Praying the gay away# is just as unacceptable as any other pseudoscientic approach which tells LGBT+ people they are #sick# and #broken# and can change their sexual orientation or gender identity, he said.Mr Corrigan said MLAs should not be distracted and should ensure that any legislation not only covers the now, thankfully, rare conversion activity in healthcare settings, but addresses religious practices where demonstrable harm results.In a statement, the DUP said discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation was wrong and everyone was equal and should be treated as such.It said: As a party we do not support #gay conversion therapy# and are clear that no-one should be forced into any treatment against their will. Our approach to any legislation that may come forward will be in adherence to this principle.In equal measure, we believe there must be a balance between safeguarding against dangerous practices and any attempt, deliberate or otherwise, to restrict freedom of religious belief, speech and association. We retain a level of concern that the debate on this important issue has at times become conflated with efforts to restrict these freedoms and constrain legitimate activities by religious organisations or others which cannot reasonably be deemed to be conversion therapy.It added: In striving to strike an appropriate and balanced outcome, we will continue to take account of the views of professional bodies on issues relating to conversion therapy and appreciate that future steps should be guided by such relevant expert advice.Belfast Most ReadPolice monitor crowd of youths as trouble breaks out in west BelfastTV#s Dick Strawbridge and we Angel deny claims of bullying on hit C show Escape To The ChateauBelfast NI Protocol protest interrupted by brother of loyalist murder victim Raymond McCord Jr DUP: Sinn Fein#s Mountbatten apology doesn#t deserve any praise Father-of-four jailed after travelling to Belfast to have sex with -year-old girlTop VideosPlayTiny Loyalist protest at Irish Secretariat building in Belfast PlayVideo: X-rated footage of woman stripping outside a Comber bar branded #disgusting#PlayCanadian MP caught naked on camera reprimanded in ParliamentLatest Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland unemployment rate increases to .% with yearly redundancies highest since Watchdog hits out as housing benefit fraud increases by %Anger after bigots target Irish language signs in EnniskillenProspect of breakaway plan angers NI fans of both Liverpool and Man UnitedLatest from Belfast First phase of King#s Hall health and wellbeing park is completedBrendan Rodgers joint favourite to become next Tottenham manager as Leicester boss on club#s list to replace Jose MourinhoLaw firm Mills Selig to advise building body#He#s ticked all his boxes#: Will Addison set to make Ulsterwhile Angus Curtis fit to face Connacht in Rainbow CupGlens# talent has got to be respected: McLaughlin,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mrs Foster said it was simply not the case her party wasn#t attending meetings in protest at the Northern Ireland Protocol.The NMSC is the main body for cross-border cooperation between Stormont and Dublin.SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon claimed a meeting last Friday involving Irish Transport Minister Eamon Ryan had been blocked because no accompanying unionist minister would make themselves available.Alliance Justice Minister Naomi Long tweeted that it was the second NSMC meeting in as many weeks to be obstructed in this way and was unacceptable.The DUP#s position will be tested tomorrow when a meeting is due to take place involving Economy Minister Diane Dodds and Finance Minister Conor Murphy.

She said she had spoken to the Taoiseach by telephone just over a week ago.She said the protocol was not part of the NSMC, but she added: North-South relationships will of course be affected by the fact that the protocol is in place because it has damaged East-West relationships and we need to sort it out.We need to get rid of the protocol so that we can continue to have relationships with our nearest neighbour in the appropriate way in the future.Ms McDonald met Executive party leaders in Belfast yesterday but not Mrs Foster. She said a meeting with the DUP would take place soon.The Sinn Fein president said: You can#t cherry-pick the Good Friday Agreement.Political progress, stability and inclusion relies on all of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement working and working well.The North-South piece is absolutely essential and that means that unionists of all hues have to participate in those meetings.It would obviously be hugely problematicthere was any suggestion that any strand of unionism was stepping back from that or causing a problem with the North-South mechanism.The Sinn Fein leader also said there could be no more delays in enacting Irish language legislation.Mrs Foster last week said there must be realism over the timeline for introducing the law, and stressed that it was not a key Stormont priority amid the pandemic.Asked about possibly delaying it until after next May#s Assembly election, Ms McDonald replied: No, we#ve agreed the language legislation and that needs to be delivered.Mr Eastwood rounded on the DUP for missing the NSMC meeting. This in-and-out approach in terms of their engagement with political institutions is childish and needs to stop, he said.There is no Good Friday Agreementone of the strands is taken away.Belfast Most ReadPolice monitor crowd of youths as trouble breaks out in west BelfastTV#s Dick Strawbridge and we Angel deny claims of bullying on hit C show Escape To The ChateauBelfast NI Protocol protest interrupted by brother of loyalist murder victim Raymond McCord Jr DUP: Sinn Fein#s Mountbatten apology doesn#t deserve any praise Father-of-four jailed after travelling to Belfast to have sex with -year-old girlTop VideosPlayTiny Loyalist protest at Irish Secretariat building in Belfast PlayVideo: X-rated footage of woman stripping outside a Comber bar branded #disgusting#PlayCanadian MP caught naked on camera reprimanded in ParliamentLatest Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland unemployment rate increases to .% with yearly redundancies highest since Watchdog hits out as housing benefit fraud increases by %Anger after bigots target Irish language signs in EnniskillenProspect of breakaway plan angers NI fans of both Liverpool and Man UnitedEx-church elder backs UUP bid to ban conversion therapy in Northern IrelandLatest from Belfast Brendan Rodgers joint favourite to become next Tottenham manager as Leicester boss on club#s list to replace Jose MourinhoLaw firm Mills Selig to advise building bodyReturning pair give Ulster timely boostGlens# talent has got to be respected: McLaughlinIrish FA President David Martin set to be a key figure in European Super League crisis after FIFA vice-presidency election,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A separate Facebook ad asks users for their Eircode and links them to a website where they can find it.Sinn Fein said this information is not processed in its #Abu# system but would not say where it is stored or what it is used for. Sinn Fein advertising on Facebook is fully compliant with Facebook#s advertising policies and with GDPR. Any information provided to a survey response is that provided by a respondent, a party spokesperson said. The development comes as Sinn Fein responded to the Data Protection Commissioner after the watchdog asked the party a series of questions about its secret voter database, the Abu system.After refusing to answer questions for almost a week, Sinn Fein housing spokesperson Eoin O Broin broke his silence to confirm his party has responded to the Republic#s Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon and said they are willing to take on board any recommendations she might make about their voter database.Mr O Broin also confirmed he does seek to elicit personal information from people he interacts with on social media so he can call to their homes at a later date.If I get information from someone on social media, it is when I ask them for it and they consensually give it to me for a purpose and that#s the only purpose I#ll use it for, he said.Mr O Broin said he does not record voter information in the Abu system because he has a very good memory and remembers the name and addresses of voters which he checks on the electoral register during election campaigns.Belfast Most ReadPolice monitor crowd of youths as trouble breaks out in west BelfastTV#s Dick Strawbridge and we Angel deny claims of bullying on hit C show Escape To The ChateauBelfast NI Protocol protest interrupted by brother of loyalist murder victim Raymond McCord Jr DUP: Sinn Fein#s Mountbatten apology doesn#t deserve any praise Father-of-four jailed after travelling to Belfast to have sex with -year-old girlTop VideosPlayTiny Loyalist protest at Irish Secretariat building in Belfast PlayVideo: X-rated footage of woman stripping outside a Comber bar branded #disgusting#PlayCanadian MP caught naked on camera reprimanded in ParliamentLatest Republic of IrelandJohnson vows action on NI Protocol over ‘absurd’ trading arrangementsFoster insists there is no boycott of meetings with Irish ministersNorthern Ireland vaccinations gather pace as Republic finds new iantThree cases of Indian Covid- iant detected in IrelandLatest from Belfast Northern Ireland unemployment rate increases to .% with yearly redundancies highest since Rodgers on Spurs# list of Mourinho replacementsAllowing fans back would be a big boost for all: TiptonO#Mullan can#t find the logic in latest camogie training restrictionsLidl#s £m spend in North West will support  jobs ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Ipsos Mori survey also suggests more than half think the UK will not exist in its current form in a decade.Support for a second Scottish independence referendum was highest among those in Northern Irelandand Scotland , while a majority of those in England and Wales also believe the SNP should be able to hold another ballot the party achieves a majority. Sinn Fein MP John Finucane said the debate on the future of this island and these islands is growing every day.This is yet another indication of the willingness of more and more people to consider a new future, he said.There is a place for everyone in the conversation on a new agreed and united Ireland and no one has anything to fear from it. Nor has anyone anything to fear from the people having the opportunity to have their say on their future. The findings indicate % across the UK would support a second referendumthe SNP wins a majority, with % saying they would not and % saying they do not know. Emily Gray, managing director of Ipsos Mori Scotland, said: The Scottish Parliament elections on May  look set to be a critical point in the future of the Union. Should the SNP win a majority of seats, as looks likelycurrent levels of support hold, it will be much more dficult for the UK Government to refuse a second referendum on independence. And these figures suggest that on balance, the UK public are on board with that course of action - more believe that the UK Government should allow a second referendum in the event of a SNP majority than say it should not. The survey of , people over  in the UK was conducted online between April  and . Half of the UK public said they would prefer Scotland to vote against becoming an independent countryanother referendum was held while % would prefer them to vote for this. Results show opinion is split in Scotland - % would prefer their country to vote against independence while % would prefer Scots to vote for it. A UK Government spokeswoman said: The push for a isive referendum is simply irresponsible. It is a distraction, when we need to focus on continuing to tackle the pandemic and rebuilding our economy.

The rain of the previous night has given way to a sun strong enough to elicit steam from its surface. Entering by the crossroads at the boxing club, there appear to be a lot of closed doors. A sign informs the public that Granaghan Fireplaces will be back on Monday, April . There is almost giddy optimism around the date, and by the time you read this, well be on the far bank of that particular Rubicon. Some non-essential retail will have opened, schools will be back and group training, albeit not in its full form, will have resumed. googletag.cmd.push In keeping with the general theme of this series, as soon as I gather my stuff and leave the car, the heavens open. Hailstones this time. By the time I reach the deserted play park at the bridge, it has receded to a bitter mizzle, only a stf breeze propelling it into my face. A quiet Swatragh last Friday afternoon. The Drumbane Road climbs towards the North Sperrins Scenic Route away to my right as I make my way up the hill past an empty St Johns Primary School, closed for the Easter holidays. St Johns chapel towers over the cars that pass by on the main road. That all of the gravestones seem to face in that direction only enhances the effect. googletag.cmd.push A single car sits outside the open doors of the chapel. Inside, an elderly lady has lit a candle and is praying at the foot of the altar. On the way out, she tells me Ive just missed mass. I head back towards the village. A triangular sign advertising Friels to Go sits outside the school, offering local flavour to an exploding mobile catering industry. Light snow begins to fall as I head back over the bridge. A pink Fiat brings a splash of colour to the street as grey clouds swell overhead. Outside McGuigans Garage, Kieran McGuigan says the pandemic has taken on a personal edge for him and his family.     “I had Covid myself, and so did my family, but we have all recovered. Its been a strange time. Once you get that [positive] result back, you just dont know whats in front of you.” he tells me. “Other families havent, and its been a tough time for everybody. Business-wise, were just tipping away and doing what we can. “Covid affects dferent people in dferent ways. I was off my feet, in bed for a week with the fatigue and no energy or appetite. “My we and the kids had it too, and my mother-in-law had to go into hospital with it for ten days, but thankfully shes okay now.” McGuigans garage has adapted to the restrictions as they have been introduced. Kieran pauses to wave a customer around the one-way system introduced with the onset of the pandemic. McGuigans have had to adapt like everyone . “Its all one-way and its appointment only now,” he says. “Its easier managed, you dont want too many people on the premises at the same time. Ive a routine every morning and evening where I wipe everything down. “You have your signs up, you do what you can and you bring as little people inside as possible. Were managing it and doing what we can. “The car sales will be open on Monday morning again. Vans and pick-ups have been very busy, but its going to be great to get opened up to do test drives again and meeting people face-to-face. “People enjoy the process, its part and parcel of the business. When theyre spending that amount of money, its a big step and you cant take them for granted.” Kieran admits not being able to physically meet up with friends has been tough, but says last years lockdown had a galvanising effect on the community. “There are boys I havent seen since the bars shut. Youd be texting boys, but its not the same having the craic in a WhatsApp group,” he says. “Having the banter over a beer or even getting to a football match is missed. Last year, Swatragh had five games and I was at every one of them. “The year before, I was only at a few of them, but it was just the fact you could get out, so you made a point of going to them. “The local GAA club did a lot for the community throughout the  months. They were offering to pick up groceries for people that were isolated and delivered meals. “My mum is  years of age and got it a few times, and that was done by Davitts. Its the heart of the community. Everything revolves around it and it brings everybody together.”  Sineacutead McErlean and Fran OKane from SM Filling Station on the Kilrea Road. After indulging in the glamour of being a reporter on the road and conducting a Zoom interview in the car, I head down Kilrea Road to SM Filling Station. A few minutes of to-and-fro with Sineacutead and a phone call with Sean and Im chatting to Fran OKane, who tells me the ongoing vaccination programme is lting peoples spirits. “I think people are more hopeful now because of the jab, theyre more upbeat as its been rolled out,” she says. “I have had the first one. It was a bit of a relief, but itll be better when I get the second one. Youre meeting so many people in here all the time.” The busy service station found itself with the responsibility of being essential retail, but Fran says the extra regulations quickly became part and parcel of doing business. “Its busier now again than it had been. It was very quiet early on in January but things have really picked up now and were a lot busier,” she says. “You always had that bit of nervousness and were very aware not to stand too near, or to sanitise your hands, especially with handling money and everything. “It was dficult, but as time went on it just became matter-of-fact and you just do it now every time you serve somebody. You adapt and get used to it. “Even outside, youre still inclined to pull back. Id say % of customers are wearing the masks, but you do get that odd one that doesnt wear it.” Daffodils signal Spring is well underway in Swatragh. Fran has noticed an upturn in people out walking, but is already turning her attention to more trivial matters as normality draws nearer. “I would walk the dog anyway, and you used to meet nobody out, but now youre meeting people a lot more,” she says. “Im looking forward to getting back to normal,there ever is such a thing, but Im most looking forward to getting my hair done. “I need a trim and a colour done,” she adds. The stay at home message has now officially been discontinued by the NI Executive, but it has been moot for weeks. Ato group training will come as a welcomed relief to sportspeople throughout the county, and summer feels a lot closer now than it did last week. At the weekend, the Department of Health announced over one million vaccines had been administered, between first and second doses. As Kieran McGuigan shows customers around the garage courtyard this week, Swatragh will be one small step closer to the end of the pandemic. It might feel like one giant leap.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The upgrade of the Buncrana Road was first mooted some  years ago. Hopes that work would commence in the near future rose this week after it emerged that traffic lights are to be erected at the Springtown Road junction of Buncrana Road. However, Dfi has quashed those hopes by stating the new lights were being put in place to facilitate an expectant increase in traffic due to the construction of a new Lidl supermarket due to open in  weeks time. googletag.cmd.push In a statement to the Derry News, a Dfi spokesperson said: “Planning permission was granted for a new Lidl store on the Buncrana Road which includes for the upgrade of the Springtown Road Buncrana Road junction to a signal controlled junction prior to the opening of the new store. “This measure is to assist the mitigation of the impact of traffic generated by the new retail outlet in the interests of road safety and traffic progression and will incorporate a pedestrian phase.” The spokesperson added: “In June , Minster Mallon announced her commitment to fund the continued development of a number of Strategic Road Improvement schemes including the A Buncrana Road, as part of her plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation while addressing regional imbalance. googletag.cmd.push “Consistent with wider priorities, Minister Mallon is committed to ensuring that this scheme is future-proofed to help stimulate green recovery. “The Department is continuing to progress the A Buncrana Road scheme in line with the objectives which include improving transport links, road safety, traffic progression and contributing to the regeneration of the area. The spokesperson concluded: “Officials will continue discussions with all affected landowners and other stakeholders over the coming months and to progress scheme development.” Sinn Fein Foyle MLA Martina Anderson said it was vitally important the upgrade took place as soon as possible. “The full upgrade of this road is crucial to ensure that it is fit for purpose as a main gateway into our Donegal hinterland and feature in any future expansion of the Fort George site.     “And it is also vitally important to make sure that happens as soon as possible for all the residents and businesses along its entirety as it’s estimated that over , vehicles use itdaily.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Shauna Gill, who is the younger sister of Sister Clare Crockett, will be the first speaker at the retreat at Long Tower church at .pm. She said that while people may be disappointed they cannot attend in person, the event will be fully streamed on the Long Tower Facebook page and webcam, allowing everyone across the city, and across the world to join in. She added: “This is a very special time for the family, and everyone who is devoted to Clare as it marks the fth anniversary of her death. We are delighted to be able to bring this retreat as we remember someone who has touched the lives of so many, both during her le and after her death. googletag.cmd.push “Our family have been inundated with stories from people across the world whose lives have been touched by Clare. “I’ll be opening the retreat on Monday night, and the theme of my talk will be of Clare as a big sister. I’ll be remembering Clare the way she was before she decided to walk the holy path, and went on that journey that has become so famous now. “On Tuesday night Clare’s best friend Sharon Doran will talk about Clare’s teenage years, and her former drama teacher at St Cecilia’s College Greta McTague will be the speaker on Wednesday night. “Thursday night will be a healing service celebrated by Father Michael of Termonbacca, Friday night the talk will be given by Brother Colin, and on Saturday a talk will be given by one of the sisters from the Home of the Mother. The retreat will close on Sunday night with Bishop Donal McKeown. Each evening we have a dferent priest leading the service. googletag.cmd.push “I’d encourage as many people as possible to watch the retreat online. We’d like nothing better than to have the church full, but it’s just not possible. Everything that will take place in the church will be online for everyone to join in with.” Sister Clare, aged just , died on April , , when an earthquake struck the home and school of Servant Sisters of the Mother in Playa Prieta, Ecuador, where Clare had been working for two years helping the poorer children of the region receive a higher standard of education. Her death touched thousands across the world, and especially in her hometown of Derry. Since then a mural has been painted on the gable wall at the junction of Deanery Street and Lecky Road, close to Sr. Clare’s family home, and a monthly Mass has been celebrated in the Carmelite Priory and Retreat Centre in Termonbacca.     The event will be streamed live at http:longtowerchurch.org webcam  and on the Long Tower Facebook page.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, because this did not meet the current threshold of %, the proposed new road sign will not be installed. At Hatmore Park,  households were contacted by the council.

The centre will provide hot showers, changing and toilet facilities, secure storage, induction spaces, equipment washdown and orientation points and they will improve the user experience to a whole new level. Cllr McMahon said: “We have been calling for this type of investment in Bundoran for some time and it is most welcome. The situation with Covid and lockdown highlighted just how important such outdoor physical activity is, to both body and mind.” googletag.cmd.push “Bundoran has become a magnet for those in the surfing world and we can offer a coastline, waves and other water based activities that are on par with many other parts of the world. It is something that will become more important to us in the future. This key investment in south Donegal is long overdue. The Bundoran centre will also be fully wheelchair accessible and built using sustainable materials such as solar heating  to meet ‘Nearly Zero Energy Building Standards’. The signicant increase in people enjoying outdoor water-based activities such as kayaking, surfing, paddle-boarding and open water swimming is expected to continue to grow year on year, and not just during the summer months.     This means all-weather changing facilities, secure storage and bathrooms at beaches and inland water spots will be in huge demand.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Local councillor Michael McMahon has said that funding for new facilities to be located at Tullan Strand, will be a huge boost for locals and tourists to the popular resort. “Bundoran itself has always been its own greatest asset and this will greatly enhance the facilities that will be on offer to both locals and tourism in the year ahead,” he said. Tullan Strand will be one of  locations that will share in a new €m Faacuteilte Ireland investment “to provide new state of the art facilities for outdoor water based activities”. googletag.cmd.push Each new centre will provide hot showers, changing and toilet facilities, secure storage, induction spaces, equipment washdown and orientation points and they will improve the user experience to a whole new level. The centre will provide hot showers, changing and toilet facilities, secure storage, induction spaces, equipment washdown and orientation points and they will improve the user experience to a whole new level. Cllr McMahon said: “We have been calling for this type of investment in Bundoran for some time and it is most welcome. The situation with Covid and lockdown highlighted just how important such outdoor physical activity is, to both body and mind.” googletag.cmd.push “Bundoran has become a magnet for those in the surfing world and we can offer a coastline, waves and other water based activities that are on par with many other parts of the world. It is something that will become more important to us in the future. This key investment in south Donegal is long overdue. The Bundoran centre will also be fully wheelchair accessible and built using sustainable materials such as solar heating  to meet ‘Nearly Zero Energy Building Standards’. The signicant increase in people enjoying outdoor water-based activities such as kayaking, surfing, paddle-boarding and open water swimming is expected to continue to grow year on year, and not just during the summer months.     This means all-weather changing facilities, secure storage and bathrooms at beaches and inland water spots will be in huge demand.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

After  years in Asia,  of which have been in Thailand, John is now nearing  years of age and is finally taking a step back from an adulthood that has revolved wholeheartedly around the growth of gaelic football in Bangkok and beyond. The magnitude of the Asian GAA community cannot be underestimated. The Asian Games are massive in this part of the world, with over  teams involved – men and women, and over  people coming together in friendship and competition. There are  clubs in Asia and the popularity of the sport, amongst Irish exiles and locals is growing year on year. googletag.cmd.push At the heart of this growth was, and is, Derry native John who founded Thailand GAA in . Since then, John has slowly but surely built something lasting, ever since agreeing to a request from the Asian County Board to set up a gaelic football team in Thailand. That set in motion a chain of events that has resulted in a thriving club – Thai GAA – but also a gaelic community that extends far beyond the limitations of the game itself. With three South Asia Championships to their name, Thai GAA is not just there to make up the numbers – it has ambition, not just for growth, but for success, and winning the men’s section of the Asian Gaelic Games remains the ultimate goal. googletag.cmd.push It is a far cry from kicking a ball about with Oxford United back in the late s. “I would never have thought  years ago when I was in Derry that I would end up in Thailand,” John admits. “I had one of those fork in the road moments. I was working for two years in England and was itching to get back home. I wasn’t that satisfied with my career and wanted to do something dferent. It was in July ’ that my boss rang me and asked ‘How do you fancy going to Thailand next week ’. The very same day I got a job offer back in Derry. I thoughtThailand didn’t happen, I would take the job in Derry. A week later I was in Thailand. That taste in travel, it opens your eyes to the world and I have never looked back.”     John left St. Columb’s in  and was accepted into Loughborough University for a degree in Chemical Engineering. Loughborough’s fine sporting pedigree was a key factor behind his choice but that side of it didn’t work out as he hoped and it wasn’t until his final year that he kicked a ball regularly again. He started playing gaelic – not his strong suit – in Leicester, before moving to Reading where there was a strong Irish community, and plenty in the way of soccer and gaelic. His job took him all around the world, but a trip to Taiwan in  ultimately changed his path and his le, completely. Now married to Jessie, with children Shannen, Cara and Caolan, John remembers when he discovered just how popular gaelic was in Asia. “I went to Taiwan in  on a project and discovered gaelic football team there,” he recalls. “They were competing in Asian Gaelic Games. It was just amazing to see  Irish people playing Gaelic football in China. “I had the opportunity to meet with Micheal OMuircheartaigh who was the honorary President of the Asian County Board. He comes over year and commentates on the games pitch-side. I didn’t watch a lot of gaelic growing up but I always watched the All-Ireland final. His voice was legendary and to actually meet the guy and have dinner with him and get to know him, was inspiring. “I ed to Thailand in , the County Board asked Johnhe could set up a team in Thailand. I managed to get a few Irish people and a few non-Irish people together and we got a team together and we played in our first Asian Games in Singapore in . In our first match we were lined up against Singapore Rugby team and I was in midfield and was lined up against a guy called Phil Green, who used to be a hooker for the England rugby team. “That was our first participation as Thailand GAA. Since then, every year, except , we have entered a team into the Asian Gaelic Games.”  Responsibility For a man who preferred soccer, and even a bit of golf, John was suddenly thrust into a position of responsibility, and, admittedly stubborn, he was not about to give his new role anything other than %. It was not easy however, and a lot of dficult days passed for a club which started out with five showing up for training to a club and city which has now hosted the Asian Games on three occasions, in ,  and  as well as hosting the South Asia Games on four occasions. “It was very dficult to be honest,” he admits. “The first thing I did was put an ad in the Bangkok Post and I got maybe four or five replies. The first training session had four or five people with a few girlfriends watching on. Because of my background with Oxford United, fitness came first so I told the guys they wouldn’t see a ball until they were fit, and I think because they had a dferent background from me, they thought this wasn’t for them. I probably scared people away. “Near tournaments it’s easy to get people to commit, but during the year and you’re running training once a week – I have a -hour commute to get out to training – you’re not sure what numbers you’re going to get. It’s very frustrating and the number of times I questioned myself ‘Why am I doing this ’ It was dficult, but I’m quite stubborn as well, and when I start something, it takes a lot for me to drop it because I want to make it a success. I persevered and I persevered and in  it really started changing.” The foundations of Thai GAA really started to take hold thanks to a talented group of girls, who came to the club, not just wanting to play, but to compete at the highest level. As defining moments go, this was signicant for John and his hopes of what Thai GAA could ultimately be. “I got a batch of girls in who were all natural athletes,” he explains. “Only two of them were Irish, one from the North and one from the South and neither of them had played gaelic before. One of them had played soccer for Northern Ireland but had no background in gaelic football. I had this group of girls for six weeks – all teachers from international schools before the  Asian Games in Malaysia, trying to get the basics. “In the first games they were asking ‘Where do I stand  Where do I go ’ They won six out of six at that tournament and won their ision. That was unbelievable success. Their hardest game was actually the semi-final against the Japanese Ladies. We beat them on Sudden Death Golden Goal. The same bunch of girls came back the next year in  and they won their title again that year. The following year they lost in the Upper Division, but that set the basis. This group of girls was committed, they loved their sport and we were giving them an opening to play competitively. “ was when we really bedded in as a club and that was on the back of our girls’ team. In , my girls won the South Asia Championship, so that was a regional tournament involving Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan and Shanghai. That was quite an achievement.”  Sustained success On the back of the girls’ success, the club got this influx of Irish men in  and that has since helped sustain the club over the last  years. The first men’s trophy soon followed – the Plate at the South Asia Games, and from there the club has gone from strength to strength. Better quality players joined – some with county experience, and fresh ideas and new energy began running through Thai GAA. “I was trying to remember things I learned playing with Doire Colmcille  or  years ago, but then these guys come in with fresh ideas and I was happy to let them coach,” John laughs. “The club is in a really strong place right now. We probably have about  members. What’s important is that there is a really good social side to the club as well. Most of the players would be late ’s, and early to late s, but there is room for everyone and it’s just a home away from home for a lot of people. It’s a good social network as well and you’re giving people a chance to play competitive sport as well as keeping fit. “Something I’ve picked up from the last  years of playing gaelic in Asia is what gaelic football means to people as a community. Most major cities in Asia have a gaelic team and it really is a home away from home from Irish and Northern Irish people, and people from both sides of the community in Ireland.” Only recently, John gave up the Chairmanship at the club, as he finally takes a back step from the day to day running of Thai GAA. It has been a labour of passion for the Carnhill man for  years, and he is proud of what it has become. He is not about to drt away into the sunset however. He might be turning  but he wants to keep playing, and doing whatever he can to ensure longevity and success for the club in the future. “I am very proud of what we’ve achieved in Thailand,” he says. “It’s also helped me stay connected to Ireland to be honest. This connection with gaelic football has given me more of an identity and a connection with Ireland being overseas. I have been able to meet a lot of people through gaelic football. The GAA certainly connects people and you can see the impact it has overseas. “I’m realizing that Father Time is marching on. I still want to be involved with the club, but I have work and family commitments. I used to be very heavily involved in making all the decisions but I have got a good bunch of people in there now who can share the load. “The next tournament maybe in Bangkok next year as it will host the South Asia Games and then at the end of  for the Asia Games, so maybe I can have a final swansong at those. There are guys older than me still playing so there’s a level for everyone. I’ll still be involved.”  Home away from home John s to Derry every summer with his family but for now, and for the past  years, his real home has been over , miles away, where he has helped build not just a team, but a club, a community and a legacy that will last long into the future. “It makes you realise the world is a small place and that the opportunities are out there,” he reflects. “It wasn’t something I sought out. I am proud of what I have achieved and what the club has achieved, but there has been a lot of good work that other people have done out in Asia around gaelic football. “It’s not just about gaelic football, it’s about Irish people and how we fit in around the world. We have no real baggage, we are able to adapt and fit into the communities we find ourselves in, and make a positive impact with our culture and with the welcome that we can bring to other people. When you are a teenager you have no idea where the future is going to take you. I had no great expectations or any great career plan. It was all by chance and by opportunity and here I am, sitting in Thailand.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Guy King’s film explores the first five years of the Candystripes’ footsteps in the League of Ireland, from their first game against Home Farm all the way to the treble success of  and the European tie with Benfica. googletag.cmd.push Current City boss Devine, who was only  years old when City ed to football, still remembers the excitement in the city at that period. “I remember it like yesterday, the walk down for the Home Farm game and the crowds and I remember the Shamrock Rovers friendly,” he said. “It was just a special, special time, and something that I’m hoping all our players will look at and realise the magnitude of the football club they are playing for. The place is steeped in tradition and we’re very privileged to be where we are and I’m really, really excited to see it.” googletag.cmd.push History shows just how signicant theof Derry City to senior football was at the time, with thousands of fans travelling theand breadth of Ireland in their excitement. “It was incredible and to be honest it was the saving grace of League of Ireland football,” Devine continued. “When you’re taking over , people to away games, the crowds were helping sustain football for the opponents. It is a magnicent part of our history. We have to strive to get that back, let’s not look past that. As a city it should give us something to be proud of but when you think of how the club has evolved over the years, it would be absolutely fantastic to attract those people back again.     “We haven’t had a supporter in the ground for over a calendar year and it’s going to be key that first and foremost we do our side of the bargain and try and improve on recent results, but what a magnicent history we have as a football club and we have to strive to get that back.”  Dundalk challenge Devine and his players are preparing for a huge game against Dundalk tomorrow night but the manager is hoping that those same players will take a lot from tonight’s documentary, which will again highlight just how important the football club is to the people of the city. “I think it’s amazing and I’m really excited to see it,” he added. poundI’ve heard so much about it. The four guys who are involved in it deserve huge credit. “This football club is an institution that’s the heartbeat of our city in my opinion. It is so important to the people of Derry. We need to be doing more to ensure that togetherness is there again. When I first came into the club I said I wanted to get the place going again and to be fair in that first year this place was special, it was really special. Whenever we were struggling the crowd really got behind us and that’s based on the history from  on. Whenever tough times come on, the people of Derry tend to come together and that’s what we have to do as a team now. “The people of the city in  in the film really rallied behind the club and we’re crying out for that again. It can’t come quick enough before we get bums back on seats here.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Film Producer Guy King has spent the past year making the documentary-style feature, called ‘Dferent League- the Derry City Story’, which will premiere tonight on BBC at pm. ‘Bombscares, Benfica and the Brandywell Stadium’ is the story of a community that needed to catch a break and how its football club, exiled from the league for more than a decade, was brought back from the dead. googletag.cmd.push Originally from Glenarm in County Antrim, Mr King moved to Hatmore Park in Derry as a youngster before making his home in London. He was part of the huge ‘Red and White Army that accompanied the Candystripes around Ireland in the mid-to-late ’s. And it was here that his fascination with the Candystripes began. “When I came to Derry I was ten years of age,” he recalled. “The kids on the street had just won the Hatmore Cup playing for Hatmore Harps. And everybody was talking about Owen da Gama and Alex Krstic. They would ask meI was related to Noel King. ‘Who’s Noel King ’ I would say. And I would think to myself ‘Why do they love him so much ’. So in a weird way, I’ve been making this film at the back of my head for more than  years.” googletag.cmd.push  Blaze of colour ‘Dferent League’ tells the background to Derry’s expulsion from the Irish League days and how they burst onto the League of Ireland scene in a blaze of colour, seen through the eyes of several key personnel. Dferent League: The Derry City Story follows the club through those exciting years, managed by distinguished managers such as Noel King and Jim McLaughlin and showcasing a stellar line-up of players from around the globe including the legendary Owen Da Gama and Alex Krstic as well as local heroes such as Paul Carlyle and Liam Coyle. “When I started going to the Derry City matches Owen was in his last season at the club and Noel had already left, so I got to see the Treble but I’d missed the peak ‘carnival’, as it was called,” Guy says.     “I do remember one game, when the visiting manager walked across the Brandywell pitch to the bench wearing a big full- Colombo coat and someone whispered ‘That’s Noel King’ ashe was royalty. So I was always interested in what I’d missed out on, what the ‘carnival’ had been like, and why people were so nostalgic about it. That’s what the first half of the film is about, and then we look at the Jim McLaughlin era up until the Benfica game.”  Imagination to screen Transitioning from imagination to screen was a long time in coming, but it was an idea that Guy could never quite let go of. “I was making a film called Border Country: Ireland Was Divided and during the research period, Derry filmmaker Sean Mullen told me all about the Gang of Four and how they had come up with the idea of Derry City playing football across the border. I thought it was a terric story but that it probably needed a film of its own,” he explained. “I had no ideaanybody was interested. One day I took a long list of ideas into the BBC and the one they were most keen on was my Derry City idea. Probably because they don’t get a whole lot of feel-good ideas out of Northern Ireland, and when you haven’t heard the whole story, it is quite amazing: for Derry to go from having no team for  years and no hope of having a team, to playing in the European Cup at the Brandywell on national television…and this happened in a five-year period. “If you look at the pitching documents we sent to the BBC, they are surprisingly similar to the film that came out the other end. This was our big sell: “A story of four ordinary men defying the system, against all odds. All they wanted was for their city to have a football team again. Their crazy idea changed the city and the country forever.” This is a good description of what you’ll see on Monday night. I’m not sure how much theof Derry City ‘changed the country’, but it certainly had a positive social effect that reached far beyond the walls of the city.” Guy is the first to acknowledge the help he has received locally in bringing his project to reality, with the Derry City story quite fittingly a real team effort. “We made the film in four stages,” Guy continues. “Myself and two producerstalked to as many players and fans as we could in lockdown we had a two-week research trip in July to meet people we filmed in August and then we had a long editing period for the next lock-down. So I’m very grateful for the summer period where Covid when there was almost zero in Derry. We still had to follow all the BBC protocols but we got enough good material when we were able to.”  Memories The documentary-film is sure to take City fans back to an extraordinary time in their club’s history, and revive memories of a unique period for Derry as a whole. “The thing that struck most last summer was that when people say football is spiritual, it can lt you higher – they’re not joking,” Guy continues. “The s Glory Years moved people to their core, it shted mindsets. A Creggan woman told me that she has two distinct compartments in her head: a dark one for memories of the Troubles, and a colourful one for her memories of going to the Derry City matches. “The whole experience had a fundamental impact on that way people saw themselves and how the outside world saw Derry. I loved playing football my whole le, but I never really understood what being a proper football fan was all about. It’s about more than football. I think I can see that now, and I hope people who normally hate football watch the film and see it a bit dferently. ““Here’s a story I love: when things were at their most stressful for Jim McLaughlin before he won the Treble, he carried a poem around in his pocket. The poem was ‘If’ by Rudyard Kipling with lines like this: “If you can dream—and not make dreams your master… If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you.. If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster And treat those two impostors just the same… You’ll be a Man, my Son!” It’s fantastic to think of him deriving strength from a poem like that when the chips were down.  Never a dull moment As any Derry City fan can attest, there is rarely a dull moment when it comes to Derry City, and right from the off in , the excitement, the drama, and the controversy began. “I’d have loved to include some of the finer details, such as how Jim McLaughlin recommended Noel King for the job of manager in the first place, and then a year later it was Noel suggested Jim come and join him, a decision he famously lived to regret,” Guy says. “At the time, the fall-out between the two men split the city, but history will judge them both to be superheroes. That’s the way I see it. They both dared to dream: Noel thought that along with Jim, they could take Derry to success on the European stage. And Jim was talking about winning the Treble long before they did. “Everyone was thinking big at the time, that’s what made that era special. The sky was the limit. And that’s what the film portrays: by getting to the top of the mountain, Derry saw a new view over the horizon. The team lted morale in a way nothing  could have done at that time in its history.”  Local talent Guy adds: “Of the eight songs with vocals in the film, seven are by Derry artists: Felix Healy , Paddy Nash, Declan McLaughlin, Strength NIA, Red Organ Serpent Sound, Jonny Nutt and the lesser-known Divine Comedy. “A couple of the songs were composed especially for the film: one is ‘Daughter Dear ’ by Jonny Nutt and the other is Strength NIA’s ‘Owen Da Gama’ which is coming out on a record soon. “It was Rory Moore from Strength NIA who first told me about Owen Da Gama because he lived across the street from us when we were kids in Hatmore Park. So there’s nostalgia for you.”  Dferent League: The Derry City Story by State Of Grace and Stray Bear Films, will be broadcast on BBC One Northern Ireland tonight at pm.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is imperative that this report is published and consulted upon so that we can see the stark reality of what key strategists in health here are thinking.ldquoAre we to take the threat of having the Downe and Daisy Hill in Newry reduced to dferent grades of urgent care centres  If we are, then we need to maintain solidarity as a district and not allow this to happento either of our two beloved hospitals.Cllr Savage said the local authority could not get into a ldquoide and conquer approach that saw ldquoone end of the district get more crumbs from the health service table than the other.ldquoWe need to fight to protect and enhance the services at both hospitals. We want services retained and enhanced for our people, he said.The Newry councillor pointed to the -year community campaign for a new Downe Hospital, suggesting that since its foundation stone was laid ldquoit has been a constant battle to retain services, commending the Down Community Health Committee for its work in fighting to retain local services.ldquoWe in this district should not have to constantly look over our shoulder in fear of the centralising grim reapers within the Department of Health attempting to swing the axe again at our cherished local hospitals to enhance services within a cluster of hospitals within the greater Belfast area, declared Cllr Savage.ldquoElected representatives have an obligation to speak up for our people and ensure that we are not treated as second class citizens when it comes to access to local hospital services and first class health care.ldquoThe Department of Health should be looking to enhance local hospitals and a strategy needs to be looked at regionally with the emphasis on fair access to local health services.Highlighting the need to fight to protect the health rights of rural communities across the district, Cllr Savage called for a ldquofair share of specialist services across all hospitals, suggesting thatthe Downe is good enough to provide cataract surgery, it is good enough to provide other services.Cllr Savage added: ldquoWe need to look at the challenges we face in health and ask ourselves are the current engagement structures we have capable of holding decision makers within health to account into the future and could they withstand the body blow of a potential decision to halve the number of current hospitals ldquoWe need to review those structures and a good place to start would be enhanced engagement with the Down Community Health Committee and Daisy Hill Pathfinder Group, inviting these groups to meet with us to discuss their concerns for the future of our local hospitals in a post-Covid world.Cllr Savage said local people required an ldquounequivocal statement from the health minister that there are no plans to reduce the number of hospitals and a ldquocast iron guarantee that there are no plans to downgrade the Downe HospitalHe added: Only when we get a response will we know  the rumours are just rumours. If itrsquos the latter, ever member of the chamber and everyone across this district will be up for that fight..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/14Apr2021-Church.jpg","title":"Church delivers huge food donation  ","story":"THE Journey Church in Downpatrick has been working to distribute more than pound, worth of food supplies to ious food banks across the district.Over a seven-week period, dozens of volunteers worked to ensure that food has been delivered to organisations which get the supplies to families and iniduals who need it most.Itrsquos the latest wave of the local effort from Newry, Mourne and Down Council with funding from the Department for Communitiesto get practical help to families economically affected by the pandemic.From March last year, local groups quickly responded to distribute food parcels to any household in need. The post-Christmas lockdown presented yet another challenge to the council and the DfC to target help where it was most needed.The County Down Rural Community Network , Newry Confederation of Community groups and others were asked to set up three brand new distribution centres and allocated over pound, worth of food and essential hygiene and household goods to the area.The Journey Church stepped up to assist in the Downpatrick area and week after week, dozens of their volunteers received the supplies from Lynas Foods, which they made into the ious orders and dispatching them to the ious groups in need. Down Community Transport helped with the bulkier loads.The Clanrye Group were tasked with coordinating the scheme and Kilkeel Development Association looked after the Mournes area. Clanrye collated orders for food and supplies each week and Lynas foods delivered pallets of supplies to this part of the world.Orders were placed each week by local food banks, the St Vincent de Paul Society, Home-Start, Sure Start and other organisations.Nicholas McCrickard, manager of CDRCN, said: ldquoOn behalf of the strategic stakeholder forum, I want to thank Journey Church and all the other groups involved in this gigantic effort.ldquoThe general public may never fully grasp the scale of the operation to keep our foodbanks and SVP stocked and able to answer the great need which has been brought on by the pandemic.ldquoWhile many of us have seen our lives as relatively unaffected, thousands of people have seen their normal weekly incomes and their day to day struggles take a turn for the worse.ldquoThis food pallet scheme and other financial and food security systems have been a leline for many. I want to thank the Maria Keenan from the Clanrye Group in particular and my colleague Daniella McCarry for going well beyond their normal jobs to help people most in need.Daniella said: ldquoWe could not have done this without the volunteers from the Journey Church in Downpatrick.

The DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna and Kathryn Owen abstained.Cllr Brown urged the local authority to oppose the harm caused to the LGBT+ community in the past through the denial of rights and equal treatment and to recognise that discrimination still occurs today.Councillors have also supported a call to three Stormont ministers mdash Deirdre Hargey, Robin Swann and Naomi Long mdash to introduce an effective ban on conversion therapy within Northern Ireland, supported by a programme of work to help tackle these practices in all their forms.Cllr Brownrsquos motion, which urged the NI Executive and UK government to ban conversion therapy, called on the council to highlight and promote the continued support, counselling and advocacy local groups provide to members of the LGBT+ community.ldquoConversion therapy is a horric practice that has no place in todayrsquos society, Cllr Brown declared.ldquoConversion therapy is a term used to refer to ious dangerous and discredited practices aimed at changing an inidualrsquos sexual orientation or gender identity.ldquoThat could include attempting to change someonersquos sexual orientation from lesbian, gay or bisexual to straight or their gender identity from transgender or non-binary to cisgender.Cllr Brown said this disgraceful practice should not be accepted and permanently banned through legislation.Cllr Byrne mdash who is the SDLP group leader mdash said the fact that the issue was being debated in  was ldquobeyond distressing and as conversion therapy was still openly being practised.ldquoWe canrsquot look at the LGBT community and ask us to speak about it without your support, he told colleagues. ldquoWe need everyone in the chamber to support it and I hope they do.ldquoWe have heard the disappointing and weak response from the equalities minister on the conversion therapy debate in early March and we have waited almost , days since the UK government announced its intention to ban this therapy and we should not have to wait any longer.ldquoItrsquos long past time that the NI Executive stood up together to ban what I think are abusive practices in Northern Ireland and right across the UK, banning all interventions that have the intention of changing, suppressing, converting or cancelling sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.Cllr Byrne said that growing up as gay, he found it incredibly dficult, explaining to his colleagues that he could not express how dficult it had been.ldquoMentally, you torture yourself, you question yourself and you close down, block out your feelings. You literally wear a mask every single day, praying that you donrsquot say something that will give you away.ldquoYou endure enough mental anguish to last a dozen letimes so, to me, when I look back, that is you internally practising a form of conversion therapy on yourself. It is shameful, but that is how you feel growing up, suppressing your own sexual orientation and every LGBT+ person knows the damage that it does, he said, emphasising that allowing conversion therapy to be practised openly or signposting people towards it is ldquobeyond depressing.Cllr Byrne said for most of those in the gay community they ldquogenerally breathe for the first time when they let it all out and to be true to yourself, explaining that the dficulties do not stop there.ldquoYou are confronted as a gay person by many situations that challenge you mentally and while people say lsquothat is the cross you have to bearrsquo it should not be, he continued. ldquoThere is nothing about my sexuality that needs fixed, nothing about it that needs intervention.Cllr Cathy Mason, who seconded the motion, said the practice of conversion therapy sought to ldquodenormalise or completely eradicate a personrsquos sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression and was deeply rooted in ldquointolerance and bigotry.She said those who conducted the therapy regularly exploited the vulnerabilities of young people struggling with their sexuality.She described conversion therapy as a ldquodeeply harmful and regressive practice and that there must be no loopholes on the legislation governing it.Cllr Hanna said the DUP would abstain on the motion, making it clear he had no problems with anyone and takes everyone as he finds them and that conversion therapy was ldquosomething that he would not wish on anyone.Cllr Willie Clarke said no one had the right to question another personrsquos sexuality, while Cllr Reilly askedpeople were ldquoforced into conversion therapy, explaining that he did not know about the issue.However, he suggested that to ban something because ldquoyou did not like a personrsquos ideology or philosophy was the start of a dark path.He said there was a wider context to the issue and that he had a lot of respect for Cllr Byrne.

Try and find a safe beach, which I know could be more challenging as we have to stay local she said.Since lockdown, Irsquove been restricted so I would travel to the end of the quay in Killyleagh and swim down there. You have to consider the effects of rip tides as they can come close to the shore and can be a very real danger.Lorna recommends those who are thinking of giving it a try to bring a wetsuit, neoprene socks, a hat, gloves, dry robe, hot drinks and possibly a hot water bottle for afterwards.Swimmers should always aim to gradually heat their body once out of the water by adding layers to prevent going into a hypothermic shock.Also, they are advised to bring a floating aid to be seen safely and wear bright clothes.Lorna, a NHS care worker, first got involved with wild swimming after a colleague informed her of a Bangor-based group called Dash and Splash.Since then, more and more groups have took to the waters in local places such as Newcastle, Ballyhornan and Whiterock.

In October, firefighters fought to bring a malicious blaze under control.They were back at the plant last Saturday just before pm following reports of a fire in an industrial skip which spread to a nearby metal container.Fire crews from Downpatrick and Ballynahinch brought the blaze under control within an hour of the alarm being raised.The fire at the waste oil plant came at the end of three nights of sporadic trouble in the area, with fires started in the middle of the Killough Road which straddles the Model Farm and Flying Horse estates and missiles fired at cars.It is also understood that police on patrol in the area came across a pile of breeze blocks which were removed, fearing they would have been used as missiles to target passing cars.Cllr John Trainor mdash who was a passenger in a car targeted by petrol bombers late on Saturday night mdash has called for an end to the violence, which, he said, is being perpetrated by teenagers hellbent on causing misery for others.He believes that a partnership approach involving the local community, statutory agencies and the police is vital in getting on top of an issue which has resulted in a number of residents living in fear and others afraid to venture out at night.Just before .pm last Saturday, Cllr Trainor was approaching the Model Farm junction when a petrol bomb was hurled at the vehicle by a crowd of up to eight teenagers which included girls and boys. While the missile missed the car, it smashed on the main road and exploded.ldquoA fire had been lit on the main road and there is just no sense to this kind of activity, he declared.ldquoWhatan elderly driver had been confronted by a petrol bomb thrown at them and lost control of their vehicle  I have no doubt that last weekrsquos trouble was cleary pre-meditated.ldquoYou just donrsquot turn up at a housing area and discover petrol bombs. While what happened was clearly planned, it is not reflective of the hard working local people in the area.Cllr Trainor said there was ldquono sense to this kind of activity and questioned how the teenagers were able to get their hands on petrol bombs.He said there had been trouble at the Killough Road some years ago and that a targeted approach involving local groups and statutory agencies had made an impact.ldquoI think we need to go back to this model and there must be community buy-in. It is clear we are talking about a long term commitment as this continued trouble needs to stop. People have had enough and want to be able to live their lives free from the threat of trouble and violence, continued Cllr Trainor.ldquoWe need a strategy and action plan in tandem with an effective policing policy to deal with this issue and a pledge from partner agencies that they will make a long-term commitment. A partnership approach is vital moving forward and must include the local community.Admitting that he was not shocked nor surprised by the petrol bomb attack, Cllr Trainor said what happened could potentially have had ldquocatastrophic consequences with the behaviour witnessed over the past number of days at the Killough Road area nothing knew, insisting that it is in no way reflective of of the people who live locally.ldquoWe have a situation where people are not happy and a number are living in fear. Numerous scenarios could potentially have played out last weekend and I am thankful that they didnrsquot. The the fire in the road, the arson attack at the waste oil plant and the petrol bomb incident will be roundly condemned and rightly so. But they must not be allowed to continue, that is why a strategy to deal with the issue involving all stakeholders is vital.Cllr Trainor added: ldquoWe simply cannot have a situation where violence is prevalent in a part of Downpatrick where people are trying to get on with their lives. They do not need this. Throwing petrol bombs is not entertainment, it is criminality. Anti-social behaviour is often a symptom of other issues in peoplersquos lives which have to be tackled.Agreeing that the recent trouble is not reflective of the wider community, Cllr Oonagh Hanlon revealed that she witnessed some of the incidents including the malicious fires.She said it appeared that the blaze at the Macwaste plant was started deliberately and was ldquoextremely concerning given that the business was targeted last October.ldquoConsidering the highly flammable material stored at the Brannish Road site, it is a miracle that no one was seriously injured, she declared.ldquoCredit to our local firefighters who ensured that the fire did not spread. It is extremely frustrating that emergency services are being distracted from what could be more serious incidents and emergencies. We also had reports of petrol bombs being thrown at cars passing through the area last week.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoIt is hugely disappointing and frustrating that this type of behaviour continues in this area. Do the perpetrators of these crimes realise the impact of their actions ldquoI would appeal to anyone with information about what happened and those involved to provide it to the authorities and ask the community to continue to report suspicious behaviour as people are fed up with the actions of a small minority. This trouble must stop..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/14Apr2021-Prince.jpg","title":"Prince Philip was most certainly a one off  ","story":"ROWALLANE councillor Terry Andrews has posted a photo on his Facebook page recalling his fatherrsquos meeting with Prince Philip during a visit to Mount Stewart on the shores of Strangford Lough in .Mr Paul Andrews mdash who was secretary of Killyleagh Wildfowlers at the time and heavily involved with the work of a conservation group connected with the internationally acclaimed waterway mdash often recalled with his family details of the meeting with the senior Royal.The social media post, which shows the Prince deep in conversation with Crossgar man Mr Andrews and two others, took pride of place in the Killyleagh home of Herbie and Mary Andrews, Paulrsquos parents.Not only that, a photo of their grandson Terry meeting Prince Andrew when he visited Killyleagh in  also took pride of place in his grandparentsrsquo home.So they had two photos of a father and a son meeting a Royal father and son.ldquoMy father said he found the Duke of Edinburgh to be a perfect gentleman and enjoyed the conversation that he had with him, Terry revealed.ldquoThe Prince was quite interested about Strangford Lough, its environs and history. It was clear that while he had a full diary given his role as the Queenrsquos consort, he was way ahead of his time when it came to environmental, wildle and conservation issues.Terry said the television coverage of the Princersquos le, which ended just a few short months short of his th birthday, brought many memories of his own family flooding back.ldquoWatching the old black and white footage and Prince Philiprsquos military service in particular brought back memories of my grandfather Herbie and his brothers, including my uncle, Andy Andrews, who joined the Royal Navy.ldquoMy grandfather served in the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers as a Regimental Sergeant Major serving in India in the s and in the Second World War in Belgium where, behind enemy lines, he was shot.ldquoMiraculously, the bullet struck a pocket watch that his mother gave him, saving his le.

My father described the Prince as the perfect gentleman.ldquoHis sad passing does indeed mark the end of a era Prince Philip was truly unique and I know that from talking to my dad that he enjoyed his visits to Northern Ireland. The Prince will be missed most by his family, but he has left an indelible mark and the success of his Duke of Edinburgh award scheme is unparalleled.Terry said the torch for environmental issue which was taken up Sir David Attenborough so many years ago was one once carried by Prince Philip whose care for the such an important issue has been passed to his eldest son Prince Charles.He added: ldquoPrince Philip has left his mark on this world and there are many people from Northern Ireland who have met him over the years.ldquoThey recall a man with an infectious sense of duty and one who could also be humorous at times, using this aspect of his character to put others at ease.

Liverpool, Cha, Man City and Tottenham are the other four English teams backing the new competition which would also involve giants of European football, including Real Madrid, Barcelona and AC Milan.If established, the ESL would operate as a midweek competition with the clubs continuing to compete in their national leagues.John White of the -strong Carryduff Manchester United Supporters’ Club said early indications are that many of his club’s member will not attend any of the ESL matches.“We have  season tickets at Carryduff so what are we renewing them for  Are we renewing them to see  Premier League games, plus European football, plus League Cup, plus FA Cup  Becausewe go into this new European Super League, the FA is going to dump them out of the [English] league, quite rightly – they won’t be allowed in any of the domestic cups, that’s all gone, so are we just paying to see a league there is no relegation from “And will this now skyrocket the price to see games  It might price fans out of it,” he said.Mr White added: “If you look at the Gary Neville interview he used quite strong and emotional words.Manchester Uniteds Mason Greenwood celebrates scoring at the weekend. Photo: Phil Noble PA Wire.“He said he as been a fan for  years and that these guys are basically ripping clubs off – he said it’s just a money thing.”The lelong Red Devils fan said the club’s roots are in the working class community of Manchester, and that that humble beginning should not be tarnished by chasing more millions at the expense of the supporters. He said: “Manchester United was formed in  but hard-working railway workers from Newton Heath railway. Their fans... built the canals and the railways, and built the motorways around Manchester... are working class people.“Man United might be first of second richest club in the work right now, but they were born out of poverty. They went bankrupt in  and had to form a new club, and it was the fans that stuck by them.“I’m hearing that a lot of United fans might not attend these games.”Alastair Kerr of the North Down Arsenal Supporters’ Club said the club he loves has “sold its soul” to boost its bank balance.“I can quite categorically say that, on social media and our own fans in our own club, I haven’t seen any supporters of Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool or anyone  in support of it.“Most of think the club has sold its soul,” he said.“The days of the rich local businessman – who is a fan who invested in his home club – are now unfortunately well gone.“It’s now the likes of people from the Far East or America investing in the football clubs and their only interest is money – it’s not the supporters.“Not only Arsenal but a lot of clubs.”Mr Kerr said the only way the fans can effectively show their displeasure is not to pay any additional subscriptions to broadcasters to watch the ESL.On Twitter, the Northern Ireland Children’s Commissioner Koulla Yiasouma said: “Dear @williamcrawley and @BBCTalkback as an Arsenal supporter I am feeling deeply disappointed and ashamed of the team that I have loved for half a century.

Itrsquos an eclectic and fascinating place that has, over the last fty years, evolved to be welcoming and inclusive to many dferent types of peopleChapter Arts Centre came to le thanks to the driving force of writer Mik Flood and artists Christine Kinsey and Bryan Jones.CEO Chapter Andy Eagle. Photo Kirsten McTernanDiscussions about the opening of an arts centre in Cardf started in  and were part of a vision for a space where artists could produce and present work, free from commercial pressures. Experimental work was seen as key to its identity, and the needs of artists were at its heart.The venue was formerly Canton High School, and the initial period of set up was a demanding time. The founders, and a gang of enthusiastic and dedicated volunteers, lovingly cleared, restored and adapted the building to make it fit for purpose as Walesrsquo first arts centre.The first official Board meeting was held on  April  and in July that year Chapter opened its doors with a temporary cinema, gallery and bar, and with former classrooms used as studios, workshops and offices.

Photo courtesy of Christine KinseyToabout the history of Chapter and itrsquos early years between  and , visit: www.issuu chapter docs earlyyears_copy.Five decades on, Chapter has grown into one of the largest arts complexes in Europe, with two cinemas, two theatres, a gallery, a large number of artistsrsquo studios and creative industry offices, meeting places for the community and a cafeacute bar.Chapter in the early daysIt produces and presents the best in national and international contemporary visual art, experimental and thought-provoking performance, and challenging independent, mainstream and international films, all alongside an inclusive learning and engagement programme.     Every year, the venue welcomes , visitors to more than  film screenings,  live performances,  visual art exhibitions and  community classes, artisan fairs and events.Mr Eagle added: ldquoChapter is many dferent things to many dferent people. For some, it will be the international gallery exhibitions and the programme of independent films.\"For others, it will be the cafeacute bar and restaurant to meet friends before a Cardf City home game, or it will be for dance and theatre classes or a cup of tea before working in the community garden.\"But at its heart itrsquos a centre for contemporary art, supporting artists and creatives from Wales and beyond to produce and present work.Chapter works with practitioners at every stage in their careers, supporting and stimulating opportunities for exciting new talent as well as promoting the work of established artists.It is a springboard for the creative community of Wales with a focus on bringing the world to Wales and Wales to the world.Chapter is home to over  of Walesrsquo most dynamic creative companies and artists, including BAFTA Cymru, Printhaus, ie ie Productions, Everyman Theatre, Beryl Productions, Cardf Music School and Taking Flight Theatre. Chapter has remained open to this creative community during the pandemic.MORE NEWS:They also offer a range of spaces in support of local artists and companies for the research and development of artistic projects, including Hijinx Theatre.Like most art and entertainment venues, the last year has been one of the most dficult times for the organisation as they were forced to close their doors. MrEagle commented: ldquoClosure has had a massive impact on us. We are an arts organisation that generates almost all of its income through ticket sales, classes, hires, cafeacute bar and other activity.\"The small remaining amount comes fromArts Council of Wales and is used to support our arts and education programme. Our capacity to earn incomeliterally stopped overnight and that was profoundly scary.Support has been generated from extremely generous public donations and from a range of funders including Arts Council Wales, Welsh Government, BFI, Art Fund, Ffilm Cymru and Admiral.Since its closure, Chapter has offered an exciting Chapter from Home programme, consisting of over  virtual film screenings, online theatre productions and art exhibitions, monthly online comedy gigs presented by Welsh comedian Robin Morgan, virtual lectures with Arts Society Cardf, as well as outdoor theatre performances with Cardf-based companies including Theatr Iolo and Kitsch  Sync.Currently showing at Chapteris internationally focussed art exhibition Artes Mundi.

In the Gallery are immersive works by South African artist Dineo Seshee Bopape - objects, drawing and sound are presented in spaces with walls covered in washes of soil from Welsh sacred sites.Talking about the programme since Chapter closed, Director of Programme Hannah Firth said: ldquoWhen our doors closed in March last year we wanted to ensure that we could still talk to our audiences and the creative community that is our beating heart.\"Despite the uncertainty faced by many artists, they showed an astonishing resilience and desire to quickly adapt to other ways of working and engaging.\"Wersquove been lucky enough to be able to work with some of them to create a dynamic programme of events and activity online and outdoors, and have developed a number of key commissions to support artists including on our lightbox, in our cafeacute bar, in our gallery, around the Canton community, and online.Chapter is currently getting ready to re-open. Depending on Covid guidelines, they hope to welcome customers back outdoors sometime after Easter, and they have been working hard to improve their outdoor catering offer to keep visitors warm and cosy day and night.Although Chapter canrsquot bring everyone together for a big Birthday party as planned, they will celebrate their five decades through to next April with a series of special events, activities and online content - they particularly have some exciting plans for outdoor events this summer.Mr Eagle said: ldquoNeedless to say  is not the year we were anticipating for our th!ldquoWhile the move to digital is great in many ways, ultimately, people want to be able to enjoy themselves and meet and do things in person.

This opportunity is in advance of opening the programme to the entire - age group by the end of April. Appointments are mainly available at the vaccine centre at the SSE Arena and bookings will be available from pm today. Appointments in community pharmacies will be made available to - year olds later in April as vaccine supplies permit. Health Minister Robin Swann said:“I have always been clear that we would move through the vaccine programme as quickly as vaccine deliveries and capacity allows as recommended by JCVI. I recently announced that we successfully administered over one million vaccines across Northern Ireland to the highest priority groups. This figure is expected to rise exponentially as the Trust vaccine centres and GP practices continue to deliver second doses while the vaccine centre at the SSE Arena and the community pharmacists push ahead to deliver first doses. Opening up to - year olds earlier than expected is a testament to the hard work and dedication of all staff who are delivering the vaccination programme in Northern Ireland. “I encourage those who are eligible to seize this opportunity and take up the offer of vaccination. Getting the vaccine not only protects you but also those close to you. I would also strongly encourage anyone aged  years or over who hasn’t booked themselves a vaccination appointment yet to do so as soon as possible.” In line with recent JCVI advice, those living in the same house with someone who is severely immunosuppressed will also be able to access the programme shortly, once their household has received a letter from their GP. Appointments at this stage are limited and the Department is asking for patience. If you cannot get an appointment immediately keep trying. Appointments will be more widely available by the end of April. If possible, booking should be done online at:https:covid-.hscni.net get-vaccinated However, where online booking is not possible, the telephone booking number is   .  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_adeefafeadcfdb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fefbfacbcdcfdd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
