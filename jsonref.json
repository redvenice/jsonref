In 1987, she served as Commissioner of the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation for the state of Maine and later as the New England regional director of the Small Business Administration in 1992.After relocating to Massachusetts to serve as the state’s Deputy State Treasurer in 1993, she returned to her native Maine in 1994 to launch a gubernatorial bid for the state’s governorship, becoming the first woman to be nominated by a major political party for the position of Governor of Maine.However, she ultimately lost the election to Angus King, who would later serve alongside her in the United States Senate.After working in the private sector, Collins again launched another political bid and was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1996, formally taking her position as Senator the following year.          Brett Kavanaugh, above, faces an extremely close confirmation battle ahead in the U.S. SenateA moderate Republican, she was reelected in 2002, 2008 and 2014. In the Senate, Collins has played a key role on many issues and chaired the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee from 2003 to 2007.In the 2016 election, she stated that should would not support the nomination of Donald Trump as the Republican standard bearer and has had a mixed record on supporting Trump after his surprise election victory, voting in favor of his proposed tax cuts in December 2017 but also opposing the President’s controversial temporary ban on travel and immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries and his family separation policy at the U.S.-Mexico border.Collins has also emerged as a key swing vote on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, being set to unveil her final decision on October 5 ahead of the final vote in the U.S. Senate.How old is Susan Collins?Susan Collins is 65 years old.She was born on December 7, 1952.          Collins has served in the Senate since 1997 and considered a leading moderate voice thereWho is Susan Collins’s husband?Susan Collins’s husband is Thomas Daffron.The couple has been married since 2012.What is Susan Collins’s net worth?According to Open Secrets, Collins’s net worth is believed to be about $3.7 million (£2.8m).She is believed to draw her wealth from both her years of government service and through various financial investments.Susan Collins vote on KavanaughIn the lead-up to the final vote on the controversial nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, the Republican Senator has emerged as a critical swing vote who could ultimately decide the balance of the highest court in the United States for decades to come.Collins, who has not yet publicly decided whether she’ll vote to confirm Kavanaugh or not, has revealed that she’ll announce her decision at 3pm EST on Friday, October 5.          Senator Susan Collins will soon reveal how she intends to vote 3pm EST on Friday, October 5During a procedural vote on the morning of October 5, Collins joined other swing vote Senators like Jeff Flake and Democrat Joe Manchin in advancing Kavanaugh’s nomination to a final floor vote on October 6. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican known for bucking her party, voted against advancing Kavanaugh’s nomination.Despite voting in favor of the procedural vote to advance Kavanaugh, Collins is still undecided – at least publicly – as to whether she’ll ultimately vote to confirm him, creating much uncertainty as to whether the Supreme Court nominee has enough votes to ultimately be confirmed as the next U.S. Supreme Court Justice.The Republicans’ narrow Senate majority means that they can only afford to lose one vote if all Democrats vote against Kavanaugh and Vice President Mike Pence casts the tiebreaking vote in Kavanaugh’s favor.In addition to Collins, Senators Flake, Murkowski and Manchin have not yet publicly announced how they will vote on the planned final floor vote on Saturday, October 6.Who is Sat Hari Khalsa?

Its publisher, Penguin, announced the cancellation of the Topshop display on Twitter – revealing the promotion had been taken down soon after being assembled.That prompted award-winning actress Thandie Newton to suggest Green was responsible for the move, labelling him a ‘loser’. The 45-year-old Line Of Duty star tweeted: ‘Yesterday Philip Green used his big muscles to smash up the Topshop penguinrandom FeministsDontWearPink pop-up because he thought it was too controversial!!?

On the boss’s orders. No explanation given. Maybe he just doesn’t like pink.’Last night, it was claimed that the stall was removed shortly after Green viewed it on a morning walk through the store before it opened, prompting a Penguin press officer to burst into tears.Florida student, 22, shares photos of her horror injuries...Fracking could resume in days as Government lends support...Share this articleA source told the Mail: ‘They were setting up, it was all going well, but then there was a bit of a commotion, Philip Green was stomping round….

The legacy of thalidomide, the last mainstream drug for the nausea suffered by millions of women in pregnancy, was not only the deformed limbs of 10,000 babies but an unwillingness to licence and provide any other medication for fear of any similarly apocalyptic side effects.When I was editor of Vogue, I worked with an 80 per cent female staff and saw countless of their babies grow into young men and women. I also witnessed how difficult it was for these prospective mothers to deal with the horror of the inappropriately titled morning sickness. They were often overcome throughout the day with nausea and vomiting.          The Duchess of Sussex is mastering the art of Royal diplomacy at an amazingly fast clip. On her and Prince Harry\u0027s first visit to Brighton last week, she was presented with what was described as an \u0027intersectional feminist\u0027 Cruelly, it was in the first early weeks, the time when pregnancies are at their most vulnerable, that they often had the worst symptoms but it was also when they wanted to keep their condition private.Few women wish to tempt fate for the first ten weeks by announcing their news to their boss and a whole office. Some were uncertain how they felt about their pregnancy, others had suffered previous miscarriages, and others were worried about how they would manage a baby and a working life.Relentless nausea while carrying on the appearance of business as usual (especially from the cramped bench seating of a month of fashion shows) is no easy task.Let\u0027s hope Xonvea will be a life-changing aid for all prospective mothers, helping these extraordinary nine months of pregnancy be the positive experience it should be, rather than the endurance test it becomes for many.It\u0027s no supermodelBMW has just announced that its new model will talk to us.

He’s currently the Workers’ Party candidate for President of Brazil in the upcoming 2018 election.Haddad was born in São Paulo, Brazil on January 25, 1963.The son of Lebanese immigrants, he earned a master’s degree in economics and a doctorate in philosophy from the University of São Paulo before starting a career as an investment analyst at Unibanco.Haddad later worked as a consultant for the Institute of Economic Research Foundation before moving into public sector work, finding employment as the chief of staff to the Finance and Economic Development Secretary for São Paulo and eventually as a special advisor at the Brazilian Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management.Climbing the ranks of government steadily, he later was named as the Minister of Education for Brazil in July 2005. During his tenure, Haddad established the Basic Education Development Index to help better measure the quality of public primary and middle schools in Brazil.He also oversaw the implementation of a new scholarship program aimed at helping low-income students attend private colleges and made numerous reforms to the country’s National High School Exam.Haddad left his position in January 2012 and was named as the candidate for Mayor of São Paulo during the 2012 municipal elections in Brazil. After advancing to the second round of the election, he defeated the city’s former mayor, José Serra, with just over 55 per cent of the vote.After assuming his new duties as mayor in January 2013, he implemented a sweeping expansion of the city’s bike lane network but later sparked a major backlash in June of that year after announcing, along with the government of the state of São Paulo, that mass transit ticket prices would be increased.The decision ultimately led to mass protests in the São Paulo and many other major Brazilian cities.          Fernando Haddad served as the Mayor of São Paulo from January 2013 until January 2017By July 2016, Haddad was hobbled by a dismal approval ratings of only 14 per cent of city residents and lost his reelection bid in October 2016 to João Doria, the Brazilian Social Democracy party candidate.He ultimately left office in January 2017 after a four-year tenure as mayor of Brazil’s largest city.As the 2018 Brazil elections loomed, he was named as former President Lula da Silva’s running mate in August in his bid to regain the presidency.However, da Silva was later ruled as disqualified from running for president again by the Superior Electoral Court for violating the country’s Clean Record Act shortly afterwards on August 31 due to his conviction on corruption charges.Haddad was eventually named as da Silva’s replacement by the Workers’ Party on September 11 while Brazil Communist Party legislator Manuela d\u0027Ávila took his place as the candidate for vice president. 2018 Brazil election polls   According a recent Americas SocietyCouncil of the Americas poll, Haddad is currently in second place ahead of the election, which will be held in stages from October 7 to October 28. Haddad leads a number of other candidates but still trails Bolsonaro, the conservative populist frontrunner of the Social Liberty Party who many have compared to U.S. President Donald Trump. Bolsonaro leads the poll with 35 percent of the vote while Haddad trails with 22 percent. Notably, Haddad\u0027s polling numbers have largely flatlined in recent days while Bolsonaro has surged ahead, making his victory, while not a sure thing, all the more likely as the election gets underway.Who is Sat Hari Khalsa?

For those  who want to do some rugged and adventurous off-roading, there is the flexible five-seater in Country Casuals and mucky wellies modeThese are big and bold vehicles. Yet interestingly both versions look more lithe and slippery when in motion.But does Cullinan live up to the billing of being ‘the Rolls-Royce of SUVs’?The moment I climbed into the vast cabin – with I admit a degree of trepidation – I felt strangely empowered. I was sitting very high, in a commanding position, looking down the bonnet at the Spirit of Ecstasy ‘Flying Lady’ mascot, and cocooned in a luxurious sanctuary of calm.Firing up the engine, I slotted the automatic gear stick into ‘D’ for drive and I was off. Acceleration from the mighty 6.75litre twin turbo V12 engine is awesome, but balanced.          For more exclusive occasions Rolls-Royce has created a more ‘regal’ fixed four-seater featuring specially styled rear side windows from which chauffeured passenger can see outIt develops a powerful 571PS horse-power (563bhp) - equivalent to a detachment of US Seventh Cavalry or raiding party of braves.Steering and handling is sharper and more precise than the more stately flagship Phantom limousine.

But it is very engaging and will deliver some satisfying roar from the acceleration when driven boldly. I was, after all, making a statement.          The car\u0027s steering and handling is sharper and more precise than the famous Rolls-Royce Phantom limousine. It’s nimble and has a surprisingly tight turning circle - and it seems to be particularly good when fighting twisting country roadsNor do you have to expend too much effort if you want to go off-road.A simple push on one button – which the super-luxury car firm dubs the ‘Everywhere’ off-road terrain button - will suffice to tighten up its sinews and brace its vast 6.75-litre twin turbo V12 engine ready for some off-piste rock’n’rollsing, whether on grass and gravel or snow and mud.The really jaw-dropping thing about the new Rolls-Royce Cullinan is its ability to climb steep mountain tracks with the agility of of a goat.Perched precariously on a near vertiginous narrow mountain track more than 6,400ft above sea-level, you frankly do not expect to be driving a marque more commonly associated with luxury limousines.          The SUV is quiet too thanks to extensive soundproofing - something that is sure to popular with families. However, petrol-heads need not worry as it is very engaging and will deliver a satisfying roar from the acceleration when driven boldlyBut here I was tearing up Snow King Mountain overlooking well-healed Jackson Hole in Wyoming as effortlessly as if I were motoring up the driveway of a stately home.It was faintly surreal – but it was true. With the stately Spirit of Ecstasy ‘Flying Lady’ to guide me I was biting hard into gravel and mud at an unfeasibly steep angle to propel me up the mountainside, and whizzing around the tightest of tree and rock-bordered hairpin bends forming part of a ski-slope in what is known as the ‘Forever West’ cowboy state.This was aided immensely by the Cullinan’s clever ‘four-wheel steering’ which allows the rear wheels to turn within limits independently of those in front.Getting down the mountain was just as easy with the hill descent control giving automatic breaking at whatever speed I set, typically within 3mph to around 7mph on a good run.The balance, poise and power was astonishing. This is a Rolls-Royce, for heaven’s sake - limbing up and down mountains off-road.That said, not even Rolls-Royce will suggest that in off-road capability it is anywhere near that of Land Rover or Range Rover whose independent wheel articulation allows it to tackle much more extreme situations like crawling over rocks. It is luxurious SUV whose capability is likely to surprise and delight, however. And a minor marvel for all that. Where will it all end?          Nor do you have to expend too much effort if you want to go off-road as you just have to push on one button – which the super-luxury car firm dubs the ‘Everywhere’ off-road terrain button - to brace its vast 6.75-litre twin turbo V12 engine ready for some off-roadingThe Cullinan has been created to be as fit for a Queen as an active family, it was inspired by Lawrence of Arabia’s Rolls-Royce adventures in the desert.And Rolls-Royce really is out to conquer the world with what it has called ‘an all-terrain high bodied car’, and nothing so vulgar as a ‘Chelsea Tractor’. Mayfair perhaps, at a push.Its blend of 21st century hi-tech and hand-craftsmanship is designed to ensure it lives up to the boast of being ‘effortless everywhere’ whether driven on or off road.It’s so polite it’ll even do a little curtsey – dropping the door level through its suspension- to make it easier for you and your passengers to get in and out.

The balance, poise and power was astonishing considering it is still a Rolls-RoyceMost well-heeled customers are also expected to pay at least £500,000 - double the £250,000 base price - by the time they have added their own sumptuous bespoke touches and ‘must have’ extras, such as the pop-out ‘viewing suite’ of two seats and a table which emerges like a Bond gadget from beneath the rear boot to offer the ‘best seat in the house’ for watching equestrian events, school sports days or falconry.Not forgetting the champagne fridge with matching flutes, whisky decanter and crystal tumblers - if you\u0027re being chauffeured in the rear.Built at the firm’s boutique factory at Goodwood in Sussex, which now employs 1,800 male and female craftsmen, Cullinan is also the first Rolls-Royce to feature a rear tail-gate.                             Most well-heeled customers are also expected to pay at least £500,000 - double the £250,000 base price                        Bosses at BMW-owned Rolls-Royce say its new £250,000 4X4 is ‘the ultimate rough diamond’ - taking its name from the legendary 3,106 carat Cullinan diamond, unearthed in 1905 in South Africa as the largest and most flawless gem ever found, elements of which are in the Crown Jewels.Launched to capitalise on the booming market for luxury off-roaders and ‘tested to destruction’ during rigorous trials around the world.The prestigious British car-maker says that after much agonising it made the decision to build a 4X4 following demand from customers globally for ‘the Rolls-Royce of SUVs’.Which is why Rolls-Royce has chosen to hold its global driving launch in the challenging terrain of the American Wild West, which has featured in countless Hollywood, near the exclusive resort of Jackson Hole, Wyoming.It’s a second home to the world’s rich, famous, and powerful – from world-leaders and business titans to music megastars and Hollywood ‘royalty’. Its well-heeled residents and visitors make Teton County, in which it is located, the wealthiest corner per capita of the United States, It also hosts the annual gathering of Central Bankers at the Economic Policy Symposium.          The Cullinan has been created to be as fit for a Queen as an active family, it was inspired by Lawrence of Arabia’s Rolls-Royce adventures in the desertYou can almost imagine yourself part of that invisible ‘club’ of movers and shakers.Yet the Cullinan is also designed to be as user-friendly and ‘without compromise’ for families on the school run as for royalty and Heads of State at home or abroad, with a ‘magic carpet ride’ promised on and off the road.Embracing the Spirit of Monarchy as much as the Spirit of Ecstasy, Rolls-Royce chiefs privately hope the ‘regal’ Cullinan will tempt Her Majesty out of her much loved Land Rovers and Range Rovers, as well as her state Bentley, and into the stately Cullinan.Rolls-Royce also points out that its vehicles – a byword for luxury - are no strangers to rough terrain, and that its highly-engineered cars have been used off-road throughout the firm’s 114 year history by the British army, Indian maharajahs as well as in desert fighting campaigns by Lawrence of Arabia who enthused that ‘A Rolls in the desert is above rubies.’Even Russian revolutionary communist Vladimir Ilych Lenin, who fought to bring down world capitalism, couldn’t help but be seduced by one of its most potent symbols – enjoying among his collection a specially adapted half-track Silver Ghost with skis to cope with Siberian winters.          Its blend of 21st century hi-tech and hand-craftsmanship is designed to ensure it lives up to the boast of being ‘effortless everywhere’ whether driven on or off roadCullinan is making history as Rolls-Royce’s first ever purpose-built off-roader since aristocratic adventurer Charles Rolls and engineer Henry Royce met and joined forces at Manchester’s Midland Hotel in May 1904 to create the world’s finest motor cars. They were designed to attract those Royals and wealthy aristocrats with an adventurous side, who liked to combine luxury with a stout vehicle that was also ‘swift and dependable.’Cullinan uses the same flexible aluminium space-frame platform as the latest £350,000 eighth-generation Phantom limousine, it aims to eclipse rival off-roaders such as Bentley’s Bentayga and Range Rover.The Cullinan also has an eight speed automatic gearbox.  It has four ‘coach’ doors – where the rear two open outwards from hinges at the back – plus Rolls-Royce’s first ever tail-gate at the rear.Riding on vast 22 inch wheels, there are two main styles.          The stunning Cullinan uses the same flexible aluminium space-frame platform as the latest £350,000 eighth-generation Phantom limousine, and it aims to eclipse rival off-roaders such as Bentley’s Bentayga and Range RoverFor adventurous families enjoying an off-road trek or a school-run journey, the flexible Cullinan in a choice of bold colours such as ‘Magma Red’ has five ‘lounge’ seats including the firm’s first ever three rear flexible seats which, when folded down, more than treble the 600 litres of boot space to up to 1930 litres.But for VIPs, captains of industry and even monarchs on the move, Rolls-Royce has created the more stately and sober fixed four seater in a shade such as ‘Tungsten Grey’ .Two inidual ‘pavilion’ seats are designed for privileged rear passengers who sit higher for ‘grandstand’ views from private jet-like side windows, allowing them to wave to the crowd if the mood takes, or sit back and enjoy their privacy when required. The two executive airline-style rear seats can be configured for ultimate comfort and are separated by a fixed centre console incorporating a drinks cabinet, Rolls-Royce whisky glasses and decanter, champagne flutes and a cool box to chill your bottles.To make entry and exit easier, Cullinan lowers itself 40mm (one and a half inches) when the driver clicks the unlock button or touches the door handle sensor for ‘keyless entry’, rising back up when the vehicle’s ‘Start’ button is pressed.The rear seats are even angled to allow occupants to talk to one another without straining their necks.    Bosses at BMW-owned Rolls-Royce say its new £250,000 4X4 is ‘the ultimate rough diamond’ - taking its name from the legendary 3,106 carat Cullinan diamond, unearthed in 1905 in South AfricaThere are plenty of luxuriously practical touches. To protect skirts and trouser legs from getting dirty when getting in and out of the Cullinan, the front and rear coach doors wrap low under the sill to ensure all dirt remains on the outside of the door, not on the inner sill itself.A glass partition creates a sealed cabin sanctuary and eco-system - by separating passengers from the rear hatch-back boot. This helps optimise temperature and reduce noise.Deploying rear picnic table reveals touch screens for sat-nav and other functions.Also on offer are a variety of ‘recreation modules’ – specially created units with a motorised drawer - that slot into the boot and contain bespoke equipment hampers from fly-fishing, shooting, rock-climbing and snow-boarding to drone-racing and photography. The open rear hatchback will shield you from rain.          With the new and unique SUV, Rolls-Royce chiefs privately hope the ‘regal’ Cullinan will tempt Her Majesty out of her much loved Land Rovers and Range Rovers, as well as her state Bentley Despite stretching to some 17ft 6 inches in length, being six ft high, and weighing more than 2.6 tons, its powerful 6.75 litre twin-turbo V12 engine developing 563bhp – equivalent to around six Ford Fiestas – can still propel it from rest to 60mph in five seconds (0 to 62mph-100kmhr in 5.2 seconds) with top speed electronically limited to 155mph. And it still has a relatively nimble turning circle of 13.23m.It certainly delivers on its promise of the traditionally smooth Rolls-Royce ‘Magic Carpet Ride’ on and off the road thanks to its sophisticated self-levelling air suspension designed to make it ‘effortless anywhere.’But it’s a real gas-guzzler with fuel consumption a mere 18.8mpg and hefty CO2 emissions of 341gkm.It has been designed to cope with terrain as erse on the road as country lanes, city streets, motorways and major highways, and off-road from desert sands, deep snow and ice, rough track, gravel, and wet grass.          Rolls-Royce also points out that its vehicles – a byword for luxury - are no strangers to rough terrain, and that its highly-engineered cars have been used off-road throughout the firm’s 114 year history by the British army, Indian maharajahs as well as in desert fighting campaignsPre-launch, Rolls-Royce said their camouflaged Cullinan prototypes were ‘tested to destruction all over the planet’ from the desert sand dunes of Africa and the Middle East, the canyons and the mountains of North America through which I have been driving, to the frozen snow and ice of the Arctic Circle, and the rugged glens of Highlands of Scotland.To ford streams it even has a wading depth of 21.2 inches (540mm  1ft 9 inches) though this is less than the 900mm boasted by the Land Rover Discovery.Yet at the heart of this rufty-tufty luxury off-roader is a woman’s touch. For Cullinan’s chief project engineer Caroline Krismer has spent the last five years of her life with her team perfecting Cullinan, the sixth car she has been put in charge of building, but the first Rolls-Royce. The executive who studied mechanical engineering in Graz, Austria told me: ‘It’s been my passion. I love cars and I love sporty luxury cars. Now it’s here, I have to pinch myself.’The high driving position and the plethora of safety feature will appeal to women as well as men, she says, and to families: ‘It’s a car you can drive daily. It’s effortless but with off-road ability.          For VIPs, captains of industry and even monarchs on the move, Rolls-Royce has created the more stately and sober fixed four seater in a shade such as ‘Tungsten Grey’ . Two inidual ‘pavilion’ seats are designed for privileged rear passengers who sit higher for ‘grandstand’ views from ‘private jet-like side window‘You feel safe in the car when you drive on your own, on the High Street or on the school run.\u0027It’s engaging. You don’t have to have that much technical skill to drive it. It’s effortless. You can have your children in the back knowing they are safe and secure.’She said it was also ‘regal’, ‘elegant’ and perfectly suited to a monarch such as  the Queen.‘It’s a very relaxed position sitting in the back. There’s lots of leg room. ‘The vehicle also lowers itself about an inch and a half to make getting in and out easier: ‘If someone opens the door you can step pit over very high kerbs.’                             She said it was also ‘regal’, ‘elegant’ and perfectly suited to a monarch such as the Queen                        She noted: \u0027We began with a simple principle – to bring the famed Rolls-Royce ‘Magic Carpet Ride’ to all other terrains possible, while ensuring class-leading on-road behaviour in the SUV sector.’Intriguingly, and one senses frustratingly (though they would never say so publicly) for the British company whose name is a byword for near perfection, Rolls-Royce does not currently hold a Royal Warrant. That went to Bentley when the two firms – once united – were split when BMW bought Rolls-Royce Motor Cars and Volkswagen Group bought Bentley, along with its factory in Crewe.BMW then built a brand new boutique factory at Goodwood in Sussex where it hand-built and launched the seventh-generation Phantom in 2003.Once inside Cullinan, the driver is subsumed in hand-crafted luxury, including a cockpit-style dashboard with digital dials and a smaller, thicker steering wheel. The upper fascia clad in durable and water resistant ‘Box grain’ leather similar to that used in high-end Italian luggage and handbags. The entire dashboard is protected by ‘masculine’ leather pads, the top one fashioned like a wing. Leather on the back of the bespoke key matches that of interior.

The legacy of thalidomide, the last mainstream drug for the nausea suffered by millions of women in pregnancy, was not only the deformed limbs of 10,000 babies but an unwillingness to licence and provide any other medication for fear of any similarly apocalyptic side effects.When I was editor of Vogue, I worked with an 80 per cent female staff and saw countless of their babies grow into young men and women. I also witnessed how difficult it was for these prospective mothers to deal with the horror of the inappropriately titled morning sickness. They were often overcome throughout the day with nausea and vomiting.          The Duchess of Sussex is mastering the art of Royal diplomacy at an amazingly fast clip.

Some were uncertain how they felt about their pregnancy, others had suffered previous miscarriages, and others were worried about how they would manage a baby and a working life.Relentless nausea while carrying on the appearance of business as usual (especially from the cramped bench seating of a month of fashion shows) is no easy task.Let\u0027s hope Xonvea will be a life-changing aid for all prospective mothers, helping these extraordinary nine months of pregnancy be the positive experience it should be, rather than the endurance test it becomes for many.It\u0027s no supermodelBMW has just announced that its new model will talk to us.

A succession of speakers pleaded with councillors to scrap the plan. More than 60 residents squeezed into the town hall, forcing officials to lock the doors to avoid a crush.Phil Hodson, who takes his grandchildren to play in the park, asked: ‘Has a case been made that the only route to regenerate the park is by selling 40 or 50 per cent of it for housing development? The answer has to be no.’Councillor Nick Laws, who had organised a 4,000-name petition against the plans, said: ‘The battle isn’t won yet but your story has brought a sea change in the approach of this authority.’Councillors voted 24-2 to reconsider the plan.    \u0027The thin grey line\u0027 clearing out criminals           Residents stand in Greenfields Recreation Park, Shrewsbury, where a third of the park has been sold  ‘We’ve raised around £3,000 for legal advice already but I think the council will keep going until we run out of energy or run out of money.’ A new road will be laid in the park alongside a footpath currently used by 300 children going to and from a nearby primary school on weekdays. Dr Day said: ‘We are totally against what is happening.

Other critics are unhappy that only 47 per cent of the homes will be classed as affordable.A showdown beckons on October 24 after the council served an eviction notice. Luciana Duailibe, who helps maintain the garden with her daughter Talia Silva, said: ‘I’m prepared to chain myself to the trees if they come.’Lewisham Council said temporary permission had been given for people to keep using the park, adding: ‘We’re disappointed they are repaying our generosity by refusing to leave.’   Jessel Green Essex: Huge housing estate will concrete over local paradise for dog walkers             Plan for new build housing at Calderstones Park in Liverpool, Merseyside, where Redrow plan to build 154 homes.If the development goes ahead, an accredited disabled riding centre and popular model railway line will have to relocate.

This is one of the green lungs of our city.’The Calderstones and Harthill estates, linked to two of the world’s greatest shipping lines, Cunard and the Bibby Line, were bought by the city council in the early 20th Century to create a cleaner, greener environment for Liverpudlians.A spokesman for Liverpool Council declined to comment.                                                     Wandle Park, Croydon: £3.4m playground that is now plagued by yobs            Wandle Park Croydon, which has been left in a poor state An inner -city park given £3.4 million of public funding to restore it to its Victorian splendour has become a ‘no-go’ zone plagued by yobs and drug gangs. Police, community groups and the council have discussed the spiralling drugs and violence at Wandle Park in Croydon, including a recent alleged rape. But the council axed the on-site park keeper role last month, just as suspected gang activity was soaring. Funding for improvements included £2 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund, including cash to employ a full-time volunteering and learning officer at the site.But the lottery cash has now gone – and so has the job. Last week the park was littered with discarded ‘hippy crack’ canisters – small metal containers that contain ‘legal highs’ inhaled by users. Teacher Layla Jones, 35, who visits the park with her daughters Seren, three, and five-month old Zinny, has been horrified by some of the things she has seen. She said: ‘One morning there were several used condoms right by the children’s play area. I’ve seen people smoking drugs and the vandalism speaks for itself.’ Croydon Council said it planned to install a mobile CCTV unit in the area and give police access to the park at night.   What We\u0027re demanding   A statutory requirement for councils to ring-fence funding for parks at £30 per household, per year.A legal duty for all green space to be managed to a good standard.New rules banning development on, or the inappropriate use of, parkland.  A new central Government fund to provide emergency help for the parks most at risk and ensure the long-term future of Britain’s green spaces.Is your park under threat?

James Brokenshire congratulated the Mail on Sunday for the campaignIt is no wonder then that the future of our nation’s parks is an issue close to all our hearts.That’s why the Mail on Sunday is to be congratulated on your Save Our Parks campaign.The campaign’s radical proposals – including the call for a new legal power to force local councils to ring-fence money to safeguard parks – has already sparked a much-needed new debate on how we preserve these vital green lungs in our towns and cities.As Communities Secretary, I am pleased to say that this Government recognises the value of parks and green spaces to local communities and we will continue to support them to ensure future generations are able to enjoy their benefits.Our historic four-year funding settlement, announced earlier this year, is giving councils over £200billion until 2020 and the freedom to spend this on meeting local priorities.That includes the vital work of maintaining local parks.This financial settlement has empowered local authorities to act in the best interests of their local community, with councils given the resources and flexibility to manage recreational spaces in their local areas.Of course, we recognise the financial pressures facing councils and we understand they have been making, and continue to make, extremely tough choices around priorities.And I will obviously not tell inidual councils how to spend their money but I would hope and expect them to address those issues of most concern to the public.Local authorities must not use the need to manage their finances prudently as an excuse to sell off green spaces in their controlIndeed, many councils are doing the right thing.From Sheffield to Stevenage, there are examples of local authorities determined to invest in their local parks, ensuring residents can enjoy the benefits of new equipment and bigger and better open spaces.Many councils are also pioneering new ways of generating additional income.In Hackney, which has protected its parks budget, the council has embarked on an exciting scheme with a local community group and a renewable energy social enterprise to develop heat pumps in its parks. In time these will provide low carbon heating for local buildings and enable the council to reinvest money into their green spaces that previously would have gone on expensive bills.We have also set up and funded a Parks Action Group to address issues facing England’s public parks. This will bring together experts with a wealth of experience across different sectors to develop practical solutions to some of the problems facing our public parks and green spaces.And the decision to extend the Green Flag Award licence by a further five years in September 2017 means the people behind Britain’s best parks and green spaces will continue to be recognised and awarded for their tireless dedication.Our £1 million ‘pocket parks’ fund has also helped transform neglected and derelict spaces and seen the creation of over 80 new green spaces for communities to enjoy in urban areas across the country.In Redcar, this funding together with match-funding from the council has transformed what was derelict land into Red Lion Pocket Park, a tranquil spot with flower beds and seating for residents. This has enabled the local community to not only get involved in growing fruit and vegetables but also find a bit of peace and quiet.Over in Kettering, the ‘Green Patch’ Pocket Park on the edge of a local housing estate provides much needed green space for residents to get together. Incorporating a garden, polytunnel, pond, orchard and a play area for children, the Patch is also home to a variety of livestock and wildlife – including beehives – and is used as the venue for various projects for children, adults and those with disabilities.To build on this success, I am delighted to announce that we are moving forward with plans for a second round of funding for ‘pocket parks’ - a further £1million - to provide new parks in areas with limited green spaces.This will also help renovate and restore some existing parks and children’s playgrounds, ensuring access to vital green spaces for our communities.Like all of us, I rely on our fantastic parks and green spaces to relax and get away from the hustle and bustle of city life. We all want a place to get together with our friends, exercise or simply reflect on the day. Let\u0027s not lose sight of this.The Mail on Sunday’s ‘Save Our Parks’ campaign has shone a welcome light on the importance of parks and green spaces and it has helped highlight key concerns in communities across the country.This Government will remain committed to creating great places to live and work and we will do all we can to ensure communities are able to enjoy the benefits parks and green spaces bring to public life. "},{"url":null,"title":"Passengers evacuated amid reports device board ferry Liverpool","story":"    The ferry had set off from Belfast (pictured is Belfast Harbour) and was bound for Liverpool.

We are in discussion about next steps.”The auction house declined to reveal the identity of the buyer.On Saturday evening, Banksy posted a video on his Instagram page which showed a shredder being fitted to the frame of the painting.It opened with the caption: “A few years ago, I secretly built a shredder into a painting.”The clip shows a hooded figure putting the finishing touches on the device, before text appears on the screen saying: “In case it was ever put up for auction.”\u0026nbsp“The auction result will only propel this further and given the media attention this stunt has received, the lucky buyer would see a great return on the £1.02m they paid last night.Girl With Balloon, which was last year voted the UK’s best-loved work of art, first appeared on a wall in Great Eastern Street in Shoreditch, east London. The 2006 gallery version featured spray paint and acrylic on canvas, mounted on a board.The true identity of the Bristol-born artist has never been officially revealed despite wide speculation.He rose to fame with graffiti that appeared on buildings across the UK, often marked by deeply satirical undertones.Two new artworks appeared at the Barbican Centre in central London in September 2017 inspired by an upcoming Jean-Michel Basquiat exhibition.Announcing the new artworks in a series of Instagram posts, the artist said: “Major new Basquiat show opens at the Barbican – a place that is normally very keen to clean any graffiti from its walls.” The work has since been protected by perspex panes.One of Banksy’s more elaborate jokes came just over three years ago when he opened Dismaland, a “family theme park unsuitable for small children”, on the seafront at Weston-super-Mare. described it at the time as “sometimes hilarious, sometimes eye-opening and occasionally breathtakingly shocking”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20ee067dc09d652983c88b2a19074e355e6eb05c/0_1315_8479_5087/master/8479.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96a7c175c590e9abb0a37ff5e27fb5dd","title":"civilisation the way we live now photography exhibition","story":"What does the 21st century look like? What are the resonant images of a civilisation that aspires to be global? These kinds of questions were the starting point for a project that formed in the mind of William A Ewing, who had been a museum director, curator of international exhibitions and writer about photography for nearly 40 years.Every epoch and generation had sought to define itself, Ewing believed, but how would you go about defining our own dizzying times? The exhibition that represents his tentative conclusions will open at the National Museum in Seoul, South Korea, later this year. It will then tour the globe – Beijing, Melbourne and Montreal are its first stops – for what Ewing hopes will be a decade-long journey. The exhibition consists of the work of 140 of the world’s most celebrated photographers – from Edward Burtynsky to Cindy Sherman – each of whom is represented by the images that best seemed to answer the questions above.Ewing calls his ambitious project Civilisation in the knowledge of all the ironies and caveats that word excites. In his introduction to the book of the exhibition, he notes that even the International Society for the Comparative Study of Civilisations has, in many years of meetings and research, never actually come to an agreement on what “civilisation” means. He takes greater comfort in Kenneth Clark’s formulation for his original BBC series of the same name: “What is civilisation? I do not know. But I think I can recognise it when I see it… If I had to say what is telling the truth about a society, a speech by a minister of housing or the actual buildings put up in his time, I should believe the buildings.”Ewing’s photographers give us some of those buildings the competing hubris of the city states in the Gulf with their soaring towers the horizontal blandness of the hangars that service the internet economy the teeming aerial views of shanty towns and the neat geometries of out-of-scale transport hubs and city planning. The civilisation that emerges from these depictions is resolutely urban, constantly on the move and rarely depicted at a human scale.One of the precedents that Ewing had in mind when he embarked on his project was Edward Steichen’s famous 1950s exhibition The Family of Man, which presented photography as the world’s first “universal language” and toured the globe promoting a message of shared humanity. “There is only one man in the world and his name is All Men. There is only one woman in the world and her name is All Women. There is only one child in the world and the child’s name is All Children,” the exhibition argued, hopefully. Including the work of 500 photographers from 68 countries, the show was seen by 9 million people. Some critics applauded its “imagine all the people” sentiment others saw it as a cold war propaganda vehicle for US sentimentalism.Ewing’s previous large-scale project was an examination of the work of Steichen, who shaped the photography collection at New York’s Museum of Modern Art. He does not view his own exhibition as having the polemical intent of the 1950s show. “I don’t imagine it will make a difference on a large scale, in the way that The Family of Man aimed to do,” he told me from his home in Switzerland. “But then I do know from my own life and that of others that just seeing a picture in a book can change the way you think about things, if the picture is powerful enough.”Ewing is an anthropologist at heart. He sees photography as a cultural object, one that springs from a shared necessity of looking. “We have a cult of iniduality and photographers in particular rarely like to think of themselves as part of a wider movement or a group. A photographer who is working taking pictures of prisons or schools hates to hear that someone else is also taking pictures of prisons or schools… ” Ewing is more interested in what that cumulative interest might reveal about us.The photographs he has chosen expose many of these shared obsessions, the ways that our lenses choose to dwell on what seems most particular or troubling about our globalising world. I point out to him that in contrast to The Family of Man, where many of the pictures concentrated on the struggles of the inidual as part of a family and a community, the pictures here tend to dwell on people either as an uniniduated mass – kneeling at daily prayer in a vast mosque, crushed together on the daily commute or packed like slaves on a refugee boat – or “alone together” logged on to technology, isolated in their living rooms. Almost none of the pictures depict couples.Ewing suggests we are unnerved and preoccupied by population growth – 7.6 billion people and counting – and that our civilisation is subconsciously engaged with mitigating its effects. “It is one of the reasons we focus so much on celebrity,” he says. “We have a need to concentrate on the inidual.” Looking at the photographs, it seems emblematic of our times how people in cities are drawn to events such as marathons, where the desire to be part of a group is in tension with our need to be thought of in the singular.I wonder, having spent some years poring over these pictures, cajoling and persuading photographers to include certain things, what Ewing came to see as their prevailing mood. To me, I suggest, the theme seems to emerge that we are creating a world in which we are anxious about being swept up in forces beyond our control. He suggests a couple of alternatives.“If there is a word I would use to describe the mood it is probably ‘desperate’,” he says. “Things like Trump and Brexit seem to be symptoms of that. But then also a great deal of comedy. The usual human comedy. Like the picture Wild River, Florida in which people float along a channel which is anything but wild.” The work, the pictures and some of the ironies they depict tend to be an antidote to any overarching gloom. “One photographer said to me, ‘I get up every morning an optimist and go to bed a pessimist,’” Ewing says. “I feel the opposite.” He cites the work of Yuval Noah Harari as a touchstone for his approach, the importance of synthesising and making broad-brush sense of where we are, however complex the challenge. And also the work of the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University, which tries to measure the relative importance of the existential threats that face us.The photographs insistently depict both the mechanisms and the infrastructure of a globalised world, one increasingly directed by technology. “It’s clear that now has its own momentum,” Ewing suggests. He points to the fact that a virtual city – nearly 2 million people – is travelling in the air at any one time, and to the idea of the Olympics, “which filters to every village in the world”.He adds: “The trend cannot be stopped. And the global systems that support our civilisation are literally incredible.” Some of the pictures dwell on the more prosaic aspects of that. A fibre-optic cable emerging in New Jersey having carried all the world’s knowledge under land and sea some – a factory producing artificial hands – are more startling. The real truth of our civilisation, Ewing suggests, “is that we are surrounded by amazing objects and tools that inidually we would not have the first idea how to make. I think part of what I was trying to do is to remind people of exactly what they are indebted to.”• Civilisation: The Way We Live Now by William A Ewing and Holly Roussell is published on 16 October (Thames and Hudson, £39.95).

The right soundtrack has the power to transform even a burger and chips into a fine-dining experience, at least according to research by Cornell University. Why? Because the music makes us eat more mindfully and even perceive our food more favourably.“Dinner parties are essentially about communication and the mingling of several different conversations, so you want background music that’s sophisticated enough to spark conversation, then melt away rather than competing with your chat,” says composer Oliver Davis, whose 2018 album Liberty recently topped the iTunes classical charts. So what music works best with different dishes? We spoke to a range of experts – from restaurateurs to party planners and composers to find out.Soundtrack for starters“I put as much thought and care into the music I play at a dinner party as I do into my cooking,” says restaurateur Asma Khan of the Darjeeling Express in Soho, London.Her favourite starter is a mutton shikampuri kebab, a recipe from the Royal Kitchens of Hyderabad. “It has a uniquely layered shah-jeera flavour,” she says. “You think it’s mild at first, then the cardamom and cumin spice blend hits you. Most people don’t recognise all the flavours, but this starter never fails to impress.”While guests dig in, Khan plays the classical Indian Sufi song Maula-e-Kull, sung by Abdida Parveen. “It has a very deep rhythm,” she says. “You don’t need to understand the words to feel the emotion in the voice of the singer: it starts off with the love between two people, then becomes deeply complex. Both the song and the starter have this incredible hidden layering, and together they set a rich, serene tone for your evening.”Your musical main“The right music helps the conversation flow, which is particularly important when your guests are meeting for the first time,” says Alice Matthews, founder of MotherHustler supper clubs.“I love the classical guitar interpretation of Johann Sebastian Bach’s Air on a G String, by Richard Mollenbeck,” she says. Like the vegetarian tagine she serves her guests, the music is about different interpretations of a classic, melodiously coming together to create something new. “I’ve discovered guests relax and enjoy themselves more when eating familiar food and listening to familiar music, but in a heightened, luxurious atmosphere,” she says.Sweet symphony“I love to cook with seasonal, locally sourced ingredients, and my taste in music reflects that too,” says Henrietta Inman, author of The Natural Baker: A new way to bake using the best natural ingredients.“For a dinner party I’ll make my plum, blackberry and blueberry crumble, served with a rosemary and lemon syrup. The topping is crunchy and decadent, made with wholegrain spelt, oats and almonds.” And the perfect accompaniment? The Lark Ascending by Vaughan Williams, says Inman.“It’s a beautifully tranquil piece by an English composer and it brings to mind a dusky evening eating outdoors, with birds singing in the hedgerows and trees hanging heavy with ripe fruit,” she says.The tune for cheese“The cheese course comes at a perfect moment to steer conversation into another direction,” says La Fromagerie’s Patricia Michelson, author of Cheese.She recommends presenting a five-strong board with Sinodun Hill, a nutty goat’s cheese the creamy, sweet and aromatic Beaufort Chalet D’Alpage Lincolnshire Poacher Double Barrel, a hard cheese with a distinctive savoury acidity from the chalky soil where the cattle graze a decadent Brie aux Truffes and Regalis, a ewe’s milk blue that combines sharp mineral qualities with a rich, floral taste.On the playlist is a classical composition with a jazz vibe, such as the Jacques Loussier Trio playing Bach. “It’s reflective and stimulating but soft and flowing, and these are words I often use when describing cheese too,” says Michelson.The finale Just as a digestif serves to calm the mood at the end of the meal, music plays a similar role. “One of the wonderful things about music is it fills in any awkward silence at the end of your dinner party, when everyone’s said an awful lot,” says Davis.“I love an Amaretto, but I wouldn’t be as didactic as to suggest that a sweet liqueur goes with sweet music,” he says. “Go for something cosy that welcomes guests into your own personal comfort zone.”For that, try downloading Rêverie Nocturne by Giulio Regondi or Liberty by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.Waitrose \u0026amp Partners know that food and music are the perfect pairing.

But Barneys, Books and Bust-ups: 50 Years of the Booker prize, to be screened on BBC Four on 15 October, the night before the announcement of this year’s winner, could not be boring even if it tried. There are no vengeful former muses on this score, even Salman Rushdie gets off scot-free. But those who live in fear of lingering shots of honeyed bookshelves and the scratchy sound of a fountain pen moving across a sheet of paper can relax. Fifty years is a long time when it comes to gossip, feuds, giant egos, rank stupidity and mild lunacy, all of which the Booker prize used to deliver on a pretty regular basis. The film’s director, Jon Morrice, could have used no new material whatsoever, and he would still have had more footage than he knew what to do with.Every moment bulges with incident every anecdote involves cattiness, hubris or the plangent lessons offered by posterity (occasionally, all three). Hard to say what I enjoyed most. Was it the sight of a sweaty Anthony Burgess, shortlisted for Earthly Powers in 1980, describing the Booker as “a rather small, parochial prize suitable for rather small, parochial writers”? (Burgess, sulking in a hotel while everyone else attended the ceremony, by this point knew very well that William Golding had bagged it for Rites of Passage.) Or was it when John Banville, the winner in 2005 for The Sea, smoothly announced on his big night that it was at least “nice to see a work of art winning the prize”? At the end of the hour, the viewer can only conclude that a kind of madness is apt to descend on those who get involved with the Booker, be they writers, publishers, judges or critics.In certain quarters, of course, Powers would be an unpopular choice not only for commercial reasons. “American wins Booker prize for the third year running” isn’t, most insiders feel, a headline its director and trustees would want to see in the award’s 50th year. Publishers’ and authors’ nerves aside, in 2018, a more than usually large cloud of anxiety looms over the Booker and all who sail in her. The Man Group, the prize’s sponsor since 2002, is signed up only until 2020, and the word is that Luke Ellis, its CEO, is somewhat less keen on the company’s £1.6m annual commitment to both it and the International Man Booker prize than his predecessor. Given the well-publicised withdrawal of other sponsors from book prizes in recent years, no one is taking anything for granted. Meanwhile, publishers and booksellers alike agree that this year’s longlist was, for whatever reason, distinctly weird, with its inclusion of both a comic book (Sabrina by Nick Drnaso) and a crime novel (Snap by Belinda Bauer). “Next year, they’re going to get 30 crime novels,” says one confused publisher. “One of the criteria for entry is that you must publish two literary novels a year, and if a crime novel is now a literary novel, more imprints are going to believe they’ve eligible books on their lists.”This, in turn, could bring the prize’s organisers yet more woe. Anecdotally, it’s getting ever harder to find willing Booker judges, largely because the task is so onerous (this year, the judges read 171 novels). At least one high-profile writer who was approached to chair the judges in its birthday year said no. There are even niggling anxieties about the ceremony itself, a grand dinner that is held in the Guildhall, in the City of London, and attended by the Duchess of Cornwall. Last year, most of the invited journalists seemed to have been seated together, far away from any authors, publishers or random celebrities, a move that seemed to many a kind of insult given that publicity, good or bad, continues to be the Booker’s most vigorous engine.Above all, the majority of publishers and many writers and agents remain furious at the trustees’ decision, five years ago, to throw open the prize to any book written in English that is published in Britain – which was a roundabout way of saying that US writers would henceforth be allowed to enter (previously, only novels by Commonwealth and Irish writers were eligible). At an event marking the 50th birthday at the Southbank Centre last July, Peter Carey, who has won the Booker twice, called it an exercise in corporate branding that made no sense to literature American prizes, he noted, are not open to writers from Australia or Britain. Julian Barnes, another former winner, described the decision as “daft”, pointing out that three of the six shortlisted writers in 2017 were American. Had one of these elbowed out, say, a fine Zimbabwean novel?With only one exception, everyone I speak to feels the same: that something has been lost. “A big, big mistake,” says Carmen Callil, co-founder of Virago books and former managing director of Chatto \u0026amp Windus. “Its USP has gone,” says a leading agent (this despite the fact that he represents some US authors). “This whole fucking thing about us having such a cultural cringe towards America,” says one publisher. In his view, it is now all but impossible for certain kinds of novel to succeed at the Booker (in four years of being eligible, two Americans have won it, while nine out of a possible 24 authors, have been shortlisted). “The judges seem to favour big, noble, American failures over smaller, quieter, non-American masterpieces.” Another publisher agrees: “It’s hard to imagine, say, an Alan Hollinghurst winning in this landscape.”The irony is that the Booker, according to some of these same people, is now losing ground in the US. “American publishers loved the fact that it brought them writers from other territories,” says one. “They don’t need to be told about Anne Tyler or Paul Auster. They know about them already.” Just to add to the angst, some American agents now reportedly make entry to the Booker prize a condition of the sale of the work of a US author to a British publisher. Given that publishers are allowed only two entries for each imprint (plus the novels of previously shortlisted authors), this would, if true, contribute to a further pushing out of British and Commonwealth writers.Last February, Mark Richards, the publisher at John Murray, and Alex Bowler, then at Granta and now at Faber \u0026amp Faber, drew up a letter asking the Booker trustees to reconsider their decision it was signed by 30 publishers, and quietly supported by at least 10 more. The letter warned of a “homogenised literary future” permanently dominated by American writers. Some weeks later, the trustees and the prize’s literary director, Gaby Wood, invited its signatories to a meeting. “It was a bit fractious,” says one publisher who attended. Another admits: “It was, perhaps, a little over-emotional. People talked of authors having been betrayed.” Alexandra Pringle, who runs Bloomsbury, which published George Saunders, the American who won the 2017 prize, spoke passionately of how “a small, Cumbrian writer” would struggle for notice in this new realm. What was the attitude of Wood and the other trustees who attended to this? They were “defensive”. Why were the publishers talking of the prize’s “duty” to authors? It has no duty. Its role is only to reward the best book. If they didn’t like it, they were more than welcome to set up their own prize.Some time after this, a second meeting was held between a smaller number of publishers, Wood and Helena Kennedy, the chair of the trustees. This was more conciliatory, though nothing really changed. “I can’t think of a single publisher who thinks it’s a good idea,” says one trade journalist. “But they’re resigned to it now.” Others are more optimistic: “My hope is that 2020, when Man’s sponsorship comes up for renewal, will provide the obvious moment for a rule change. I get the feeling that some trustees, if not all, are persuadable.” On the committee that advises the board of trustees about such matters – it comprises publishers, agents and critics, as well as, currently, James Daunt, the managing director of Waterstones, and Jonty Claypole, head of arts at the BBC – opinions are mixed. “I don’t think the decision should be reversed,” says one member. “I think that ship has sailed. But I know there are others who disagree.”Where did the decision to include US writers originate? Publishers like to blame the Man Group, and what they regard as its greedy lust for global publicity. But according to one Booker insider, this is not the case. For two years, the trustees looked at the possibility of setting up a new, separate prize in the US the consultants McKinsey were commissioned to explore this. When it became clear that it wouldn’t be feasible, Peter Mayer, the American former publisher of Penguin Books, and Ed Victor, the London-based American literary agent, suggested the change (both men have since died, as has Ion Trewin, then the literary director of the prize). Ask the Man Group, an investment management company, what it gets out of sponsoring the prize, and the talk is mostly of corporate social responsibility (the Booker prize foundation works in schools and libraries and supports a number of literacy programmes) and the “unique social networking opportunities” it provides for clients (among other things, it takes 200 seats at the award ceremony).However, a spokesperson also tells me that the company regards it as a “brand that we own because we have our name on it”. Is the name Man Booker better known – more written and talked about – in the US since American writers became eligible? It is difficult to say. However, it is worth noting that the percentage rise in sales of books in the US for winners from outside the country dwarfs that of American winners (while Paul Beatty, the American who won in 2016 for The Sellout, only doubled his US sales, Eleanor Catton, the New Zealander whose novel The Luminaries won in 2013, multiplied hers tenfold).To some, of course, all this is just a squall in an inkwell. As Professor John Carey puts it in the BBC’s film, Booker titles seem to many to conform ever more strongly to the bien-pensant tastes of a small, urban coterie, a world so far removed from most bookshelves as to be almost absurd (one thinks of Edward St Aubyn’s 2014 novel Lost for Words, a satire about a prize very like the Booker, in which there appears a judge who is obsessed only with relevance and “consensus-building” and a novelist who writes “like a man walking backwards along a path, erasing his footsteps with a broom”). But while there may be truth in this, if you are of a certain age, and love novels, and didn’t grow up in a family with, say, a subscription to the Times Literary Supplement, it’s impossible not to care about its future. I remember so clearly the first time I saw the winner announced on the BBC: it was Kingsley Amis in 1986, for The Old Devils, who said, eyes popping, that he would spend the prize money on “booze, of course, and curtains”, words I’ve never forgotten. As a teenager, the Booker introduced me to Penelope Lively and Timothy Mo. As a student, it brought me to AS Byatt and Banville. Later on, I read Ahdaf Soueif’s The Map of Love and Mick Jackson’s The Underground Man – beloved books, both – for no other reason at all than because they were on the shortlist.I would love it to seem glamorous and vital again: as widely and passionately talked about as it was in the 80s and 90s. But maybe we’ve simply come, down the years, to expect too much of it. “It’s just one literary prize,” a member of the advisory committee tells me. “Yet expectations of it are totally unrealistic.” People think that it has changed, he says, when really it’s only the world in which it operates that has: “No prize could have the same place as it once did in a culture that is so noisy. Maybe that’s the real reason quieter, more domestic books are losing out they make less impact anyway.”Or perhaps it has just become too slick, too professional, too boringly 21st century. Last year, hunkered in a corner with my fellow hacks, I looked out across the Guildhall at the massed ranks of sober-seeming guests (no wonder there are fewer punch-ups these days), so many of whose heads were bowed prayerfully over their mobile phones, and thought of Selina Scott’s famous faux pas when she stuck her microphone in the face of Fay Weldon, the chair of the judges in 1983, and asked if she really had read all the books. (This after she had already failed to recognise another judge, Angela Carter.) If I had seen Morrice’s film, I might also have pictured the distinguished biographer Hermione Lee phoning Keri Hulme, the pipe-smoking New Zealander who won for The Bone People in 1985, live from her table at the award dinner to ask how she was feeling (technology being what it was then, we could hear, but not see, the startled author shout the words: “Bloody hell!”). These things, and so many others, would never happen now – and perhaps we’re all the poorer for it.The 2018 Man Booker prize for fiction will be announced on 16 October"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ec4af6235afd671a06c4f08804c15e58fed74ce/0_278_5319_3193/master/5319.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45eb539ef0b38ff3e68f957f8cb5ce41","title":"amazon 15 minimum wage raise affects","story":"Amazon has been the primary reason why companies – large and small – have gone out of business. But it has also helped a new group become entrepreneurs This week, Amazon announced that it was raising its minimum wage for all workers to $15 an hour. The move will affect more than 250,000 of their employees, as well as more than 100,000 seasonal workers.“We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead,” said Jeff Bezos, the company’s founder and CEO. “We’re excited about this change and encourage our competitors and other large employers to join us.” (Bezos this week topped the richest people in the world according to Forbes magazine, beating out Bill Gates spot by a staggering $63bn).Raising its own minimum wage isn’t the only thing the company is doing on the issue. Bezos also committed that Amazon would be advocating for a raise in the federal minimum wage from its current $7.25 an hour, because doing so would “have a profound impact on the lives of tens of millions of people and families across this country”.With this highly publicized move the company is not only attempting to soften its image among critics that have accused it of paying its workers too little and working them too hard, but it’s also taking a shot across the bow at its competitors. So should merchants be worried? Is this yet another example of how Amazon is “bad” for small businesses?Sure, Amazon has been the primary reason why many businesses – large and small – have gone out of business. Visit your mall or take a walk down Seventh Avenue in New York City and you’ll see retail locations that were once the site of clothing, books, gifts and office supplies stores now either vacant, occupied by “experience” retailers like restaurants, nail salons and smoothie shops or rented out by non-retail businesses and government organizations. Amazon has helped to put giant retailers like Borders, Circuit City and Linens ‘n Things out of business and has driven out many smaller mom and pop shops that just couldn’t compete with its pricing and convenience.A whole new group of people have become entrepreneurs. These are full-time business owners, part-time hobbyists and even corporate employees with side-gigs that are making money as Amazon merchants. In fact, according to a Small Business Impact Report released by the company earlier this year, there are millions of small merchants selling their wares on Amazon (one million of those in the US), accounting for more than half of the products sold on the site. Just this past month the company launched a new site – Amazon Storefronts – that is devoted entirely to highlighting the products and stories of its merchants. (Disclosure: I am not being compensated by Amazon to write this piece, but my company has done work for Amazon in the past.)Amazon offers fulfillment, billing, marketing and customer service tools that help its small merchants reach customers that were previously unreachable. Sure, their requirements for customer service, product quality and transparency can sometimes be draconian, and Amazon certainly takes a healthy cut of the profits. But for those that play by their rules, the opportunities can be significant. Amazon has given rise to countless startups and small companies looking to take advantage of its investment in warehouse logistics and delivery. And not all businesses have been shuttered by the online giant. Independent bookstores are thriving, as are smaller retailers that have figured out how to provide an extra level of service that customers will never be able to get online.Now, Amazon is raising its minimum wage, which is another challenge to small firms who may not be able to afford to pay $15 an hour. For starters, let’s be grateful that the private sector is taking the lead on this issue and not the government. Let’s also thank Amazon, for pushing us to do better when it comes to compensating our employees. As I’ve written before, you get what you pay for. With Amazon’s decision to up its wages, many small companies are going to be forced to respond.So how will your firm meet this challenge? Maybe you’ll pay more and absorb the costs – or raise prices. Perhaps you’ll find other ways to compensate your people through better time off, additional fringes and more flexibility. Or, how about being better at selling the benefits of working for a small firm where an employee can really contribute, interface with owners and not be tied down by corporate rules, policies and gobbledegook? It’s also possible that a $15 an hour wage will be what finally makes you invest in better technology to make your business more efficient and help keep your payroll under control.There are ways for a small business to respond to Amazon’s wage increase – and most will do so successfully because it’s the right thing to do to pay people a fair wage. Those firms – as well as their employees – will be better off in the long run for it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6e2088fc24c661dea90b6e428b96e3a62f3f78b/0_147_4715_2830/master/4715.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=218cab61ba136c7cc21dcf45fc6f4831","title":"fish dwindle traditionally rich waters tanzania kivukoni dar es salaam in pictures","story":"In Kivukoni fish market, the port city of Dar es Salaam boasts a thriving economic enterprise.

In a recent survey carried out by the eco-cleaning company, Method, nearly a quarter of 16- to 24-year-olds said they would only be pictured in an item one to three times on social media before discarding it.But while their approval is everything, their censure is particularly powerful. Influencers are also, by definition, cool. From Vetements to Gucci to tiny ethical brands like London-based Riley Studio, the cool brands are all talking sustainability. As the strategy director of brand consultancy Siegel+Gale recently put it: “Knowing how and where something is made gives it social currency.” Meanwhile, the fast fashion brands are losing their allure. At the Copenhagen Fashion Summit, supposedly the industry’s big drive towards sustainability, Dooley plays cat and mouse with evasive mainstream brands who come across as unappealing.The influencers seem shaken and stirred by Dooley’s findings. They agree that the true cost of this type of consumption is too high. The stage seems set for a dramatic change. But we shouldn’t be too Pollyanna-ish. Amazon has just announced a new fashion TV show, fronted by Project Runway stars Heidi Klum and Tim Gunn, that will be the first “shoppable experience” where fashion can be bought with a tap of the screen. Forbes has described the show as the “harbinger of a new retail world”. At a point when we’re already producing over 100bn new garments a year and brands are shovelling excess production into incinerators, that is concerning. By 2050 the industry will be responsible for quarter of all carbon emissions unless we apply the brakes.To imagine that the generations subjected to this catastrophic abundance of fashion could be the ones to apply the brakes seems like fantasy. But we need them. To begin, Instagram influencers need to do more than post the odd positive message about vintage or recycled fibre. The influencers must become activists and take on the brands and habits plundering the planet.Lucy Siegle is an environmental writer and broadcaster"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a3cbf9aca6d94f88ec655a6a18bffe805ff4f10/427_0_1430_858/master/1430.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf09fc0bb18857f3993c09eefe24f117","title":"a star is born review bradley cooper lady gaga","story":"Each generation has its own version of A Star Is Born, a timeless tale (prefigured by George Cukor’s What Price Hollywood?) of intersecting career trajectories. In the 1930s, William Wellman directed Janet Gaynor as the young actress on the way up who falls for alcoholic fading idol Fredric March. Judy Garland and James Mason reprised the roles in Cukor’s 1954 classic, setting a musical template mirrored in subsequent versions. Barbra Streisand famously wanted Elvis to star opposite her in Frank Pierson’s 70s remake, and it still breaks my heart that Presley never got to play what would surely have been his defining screen role (Kris Kristofferson landed the part of a rock star in decline.)Now, taking the tale to a 21st-century audience, we have Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper: the former in her first big-screen starring role, the latter making his startlingly assured directorial debut (he also produced, co-wrote the script and contributed to song composition). Capturing the slow grind of touring and the speedy ups and downs of pop stardom can be a notoriously tricky business. But from its uncannily realistic performance footage to pinpoint observations about modern in-ear monitors (“it’s just in my head I need to be here”), this new incarnation of an old story paints a painfully precise portrait of life seen from the other side of the stage.Cooper plays Jackson Maine, a grizzled, axe-wielding country-rocker who stumbles out of a gig and into a late-night drag bar in search of booze (“They got alcohol? Then it’s my kinda place”). Here he sees Ally (Lady Gaga, brilliant) singing La Vie en Rose. It’s a show-stopping turn, striking a chord with the tinnitus-tormented Maine, who thinks he’s found an artist with “something to say and a way to say it”. But Ally, who hides her own songwriting light under a bushel, thinks the music industry is full of men who say: “You sound great, but you don’t look so great.” So Maine, in an act of both sacrifice and salvation, foists Ally on stage in front of his adoring crowd, with spectacular results.For one enchanted moment, their chemistry is perfect, with each firing the other’s dreams (“It’s been a long time since he played like that,” says Jackson’s long-suffering brother, Bobby). But these star paths are crossed rather than entwined. He’s dependent on a self-destructive cocktail of steroid injections, booze and boot-crushed pills. As for her, fame brings its own baggage, as pop-savvy manager Rez (Rafi Gavron) moulds her image with new dancers and hairdos and publicity photos that “don’t even look like me”.Beyond the jokes about her unmarketable nose, there’s more than a touch of Streisand’s Funny Girl persona in Lady Gaga’s thrillingly spiky performance. We know from her pop pedigree that she can cut it as an onstage sensation, but it’s her more down-at-heel scenes (taking out the trash in a soul-crushing job) that really impress. Never once did I doubt that the rock’n’roll high life (popping corks on Jack’s private plane) was a new and astonishing experience for this real-life megastar. Significantly, Ally has the cover of Carole King’s Tapestry framed on her bedroom wall and there’s a hint of the King-inspired 1996 film Grace of My Heart in her progress from songwriter to recording star, particularly in a lovely scene in which Maine suggests using a piano keyboard to unlock her natural studio voice.Yet for all his support, Maine is unsettled by Ally’s success, and the independence it brings her (“why can’t I be enough?”). A poignant shot of him watching as the increasingly Gaga-esque Ally rehearses an angular routine casts him as a wounded old bear lost in a futuristic neon world, his reddened face counterposed with the cold blue light of an alien environment. It’s as if he’s wandered out of his own movie and into hers. Elsewhere, the narrative’s infamous awards ceremony outrage is revisited in excruciating hues that will have you hiding you face in your hands.Strong supporting turns include Sam Elliott as Bobby, the brother from whom Maine apparently “stole” his voice, Andrew Dice Clay as Ally’s protective yet clumsily undermining father and Dave Chappelle as an old musician friend of Jackson’s who found a way out of all the craziness. Expect to see A Star Is Born nominated in numerous categories in the forthcoming awards season, not least for acting, direction and songwriting. Its Oscar-bait earworm tune may be entitled Shallow, but the film itself is as deep and resonant as Bradley Cooper’s drawl, and as bright as Lady Gaga’s screen future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c53516cea76eb17eb549da5933bf4c5cd137d696/0_1312_4461_2677/master/4461.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6adbf7873a441eaddacddcc2d2a9ca8b","title":"nigel slater fishcake recipes","story":"Dill and haddock and pea and prawn cakes accompanied by a herby and a chilli dipIt was a double fishcake day. A first batch that was light, fresh and spicy. A second to send us into a deep, satiated slumber. For the latter, I peeled potatoes, cooked them in boiling water and mashed them. Haddock was simmered with milk, parsley and bay leaves, its silver skin was removed and the pearly white flesh broken into fat flakes. I made a sauce from the seasoned milk, flecked with parsley and grated nutmeg. I stirred together the fish and potato and rolled it into balls, dipped them into beaten egg then rolled them in fine, fresh breadcrumbs and, lastly, fried them in deep oil. And then I washed up. Peelers and pots, dishes and mashers, plates and bowls and the dreaded pan in which I made the parsley sauce.Was it worth it? The peeling and mashing and poaching and crumbing? Heavens, yes. Crisp balls of fish and potato hot from the pan alongside an accompanying comfort blanket of green-freckled sauce.

Athletic, strong, an attacking threat and Improving all the time.Has seized the opportunity created by Dejan Lovren’s World Cup injury to claim a regular place. His reading of the game and alertness to danger have stood out.Playing like someone who relishes the mantle of most expensive defender in the world. Has been imperious since arriving at Anfield. His confidence and authority rub off on those around him too.The Scotland captaincy is another sign of his blossoming into one of the league’s finest left-backs. Perfect for Klopp with pace, energy and tenacity. Badly missed against Chelsea in the Carabao Cup.Liverpool spent heavily this summer to revitalise their midfield yet the 32-year-old’s position and form look stronger than ever. Subdued against Napoli, though. Klopp must hope an intense period has not caught up with him.The World Cup delayed his return: he has started only four games, with his time managed carefully. His distribution enhances Liverpool’s attacking threat when he has appeared.Like Milner, the Netherlands international has thrived on increased competition and is producing the best form of his Liverpool career. Has impressed in every central midfield position this season.Has started almost identically to last season, yet modest form would not have sparked so much debate 12 months ago. Developing into one of the best players in the world, has brought extra attention on the pitch too and he has been unable to wreak havoc so far.Another who started late because of the World Cup, but needed only a few games to regain his rhythm. Superb movement and awareness, although needs his fellow strikers to capitalise on his influence.Erratic. In clinical form at the start, with four goals in four games, but has not scored in the last six. Decision-making has been awry. Andy HunterDifficult to recall his last mistake. One of Pep Guardiola’s most inspired signings. His pinpoint long-range passes are revolutionising the No 1 role.Does not have a higher mark because, with his scintillating speed, he should be creating more. But it does mean attackers still struggle to beat him.Caught out for Hoffenheim’s goal in Tuesday’s Champions League win but this was from the out-of-position left-back berth. Physicality is invaluable, especially when Vincent Kompany does not play.Has not made a league start since August but showed on Tuesday he can drop into the side seamlessly and this reliability plus his leadership mean he should get the nod at Liverpool.Has upset the manager with tardiness and social media profile but continues to add an extra dimension to the team via his attacking vim. Defensively not as accomplished as Walkerbut may start if back from injury.Guardiola once stated that Fernandinho could operate in all outfield positions and the Brazilian is continuing to live up to that assessment virtually every game with his accomplished all-action style.Scored 18 league goals last season and is up to four this year. The winger also contributed a beautiful assist for Sergio Agüero’s second against Brighton last weekend, choosing the correct ball at the correct time.Showed a poacher’s instinct with the stabbed last-gasp winner at Hoffenheim and still seems to be improving at 32. An example to younger teammates.Kevin De Bruyne is hardly missed: this is the best way to sum up how impressive the Portuguese is in a central role for which Guardiola will select only the best.Back in the side and showing the rocket-like speed that leaves defenders looking like statues.

They seem good enough not to be concerned with relegation in the final analysis, but that defence is possibly an issue and Jokanovic is maybe a *touch* quixotic in his approach. Will he need to compromise a little to make things safe? Or will all those new signings just get better and better as things settle down?Arsenal fans, do you think this setup has a bit more balance? You’d want Ozil in there, preferably at No 10, but Aubameyang isn’t always at his best out wide and Welbeck did well in Thursday’s convincing win over Qarabag.While we get ready for this one, have yourself a look at Daniel Taylor’s column – this week a fascinating read about Kevin Keegan and Newcastle:Interesting stuff there! No Mesut Ozil for Arsenal, he’s got a back injury apparently, while Aaron Ramsey – whose new contract seems dead in the water of course – is on the bench. So too is Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, while Henrikh Mkhitaryan – who isn’t banned from visiting Craven Cottage – comes in along with Danny Welbeck. Will these combinations give the Gunners a bit more fizz?For Fulham, Maxime Le Marchand and Cyrus Christie replace Timothy Fosu-Mensah and Joe Bryan, otherwise it’s the same side that took a hiding at Everton. But hang on, who’s that “S Sessegnon” on the bench? It’s Steven, twin brother of Ryan, who has played in the League Cup this season. What a mightily talented family!Arsenal are on fire! They’re not, not quite, but they are the Premier League’s form horses. They’ve won eight in a row, five of them in the top flight, and although they’ve had to ride their luck along the way you can’t really argue with that. It’s a delicate balancing act for Unai Emery, instilling a fairly profound cultural change behind the scenes and trying to get results while doing so – at the moment the victories are coming so, even if you’d quibble with some of the style, Gooners probably can’t argue too much.Fulham aren’t on fire. I thought they might be, especially after watching them score four, going on 10, against Burnley in a fantastic performance a few weeks back. But that was their only victory so far and, even though they’re playing some nice stuff and Aleksandr Mitrovic remains firmly among the goals, they need to start picking up a few more points. Slavisa Jokanovic’s side create chances but they always give you a chance, too they’ll fancy their chances of prising open an Arsenal back line that has looked wobbly but it’s hard to see them keeping it especially tight.So we could be in for a cracker. And something a bit more relaxed than yesterday’s Mourinho-fest, I would expect. I, for one, don’t blame either of today’s two managers for Brexit!

His knack for pitting young women against each other, which provided much of the drama on this year’s series of the dating reality show, might well have been controversial he might conceivably have been accused of vanity, for flashing his six-pack. But what was new and striking this summer was the furious debate among viewers over whether he could fairly be called a narcissist.A century after Freud wrote his essay On Narcissism, identifying a form of self-adoration prompted by viewing oneself as an object of sexual desire, the term has filtered right down from psychology textbooks into casual everyday conversation. Like “gaslighting” – which evolved from a reference to a Hitchcock film, to a form of emotional abuse identified by domestic violence specialists, to a word flung around with pretty wild abandon – its meaning has stretched sometimes to breaking point along the way. But it clearly fills a contemporary need.“It’s a buzzword,” says Marianne Vicelich, author of the self-help book Destruction: Free Yourself From the Narcissist. “Every time you have dinner with a few girlfriends someone uses the term – their boss is a narcissist, or their husband, or their ex, or their mother.”The Facebook group Knowing a Narcissist has built up a staggering 400,000 likes, with followers endlessly posting about the strains of dealing with a self-obsessed parent or partner. In her autobiography My Thoughts Exactly, Lily Allen describes her comedian father Keith as “cold and narcissistic”, too wrapped up in his own hedonistic life to spend much time with her.Vicelich, a prolific author of self-help books, thinks that’s where young women are picking up the term. “Women are becoming a lot more educated when it comes to relationships,” she says. But it might also have something to do with psychologists openly speculating that Donald Trump might have narcissistic personality disorder, a clinical condition involving grandiose behaviour, fantasies about one’s own power and attractiveness, craving for admiration, and unwillingness to empathise with others (other presumed sufferers include Saddam Hussein).The term is also increasingly being used against young women, accused of overindulging in all kinds of navel-gazing, from the cult of “self-care” (taking time out to cosset yourself) to compulsive posting of selfies. According to the American psychologists Jean Twenge and Keith Campbell in their book The Narcissism Epidemic: Living in the Age of Entitlement, social media along with other factors, from indulgent parenting to a highly inidualistic culture, risks creating a generation excessively wrapped up in itself. But is this really a new phenomenon, or merely the latest expression of a phenomenon as old as human nature?The original myth of Narcissus, the beautiful young man whose punishment from the gods was to fall so in love with his own reflection in a pool of water that he couldn’t bear to leave it, is on one level a warning against vanity but it’s also a cautionary tale about isolation, because the cruelty of Narcissus’s punishment is that it cuts him off completely from other living human beings.In small doses, narcissism can be a good thing or at least, better than a crippling lack of self-esteem. Research at Queen’s University Belfast suggests narcissists score better in exams than other measures of their intelligence would suggest they should. In careers requiring confident judgement under pressure, such as finance or politics, a strong sense of self-belief could well be advantageous. But it becomes counter-productive when not tempered by respect for the views of others, and it’s this inability to feel compassion, empathy, or even much curiosity about others that distinguishes the truly narcissistic from the merely vain.As Vicelich writes in her book, for narcissists “everything is about them and belongs to them”. They don’t recognise personal boundaries, hog conversations, crave constant validation and take criticism extremely badly. “They basically behave like four-year-olds: it’s all about them,” she says. “They want your attention, they need things right now – it’s all about instant gratification – and they really have an undeveloped sense of self.” They can be charming, flirtatious company. But they typically see others largely as extensions of themselves and can be controlling, cruel or critical of anyone they feel reflects badly on them. Loved ones willing to feed their egos are known in self-help lexicon as their “supply” – attention is to narcissists as drugs are to addicts – and that supply needs constant replenishing. What’s changed in a decade is the ease of getting a fix.Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter all supply attention-seekers with oodles of what they crave, in the satisfyingly measurable form of likes and shares. With its heavily filtered images of perfect abs and perfect lives, Insta is most often accused of harbouring narcissists, but it’s striking how many Twitter trolls would also fit the definition of a craving to be noticed plus indifference to pain caused. (Katie Hopkins once admitted that she’d considered whether she might be a psychopath, narcissist or autistic but decided none of the labels fitted.)In their book, Twenge and Campbell use questionnaires filled out by generations of college students to show a marked rise in scores on the so-called Narcissistic Personality Index since the 1980s, especially in women. It’s a contested area, with some questioning whether narcissism is even a recognisable condition given how loosely it’s defined, and middle-aged complaints about the young being selfish are certainly not new (back in the 1970s it was baby boomers who were being dismissed as “Generation Me”).Jamie Jewitt is a former model who was one half of Love Island’s runner-up couple last year, with his girlfriend Camilla Thurlow. He has more than 831,000 followers on Instagram and 128,000 on Twitter, and since leaving the show has filmed documentaries for the BBC and recorded a TED talk. He has all the attention any self-respecting millennial could desire, yet is about to start giving talks in schools about the perils of overdoing social media. If tomorrow he was told that he could no longer use it, how would he feel? “For me, I know it would be a huge relief,” he admits. “The annoying thing is that it’s necessary at the moment. It’s a huge avenue to get publicity for the work that we are doing and it’s always going to be a very handy tool for that, but it’s a bittersweet thing. It’s a necessary evil, put it like that.”Jewitt dates his discomfort back to his modelling days, when he was expected to upload a steady flow of unrealistically flattering pictures on Instagram as a showcase for prospective clients. “All of my model friends were doing what they were told, posting these images, becoming a bit self-absorbed and going down the rabbit hole. I refused to do it and I ended up losing out on work, but I had such conflicting feelings about it,” he says.After Love Island, he was determined not to go back into that world instead he and Camilla volunteered in a Greek refugee camp (she had been working for a mine-clearing charity before going on the show), and made a documentary about it. “I didn’t want to come out and end up living a life that was just a version of what I’d done before with modelling. It became such a fundamental thing, to have Insta and self-promote, and it was a dishonest way of living – you had to take pictures of yourself looking your best, just so the clients would see you as a viable tool to use to sell their products. It’s not real and it’s not healthy.”Although 28-year-old Jewitt might not be your average reality TV contestant, his reservations about social media are fairly typical of his generation. A third of Generation Z have deleted accounts in the past year, with a fifth saying they wanted more privacy and couldn’t cope with the pressure to get attention, according to research by Origin, a Boston-based market research company. Private messaging circles like Snapchat and WhatsApp are overtaking public-facing platforms like Facebook and Twitter among the young. But if the generation raised on social media is increasingly wary of its impact on them, the generation who discovered it later in life is a different matter.“Make America great again.” “Take back control.” “The people have had enough of experts.” What’s striking about the slogans adopted by Trump in the US and the Leave campaign in Britain is that they flatter the movement’s supporters as much as its leaders. They imply that the people are invariably smarter than anyone disagreeing with them, that they deserve to be in charge, that their natural greatness is being unfairly suppressed.And whether deliberately or not, it’s a siren call to what’s known as collective narcissism, or an exaggerated love not of oneself but of one’s group. Collective narcissists aren’t personally grandiose – if anything they may feel inidually powerless – but can be cultlike in their devotion to a national, religious or ideological identity with which they identify.“Collective narcissists feel their group is threatened all the time, that others are after it. They’re prone to conspiratorial thinking,” explains Golec de Zavala, who specialises in researching the phenomenon. “Whenever they feel their group status is threatened, if they had it in their power, they would aggress against those who threaten it. Things that other people would not even notice or imagine are insulting, they would be hostile towards.”On social media, de Zavala says, they tend to come across as “zealous” and persevere with arguments well after others have given up. And while her research shows they’re disproportionately likely to have voted for Trump in the US or Brexit in the UK, “it could be that on the left there are collective narcissists, too.” The cap is certainly a good fit not just for Brexiteers hellbent on crushing imagined saboteurs, or white men furiously objecting to Black History Month on the grounds that it doesn’t seem to be about them, but also perhaps for the posters of memes comparing Jeremy Corbyn to a persecuted Jesus. More disturbingly, the collective narcissist’s extreme intolerance for dissent might help explain why politicians in all parties now routinely face death threats over ideological stances taken.In small doses, collective narcissism can foster a healthy sense of patriotism or pride. But it can turn ugly when supporters are encouraged to believe that their own group’s innate specialness isn’t being properly recognised and that rival groups are getting what’s rightfully theirs. What differentiates them from other protest movements, says de Zavala, is that they don’t just want equality but “special privilege”, or supremacy over everyone else.“What I think is happening to us now worldwide is that this collective narcissistic construction of national identity became the norm,” she says. “It’s something that was marginalised and now is becoming mainstream and if you look at our research on collective narcissism, that’s a bad sign.”The concept originates from the 1930s, when it was used to explain why people who lost their personal sense of self-worth in the depression began investing heavily in group identities instead, and the parallels with the 2008 crash are all too alarming. De Zavala started researching collective narcissism in part because she wondered if there was a way of curbing it early, bearing in mind where it ultimately led in the 1930s. One option, she thinks, might be channelling collective narcissists’ energies into constructive ways of boosting their group, such as voluntary work in their communities – essentially a twist on John F Kennedy’s “Ask not what your country can do for you” approach. But her research points towards tackling the fact that collective narcissists are generally dissatisfied with their lives. “If you make people experience self-transcendent emotions – such as gratitude or something that diminishes the importance of ego – we had experimental studies which showed that, especially among collective narcissists, it reduces prejudice.” In other words, the ability to focus on something bigger than yourself might have more profound social effects than we realise.Taming the inidual narcissist in your life, or indeed your Oval Office, may be harder given their indifference to others’ distress and their inability to take criticism. “If you attack them, that’s wounding their fragile egos, so that’s no good – in a relationship you just have to work around them,” says Marianne Vicelich. It is hard not to be reminded of how the White House insiders are described in Bob Woodward’s new book Fear: Trump in the White House, creeping around removing papers from Trump’s desk to stop him signing them rather than confronting him directly.And if you can’t avoid dealing with a narcissistic parent or boss? Stand up for yourself, Vicelich says, remembering that their bombastic exteriors are often a defence against deep insecurity. “They’re not happy people. Once you realise their egos are so fragile and that what they’re saying is no reflection on you, you can start setting boundaries.”The original Narcissus, it’s worth remembering, eventually died of sorrow at his lonely predicament.

The festival’s co-organiser Emily Eavis announced at 9.36am that the sale was over.“Tickets have now all sold out! We are blown away by the huge demand, looks like record numbers tried. Thank you for your patience and incredible support and for those of you who missed out, there will be a ticket resale in April,” she tweeted.This followed a swift sellout last Thursday of tickets packaged with coach travel. Only pre-registered buyers could access the two online sales as part of the festival’s continued drive against ticket touting.A spokesman for the festival said it sold 135,000 tickets for the event each year. The festival next June will be the first since 2017 after a fallow year, which allows the ground at Worthy Farm in Somerset to recover.Festivalgoers who bought the £248 tickets were, as usual, taking the plunge without knowing the lineup, but speculation is already rife. Eavis has previously said that Paul McCartney is “top of our list”, while other rumoured headliners include Elton John, Kendrick Lamar and ABBA. Madonna has also hinted she would be open to performing.As for the Sunday afternoon “legend” slot, Eavis dropped a hint to BBC Radio 2 this summer. “I’ll give you a clue. It’s a female. She is not British, but I can’t give you any more clues because it will get me into trouble.”Barry Gibb filled the slot in 2017, with Foo Fighters, Radiohead and Ed Sheeran headlining. The event that year was particularly political, taking place days after the Grenfell Tower fireThe Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, gave an impassioned speech on the main stage.The festival’s founder, Michael Eavis, announced in July that he would be giving away up to 500 free tickets to trainee nurses in the Mendip area of Somerset, where Worthy Farm is located, after he learned of nursing shortages in the county.The event will run from 26 to 30 June 2019.

That would be only right and proper,” he said.“There has to be the right for Scotland to call a second referendum on independence.”This year’s conference is expected to be one of the most subdued of recent years, with Nicola Sturgeon, the party leader and first minister, still unable to make a final decision on whether to call for a new independence vote. She faces a difficult dilemma: choose between thwarting Brexit or pressing on with independence.Barely 24 hours before the start of the conference, thousands of independence activists backed by some SNP MSPs marched to the Scottish parliament in Edinburgh on Saturday. The rally, organised by the unaligned group All Under One Banner, increases pressure on Sturgeon to prioritise independence over Brexit.Backed by Blackford, Sturgeon is waiting until the terms of a Brexit deal become clearer, but she also has to decide whether to commit to backing a second Brexit referendum if that becomes the best way to block a bad deal.Blackford said he and Sturgeon were sceptical about the chances of a second Brexit referendum being held because both Theresa May and the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, opposed the option.As the third largest party at Westminster, the SNP’s 35 MPs could have a crucial role in any knife-edge vote on the Brexit deal or a second EU referendum. Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, wrote to Sturgeon on Friday urging her to join his party by backing the People’s Vote initiative.With Corbyn under pressure from party members to reverse his opposition to a second referendum, there are signs the SNP is shifting ground too. Sturgeon’s Brexit minister, Mike Russell, held what he described as interesting and informative talks with Hugo Dixon, a leading figure in the People’s Vote campaign, late last month.Blackford confirmed that Sturgeon’s aides had also floated another option that would involve structuring a second Brexit referendum so that all four UK nations would need to vote the same way for the result to be valid. The SNP says it would mean no part of the UK would be forced to accept an outcome it did not support.Other parties are highly unlikely to back the idea, however, because it would give the smaller nations an effective veto on the result.Sources in the People’s Vote campaign have indicated they would resist such an arrangement because a second Brexit referendum would have to be based on “speed, simplicity and clarity”.The SNP, which is run by Sturgeon’s husband, Peter Murrell, has decided there will be no debate on independence or Brexit at this year’s conference, but the first minister will need to face down demands from hardline independence activists and some MPs and MSPs to launch a second independence campaign soon.The party has also been reeling from the disclosure that its former leader, Alex Salmond, is being investigated for the alleged sexual harassment of two women. He has launched legal action calling for a judicial review of the investigation of the allegations, which he denies, backed by a isive crowd-funding campaign.Several MPs and MSPs appeared on Salmond’s controversial chatshow on the Kremlin-backed channel RT on Thursday calling for another independence referendum “as soon as possible”. They ignored Sturgeon’s instruction to boycott the show because of the channel’s links to Vladimir Putin’s government, which did little to dispel speculation about dissent within SNP ranks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91ae047c61714fe4a4699d62304ca841f44680b0/0_295_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a47c2da661ca3c70ece7425c3f41c77a","title":"macron woos uk car firms over private dinner","story":"President Macron has stepped up attempts to attract UK-based carmakers to France with a private dinner at the Elysée Palace, following their growing concerns about a botched Brexit deal.The heads of Renault Nissan, Vauxhall and Jaguar Land Rover are understood to have been among executives invited to a dinner last week, where the president warned against growing nationalism around the world and said he was making France more business friendly. It is the latest sign Macron is trying to attract firms nervous about the uncertainty created by Brexit. Three French ministers also took part in the dinner, with the organisers ensuring that companies with major UK operations were represented.Macron’s charm offensive emerges before a crucial fortnight that could make or break Theresa May’s hopes of securing a comprehensive Brexit deal. Some ministers are still understood to be considering resigning should May concede further ground to Brussels, such as limiting Britain’s ability to strike trade deals with other countries.A week of frenzied diplomatic activity will see the prime minister’s key Brexit adviser, Olly Robbins, head to Brussels on Monday, with the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, holding talks there on Thursday. An impasse over how to keep the Irish border open after Brexit remains, with much riding on whether May can give ground while retaining the support of Northern Irish DUP MPs.Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, talked up the chances of a deal on Saturday, saying he had “reason to think the rapprochement potential between both sides has increased in recent days”. However, the EU is expected to unveil its vision for a future agreement with the UK on Wednesday that falls short of May’s demand for “frictionless trade” – a major blow to UK exporters, who have warned any disruption will hit the productivity of their UK plants.Macron’s administration has been attempting to lure financial services staff and companies based in London for some time. Industry insiders said his dinner for car executives, held to coincide with the Paris motor show, was an attempt to make the case for France as a manufacturing location as companies decide where to build a new generation of electric cars.At the event last week, Macron pledged to work with industry bosses to find a compromise on plans for CO2 targets and is said to have told his audience that France is now a place that champions business success. The Elysée Palace refused to comment.Carmakers have been increasingly vocal about their Brexit concerns. Vauxhall warned last week that there would be “dramatic consequences” for its UK plants if no Brexit deal was reached. Ralf Speth, the chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover, warned last month that he was not certain whether its UK plants could continue to operate after Brexit. He has also said investment decisions over its electric car production have been delayed as a result of Brexit uncertainty.It is now less than two weeks until the EU summit at which the principles of a deal need to be agreed. The so-called “Irish backstop” – a legal agreement guaranteeing the Irish border remains unchanged after Brexit, even if a future trade deal fails to ensure it – remains the sticking point.In an attempt to solve the issue, Britain is expected to support sticking to the EU’s customs rules on goods, as well as aligning Northern Ireland with EU regulations, as long as the Irish assembly agrees. The bid could be derailed if it is opposed by DUP leader Arlene Foster, who has warned Northern Ireland must not be treated differently to the rest of the UK.One EU official said: “We heard Arlene Foster’s ‘blood red’ red-line. I seem to remember the DUP said last year they were ready for a staring match, as they had cut off their eye-lids. That is a bit of a worry.”Any suggestion the EU has a veto over Britain’s ability to move away from its customs rules in the future would be met with fierce opposition from Tory Brexiters. The mood among some ministers is grim, but most agree a “no deal” outcome would be so disastrous that there is no choice but to compromise in the short term.An EU ambassadors meeting on Friday afternoon and addressed by Sabine Weyand, the EU’s deputy chief negotiator, heard that progress was being made, with deals on the future of UK bases in Cyprus and the future of Gibraltar close to being finalised. The Irish question remains unresolved, but EU sources were told there was “movement” on the issue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7ec99c4e358db21dac6c63462474aff20f0cbd9/80_515_1524_914/master/1524.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afdc8541ff7c253ed9d254f43e130cb9","title":"apollo programme first steps into space fifty years on half century since photogaphs book","story":"This week marks half a century since the launch of Apollo 7. The photographs from that mission and those that followed still have the power to astonishFifty years ago this week, the first Apollo spacecraft to carry humans into space was launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The sequence of missions begun by Apollo 7 would eventually see American astronauts land on the moon nine months later. The 11 manned Apollo flights that took place between 1968 and 1972 represent the greatest odyssey ever undertaken by our species and are revealed in majestic colour in the newly released Apollo VII to XVII, published by teNeues (£45).The book is filled with startling colour images of fiery Apollo launches and spacecraft interiors as well as scenes of the bright blue disc of the Earth rising majestically over grey lunar plains. It is a dramatic evocation of just how swiftly the US manned space programme had advanced in only a few years since President John Kennedy had committed the US, in May 1961, to land a human on the moon by the end of the decade.Complex space rendezvous techniques had to be perfected, special spacecraft designed and Apollo’s giant Saturn V launcher constructed and tested. All had been put through their paces during unmanned flights. Apollo 7 was the first to carry astronauts. The mission was confined to Earth orbit but still grabbed world attention after its astronauts – Walter Schirra, Donn Eisele and Walter Cunningham – made the world’s first live television broadcast from space.Photography was given a key role in the Apollo programme as Nasa wanted good records of its missions and the three astronauts had been trained to use Hasselblad cameras that were later used routinely on other missions. The resulting photographs are of superb quality, though Cunningham recalls being given one strange photographic command: “We were told: take no pictures of China,” he states. The order, made presumably for security reasons, turned out to be an easy one, he adds. “In 11 days and many passes over China, we never saw the surface because of cloud cover and smog in their atmosphere.”• Apollo VII-XVII is published by teNeues (£45).

Privately, NHS bosses say that their hands are tied, the law is “nonsense” and they have to allow for-profit firms to bid or risk facing legal challenge. Since 2016 Virgin Care has sued the NHS in Surrey as well as Lancashire county council amid disputes about contracts for services it failed to win.Hartlepool \u0026amp Stockton Health, a not-for-profit GP collective that provides appointments at three Teesside surgeries, is a case in point. Despite high patient satisfaction scores and offering 25,000 extra appointments a year outside usual surgery hours, it could lose out to profit-driven companies. Several private firms, including IntraHealth, have expressed interest after it issued a tender worth up to £1.1m a year for the extended-hours service from 2019-21.Dr Paul Williams, a local Labour MP who helped to set up the collective in 2015 and still practises as a GP, said: “The law is creating unnecessary privatisation that isn’t working in the interests of patients. This is a ridiculous fragmentation of services, at a time when the rhetoric from government and NHS leaders has all been about integration.”Doctors’ leaders are demanding an end to outsourcing. “These services should be managed and run by local GPs working together. It is these doctors, who provide care to the same patients from within the community, that are best placed to control how the service works best,” said Richard Vautrey, chair of the British Medical Association’s GPs committee.Other CCGs intending to invite bids for evening and weekend GP sessions include Bassetlaw in Nottinghamshire, Watford and Three Rivers in Hertfordshire. North Lincolnshire CCG has also invited expressions of interest in extended-access consultations at an urgent treatment centre based in Scunthorpe general hospital worth £25m-£35m.Private firms such as AT Medics have already won contracts for out-of-hours sessions. Last year, it secured a £1.5m, two-year contract from Camden CCG in north London it does the same in other boroughs in the capital.“The government is saying one thing – collaboration – but the reality is that competition prevails. How can it be better to have a private company running general pracice for an hour and a half each day than having it run collectively by local GPs?” asked Williams."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa3a465455877517a6d4a9c6ee5adc7958991e07/424_0_3363_2018/master/3363.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46be0c591c3008d008281cede9b0389a","title":"english clubs champions cup atonement leinster saracens","story":"The pressing question in European rugby union as the Champions Cup starts is how do you stop Leinster winning it for a record fifth time. At the launch in Newcastle, where next May’s final will be played, Bath’s director of rugby, Todd Blackadder, suggested it is a tournament where cultures collide – and that the holders have become adept at winning the collision battle.The draw has placed the Irish provincial side in Pool 1 with three former winners of the cup, including Toulouse, whose record of four triumphs Leinster equalled last season in a tense final against Racing 92 in Bilbao. The Irish province look a class apart, all but an international team whose leading protagonists, unlike their French and English counterparts, have enjoyed a long pre-season.Leinster’s fly-half Jonathan Sexton turned 33 in the summer. He has spent four more seasons at Leinster than his England rival Owen Farrell has at Saracens but has played fewer matches and in the last two campaigns, 12 of his 21 starts for the province came in the Champions Cup. He played more during his two years at Racing 92 but burnout is not a factor for one of the most influential players in the game.Leinster begin the defence of the trophy against Wasps in Dublin on Friday night, a fixture that three years ago marked their lowest point in Europe this decade. They were routed 33-6 and conceded 51 points in the return to finish bottom of their pool, five defeats in six contrasting with nine in their previous 47 matches in Europe.“When I first broke into the side, we were the European champions three years in four,” says Sexton. “I thought it was pretty easy but it is only when you go years without the trophy that you realise just how hard a competition it is to win. It is incredibly difficult and that’s what makes it special. There were times when I did not think we would get back to the level we had been and it was a dream to win it again.”Leinster were favourites last season even before defeating Saracens in the quarter-final, but the English champions, who were defending the crown they had held for two years, are ready to reclaim it. They are in a group that includes the only newcomers, Lyon, whose head coach, Pierre Mignoni, won the tournament with Toulon.“A few years ago we were in the second ision playing before a few thousand spectators,” he says. “We had to rebuild the team and the mentality. If the route we have taken to get here is a bit unconventional, the change has been remarkable in a short period of time. Now we have to climb again because the Champions Cup is close to international level. I know from experience how difficult it will be but we will give it a go.”The leading two teams in France’s Top 14 – Clermont Auvergne and Stade Français – do not even feature and are in the Challenge Cup while Toulon went into Sunday’s league match at Montpellier, their European group rivals, in danger of dropping into the relegation zone. Ma’a Nonu has gone and their summer import from New Zealand, Julian Savea, has yet to score a try for his new club.The only unbeaten Champions Cup teams at the end of the first month of the season were Saracens and Exeter. The Chiefs have yet to assert themselves in Europe but they look to have a more favourable group than last season, when they were drawn with Leinster. None of Castres, Gloucester or Munster has the look of potential winners, but in their eight seasons in the Premiership Exeter have yet to double Gloucester or be doubled while the French champions have in the past prioritised the Top 14 ahead of the Champions Cup because of their relatively small squad.Since reaching the semi-finals in 2002, Castres have won away twice in 33 matches, at Treviso and Glasgow, but their director of rugby, Christophe Urios, believes this season they have the strength in depth to compete and with Munster invariably energised by Europe, Pool 2 may be the most compelling of the groups.The Premiership clubs are seeking atonement after supplying just one quarter-finalist last season, and even then Saracens missed the back door and sneaked in through the cat flap. A prime reason why Leinster won the tournament was their ability to retain possession and minimise mistakes despite referees permitting a contest for possession at the breakdown.That did not happen in the Premiership, prompting Eddie Jones, the England head coach, to request a rethink, but the penalty conceded by Ed Slater last week for Gloucester against Harlequins when Danny Care was holding on to the ball after a tackle showed there has been little change. English clubs remain more comfortable moving their own ball rather than attacking from turnovers. Saracens, for whom Alex Goode continues to excel, are an exception and they pose the greatest threat to Leinster."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6d6b6f8e35b70ba3fdbf510aab858aaa96cf7a1/0_246_3843_2307/master/3843.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c02f3861ea8d5ac85a48453f984b098","title":"lewis hamilton win japan grand prix and moves closer to drivers championship","story":"Win puts Hamilton’s fifth world championship firmly in his grasp as Sebastian Vettel finished sixthLewis Hamilton won the Japanese Grand Prix from pole with a controlled and untroubled run at the front of the field. The win puts his fifth world championship firmly in his grasp. With his title rival Sebastian Vettel only able to manage sixth after he tangled with Max Verstappen early in the race, the German’s challenge is all but over. Hamilton’s team-mate Valtteri Bottas completed a strong one-two for Mercedes. Verstappen was in third and his Red Bull team-mate Daniel Ricciardo in fourth, with Kimi Raikkonen in fifth.Hamilton’s lead over Vettel is now 67 points with four races remaining, worth 100 points. Vettel knew he had to win here but after qualifying badly the odds were already against him. Now it is a matter of just when Hamilton closes it out and equals Juan Manuel Fangio’s five F1 titles. If Hamilton wins at the next round in the USA Vettel must finish second to ensure the fight even goes to Mexico City.For Hamilton and Bottas enjoyed an almost serene run from the front row to the flag, although Bottas was pressured by Verstappen at the death. It will not necessarily be remembered as a classic but their perfect execution all weekend was an object lesson to Ferrari as to why their title hopes have been dashed. Vettel was pressured into trying to make something from his lowly grid slot and his eagerness led to another misjudgement that cost him dearly.It is Hamilton’s fifth win at the Japanese Grand Prix and the 71st of his career. He took the flag at Fuji for McLaren in 2007 and has now won for Mercedes at Suzuka in four of the five races since 2014. He now has six wins now from the last seven races.The victory means Mercedes continue their run of being unbeaten at Suzuka since the turbo-hybrid era began in 2014. Hamilton’s ninth win of the season leaves Ferrari reeling and their championship challenge in tatters after such a promising opening to their year. Their tyre choice mistake in qualifying that meant Vettel could only start from eighth was a huge blow and left Hamilton and Bottas free to dominate the race for Mercedes at the front.Suzuka was expected to provide a good measure of just how Ferrari and Mercedes now match up to one another and on this evidence Mercedes have clearly regained the advantage. Although Ferrari have had the quicker car since Silverstone, Mercedes looked to have surpassed them in the development battle over the last three rounds. Hamilton had been strong all weekend topping all three practice sessions before taking pole and in the race he exploited his advantage to maximum effect.Hamilton and Bottas held the lead cleanly through turn one but Vettel executed a magnificent first lap from eighth on the grid. He was quick off the line and had passed the Toro Rosso’s of Pierre Gasly and Brendon Hartley by the time he was into the esses to take sixth and the Haas of Romain Grosjean fell swiftly afterwards.In front of him Verstappen overcooked it under pressure from Raikkonen at the chicane and went off, then squeezed the Finn when rejoining, Vettel took advantage to nip round his teammate to take fourth by the end of the first lap. Verstappen was subsequently given a five-second penalty for not returning to the track safely.The safety car was deployed on lap five after Kevin Magnussen left debris on the track after clashing with Charles Leclerc, however when racing resumed on lap eight, Vettel’s valiant efforts were promptly wasted. He tried to go up the inside of Verstappen at Spoon and the two clipped one another. Vettel spun off and had to rejoin in 19th – last place.The move appeared to be a little too much too soon, especially at Spoon and given that the Dutchman had a five second penalty to take at his stop. The incident was investigated by the stewards but they took no further action. Vettel appeared to want to avoid letting Mercedes open up too much of a gap in front, which he had to do given his deficit in the championship fight. It was the decisive moment of the race.Vettel tried to come back but once again had to move right through the field. While Hamilton was in control out front the German driver had made it to 15th by lap 14. By lap 32 he had finally made it back to his starting position of eighth. He was putting in some of the fastest laps and on lap 35 was in 6th but a full 40 seconds behind his teammate in fifth.It was as far as he could go and to be fair a valiant effort but his race was long gone just as his title attempt has fallen by the wayside over the last seven races. Hamilton however has simply gone from strength to strength and once again in Japan demonstrated why the championship is now in his hands.The Force India’s of Sergio Pérez and Esteban Ocon were in seventh and ninth with Romain Grosjean’s Haas in eighth and the Renault of Carlos Sanz in tenth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/981e3702177b8ccd0e0404600b50bd88e6ae44b3/0_0_3739_2244/master/3739.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecb79123c9b2d4b750d76fea86edcf0c","title":"five europe best wilderness spotting wildlife romania poland finland greece portugal","story":"Even on our crowded continent there are remote regions where you can still spot bears, bison, lynx, wolves and moreFor big open skies and untrammelled snow forest (taiga), set your compass to Kainuu, in eastern Finland.

Paddling along the Tar Route, once used to transport tar from the forest’s eastern fringes to the Baltic Sea, the six-day, self-guided trips cost from £645 for a family of four, including transfers and equipment (for canoeing, cooking and camping) but not flights or food.If you’d rather go in winter, Wildlife Safaris Finland takes guests out on foot, ski or snowshoe from its “base camp”, a traditional log house complete with sauna, to see wolverine, wolf and otter tracks and, if they’re lucky, spot golden eagles, Siberian jays, waxwings or even the northern lights. Prices start from €890pp for three nights, including transfers, accommodation, food and two guided activities a day but not flights. Once upon a time (10,000 years ago) a vast swathe of north-eastern Europe was covered by dense forest. Since then, many of those tree-lined tracts have been felled but, in what is now the far east of Poland and the far west of Belarus, on the watershed of the Baltic and Black Seas, the last significant tract of this primary woodland remains: the almost 142,000-hectare Białowieża forest.How to do it Unlike with many European wildlife trips, there is no need to wait until next summer to visit the Białowieża forest Wild Poland’s eight-day Winter Wildlife Festival runs from 19-26 January 2019. Starting and finishing in Warsaw, the tour costs from £552pp, and includes transfers, half-board in a cosy wooden forest guesthouse, evening lectures by visiting scientists and self-guided nature walks. In addition, guests can dip into a daily programme of guided activities – including the chance to visit the Biebrza Marshes – on a pay-as-you-go basis.The Pindus (sometimes spelt Pindos) Mountains are dubbed the backbone of Greece – head to the top of the spine for the best wildlife encounters. In the country’s rugged north-western corner, nudging the border with Albania, two national parks (Northern Pindos and Vikos-Aoös) attract a trickle of tourists to sites such as the Vikos gorge and the Zagori villages, but in far smaller numbers than those congregating along Greece’s busy coastlines.Why go? Between the mountains’ toothy peaks, deep ravines and alpine lakes are valleys of beech, chestnut and pine forest (parts of the latter belong to the Natura 2000 network of protected natural sites across Europe). In the Northern Pindos national park alone there are 11 wildlife sanctuaries, helping to protect 4,000-odd plant species and fauna ranging from wolves, jackals, otters, red deer and brown bears to herons, egrets and spoonbills.How to do it Join Natural Greece’s five-day Wild Bears in Northern Pindos trip and spend time tracking animals with the help of researchers from Callisto, an aptly named local bear conservation charity. Starting and finishing in Thessaloniki, these run in summer and autumn and cost from €550pp, including transfers, guiding, accommodation and some meals.Alternatively, make a comfortable base camp in one of the region’s family-run village hotels and venture out on day trips. Doubles at Primoula Country Hotel, in Ano Pedina, cost from £70 B\u0026ampB. Photography tours, birdwatching trips and trekking can be arranged in partnership with local organisations such as Zen, the Zagori Excellence Network.Vampires may be Transylvania’s most infamous predatory carnivores but the region’s population of wolves comes close. This southern corner of the Carpathians – an arc of wooded mountains, meadows and canyons that rises from central Romania – offers some of the most accessible wildlife watching in Europe and though it comprises wild swathes of rugged, old-growth forest, it is easily reached from Transylvania’s centuries-old villages. Those who want to explore Saxon citadels, perfectly pickled medieval towns, bucolic rural villages, fortified churches or Dracula’s Bran Castle alongside vultures (bearded, Egyptian, griffon and cinereous species have been spotted in the region, too), can easily fit these in on their way to wilder territory.Why go? The Southern Carpathians are home to some of the largest populations of wolves, lynx and bears in Europe, as well as chamois, wild cats, red and roe deer and wild boar. Over a million hectares of protected bioerse land is linked through wilderness corridors here, one of eight key areas run by Dutch non-profit organisation Rewilding Europe, and a small number of European bison have been reintroduced.The cobbled streets and riverside wine bars of Porto may be heaving with tourists these days, but three hours’ drive east, along Portugal’s north-east border with Spain, the Côa Valley is unfathomably quiet. Hikers and cyclists tackling the Grande Rota do Vale do Côa long-distance trail and archaeology buffs exploring the Côa Valley world heritage site (with up to 12,000 prehistoric depictions of horses, oxen, deer and hunters) – are drawn to the region in small numbers, but its river gorges, oak forests and scrubby heaths remain largely undisturbed.Why go? Sitting within the cross-border Meseta Ibérica Unesco biosphere and Western Iberia (another of Rewilding Europe’s key areas), the Côa Valley is known especially for cliff-breeding birds (among them black storks, eagle owls, alpine swifts, red-rumped swallows and numerous species of vultures and eagles). It is also home to the Reserva da Faia Brava, an 850-hectare independent nature reserve that counts wild Garrano horses and Maronesa cattle, Iberian wolves, ibex and red deer and roe deer among its inhabitants.How to do it Nature-based tourism is one of Rewilding Europe’s key strategies. In the Côa Valley it has supported small accommodation providers, one of the most noteworthy being Star Camp, a trio of safari-style tents within the Faia Brava reserve. Here, guests pay from €104 a night for two (dinner is €30pp), and can add on guided bird-watching. For longer trips, local tour operator Miles Away or the Netherlands-based European Safari Company can put together tailormade packages.

What she can’t or won’t talk about. It’s not that she doesn’t have a whole lot to say – she does, particularly about technology and how it can be used against us. Her job as an intelligence analyst for the US army, using data to profile enemy combatants – to be targeted and maybe killed – gave her an acute understanding of its potential uses and abuses. She understood the power of Facebook to profile and target long before the Cambridge Analytica scandal erupted. “Marketing or death by drone, it’s the same math,” she says. There’s no difference between the private sector and the military. “You could easily turn Facebook into that. You don’t have to change the programming, just the purpose of why you have the system.”She understands this world the overlap between military and civilian technologies that has caught us all in its dragnet. It’s her role in it that’s more opaque. She seems, still, at the beginning of a process of understanding what she did, what it all means, where she fits in. How in 2010, as Bradley Manning, aged 22, she downloaded and leaked, via Julian Assange’s WikiLeaks, 750,000 classified and sensitive documents that revealed America’s secret diplomatic cables and Iraqi and Afghanistan war logs. How she was caught, court martialled and sentenced to 35 years in prison. And how, in one of Barack Obama’s last acts as president, she was suddenly and unexpectedly granted clemency last year and freed.It’s a story that is as complex, complicated, conflicted and unresolved as perhaps Manning herself. The meaning, the significance, the consequences of what she did are not yet in any way settled or even stable. As Bradley Manning, she was the hero who blew the whistle on the US’s relationship with the rest of the world and its hypocrisy. Or the traitor who committed crimes under the Espionage Act and betrayed her country. For some people, it’s both.Because Manning was the techie who turned. Turned the technology against the country that had developed it, turned its foreign policy inside out, turned herself from Bradley into Chelsea and – an unforeseen consequence – turned WikiLeaks from a fringe actor into a new force in global politics. Before Manning, Assange was a leaking organisation without a significant leaker.Manning can’t talk about a lot of what happened in detail. She says the US army has reclassified many of the documents that were previously public – and she’s also writing a book – so there’s a hesitancy to give things away ahead of time. But it also seems to run deeper than that. She doesn’t try to second guess the choices she made.She shrugs. “I don’t know. I just remember breakfast, lunch, dinner, sleep, breakfast, lunch. I keep going back to that because what I remember is that the routine was my centrepiece to staying grounded.”It seems unlikely that Manning’s trip to London last week will have made any of this any clearer. Stefan Kalmár, the ICA’s newish, politically minded director, had invited her to London to give a talk and be the guest of honour at a fundraising dinner hosted by Vivienne Westwood. It’s another jump cut for Manning. From a cage in the Kuwaiti desert, where she was exfiltrated after being caught while serving in Iraq, to the ICA’s Nash-designed villa a few hundred yards from Buckingham Palace. Westwood shocks the audience, a well-heeled, gender-fluid art crowd, by referring a number of times – sincerely, but forgetfully – to Chelsea as Bradley. “He was my hero,” she says as hostility ripples through the audience and people shout: “It’s Chelsea!”There’s been so many of these cuts in her story. Manning has lived more lives than most and she’s still only 30. Her aunt painted a brutal picture of childhood isolation and neglect at her trial – her parents had problems with alcohol, her mother with a history of psychiatric problems. Later, she plunged herself into one of the most hyper-macho environments imaginable – an army unit in a war zone – just as her discomfort at her outward appearance as a man was becoming unbearable. She changed her name to Chelsea and decided to live outwardly as a woman the day after she was sentenced to 35 years in another hyper-macho environment – a male prison. Another rupture.Bradley Manning is born in Crescent, Oklahoma, to an American father and Welsh mother.Manning and her mother move to Haverfordwest in Wales after her parents’ orce. The teenager shows an aptitude for computers at school. She returns to the US to live with her father in 2005.At 19, Manning joins the US army. Her father, Brian, had served in the US Navy as an intelligence analyst.Manning is sent to\u0026nbspIraq, where she works as an intelligence analyst at a US army base outside Baghdad. In that role, she is given access to top secret intelligence databases.Manning makes contact with\u0026nbspWikiLeaks\u0026nbspfor the first time after it leaked 570,000 pager messages from 911.Manning uploads the Iraq and Afghanistan war logs to the WikiLeaks portal from a Barnes \u0026amp Noble store in Maryland while on leave.WikiLeaks posts a video of Iraqi civilians and journalists being killed by a US helicopter gunship some time in July 2007, publishing it under the title Collateral Murder.Manning is arrested at Forward Operating Base Hammer outside Baghdad, and transferred four days later to Camp Arifjan in Kuwait. While being held in Kuwait, she is found with a sheet that she has fashioned into a noose, having had suicidal thoughts.A series of\u0026nbspreports on the Afghanistan war, based on US military internal logs, are published by the , the New York Times and other media groups.Manning is moved to Quantico in the US, where she is held in a solitary cell for 23 hours a day. The UN later denounces her conditions as\u0026nbspa form of torture.The\u0026nbspIraq war logs are published, detailing civilian deaths, torture, summary executions and war crimes in what Manning summed up as the “true nature of 21st-century asymmetric warfare”.250,000\u0026nbspUS embassy cables\u0026nbspare published by the  and other international outlets, revealing what diplomats really think about their postings and exposing widespread corruption in regimes across the Middle East.The Guantánamo files are released\u0026nbspby the  and the New York Times, containing the US’s secret assessments of detainees at the US base in Cuba.-Manning pleads guilty to leaking military information, but\u0026nbspnot guilty to 12 of the most serious charges, including “aiding the enemy”.Manning’s court martial begins at Fort Meade, Maryland.Manning is cleared of “aiding the enemy”, the most serious charge, but is\u0026nbspfound guilty\u0026nbspof a total of 20 counts, including several under the Espionage Act.Manning is sentenced to 35 years. The next day\u0026nbspshe announces through her lawyer\u0026nbspthat she is transgender and wishes to be known as Chelsea Manning.Barack Obama\u0026nbspcommutes Manning’s sentence\u0026nbspand sets the date of her release.Manning\u0026nbspis freed from Fort Leavenworth in Kansas. “Whatever is ahead of me, is far more important than the past,” she says in her first comment as a free woman.And, then, suddenly and unexpectedly, in January 2017, she learned she would be released, Obama’s parting gift to Donald Trump, who railed against the “ungrateful TRAITOR” on Twitter but could do nothing about it. It was another difficult transition. “I’d became institutionalised… When you put somebody in prison for a while, you really develop a mentality to get you through that environment. Even just imagining being out of prison is difficult”And you can see it, perhaps, in Manning’s stance, the way she faces the world. She appeared before the massed ranks of photographers on Monday morning for a press call outside the ICA, chin out, defiant. It was her first trip to the UK since her release and she was in London to be feted and celebrated, but in the photos she looks as if she’s facing another day of battle. Later, she was invited to pick out a Westwood outfit to wear at the gala dinner, and while Westwood wore a pink satin floor-length gown, Manning chose a sober black trouser suit that, as a German designer pointed out to me, “looks like Hillary Clinton doing Westwood” it seemed more armour than adornment.Perhaps Manning, a trained soldier, is not yet out of the combat zone. “I spent the last seven years of my life fighting to survive,” she says. “And that was the main focus of everything. Y’all have had the opportunity to unpack it all. But I never did. I was in the mode of seeking hormones, seeking access to gender-confirming healthcare and then suddenly I’m out. And these things that were bothering me 10 years ago, well they’ve really intensified. And I haven’t really had time to unpack it.”It’s hard to overstate how radical Manning’s message is now. She’s engaging with grassroots activists who are organising protests and actions all over America and working with technologists to address the coming dangers of AI.America’s problems are way bigger than Trump, she says. “All these systems, our court system, our military, our prison system, the intelligence apparatus, have all been going through this buildup, buildup, buildup over several decades.” She calls it the “whirling death machine”, a “nationalist authoritarian regime” that has only speeded up under Trump. And she believes the solution won’t necessarily come through the ballot box. She campaigned in a Senate race last year but she also favours Malcolm X-style direct action, up to and including breaking the law.“I am there to stand in support of folks whenever they go out there and protest. I saw these local activists in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, pull down a Confederate statue and it was the most fucking inspiring moment in my life to say the least.” They didn’t wait for permission, she says. And “by going outside the bounds, they changed the conversation”.But how far should you go? I ask. If the other side also takes direct action, won’t you have a complete breakdown of law and order?“Law and order is already broken down. That’s why there’s unrest. Whenever you have authoritarian power, centralised power that ends up affecting millions of people, you’ve already had a system breakdown.”Isn’t this like advocating for armed revolution? I ask. For civil unrest?“Well, I mean violent acts are happening to us all the time. It’s a question of self-defence… Whenever people are advocating for or alluding to ethnic cleansing, any time you’re discussing the possibility of an entire group being suppressed, or removed from society, that is violence.”In June, Manning ran (and was defeated) in the Democratic Senate Primary in Maryland. Her campaign offered a radical agenda that included proposals to abolish border controls and the prison system and she went “door to door, listening”, an experience that drove her “closer and closer to being on the edge of really deep, dark depression…”There was an incident, wasn’t there, I say. I’d hesitated to bring it up, but she confirms that there was, that she’d been exhausted and had tweeted a photo of herself on the ledge of a building. It was quickly deleted and there followed a message that she was with friends and safe. She’d attempted suicide twice in prison but it’s shocking to realise this was in May, just a few months ago.It was at an army field base that Manning took the decision she did. In the US, she says, her job had been “abstract math”. It was only when she was posted to Iraq that she understood properly that the numbers represented people. She realised her world entailed “not just database records. These are human beings. Their hopes and dreams and desires are all tied up in this.”There’s a record of her mental state at the time in the logs of chats that she had with a hacker, Adrian Lamo, whom she met on an online forum. They were later published in Wired magazine, though she can’t confirm these conversations or talk about them for legal reasons – the material was reclassified after the trial – but they’re a compelling read, especially with the knowledge that, unknown to her, Lamo was working with the FBI and would later turn her in.In their chat, she refers to watching the video that she leaked to WikiLeaks, which WikiLeaks in turn released to the world under the title “Collateral Murder”, that shows a bird’s-eye view of US soldiers shooting a group of Iraqis, which turned out to include a pair of Reuters journalists. “I don’t know,” she told Lamo. “I’m just weird I guess. I can’t separate myself, others. I feel connected to everybody… like they were distant family. I… care?”When I suggest she lacks a layer of skin, Manning says matter of factly: “I mean I have empathy. That’s what it is.” It’s a quality that’s in short supply in Silicon Valley, I point out. “I think there’s a culture that discourages it,” she says. I wonder what her take is on its notorious gender imbalance, having worked in tech as both a man and a woman. How has she found the tech bros?“I’m trans. I was trans before and I’m trans now. But when I was presenting as male, I was still very feminine so there was always that issue that I was never good enough. I was never male enough to be widely accepted. And now that I’m presenting as female the same issues are there.”Not fitting in has been the defining feature of Manning’s life. She spent four years in Haverfordwest, not fitting in as a teenager, when her Welsh mother returned home to the UK after orcing her father, though she appreciated certain aspects of her Welsh comprehensive school. “I learned things that weren’t talked about in America. The civil rights movement is glossed over in most American textbooks.”It’s striking, I say, reading the Lamo logs, just how alone she was. It took a year for me to get Christopher Wylie on the record to talk about Cambridge Analytica, I tell her, partly because it was a matter of finding the right support for him, whereas she undertook this incredibly bold and brave move entirely alone.“I wasn’t isolated,” she shoots back. “There were 30 people on my base.” Perhaps, but it’s not what she said in the online chats at the time. “I’ve created a massive mess,” she tells Lamo. “I’m very isolated atm… lost all of my emotional support channels… family, boyfriend, trusting colleagues… I’m a mess.” The 30 people on her base are described at the time as “trigger-happy rednecks” and “the only safe place I seem to have is this satellite internet connection”.Some have questioned whether Assange was directing her as to what to look for, what to leak, which may be another reason why she’s shying away from the question, just as at the ICA-hosted Q\u0026ampA she avoids a question from the audience about whether she still supports him. What strikes me reading the conversations with Lamo is the sheer psychic weight of the secrets she was carrying: Her personal secrets state secrets America’s secrets. She tells Lamo she’d sent her superior a photograph of herself dressed as a woman and was waiting to be sent back to the States – “all while witnessing the world freak out as its most intimate secrets are revealed”.It reminds me of the 1970s feminist slogan, the personal is the political, but Manning rejects it. “I don’t want to make that connection. I didn’t leak because I’m trans. That’s not it. But certainly the values that I have have been shaped by who I am and there’s a connection with that.”Manning’s accompanying note to the leak said that she wanted to illuminate the “fog of war”. She wanted to “reveal the truth of 21st-century asymmetric warfare”, a term we now understand I say, because it’s what Russia is waging on us.“Right. Election interference. The United States has been doing this in Latin America for decades.”Is it blowback? “Everyone’s got a little dirt on their hands, so I’m hesitant to say that this is coming from Russia when other countries are doing this. Across the board, election interference is not good.”Manning doesn’t like the word “whistleblower”. It makes political change seem like an exclusive club, she says. She wants everyone “to realise they have political agency”. The problem the world has now, she says, “is not an information problem, it’s an action problem”. Just as trans issues now have “more visibility. But visibility is not the same as equality.” We know what’s going on, she says, in politics, in technology. We’re just not doing enough about it.It slightly amazes me that there haven’t been more whistleblowers from inside the tech industry, I say. “That will change,” Manning says. She believes the tech community, the developers, will recognise their power, their responsibility. At the same time, she offers a chilling vision of where we’re heading with artificial intelligence, of systems that are already beyond our control.“There is something really deep going on inside machine-learning systems, especially neural network-type machine learning… I’ve started to think of algorithms as primitive living entities. When I work with neural networks I get this chilling feeling. They’re acting like inorganic life forms.”Manning is still feeling out her new role in the world. She movingly describes the 300,000 letters of support she received in prison (another 220,000 were sent, as part of an Amnesty International campaign, to Obama, asking for her release), support that she’s attempting to pay forward now, though she still seems a singular, lone figure.While waiting to go on stage to host a Q\u0026ampA session at the ICA, I tell her that a friend of mine, Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a Swiss mathematician who paved the way in investigating Cambridge Analytica, sent her a book in prison. It was on the Riemann hypothesis – an unsolved theorem about the distribution of prime numbers – and though we’ve just been discussing how exhausted she is after a 14-hour day, her eyes light up. “That was such an important book to me! I’m obsessed with prime numbers.” It’s the most animated I’ve seen her. “They’re magical, impossible to predict, you can’t build an algorithm to detect them, but they’re in nature. Nature understands prime numbers.” They’re also, she points out, important in cryptography. To secrets. They underpin encryption technology.It’s a fascination Manning shares with Assange. With Dehaye. With the keepers of secrets and the leakers of secrets. Manning can’t or won’t look back can’t or won’t imagine other lives or other decisions hasn’t yet processed the impact of her actions on the world. But for a moment, there’s a glimpse of another Manning. A private inidual with a private life doing nerdy things with numbers. Because she didn’t just make the US’s secrets public, she made her own life public. And she, us, we’re grappling with that still."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb79e243e6ed477a7ed7a871bb402b7668c79eb8/0_32_1136_682/master/1136.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=296fb3b0105b9a6e719593bbb72b5e64","title":"pyongyang female defectors south korean wives","story":"Dating had never been easy for Kim Jeong-soon. In her native North Korea, couples holding hands were chastised for “disturbing public order”, and when she arrived in South Korea potential suitors were often repelled by the mere fact of the country of her birth.It was with a certain reservation, then, that she went on a blind date with a South Korean man three years ago Kim Jong-il – whose name in the south is pronounced slightly differently to the late North Korean dictator. They dined on fried chicken and beer and launched right into conversations about marriage, orce and what a future together might look like. “South Korean men are more attentive and considerate compared with North Korean men, and they’re also more friendly,” Kim said. “But I was really surprised when I first saw the way South Korean men dressed … in some ways they seemed to care about fashion more than women.”Six months after that first date they were married. Not only was it a cause for celebration for them, it was another success story for the woman who arranged their meeting. Han Yoo-jin has helped about 300 couples marry since she started her matchmaking company, Love Storya, four years ago. Amid a skewed gender ratio, cultural differences and a desire among many North Korean refugees for a sense of security in their adopted home, an industry has sprung up catering for lonely South Korean men and North Korean women interested in marriage.Han’s own relationship makes her the literal poster child for her business. She met her South Korean husband at a party for prospective clients, and photos of the two on their wedding day fill her company’s website. Her service is part matchmaker, part therapist because frequently mediates conflicts between couples, sometimes even after their wedding.“There’s an old saying, ‘If you manage to get three couples married, then you go to heaven’, which shows how challenging it is for two people to get married,” said Han.“In South Korea, people are taught to think North Koreans are all bad people, and I thought something really bad would happen to me for engaging with a North Korean,” said Hong, who started his matchmaking firm in 2006 after marrying Ju Jeong-ok, a North Korean woman.“There are concerns that these women may be excessively commercialised,” said Kim Soo-kyung, a research fellow at the government-funded Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul. She analysed marketing practices by marriage brokers and was dismayed by the overemphasis on “pure Korean blood” in describing advantages, and how women were portrayed as submissive. “I’m worried this will lead to the public perceiving North Korean women as sexual objects, rather than iniduals.”North and South Korea have been ided since the end of the Korean War (1950-53), and except for about a decade ending in 2008, relations between the two have remained frosty. The two nations technically remain in a state of war, since a peace treaty was never signed.\u0026nbspThere have been occasional outbreaks of violence, most recently in 2010 when 50 people were killed when a South Korean navy corvette was sunk and several islands close to the border were attacked.This meeting\u0026nbspcould touch on a formal truce\u0026nbspbut this is also not the first time North Korea has expressed a willingness to abandon its nuclear ambitions. A deal with the US, Japan and South Korea in the 1990s was meant to give the North civilian nuclear power without the ability to build a weapon, but the reactor was never finished.North Korea\u0026nbsppledged to relinquish its nuclear programme\u0026nbspin 2007 in exchange for sanctions relief and fuel, but later pulled out of that agreement and expelled inspectors in 2009.Read a full explainer on the Korea summit hereHan’s story speaks to this concern. She left North Korea at the insistence of her grandmother, who fled across the border to China during the 1950-53 Korean war and lamented the limited opportunities available for women in her home country. Han’s aunt served as a cautionary tale. She studied physics and envisioned a career building weapons for the north’s nuclear programme, Han said, but became a housewife after graduation.It is this deeply entrenched patriarchy that has been instrumental south of the border in portraying North Korean women as dutiful wives fulfilling traditional gender roles, “like how things were in the south in the 60s and 70s”, Han said.North Korean women tend to prefer financially stable men – those with bad credit are screened out – and “bigger men, ones that look a bit like Kim Jong-un”, Han said with a smile.After three failed escape attempts, – each time receiving increasingly harsh punishments in one of the north’s infamous labour camps – Han arrived in South Korea in 2001. She worked as a highway toll collector and then in a string of matchmaking firms before striking out on her own.She is confident that her business will endure despite the proliferation of apps such as Tinder. “North Korean refugees prefer handling things face-to-face,” she said, adding that most were deeply sceptical of technology, and concerned about revealing even mundane personal details online.Additional reporting by Kyungmi Choi"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ff3b70cd36d0fef3aa0c281bda67099b67ae651/0_12_5196_3117/master/5196.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3dcdd56faaa3aafbea4431d2c1c30feb","title":"paris cemetery dilapidated grave only for rich","story":"Shortage of space in city cemeteries means most Parisians are shipped to suburbs after deathEven the dead, it seems, cannot escape the rocketing property prices of Paris.A shortage of burial plots means the wealthy are being asked to stump up as much as €15,528 for a place in a city cemetery while the poor are being shipped out to the banlieues. Even fame and wealth, however, cannot guarantee a final resting place in one of Paris’s 14 inner-city cemeteries, such as Père Lachaise, where Chopin, Balzac, Oscar Wilde, Edith Piaf and Jim Morrison are interred.There are about 14,000 deaths in Paris every year, with 5,000 requests to be buried at city cemeteries. But authorities say there are now only 150 paid-for places available a year.A report by Cour des Comptes, the state auditors, last week declared Paris cemeteries “saturated”. “The freeing up of plots can only happen by taking back concessions that have expired and have not been renewed by the families, or, in the case of in-perpetuity concessions, when the tomb is in a state of abandonment,” it said. This was complicated by many of the old abandoned tombs, including many at Père Lachaise, being listed buildings, it added.Père Lachaise attracts two million visitors a year and contains 70,000 tombs and about a million bodies. Its paths are scattered with horse chestnuts and many older sepulchres are abandoned, their grand stone porticos, intricate carvings, statues and wrought-iron decorations dilapidated and rusty. Dozens of graves have crumbled into overgrown stones.Opened in 1804 on land acquired from Louis XIV’s confessor, after whom it was named, the site was not popular until Napoleon had the body of Louise de Lorraine, Henri III’s wife, moved there as well as the remains of the poet Jean de la Fontaine, the dramatist Molière, and celebrated lovers Héloise and Abelard. The grand mausoleums built before 1900 are listed and cannot be touched.The Cour said that city authorities should manage cemeteries “to allow everyone living in, dying in or having a tomb in Paris to be buried there”. It added: “The city is yet to set out its main objectives concerning the management of the cemeteries.”By law, each French commune must provide an inidual grave for every deceased person for a period of five years. After that, the bones can be removed to a general ossuary. The cemetery does not have to be within the commune, and authorities have established six cemeteries outside the city where most Parisians are buried.Pierre Larribe of France’s Confederation of Funeral Parlours said Parisian families were often shocked to discover they could not bury loved ones in the capital. “Plots in cemeteries in Paris intra muros are expensive because they are rare. This means concessions in cemeteries inside Paris are sold to those who have money and the poor are sent somewhere else. Now space is so rare even those who can afford it can’t always get a place unless they already have a family tomb. Paris city hall has chosen to overcome this by buying land so inhabitants can be buried outside Paris. This is a political choice and we don’t get involved, but it does lead to criticism that Paris has become elitist and doesn’t want its poor.”He added: “People are often surprised to learn this, but these things need to be discussed before death. Unfortunately, in France death is still a taboo subject.”Pénélope Komitès, the deputy mayor in charge of cemeteries, said Paris’s authorities were working on freeing more space but did not have the money to repair the abandoned tombs. She said city hall was seeking new legislation to allow it to take over abandoned graves and resell them as shorter-term concessions.She denied that the city was pushing the deceased poor to the suburbs. “Not at all. Historically, from the time of Napoleon when there was an increase in the population of Paris and consequently an increase in the number of dead, cemeteries were sited outside the city. Today, if you take the price of burial plots in other cities they are the same.“We are trying to find ways of ensuring people who are Paris residents can be buried in Paris.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10b38c78336e9074be3e612b0b548b3b33591922/0_100_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e5157aade808b14d28beb6245a595a1","title":"pro russian harmony tipped to be latvias largest party following election","story":"The pro-Kremlin Harmony party looked set to hold the balance of power in Latvia, following a general election on Saturday, with an exit poll showing it topping the vote ahead of liberals.“No coalition combination is possible without Harmony that would appear able and stable,” the Harmony chairman and Riga mayor, Nils Ušakovs, told the Leta agency. “Otherwise, you could have a coalition of xenophobes and gay rights supporters, and such a government would stick together for two or three weeks.”Popular with Latvia’s ethnic Russian minority, which makes up about a quarter of the country’s 1.9 million population, Harmony, formerly allied with United Russia, the party of the president, Vladimir Putin, won the largest number of votes in the last three elections. However, it never entered government as it failed to attract coalition partners.The final results of the vote are expected early on Sunday, with coalition talks to follow while the current parliament keeps working until November.The vote was tarnished by a hacker attack on the Draugiem.lv social network, second in popularity only to Facebook in the Baltic state, which displayed a pro-Russian message.“Comrades Latvians, this concerns you. The borders of Russia have no end,” it said in Russian, followed by images of unmarked Russian soldiers in green uniforms annexing Crimea, Russian tanks parading in Moscow and a smirking Putin.Analysts predicted Harmony, which has signed on some high-profile ethnic Latvians as their frontrunners, might join forces with populists to govern.KPV LV, a populist party led by former stage actor Artuss Kaimiņš, is a potential coalition partner.And the party’s candidate for prime minister, lawyer Aldis Gobzems, recently suggested they were open to working with other parties.“KPV LV can work with anybody, we don’t have any red lines regarding any other political force,” Gobzems said during a TV24 debate."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3651688.1538811602!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fintan o toole john bull not michel barnier is undermining the union","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNorthern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster, earlier this week: the image of the “blood red line” was not in good taste, but it was revealing. Photograph: Chris RatcliffeBloombergArlene Foster spoke this week about the DUP’s “blood red line” of avoiding any post-Brexit differences between Northern Ireland and Britain. The image was not in good taste, but it was revealing. When politicians resort to such overheated rhetoric, it is usually because they know deep down that they are protesting too much.To really understand the hysteria about “the territorial integrity of the union”, we have to understand that it is not about what it seems to be about. Beneath the surface of anxiety about the EU’s Brexit proposals is a deep pool of panic about the union itself. For even the DUP must know that the blood red line of Britishness is now a thin red line. It has been worn away, not by the EU, but by the English. The union is being undermined, not by Michel Barnier, but by John Bull.

She told her mother she would be home on Friday.On Friday night there was no sign of Jessie. ‘We thought she must have missed the last train,’ her mother Valerie says. ‘But in the morning there was still no phone call.

TechBritish security services have spoken out about claims that China managed to plant tiny chips in computers that made their way across the US.The bombshell report came from Bloomberg News this week and alleged that special agents in the People\u0027s Liberation Army had dropped tiny components into computer hardware before it left the country. It would eventually go on to be used by companies including Amazon, Apple and many others, as well as the US defence establishment.Such a hack would allow spies to look in on messages being sent across Apple\u0027s cloud services, for instance, and intercept messages as soon as they are sent. And a hardware breakthrough of that kind would mark a step change in the kind of hacks that are possible, since they could not be easily found or fixed.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 43Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Designed by Pierpaolo Lazzarini from Italian company Jet Capsule.

The National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of UK spy agency GCHQ, said that it agreed with those denials from the two companies.Apple and Amazon deny report they were hit by huge Chinese hack“We aware of the media reports but at this stage have no reason to doubt the detailed assessments made by AWS and Apple, an\u0026nbspNCSC\u0026nbspspokesperson said.“The NCSC engages confidentially with security researchers and urges anybody with credible intelligence about these reports to contact us.”The denial came after Apple and Amazon – the two companies named in the report – both emphatically rejected the content of the report. They both said they were unaware of the claims and had undertaken detailed investigations to find any chips and had discovered nothing.Apple even published a special page on its website, under the title What Businessweek got wrong about Apple, that took all of the claims on in detail. It said on that page that there is no truth to these claims, that it never found malicious chips, and that its contacts in law enforcement had not heard of such a case either.As we have previously informed Bloomberg, this is completely untrue, Apple concluded.\u0026nbspApple has never found malicious chips in our servers.Finally, in response to questions we have received from other news organisations since Businessweek published its story, we are not under any kind of gag order or other confidentiality obligations.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

This is their victory and nothing to do with any politicians, despite what they might have you believe\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentUnilever had planned to consolidate its headquarters at its base in RotterdamPoliticians of varying stripes were quick to jump on marmite maker Unilever’s decision to abandon plans to pull its headquarters out of London, and its shares out of the FTSE 100, and no wonder. It’s created quite the froth.\u0026nbspBut let’s be quite clear: This is not their victory, whatever their stripe.\u0026nbspIt is not down to London mayor\u0026nbspSadiq Kahn and it has nothing to do with any efforts made by Theresa May’s Tory Government. As for the ramshackle army of gloating Brexiteers? They can belt up too.\u0026nbspUnilever scraps plans to move HQ from London to RotterdamLegal \u0026amp General vows to vote against Unilever’s planned Dutch moveThis was, in point of fact, a battle fought and won through the prosaic virtue\u0026nbspof responsible engagement and activism by big City institutions acting\u0026nbspin the interests of the people who invest with them, which is not something that they always do.\u0026nbspUnilever moving its headquarters out of the UK and abandoning its dual headed Anglo-Dutch corporate structure would have seen it ejected from both the FTSE 100 and the FTSE All Share indices.\u0026nbspThat\u0026nbspwould have forced funds run by the likes Legal \u0026amp General, Standard Life, Aviva and others, to sell up (full disclosure, I have\u0026nbspfunds that track FTSE\u0026nbspindices\u0026nbspand Unilever’s presence within them thus benefits me) because of the rules they operate under.\u0026nbspAs a result, there would have been an awful lot of stock hitting the market in a short time, which would have depressed the selling price. But Unilever’s London exit - a Lexit? - would also have deprived their funds of a high quality, well run, company\u0026nbspa reliable performer with a reliable idend that is\u0026nbspthe sort of hardy perennial every investor needs.\u0026nbspIt was thus very much in the interests of the\u0026nbspclients of London institutions\u0026nbspfor them to say no, and for them to do so publicly, as a number of big fund managers did (but not, sadly, BlackRock, a heavy hitting index\u0026nbsptracker manager).This left Unilever, which needed to secure the support of 75 per cent of its UK shareholders, facing a potentially embarrassing defeat.\u0026nbspIn the City you don’t hold a vote you can’t win if you can help it, so it sensibly withdrew.\u0026nbspNot happily, mind. The statement it issued explaining the decision had\u0026nbspthe feeling of a Scooby Doo style “we’d have got away with it if it weren’t for those meddling kids”.I imagine there will be some strained conversations between a board that robustly defended the plan - “guided by the opportunity to unlock value for our shareholders by creating a stronger, simpler and more competitive Unilever” - and investors over the coming months.\u0026nbspShareholder value was clearly not the sole issue in bringing this forward, however.\u0026nbspForget Brexit. Going Dutch would have made it much harder for the likes of Kraft Foods to come forward with opportunistic, and bad, bids in future because of the regulations in that country. Remember, Unilever only narrowly avoided getting taken out by Kraft last year.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

But they posit that the largest contributory factor is a misallocation of resources, notably the “crowding out” of other industries which causes those industries to wither and die over time.In the UK, the\u0026nbspvast sums of money being created as banking, fund managers and other financial businesses boomed\u0026nbsphas created a brain drain that pulled people from other industries.In the 30 years following Margaret Thatcher’s deregulation of the City in the mid-1980s, financial workers were overpaid by around £280bn, when compared to people of a similar educational background in other jobs, according to the research. Meanwhile, financial services firms reaped an estimated £400bn in excess profits.City of London criticised for giving award to Turkish president’s wifeMcDonnell offers City bosses role in Labour policy makingMay warns EU: Keep City in Brexit trade deal or ‘hurt your economies’Corbyn vows to strip City of London of dominance in British economyBrexit: City of London suffers ‘alarming’ drop in job vacanciesTheresa May says City of London should be ‘optimistic’ about BrexitThese booming profits and salaries pushed up the relative value of the UK’s currency, making manufactured goods and agricultural products more expensive to overseas buyers. Because the price of those goods is set internationally some businesses in those sectors have become less competitive or even unviable.\u0026nbsp“Too much finance” also inflicts the costs of recurrent crises, which the study puts at £1.8 trillion between 1995 and 2015.Professor Andrew Baker, co-author of the report and professorial fellow at the University of Sheffield, said the numbers hint at a “deep underlying problem” caused by the UK’s financial sector.“UK economic strategy in a post-Brexit world needs to make addressing this the central challenge, recognising that where finance is concerned, more can sometimes be less, and less could be more,” he said.John Christensen, a director at the Tax Justice Network who helped develop the framework for the research, witnessed the effects of the “finance curse” in his former role as economic adviser to the island of Jersey.“This new evidence overturns the entrenched orthodoxy that what is good for the City of London must be good for the rest of Britain,” Mr Christensen said.“For decades City interests have been inflicting a finance curse on the UK economy, inflating the exchange rate, slowing growth of the productive sectors, and lobbying governments into deregulating financial services, which led directly to the 2008 banking crisis.\u0026nbsp“UK productivity has fallen dramatically behind most EU member states, and excess household and corporate debt is holding back growth.”Created with Sketch.Biggest business scandals in pictures  Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.121 Barclays CEO under investigation for trying to identify whistleblower - Monday Paril 10Authorities have launched an investigation into Barclays chief executive officer Jes Staley for trying to identify a whistleblower, the bank said on Monday.221 UK to crack down on bank money laundering after reports of £65bn Russian scam, City minister says -  March 2017The Economic Secretary to the Treasury has vowed that the Government will crack down on money laundering practices, after several of the UK\u0027s biggest banks were accused of processing money from a Russian scam, believed to involve up to $80bn (£65bn).321 Former HBOS bankers convicted of bribery and fraud over £245m loan scam - February 2017Two former HBOS bankers were among six people found guilty of bribery and fraud that cost customers and shareholders hundreds of millions of pounds, the BBC reports.421 Former Reckitt Benckiser executive linked to death of 100 people in South Korea jailed for seven years - Friday January 6 A former South Korean executive of UK-based Reckitt Benckiser has been jailed for seven years over the sale of a humidifier disinfectant that killed about 100 people and left hundreds with permanent lung damage.A French court cut the damages owed by rogue trader Jerome Kerviel from €4.9bn (£4.2bn) to just €1m (£860,000). 621 Lloyds chief apologises for damage caused by affair allegations - August 2016 Antonio Horta-Osorio, the chief executive of Lloyds Bank, has broken his silence over allegations about his private life admitting he regrets any damage done to the group\u0027s reputation.The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Christine Lagarde, must stand trial in France over a payment of €403 million (now £340m, then £290m) to tycoon Bernard Tapie, a France\u0027s highest appeals court has ruled.821 HSBC senior manager arrested in FX rigging investigation at JFK airport in New York - July 2016A senior executive at HSBC has been arrested at New York\u0027s JFK airport for his alleged involvement in a conspiracy to rig currency benchmarks, according to reports.921 Former PwC employees found guilty in \u0027Luxleaks\u0027 tax scandal - June 2016Two ex- PricewaterhouseCoopers staffers were found guilty in Luxembourg of stealing confidential tax files that helped unleash a global scandal over generous fiscal deals for hundreds of international companies.1021 Goldman Sachs dealmakers lavished Libyan officials with prostitutes to win contract - June 2016 A former Goldman Sachs dealmaker trying to persuade Gadaffi-era Libya to invest $1 billion with the investment bank procured prostitutes and invited Libyan officials to lavish parties in the hope of winning the business, the High Court heard on Monday June 13.The Libyan Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund is suing Goldman Sachs for inappropriately coercing its naïve staff into giving its sovereign wealth fund cash to the bank to invest in products they did not understand.

You have the unemployment rate down to levels last seen in the late 1960s to early 1970s. Wage growth remains consistent with the Fed’s expectations at about 3 percent. Barring any shocks to the economy, we expect them to raise rates in December.”Last month the Federal Reserve raised rates to 2-2.25 per cent, its third hike of 2018 and projections by policymakers signalled one further quarter point rate hike later this year, followed by three in 2019 and another three in 2020.The BLS said the September jobs gains came in professional and business services, health care, transportation and warehousing.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But they posit that the largest contributory factor is a misallocation of resources, notably the “crowding out” of other industries which causes those industries to wither and die over time.In the UK, the\u0026nbspvast sums of money being created as banking, fund managers and other financial businesses boomed\u0026nbsphas created a brain drain that pulled people from other industries.In the 30 years following Margaret Thatcher’s deregulation of the City in the mid-1980s, financial workers were overpaid by around £280bn, when compared to people of a similar educational background in other jobs, according to the research. Meanwhile, financial services firms reaped an estimated £400bn in excess profits.City of London criticised for giving award to Turkish president’s wifeMcDonnell offers City bosses role in Labour policy makingMay warns EU: Keep City in Brexit trade deal or ‘hurt your economies’Corbyn vows to strip City of London of dominance in British economyBrexit: City of London suffers ‘alarming’ drop in job vacanciesTheresa May says City of London should be ‘optimistic’ about BrexitThese booming profits and salaries pushed up the relative value of the UK’s currency, making manufactured goods and agricultural products more expensive to overseas buyers. Because the price of those goods is set internationally some businesses in those sectors have become less competitive or even unviable.\u0026nbsp“Too much finance” also inflicts the costs of recurrent crises, which the study puts at £1.8 trillion between 1995 and 2015.Professor Andrew Baker, co-author of the report and professorial fellow at the University of Sheffield, said the numbers hint at a “deep underlying problem” caused by the UK’s financial sector.“UK economic strategy in a post-Brexit world needs to make addressing this the central challenge, recognising that where finance is concerned, more can sometimes be less, and less could be more,” he said.John Christensen, a director at the Tax Justice Network who helped develop the framework for the research, witnessed the effects of the “finance curse” in his former role as economic adviser to the island of Jersey.“This new evidence overturns the entrenched orthodoxy that what is good for the City of London must be good for the rest of Britain,” Mr Christensen said.“For decades City interests have been inflicting a finance curse on the UK economy, inflating the exchange rate, slowing growth of the productive sectors, and lobbying governments into deregulating financial services, which led directly to the 2008 banking crisis.\u0026nbsp“UK productivity has fallen dramatically behind most EU member states, and excess household and corporate debt is holding back growth.”Created with Sketch.Biggest business scandals in pictures  Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.121 Barclays CEO under investigation for trying to identify whistleblower - Monday Paril 10Authorities have launched an investigation into Barclays chief executive officer Jes Staley for trying to identify a whistleblower, the bank said on Monday.221 UK to crack down on bank money laundering after reports of £65bn Russian scam, City minister says -  March 2017The Economic Secretary to the Treasury has vowed that the Government will crack down on money laundering practices, after several of the UK\u0027s biggest banks were accused of processing money from a Russian scam, believed to involve up to $80bn (£65bn).321 Former HBOS bankers convicted of bribery and fraud over £245m loan scam - February 2017Two former HBOS bankers were among six people found guilty of bribery and fraud that cost customers and shareholders hundreds of millions of pounds, the BBC reports.421 Former Reckitt Benckiser executive linked to death of 100 people in South Korea jailed for seven years - Friday January 6 A former South Korean executive of UK-based Reckitt Benckiser has been jailed for seven years over the sale of a humidifier disinfectant that killed about 100 people and left hundreds with permanent lung damage.A French court cut the damages owed by rogue trader Jerome Kerviel from €4.9bn (£4.2bn) to just €1m (£860,000). 621 Lloyds chief apologises for damage caused by affair allegations - August 2016 Antonio Horta-Osorio, the chief executive of Lloyds Bank, has broken his silence over allegations about his private life admitting he regrets any damage done to the group\u0027s reputation.The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Christine Lagarde, must stand trial in France over a payment of €403 million (now £340m, then £290m) to tycoon Bernard Tapie, a France\u0027s highest appeals court has ruled.821 HSBC senior manager arrested in FX rigging investigation at JFK airport in New York - July 2016A senior executive at HSBC has been arrested at New York\u0027s JFK airport for his alleged involvement in a conspiracy to rig currency benchmarks, according to reports.921 Former PwC employees found guilty in \u0027Luxleaks\u0027 tax scandal - June 2016Two ex- PricewaterhouseCoopers staffers were found guilty in Luxembourg of stealing confidential tax files that helped unleash a global scandal over generous fiscal deals for hundreds of international companies.1021 Goldman Sachs dealmakers lavished Libyan officials with prostitutes to win contract - June 2016 A former Goldman Sachs dealmaker trying to persuade Gadaffi-era Libya to invest $1 billion with the investment bank procured prostitutes and invited Libyan officials to lavish parties in the hope of winning the business, the High Court heard on Monday June 13.The Libyan Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund is suing Goldman Sachs for inappropriately coercing its naïve staff into giving its sovereign wealth fund cash to the bank to invest in products they did not understand.

He returned to the UK in December 2012 and was arrested following a two-and-a-half year criminal investigation by the SFO.To solve the problem we must loosen the City of London’s “leaden grip on our economy” by strengthening regulation and increasing taxes on the financial\u0026nbspsector, Mr Christensen said.This will free up local businesses and allow hardworking citizens to prosper and flourish, he added.City of LondonShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Nick Johannsen\u0026nbspexplains how even urgent action may not be enough to\u0026nbspsave this stately beastClick to followThe IndependentThe fungus causes leaf loss, lesions in the wood and on the bark, and ultimately the dieback of the tree\u0027s crownAs a child growing up in East Anglia, two mighty elm trees were anchors in my world.\u0026nbspEven more feral than my own children, wherever we wandered above the Dedham Vale, two gigantic elm trees signalled home. Without warning these beautiful twins were quickly and ruthlessly cut down by Dutch elm disease. Our welcoming elms became giant, gloomy monoliths, quickly felled, logged and stacked.\u0026nbspDutch elm disease was good for the chainsaw and log stove market. Across Britain there ensued the removal of dead and dying elms on a drastic scale, which created a dramatic diminishment of much loved landscapes. In my own East Anglian clay land, the change was appalling, lanes which were once tunnels of cathedral-like elm trees became scrappy hedges field trees felled and not replaced, woods completely altered, the landscapes changed forever. When my father died nearly 40 years later he had not finished burning the logs he cut and stacked even from our tiny farm.And now for ash, perhaps our most graceful tree, the die seems cast. Ash dieback was first recorded in Britain in 2012, although there is speculation that it\u0026nbspwas here years before. Also known as\u0026nbspHymenoscyphus fraxineus, is a fungal pathogen and a most serious disease of ash trees. It\u0026nbspis stealthier than Dutch elm the death of ash trees is slower: there are moments of apparent recovery, but the eventual decline seems irrecoverable. The estimates are that between 95 per cent and 98 per cent of our ash trees are threatened\u0026nbspthis would seem to be borne out by what we are witnessing in some of the ash dominated woodlands in east Kent.The strange story of Sheffield’s tree massacreSo great is the threat that common ash (Fraxinus excelsior), the everyday tree of our streets, hedges and woodlands, is now listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List.\u0026nbspAsh dieback was first identified in Europe in Poland, in 1992, where it is believed that it arrived on commercially imported ash from East Asia. In its native Asia, the fungus will have co-evolved with the Asian species of ash, on which it therefore has limited\u0026nbspimpact European ash has far less immunity.\u0026nbspThe fungus lives in the leaf litter and has a delicate if peculiar beauty. Thousands of airborne spores are released and can disperse naturally on the wind over tens of kilometres. Continual cycles of infection and reinfection from the leaf litter below produce trees punch drunk with pathogen.\u0026nbspAsh dieback is well described: the effect of the fungus is to block the water transport systems in trees causing leaf loss, lesions in the wood and on the bark, and ultimately the dieback of the crown of the tree. Young trees succumb quickly in older trees the decline can take between six\u0026nbspto 20 years. When the fight is lost, the weakened tree succumbs or is attacked and ultimately killed by another pest or pathogen. The elegant, luxuriant deep green of a late summer venerable ash is reduced to a threadbare tangle of branches and twigs. Desperate new “epicormic”\u0026nbspgrowth emerging from the trunk and branches changes the form and elegance of the tree, once more diminishing our landscapes.An ash tree is a whole ecology: almost 1,000 species use ash as a habitat, including wood mice, liverworts, wrens, blue tits, bats, lichens, fungi and beetles. Bullfinches will eat ash keys in winter when food is scarce. The caterpillars of many kinds of moth feed on ash leaves.\u0026nbspMany lichens are hosted by ash. Lichens are not a parasite and they do not feed off the tree, but use it as a support. According to Oliver Rackham, author of the brilliant book The Ash Tree, the ash is the last refuge of many declining tree lichens, especially those that once grew on elms before they fell victim to loss of habitat through Dutch elm disease. King Alfred’s Cakes (Daldinia concentrica) are specific to ash, and a number of beetles that live only on this fungus are dependent solely on ash for survival.It is true to say that some ash trees appear to be able to resist or tolerate infection. There is a significant scientific effort going into studying the genetic factors which make this possible so that tolerant ash trees can be bred for the future. Interesting and exciting developments in the science are occurring all of the time and the Living Ash Project reports big steps in collecting, grafting and growing from trees that are identified as being “putatively tolerant to ash dieback”.\u0026nbspDespite the extent of devastation already witnessed elsewhere in Europe and in certain parts of Britain, scientists from the Earlham Institute have found an incredibly limited genetic ersity in the fungus. It would seem that the original infection in European ash may have come from just one or two mushroom-like fruiting bodies.\u0026nbspAccording to the Natural History Museum the ersity of the fungus found across Europe is just an eighth of that found in a single Japanese woodland, so is likely to be a just a tiny fraction of that found across Asia. Imagine what might happen if more of that Asian genetic ersity is brought into Europe.The ash dieback story is bleak, but\u0026nbspfor the beleaguered ash tree\u0026nbspanother\u0026nbspperhaps even more serious\u0026nbspthreat approaches from another invasive species with its own surprising beauty. The Emerald Ash Borer beetle, again a native of Asia, was imported accidentally to North America, thought to have been\u0026nbspon something as apparently innocent as wooden packing material. The impact in North America has been widespread and devastating, killing hundreds of millions of trees since the 1990s.\u0026nbspEmerald Ash Borer has now been found in Russia and is moving westwards and southwards at a rate of around 25 miles a year.The extreme vulnerability of our trees to imported pests and diseases is most dramatically illustrated by the loss of elm and ash. Our trees have such long lives our treescapes take such a long time to recover from these attacks that managing the risk of importing further diseases and pests must be a critical issue for the future.\u0026nbspThere are a wide variety of other tree diseases, which are known threats:\u0026nbspwhile many websites have listings of the top things to do, see or visit, rather sadly the Forestry Commission website has a list of “top tree diseases”.Ash dieback is just one of a list of 14 top diseases, and the borer beetle one of the eight\u0026nbsptop pests.\u0026nbspThe loss of a single beautiful tree can be felt deeply and personally we face the loss of hundreds of millions of trees from Britain’s treescapes, the forces for change are enormous and the response should be in equal measure.Earlier this year the government produced a 25-year plan for the environment, an ambitious initiative that\u0026nbsphas signalled a strong intent to leave the environment in a better state than it was found. The “at a glance”\u0026nbspsummary includes the need to protect our many plants, trees and wildlife species in its very first line. One of the first, most tangible early outputs of the plan is the Tree Health Resilience Strategy. The strategy sets out an integrated approach, which seeks to significantly strengthen biosecurity in\u0026nbspprocurement and practice, deploy the best science and evidence to understand and respond to the risks in an informed way and to increase the extent, connectivity, ersity and condition of our trees and woodlands.The strategy recognises that there is a real need to increase the resistance of our treescapes so that there is no further substantial change or loss, and to support the recovery and adaptation of our landscapes in what will inevitably be a most difficult future.There is a scientific, technical and conservation response to ash dieback and it is vital that there is, but what is the cultural response?\u0026nbspWhat about the little boy who lost his elm trees and is now working to try to conserve and enhance the Kent Downs, one of Britain’s finest and most ash dominated landscapes what is the emotional response?\u0026nbspA fully grown ash can reach a height of 35 metres and can live to 400 years or more. The trees can be easily recognised by their\u0026nbspblack buds and clusters of seeds – which can be a menace for gardeners proud of their lawns. Native to Europe, Africa and Asia, ash is dominant in many parts of the UK and provides the perfect habitat for various wildflowers on the woodland floor, as well as numerous bird species which\u0026nbspnest in its branches. In days gone by the ash was believed to have healing properties – in Viking mythology it was known as the ‘tree of life’.The hills and valleys of this enchanting quarter of Kent are punctuated by ash, our most common tree. Ash is intrinsic to the place, it is in the names of the villages, towns and woodlands one of the most affected woods has two names, Asholt Wood and Ashley Wood a single remarkable ash tree is marked on the Ordnance Survey map for Ashford.\u0026nbspWe expect that we will lose almost all of our ash trees and so we feel that it is vital that we record and celebrate what we have before it might be lost. We want to do this in extraordinary and enduring ways so that we connect more with our trees and treescapes and provide a record for the future. For elm, Gerald Wilkinson wrote Epitaph for The Elm. Hastily put together and almost too late to record fine elm trees in the landscape, it is a saddening record.\u0026nbspOur idea is to salute the tree, as well as mark the loss.\u0026nbspThe Ash Project, which is funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Arts Council of England, combines a major new sculptural commission by internationally recognised artists Ackroyd \u0026amp Harvey with a wide-ranging programme of walks, talks and exhibitions.\u0026nbspWe have created a temporary archive that records both the extraordinary utility of ash and celebrates ordinary ash objects that we all might know.The Ash Archive involves\u0026nbspexisting objects and art works and new commissions across a range of art forms, and the public is invited to add to a growing, collectively generated collection. Our approach has been to collaborate across conservation and scientific research work to develop new languages with this massive environmental change. It is our hope that, through the Ash Project, we will preserve our memories of the tree for the generations who will live with the loss.The cultural celebration is also supported by a collaboration with the Woodland Trust and a number of Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in which ash is dominant, to work with author Archie Miles to publish a monograph. Titled Ash, this new publication pays tribute to the ash tree in all of its glorious manifestations across the landscapes of the UK. The book, on sale now,\u0026nbspis a loving homage to the ash tree.On a practical basis we are working with a wide variety of organisations to support a Kent-wide plan for landscape restoration. We have produced guidance for landowners in order to plan wide scale recovery and to ensure we retain much of the bioersity that ash supports, but surely more must be done across the country to prevent further landscape and environmental loss.Campaign plants trees every time Trump tweets about climate changeHere’s why we’re planting trees in northern SyriaCouncil ‘reliant on police’ to carry out tree-felling workAs the summer wanes the impact of ash dieback is at its greatest. At this time of year in Kent we see the ink-like blackening of the leaves of affected trees, with leaf fall occurring as much as a month or two earlier than it should, bringing the bleakness of winter to the landscape all too soon.It is in this season that we have chosen to present Ash to Ash\u0026nbsp– a monumental art work by Ackroyd\u0026nbsp\u0026amp\u0026nbspHarvey. Standing high on the scarp of the Kent Downs, two giant monoliths stand proud, almost defiant. One the bright white of newly cut ash wood, the other charred and blackened like the inky leaves of an affected tree. These extraordinary pieces, made from ash dieback stricken trees, are pierced by more than 10,000 arrows, handmade from coppiced ash. They act as marker trees, on the edge of the North Downs Way.\u0026nbspOverlooking a landscape already damaged by ash dieback, they will be a striking reminder of all that we stand to lose. Unlike the giant elm monoliths of my childhood, this extraordinary artwork both memorialises and celebrates the ash.\u0026nbspIn Kent and East Anglia the impact of ash dieback is already, in places, devastating.\u0026nbspThis seems likely to be the story across the country over the next 10 to 15 years.Ash is perhaps most closely associated with some of our most valued landscapes, the Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and National Parks. Places such as\u0026nbspthe Cotswolds, Chilterns, High Weald, Lake District, Dorset, Yorkshire Dales, White Peak and Snowdonia are, in part, defined by their relationship with the ash tree, there is a great need to document and celebrate these landscapes also.We plan to take the work\u0026nbspwe have started in Kent to a national platform, to collaborate across Britain with landscape managers, artists, scientists and ecologists to ensure we mark and honour the graceful Venus of the woods, the tree of life, before it is lost to us.Nick\u0026nbspJohannsen\u0026nbspis director of the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty Unit.

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Andy Martin says it’s time to revive the sound of silenceClick to followThe IndependentI’m sitting in my local library, in Church Street, London. Trying to concentrate, the way you do. There are people reading and writing, and taking books off shelves, and reading the newspaper. There are also two people, one man and one woman, making telephone calls. I imagine it’s a WhatsApp call or Skype, via the library’s decent wifi setup. The guy is keeping his voice down a bit (some kind of business deal), the woman, if anything, is speaking louder than normal. She is upset. Something about how she has thrown her partner out of the house for excessive drinking or something. Either way, it’s a sad tale.\u0026nbspBut what I really want to know is this: whatever happened to those signs in libraries that said,\u0026nbsp“SILENCE PLEASE”, or “SILENCE MEANS SILENCE”? When did libraries become silence-free zones? The telephone callers come in here specifically to shoot the breeze. The library has become a mecca for mobile phone users who can’t get a decent signal in the street.I was recently on a train journey from London to Bristol. An hour or two. I had reserved a seat in the “Quiet Carriage”. A train is not a library (although that’s not a bad idea). But it seems reasonable to have at least one compartment dedicated to people who want to keep it down for a while. There are polite notices (that not everybody reads) asking passengers to refrain from (as per the library) making telephone calls. But what about loud conversations? Is there a protocol about that? Two women, sitting opposite one another, keep up their dialogue, punctuated by laughter, all the way to Bristol. Maybe they really are old friends who haven’t seen one another for years. But I get the feeling that, overt content aside, everything they say is a protest, a revolt against oppressive peace and quiet.‘Africa’ by Toto to be played at Bristol music venue for entire nightYou will often find me walking down the street (or, indeed, sitting in libraries or in quiet carriages) wearing a pair of headphones – the big ones that go right over your ears. And you are welcome to tap me on the shoulder and say:\u0026nbsp“Aren’t you that curmudgeon who goes about complaining about noise and yet here you are with headphones on, listening to music. Isn’t there some kind of contradiction here, verging on hypocrisy?” (or words to that effect). And I might reply to you – perhaps wordlessly – by removing the headphones and inviting you to listen to… the sound of silence. I am wearing the headphones to keep the music out.\u0026nbspBut in any case, even if I were listening to that old song by Simon and Garfunkel (now to be heard in a rather louder version by a band called Disturbed), there is a big difference between consensual listening and the non-consensual kind. Take, for example, my local gym. Again, the gym is not a library or a quiet carriage. You expect to hear a certain amount of grunting and groaning and huffing and puffing, not to mention the chugging of X-trainers and rowing machines and the clang of weights hitting the floor. But do I have to listen to yet another droopy Ed Sheeran tune as well? In fact most of the “songs” at the gym are not songs at all but rather extended disco programmes consisting of some endlessly repeated electronic pulse. Like static, but too irregular to count as white noise.Even in the post-industrial landscape we still seek out the solitude of far-flung spaces, the forest or the desert or the mountainI went to the trouble of writing to the higher powers at the gym to register dismay at this aural fodder and trying to get them to change their playlist, but was told that the “music” is bought in as a package from some anonymous provider, so can’t be modified, and is deemed to be suitable for the purpose of exercising anyway. Someone is paying for this garbage? I’d pay not to have to listen to it.Does life need a perpetual soundtrack, as if it were a movie, with a theme tune denoting sharks or flying saucers or romance? Or commentary, as if it were the Big Match or the Big Fight? We are living through an age of maximum noise, which has driven me into the arms of a new book, A History of Silence, by the French historian Alain Corbin, who has also written marvellous histories of bells, beaches\u0026nbspand smells (and even a history of the weather). Books used to be largely audio. Since there\u0026nbspweren’t too many copies around (and there weren’t too many people capable of reading them), they would be read out loud to the assembled throng. It’s only in the era since Gutenberg and Caxton that the text has become the accessory of quiet contemplation, the opportunity for a silent conversation going on in your head, and Shakespeare can write:\u0026nbsp“Come and take choice of all my library and so beguile thy sorrow.” A History of Silence is definitely beguiling, like an oasis of tranquility amid the maelstrom.My father, I recall, was close enough to a bomb exploding to lose 50 per cent of his hearing. But I want to set aside acts of war and concentrate on what, for want of a better term, we can call acts of peace. Probably the least peaceful environment I’ve ever been exposed to is a metalworking factory. My job was to feed and clean out the machines. Which kept on ceaselessly stamping out nuts and bolts. Maybe they provide ear-protectors these days, but then you were on your own. It was the aural equivalent of hell, the dark but also ear-splitting satanic mills, where you can’t hear yourself think. I didn’t last too long in that cacophonic job, mainly because I thought it was going to inflict lasting cerebral damage, like getting in the ring with a heavyweight for punishing round after round. They worry about footballers heading the ball, but what if the ball is pounding into your head all day long?\u0026nbspAnd talking of headbanging, isn’t this the point of the typical rock concert? Was it on the Isle of Wight or that one in Suffolk –\u0026nbspLatitude Festival – where I found myself rammed up against one of the loudspeakers? My brain is still reeling too much from the experience to recall exactly. It seems ironic that even musicians need to wear earplugs. Probably didn’t happen to JS\u0026nbspBach. I know Beethoven went deaf, but probably not as the result of an over-amplified pianoforte. \u0026nbspI still don’t understand how Stephen King (according to his book\u0026nbspOn Writing) can write while listening to loud rock music (Metallica is one of his go-to bands). Or maybe it explains why Jack Nicholson can’t wait to pick up an axe in The Shining. Conversely,\u0026nbspProust needed the cork-lined bedroom to write in and even bribed builders working on the apartment above to stop work so he could finish a sentence.\u0026nbspA silent retreat would test me to breaking point. Language is as indispensable to the mental as water is to the physical. In the beginning was the wordThe rise of the Romantic sublime, with its adulation of the pastoral, was in part a counterpoint to the rise of industrial capitalism. Wandering lonely as a cloud tended to take you well away from the madding crowd and into the verdant wood to listen to the birdsong. When Wordsworth does stand on Westminster Bridge and look out over London (back in 1802), he makes sure it’s first thing, before everyone is up and around and making a racket: “This City now doth, like a garment, wearThe beauty of the morning silent, bareShips, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lieOpen unto the fields, and to the skyAll bright and glittering in the smokeless air.”Even in the post-industrial landscape, where the clatter and clamour of factories has given way to the constant chatter of mobile phones and annoying ringtones, we still seek out the solitude of far-flung spaces, the forest or the desert or the mountain. We want to get off the grid for a change. Switch off all the notifications. Leave an “on vacation” message on email. It’s like those telescopes that are installed on top of remote island peaks or in the Atacama desert\u0026nbspto get away from all the artificial light. You’re not excluding light altogether, you’re just trying to focus on a point. So too we seek to escape the noise with some notion of getting a clearer signal from the great beyond. I imagine even GCHQ surveillance wallahs eventually take the headphones off and stop listening in to all those myriad conversations taking place every minute of the day, clandestine or not.Considering the history of the universe, the Big Bang was actually the most peaceful event ever (and here I have to depart from Alain Corbin’s last-page shoutout to the “noise” of the Big Bang) because there was as yet no medium for conveying sound. Nor was there anyone around to lend an ear anyway. As the tagline of Alien used to says:\u0026nbsp“In space, no one can hear you scream”.\u0026nbspWomen driven to suicidal thoughts over ‘callous’ pension age changeHow a family hiking trip left me thinking about mortalityThere is a case for the music of the spheres. The whole of time and space is vibrating with gravitational waves, which are audible, so in this sense silence is an illusion. But noise is more of a human speciality, and the desire for serenity has risen alongside it. I just heard on the radio – maybe I should have turned it off? – Nicky Campbell denouncing as “pathetic… mollycoddling” the decision by Manchester University students to ban clapping and whooping, but I get that. It’s akin to mystics going off into the wilderness in their quest for the ine. They haven’t banned beer yet.I have a talkative friend who has joined a Talkaholics Anonymous group. I guess she’s getting on pretty well because I haven’t heard from her for a long time. The recurrent catchphrase of Lee Child’s novels, “Reacher said nothing”, is a mute testimony to our sense that, at a certain point, you have to turn off the tap and call a halt to the wisecracks and witticisms and Boris-Johnsonian bluster and speechifying.\u0026nbspBut I understand the fear of silence. “The rest is silence.” It’s the tragic end of Act 5. It feels like RIP. Silence is spooky. Even the deeply contemplative Pascal, who prided himself on being able to remain at rest in a room, could look up into the night sky and fear “the eternal silence of these infinite spaces”. I couldn’t sign up as a Trappist monk. Even going off on one of those silent retreats would test me to breaking point. How long could I stand it? Language is as indispensable to the mental as water is to the physical. In the beginning was the word.I can think of one guy who regularly used to lapse into silence, sometimes for days on end, as an alternative to the blazing row. I don’t blame his wife for leaving him. Coercive silence can sometimes be as much of an assault on the person as too many decibels.But there has to be scope for voluntary and consensual silence. Nietzsche once defined marriage as “a long conversation”, which is fine, but there have to be times (curled up in front of the fire, walking down the street arm in arm) when the conversation stops and silence descends like grace, as soundless as snow falling. Silence (whisper it) is the language of love. Or as Wittgenstein so neatly put it:\u0026nbsp“Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must remain silent.”Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child\u0026nbspand the Making of Make Me’. He teaches at Cambridge University.

But calls and texts will simply not come through.The easiest way to check whether any O2 phone is affected is to try and call another number. If that handset is affected then it will simply fail to connect.The issue was confirmed on phones in\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0027s office. But some other handsets, right next to them, appeared to be working absolutely fine.Instagram stops working and refuses to load picturesHey @O2 your network is down in Old Trafford, he wrote on Twitter.\u0026nbspNot a surprise normally but it’s not match day!O2 said it was aware of the problem and that it had been fixed, but that the problems might continue as people\u0027s phones settle back onto the network.Some customers may have experienced an issue when using their mobile earlier today, a spokesperson said. This was fixed within 40 minutes. Some customers may continue to experience some intermittent issues when reconnecting to the network. We’re investigating what happened and apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.The outage came at the same time as O2 announced a new service, known as Popcorn Pass, which will give eligible customers 40 per cent off cinema tickts for two years. Anyone buying its more expensive sim-only or handset deals will get access to the new membership.It also followed a major outage at Instagram, which left users unable to load their feeds or see pictures on the app.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

their positions handed to European partnersClick to followThe IndependentProfessor Peter Coveney is concerned about the fate of medical research in the country following BrexitA top British scientist has called the government “totally chaotic” as he stands to lose\u0026nbsphis leadership of major European projects after Brexit.\u0026nbspProfessor Peter Coveney heads up three EU projects with a total value of around £15m, and he says work like his will be compromised if a deal is not agreed before March.His research, which aims to create a “forecasting system” that predicts disease, involves scientists working across Europe but is led from University College London.A no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for the UK science communityWhile the government said\u0026nbspit will fund British scientists participating in European projects if they lose out on money post-Brexit, it has not promised to support entire projects with UK scientists at the helm.The EU currently hands British project leaders millions of euros to distribute among their partners, but it will not do this if the UK is relegated to a so-called “third country” after Brexit.“The big thing that is unclear is that there is no agreement from the government here to continue to support projects that are led by the UK,” said Professor Coveney.“So leadership of projects – big ones that are influential – is thrown completely into disarray.”Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor

participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchDescribed by Professor Coveney as the “medical equivalent of weather forecasting”, his work uses supercomputers to simulate human bodies and plan people’s medical treatments and surgeries in advance.Due to limited British capacity to undertake such projects, he said this kind of research is totally dependent on European collaboration.His criticism comes after Royal Society president Venki Ramakrishnan\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspTV particle physicist Professor Brian Cox voiced their concerns about the impact of Brexit – particularly a no-deal outcome – on British science.Many leading scientists, including two Nobel prize winners, have backed The Independent‘s campaign for a Final Say on the Brexit vote.Leading scientists back call for Brexit deal voteThe UK is currently positioned as a European leader, home to many of the EU’s most prestigious research institutions and receiving 15 per cent of the funding from the flagship European funding programme Horizon 2020.However, this status will be threatened if the nation’s top scientists are forced to hand over the reins of their research to partners.Such an outcome now seems likely, as the government expects the UK to become a third country without a deal, and the prospect of a no-deal Brexit now looks more plausible than ever before.He wants reassurances that his projects and the livelihoods of lab members who are paid with this funding are not jeopardised.Professor Coveney contacted Mr Gyimah to voice his concerns, and received an assurance that the government was “seeking discussion” with the European Commission concerning a no-deal scenario.“This would need to include projects where the UK participant is responsible for coordinating funding,” Mr Gyimah wrote.Scientists fear loss of half a billion pounds of funding after no-dealDismissing this response as “merely regurgitating” information from the government’s official no-deal planning documents “that was unhelpful in the first place”, Professor Coveney said he needs the government to guarantee it will replace any lost funding in its entirety. He has laid out his case in a blog post for the campaign group Scientists for EU.“The picture is as follows: if you were to be a third country following midnight on 29\u0026nbspMarch and you wanted to continue to run these big projects, it would be incumbent on you to fund the entire thing,” he said.This would mean committing to funding not only the British scientist in charge of the project, but also the international team working with them.Despite the expense, he said this was a price worth paying to maintain UK leadership in science and protect the health of its citizens by funding medical research.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

If confirmed by follow-up Hubble observations, the finding could provide vital clues about the development of planetary systems and may cause experts to revisit theories of how moons form around planets.The new moon is far bigger than any of the nearly 200 natural satellites that have been found in our own solar system. It is comparable in size to its\u0026nbspplanets, roughly the same size as Neptune – orbiting a planet as big as Jupiter.The two are floating around their own star 8,000 lightyears away.Nasa releases statement about bizarre International Space Station leakIt was found in the same way that scientists discovered those thousands of exoplanets: watching for the small dips that happens when they move in front of their star, and working out from those how big it is and what its orbit might be like.They looked at data from\u0026nbsp284 planets found in that way by the Kepler Space Telescope and tried to find those that had anything strange about their orbits.One of those planets, known as Kepler 1625b, seemed to be behaving strangely.\u0026nbspWe saw little deviations and wobbles in the light curve that caught our attention, Kipping said.They watched the planet for some time, and noticed that soon after it passed in front of its star, there was another dip of light, which appeared to be a moon trailing the planet like a dog following its owner on a leash.It also seemed to be passing in front of its star slightly sooner that might be expected, which would be consistent with the kind of wobble that would happen because of a moon\u0027s gravity.\u0026nbspAn extraterrestrial civilization watching the Earth and Moon transit the Sun would note similar anomalies in the timing of Earth\u0027s transit, Kipping said.It is possible that the strange behaviour could also be caused by another planet in the system, and hope for further data from space telescopes to confirm their findings. But at the moment a companion moon is the most convincing explanation for the dip in the light and the change in the orbit, they said.Exomoons are so difficult to find because they are so small, and as a consequence the dip they cause in the light coming from the star is much weaker than a larger planet. Their orbits also shift as they move around their star, because they orbiting their planet.The new moon was probably found first because its larger size made it easier to see.Both of the planets are within the habitable zone, where they are close enough to their star to get heat and support life but not so close that it would be killed by the intensity. But both planets are gaseous and so are unlikely to support life.The gaseous nature of the planet also lead to questions about where its Moon might have come from. Our Moon, for instance, is thought to have been formed when an earlier collision shot off material that would go on to become the rock we see today, but that could not happen if the two objects are made up of gas.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It would cost an estimated £20bn, for instance.Even Mr Johnson’s allies have had some trouble associating the idea with what might be called reality. Rather, they say, it is an example of the politician’s “free-thinking”.Well, we’re all capable of that, aren’t we?After all, a bridge over the Irish Sea is far from the only\u0026nbspambitious mega-project that has been mooted for the UK of late. So could any of this lot ever really become reality?When Highways England was asked to think up blue sky solutions to congestion on the M25, it seems it took the request literally. One secret proposal presented to the government was to make the motorway a double-decker highway.Six lanes of elevated carriageways would run for 26 miles to the southwest of London, according to the 2016 plan. But when the idea was leaked not everyone was enamoured. “You can’t build your way out of trouble,” thundered the Campaign to Protect Rural England, while even the AA questioned if the sheer disruption would be worth it.M25\u0026nbspcould be a thing of the past?\u0026nbsp(PA)It remains, for now, on the proverbial ideas board.Riding over rooftops is one way to beat traffic – and that is precisely what Lord Norman Foster has\u0026nbspproposed as a way for reducing London congestion.His company has set out a vision for a sky-high(ish) cycle super-highway, which would criss-cross\u0026nbspthe capital and\u0026nbspwhich has won the theoretical backing – if not the financial help – of Transport for London.Plans for 136-mile ‘SkyCycle’ highways above London’s rail lines to beThe grand plan would see 220 kilometres\u0026nbspof new bike routes installed above rail lines. An initial track from Stratford to Liverpool Street has been costed at a cheeky £200m, which architects say is relatively affordable – which no one has yet volunteered to stump up.“The idea was proposed in 2013,” Sam Martin, of Exterior Architecture, which worked on the idea, tells The Independent: “Since then, there has been a shift in favour of cycling as a solution to urban transit issues so we remain hopeful the first route can be built with the right political will.”A road tunnel through the PenninesManchester and Sheffield – two of England’s biggest cities – sit only about 38\u0026nbspmiles\u0026nbspapart.Yet a rush hour car journey between the two can be a\u0026nbsptwo hour ordeal, mainly because the southern Pennines sits betwixt them. Motorists take a road known as Snake’s Pass, which is as winding as it sounds.But in 2016 the Department for Transport proposed a new motorway – blasting right through 20 miles\u0026nbspof England’s most famous hills.Miles that a tunnel through the Pennines would need to be bored to link Sheffield and ManchesterTransport for the North told The Independent that, at present, consultants are working on an analysis for “a better understanding of the benefits”.Nonetheless, motorists probably shouldn’t hold their breath: such a road has been advocated by different governments ever since\u0026nbspthe 1950s.Another pet project of Mr Johnson, a\u0026nbspproposed aviation hub for the capital in the Thames estuary\u0026nbsp– nicknamed Boris Island – was rejected by the Airport Commission in 2014 and described by experts as “financially, geographically and environmentally wrong”.BoJo’s response? To re-float the idea once again in a 78-page report in 2016, and refuse to rule it out if he ever becomes Prime Minister.Supporters argue it’s the “only credible” way of increasing the UK’s air capacity because it would have the necessary space for four runways, as well as high speed rail connections to London and the north.All that said, “credible” might not necessarily describe the financial estimates. Mr Johnson himself suggested the hub would cost £50bn back in 2012. For context, the building of Heathrow’s third runway is set to top £18bn.The number of visitors a garden bridge across the Thames might have attracted annually, according to supportersAnother one of Boris’s: a widely criticised\u0026nbspidea for a crossing over the Thames filled with flora and fauna.Advocates including Joanna Lumley suggested the bridge would attract 7 million people a year – more than the Eiffel Tower. But it was dogged by spiralling costs, opposition from Londoners, controversies over procurement and, ironically for a bridge championing nature, plans to cut down 30 mature trees to make way for it.On becoming mayor Sadiq Khan almost immediately canned it, though not before the project had burnt through £46.4m of public money. “I did not waste a single penny,” Mr Johnson later said in all apparent seriousness.Critics might say\u0026nbspSir Richard Branson struggles even to run a regular rail service effectively – his Virgin Trains had to give up the East Coast Mainline franchise\u0026nbspthis year after being unable to meet obligations.But that hasn’t stopped the bearded entrepreneur from laying out plans for Virgin Hyperloop – a tube-like network that would whip passengers across Britain at 700 mph.The system – currently being developed in Nevada – would see 20-person pods pinging through an underground tube on electro-magnetic tracks. It would cut journey time from London to Manchester, the first proposed route, down to a coffee-spilling 18 minutes.“Most definitely it could be built in the UK,” Sir Richard told Radio 4 in May. “It would end up transporting people far quicker, in far greater numbers, with far greater convenience than any other train network.”Long-suffering commuters might suggest such an ambition would not, currently, be hard to achieve.Department for TransportShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

surpassed 60 per cent with many wanting to remain inside it or within the EUClick to followIndy PoliticsA large majority of the British public want the UK to retain at least “full access”\u0026nbspto the EU’s single market after Brexit, a new poll has revealed.The exclusive survey for The Independent showed backing for full access as the lowest level of integration has increased steadily this year and has now surpassed 60 per cent.The public’s clear and growing desire to retain such a high level of access to the market heaps pressure on Theresa May as she prepares for a critical EU summit at which an outline Brexit deal may be agreed.Brexiteers give May ‘Canada or quit’ ultimatum if her plans failThe Independent understands the EU is preparing to offer the UK a Canada-style free trade agreement that would not deliver the “frictionless” trade Ms May is seeking, and is something that just a quarter of people said they wanted in BMG Research’s poll.The prime minister is also to meet with her cabinet ministers next week when it is likely she will discuss tweaks to her Chequers proposals to make them more amenable to the EU’s negotiators, including the possibility of a much closer customs union. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspPollsters asked a weighted sample of more than 1,500 people what their preferred option would be, including…Full EU membership with no limits on immigrationFull single market membership, similar to remaining in the EEA, with moderate immigration limitsRetaining “full access” to the single market with completely new immigration rulesSeeking a free trade deal with a degree of access to the single market and stricter immigration controlsNo free trade deal with strict immigration rules, effectively the WTO optionMore than 61 per cent of people opted for one of the first three options, all of which deliver full access to the single market, with 22 per cent of the total within that proportion wanting to just stay in the EU.Just 25 per cent said they backed the kind of free trade deal advocated by Brexiteers and several members of the cabinet, while only 14 per cent advocated a no-deal withdrawal.Support for full access to the single market has been the majority position for months, something which has no doubt informed Ms May as she negotiated, whilst also attempting to deliver on concerns about immigration.But BMG surveys carried out for The Independent in recent months have clearly shown support for remaining closely tied to the single market increasing, during a period in which businesses have more consistently raised the alarm about the potentially devastating consequences of rowing back from it. \u0026nbspSince July, backing for at least full access to the single market has risen five points, from 56 per cent.At that time support for a free trade deal approach was at 28 per cent, while a no-deal approach had the support of 16 per cent – meaning voters have become progressively wary of both options that deliver looser ties with the UK’s biggest trading partner.It could make life difficult in Brussels on 17 and 18 October, when EU leaders are said to be preparing to offer the UK something closer to a Canada-style trade deal, which would not deliver frictionless trade.Instead it would seek to reduce barriers as far as possible for a nation outside the single market, and would include clauses that leave open the possibility of further change after Brexit day, meaning a future Tory or Labour leader could tighten the relationship.\u0026nbspEven if Theresa May strikes a no-deal Brexit, she will surviveMinister warns of ‘collapse and disarray’ if Brexiteers topple May Brexit deal could be done in next fortnight, EU chief saysHowever, since the beginning of negotiations the EU’s conception of a free trade arrangement has been contingent on Ms May accepting different customs arrangements in Northern Ireland and mainland Britain, something she has already ruled out.The Independent\u0026nbspreported last week that the prime minister was instead considering a tighter customs arrangement than previously countenanced, along with new concessions in relation to future European regulation, which are likely to be discussed by ministers in the coming week.Today’s new poll also saw respondents asked if tighter customs arrangements than those originally envisioned by Ms May was a concession worth making to secure a deal.Most people – 38 per cent – said it was, with 27 per cent saying it was not and 34 per cent saying they did not know.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on

But\u0026nbspnow, once the Tory conference is over, we should get down to business.”Speaking alongside\u0026nbspLeo Varadkar, the Irish president, Mr Tusk made clear the EU remained “united behind Ireland” in its determination to prevent a return to border posts and checks.But he also made clear his anger at the delay to Theresa May’s promised fresh border proposals – linking it to a reluctance to risk a backlash at the Tory conference.In Birmingham, Mr Hunt, the foreign secretary, triggered fury across the EU by accusing it of trying to keep the UK in a “prison” with behaviour similar to the Soviet Union.After the Salzburg summit, the prime minister accused Mr Tusk of showing disrespect, but he tuned that accusation on the UK, saying: “In respecting our partners, we expect the same in return.“Comparing the European Union to the Soviet Union is as unwise as it is insulting. The Soviet Union was about prisons and gulags, borders and walls, violence against citizens and neighbours.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

So it is no wonder she’s desperately looking for support fairly cynically from anywhere. No I’m not worried at all.”He pointed to stories in the press that families could lose out by up to £2,400 a year due to the universal credit rollout, which he said proved claims of an end to austerity made by Ms May were false.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But you do have an upward revision to the prior month’s increase and there is evidence of some downward effect from the hurricane,” said Matt Luzzetti of Deutsche Bank in New York.“The overall picture is that the labour market remains solid and robust. You have the unemployment rate down to levels last seen in the late 1960s to early 1970s. Wage growth remains consistent with the Fed’s expectations at about 3 percent. Barring any shocks to the economy, we expect them to raise rates in December.”Last month the Federal Reserve raised rates to 2-2.25 per cent, its third hike of 2018 and projections by policymakers signalled one further quarter point rate hike later this year, followed by three in 2019 and another three in 2020.The BLS said the September jobs gains came in professional and business services, health care, transportation and warehousing.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The one known as\u0026nbsp802.11ac is WiFi 5, and\u0026nbsp802.11n is WiFi\u0026nbsp4.“For nearly two decades, WiFi users have had to sort through technical naming conventions to determine if their devices support the latest WiFi,” said Edgar Figueroa, president and CEO of Wi-Fi Alliance. “WiFi Alliance is excited to introduce WiFi 6, and present a new naming scheme to help industry and WiFi users easily understand the WiFi generation supported by their device or connection.”As well as being easier for people to understand, the new name will be able to fit into screens on phones and computers. That will let people know how they are connected to WiFi, for instance, and tell them whether they should expect faster or slower speeds.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But that for me makes this point clearer than ever.\u0026ldquoScotland needs the option of independence because only independence guarantees that these things can\u0026rsquot be imposed on us against our will.

He had a hard time because he was so drunk, and because I was wearing a one-piece bathing suit under my clothes.I believed he was going to rape me. I tried to yell for help. When I did, Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from screaming.It was hard for me to breathe, and I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me. This was what terried me the most, and has had the most lasting impact on my le.At the hearing, Democrat Richard Blumenthal said Donald Trumps failure to order an FBI investigation was tantamount to a cover-up.Upon questioning, Fords voice cracked as she described her most vivid memory being the uproarious laughter of the pair.They were laughing with each other. Having fun at my expense. Two friends having a really good time with one another.She explained she only escaped the room when Judge jumped on the bed causing Kavanaugh to lose his balance and fall off her.Ford then told how she immediately fled the house.With what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you  Democratic Senator Richard Durbin asked Ford.One hundred per cent, she replied, remaining firm and unruffled through hours of testimony.In Kavanaughs prepared testimony, the -year-old appellate judge acknowledges drinking in high school with his friends, but says hes never done anything remotely resembling what Ford describes.He said he has never had a sexual or physical encounter of any kind with her.Kavanaugh angrily and tearfully claimed he was the victim of a political hit after Dr Ford said she was  per cent certain he attacked her.Kavanaugh branded himself a victim of grotesque and obvious character assassination.He then unequivocally and categorically denied Fords allegation, adding: I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process.Im here today to tell the truth, Ive never sexually assaulted anyone, not in high school, not college, not ever.Those who make allegations always deserve to be heard. At the same time, the subject of the allegations also deserves to be heard.The Senate Judiciary Committee scheduled its vote for Kavanaughs nomination to the Supreme Court for .am local time on Friday, September .This was done in order to comply with rules that requires three days notice is given ahead of any vote.The Senate Judiciary Committee voted to approve Kavanaughs nomination to the US supreme court.It will now be brought to the Senate where a vote in the full chamber - currently controlled by the Republicans - would secure his position on the Supreme Court.Following the Judiciary Committee confirmation, Republican senator Jeff Flake called for a delay of the vote for up to a week for the Senate vote, announcing he would support moving forward with the understanding of an investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.The FBI then proceeded to investigate Kavanaugh with the resultant report deemed acceptably thorough by Republicans and inadequate by the Democrats.Yesterday Republican Senator Susan Collins and Joe Manchin, a Democrat, both indicated their backing his seat looks all but confirmed ahead of the vote scheduled for tonight."},{"url":null,"title":"typhoon kong rey where is the storm now","story":"Super Typhoon Kong-rey, currently a Category  major hurricane, was starred up to a Super Typhoon on Tuesday.A northwest track in the coming days will take this dangerous tropical cyclone toward the Ryukyu Islands, which are still reeling from damaging winds in excess of  km hfrom Trami on September .The Ryukyu Islands are an archipelago of islands nestled between southern Japan and Taiwan.AccuWeather Meteorologist Rob Richards said: Typhoon Kong-rey will travel across the Philippine Sea over the coming days and gradually strengthen.“Scenarios for Kong-rey’s expected track around the start of next weekend range from the typhoon targeting Taiwan and or eastern China or curving northeastward to mainland Japan or the Korean Peninsula.”After threatening the Ryukyu Islands, scenarios for Kong-rey’s expected track around the start of next weekendrange from the typhoon targeting northern Taiwan and or eastern China to curving north-eastward to mainland Japan or the Korean Peninsula.A blow by Kong-rey less than a week later would further heighten the risk of damage and flooding to structures left weakened by Trami.Cities Miyako and Okinawa are expected to face the worst of Kong-reys impacts which will include damaging winds and torrential rainfall.

She’s about as charismatic as an underdone crumpet on a wet Sunday. But she doesn’t need to be Ginger Rogers. She’s the Prime Minister.And you have to give her credit for doggedly sticking to that role. EvenI’m not convinced she’s been doing it terribly well.But on Brexit — God, how mind-numbingly boring the whole thing is — she has a good point.I’m not a fan of her Chequers deal for us to leave the European Union. I think we’re giving too much away. I’d rather have a no-deal exit.But time is pressing. And I’m aware that while we Leavers won the referendum, the margin was comparatively small. So we ought to be gracious and accept a little bit of a compromise. Try to strike a respectable deal with those gangsters from insignicant countries.And a little further down the line, tweak the arrangements a little to suit us better. In the meantime, just strike the deal.And that means getting behind May and presenting a united front to Europe. Most of the Conservative MPs understand that, even the arch-Brexiteers like the excellent Michael Gove.But Bfo the Blundering Bear does not. I’m talking about Boris Johnson. Now he IS fun and good company. But he’s about as likely to become Prime Minister as I am to cop off with Emily Ratajkowski after a few pints and a quick meal at the Chicken Cottage.He has very little support among his political colleagues. He has a lot more among Conservative activists. But very little among voters north of Watford.And yet Bfo was at it again this week. Taking the p**s out of the Prime Minister. And making a rousing speech to his hardcore supporters. Demanding we tell the EU to stuff it.Well, there was a time when we should have told the EU to stuff it — two years ago when we first started negotiations.That time has passed. A lack of confidence from the Government and a ided party let us down.Now is the time to show a bit of unity and wring a deal out of the deathly bureaucrats. Maybe not the Chequers deal — May didn’t mention the word at all during her speech — but a version of it.Otherwise we’ll have a General Election on our hands. One the Tories will lose. And you’ll wake up to find John McDonnell is in charge of your finances and Diane Abbott is Home Secretary.Come on — surely that should concentrate the mind a little Hero of the week is Jane Lunnon, head of a girls’ school in South London.She has stuck the boot into “image-obsessed” reality TV – especially that coven of gurning and pouting imbeciles in Love Island, such as Megan Barton Hanson.Such programmes are “incredibly damaging” to young people, she reckons, calling them “trivial nonsense”.I think Jane is right. And the same goes for all those hyped-up talent shows where people with no talent – just a lust for fame – get judged on their appalling performances by people with no talent.Kids need to know the dference between fame for fame’s sake – and real achievement.Its horrible that Corine Remande has lost the sight in one eye after she was hit by a golf ball during the Ryder Cup.The poor woman was standing among spectators when Brooks Koepka’s tee shot hit her in the face.She’s now threatening legal action against the organisers. She says they didn’t give spectators enough protection.This is ludicrous. What were they supposed to do And what will happen is that in future crowds will be kept even further back from the action. Just because of one horrible accident.Wait until the same thing happens in cricket...The uni magazine said: “It was argued that the loud noise of traditional clapping and whooping pose an issue to students with anxiety or sensory issues. BSL clapping – or, jazz hands – would be a more inclusive form of expression.”With anxiety or sensory issues  What is wrong with these people They are “triggered” by almost everything. Especially by people who have views which dfer from their own.That REALLY triggers them. They shouldn’t be at university. They should be safe at home with mummy and daddy.That old windbag Mahathir Mohamad has been visiting the UK.Lovely to have him, of course. He’s the boss of Muslim-dominated Malaysia and he hates Jews.He was at it again over here.

Problem is, I can’t stand them, the middle class.And the thought of nearly four billion people eating avocado on toast while doing Pilates then listening to Coldplay in their Volvo XCs makes me feel terribly queasy.The human race is being taken over by the legions of the smug.

The zoo had been unable to get the real thing.And here’s a tip for the zoo owners. Don’t buy any real penguins, stick to the models.I think plastic penguins would be far better suited to an enclosure of a dozen square yards of shingle with a tiny drainage ditch to bathe in.Why are we allowing zoos like this to open  If I were a real penguin in Telford Exotic Zoo I’d sue them.

You might forget buying that extra round at closing time in the pub, but your phone will always remember. And of course, you get consumer protection when using a credit card, along with reward points or cashback offers.Credit card firms make their money not just from interest payments but from taking a small fee for each transaction — so they offer us incentives to choose their cards. Use an Air Miles card and before long you could have a free flight to Paris or New York.More than a quarter of clothes in the UK are bought online — and you can’t use cash over the internet. As we move even more to buying online and via smartphone apps, cash will be needed less and less. Whether cash dies out in five years or  or  just depends on technology.But many are in no rush to see the back of it — and not just because of nostalgia for their old piggy banks. One consideration is: Can we entirely trust the banks to look after our money  Fraud is soaring as criminals take advantage of security issues around online banking. Banks blame customers but critics say banks need to take responsibility.We have featured victim after victim on The Sun Money columns, and they all say bank staff have turned their backs on them. There are millions of others who need cash simply because they rely on it to pay for things day to day. And it is the less well off or elderly who rely on it the most.Consumer magazine Which  — which has been campaigning against the loss of banks and ATMs — has produced research showing poorer families and older folk are hardest hit.Gareth Shaw of Which  said: “ATM and branch closures are threatening to leave behind the millions who still rely on cash. Our research highlights lower-income families and older generations will be among the worst hit.”In June, services from Visa, one of the three main card providers along with Mastercard and American Express, went down with technical issues — highlighting the risk of being solely reliable on cards and phones. “When the trolley came around on the train and the card payment wasn’t working, the only people who could eat were those with cash,” one banker explained.And what about hospitality workers  The Government has said all tips, evenon cards, must go to staff — but we all know some unscrupulous bosses will not do that. Like many, I prefer to give my tips in cash so I know the waiter or waitress gets it all.Charity collectors often have card machines now but collections for most churches, schools and small local good causes still rely on tins and the rattle of coins.Cash may well be dying out, but I still make sure I always keep some coins in my pocket just in case. And I have older relatives who still feel most comfortable with coins and notes.So until we have a population where everyone feels happy when using a card or phone, I will be rooting against a completely cashless Britain.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We want to collaborate with, not clobber, the property investor, Mr Taylor-Smith wrote.The letter also requested that councils be able to levy a management fee to help cover the costs of taking over the homes.RBKC owned Grenfell Tower and faced criticism after the fire amid accusations that it and the Kensington and Cha Tenant Management Organisation, which ran the block, ignored repeated safety warnings from residents.Theof time taken to rehouse survivors following the disaster was also condemned, with dozens forced to spend months in hotels.In response, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said there were no plans to change the system.A spokeswoman said: Local authorities have a range of powers at their disposal to tackle long-term empty homes, and we expect them to use these to best address the needs of their residents.We have no plans to change the existing laws in this area, but are clear that all councils have a duty to provide affordable homes."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000439734495.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"giant us aircraft carrier uss harry s truman sails into portsmouth as hms queen elizabeth heads stateside","story":"The giant USS Harry S.

Unilever got the fright of its le when, in February last year, US food giant Kraft Heinz approached it about a bn takeover. This restructuring was seen as a way for the company, which has a Dutch chairman and chief executive, to avoid such incidents in future because the Netherlands has tougher takeover laws than the City. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister and a former Unilever employee, did his bit to smooth the way by promising to abolish a tax on idends that made holding the shares in the UK more attractive than in the Netherlands.One by one, the big battalions of City fund managers, many of whom prefer to speak on an anonymous basis to the financial press, broke cover to say what a dreadful idea this was: Colombia Threadneedle, Lindsell Train, Schroders, Aviva Investors, MG and Royal London all publicly stated their opposition. With Unilever needing the backing of % of UK investors to go ahead with the reorganisation, it was starting to look like a close-run thing.Yet that was not the only dficulty that emerged for the consumer goods giant.The influential Financial Times columnist Neil Collins, the most vocal critic of the move from the start, spotted in the small print of the particulars sent to investors that Unilever also required a simple majority of shareholders taking part in the vote for the motion to be passed. In other words, a small shareholder with only a handful of shares would carry as much weight as a big City institution with millions of them.,targeting:\" data-targeting-strnativekey\"\" data-targeting-\"\" data-tag\"\" data-component-name\"sdc-site-mpu\" aria-label\"Advertisement\" id\"mpu-inline-mobile\" data-tolerance\"\""},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/10/2048x1152/skynews-banksy-auction-sothebys_4445517.jpg?20181006202908 ","title":"who is mystery man who films at banksy auction","story":"Later, the artist posted a video to his Instagram showing how he had secretly built a shredder inside the frame without the dealer or buyer knowing.A post with the video said: \"A few years ago, I secretly built a shredder into a painting... in case it was ever put up for auction.\" The artists identity is a closely guarded secret but footage from inside the auction house has got reporters talking about the role played by a mystery man in the crowd."},{"url":null,"title":"voice sunday mirror must leave","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Sunday Mirror: They must all leave the EU in peacePoliticians need to stop playing games and, instead, work together to make Brexit a successShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  OCT NewsopinionThe EU Commission President with Prime Minister Theresa May \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheresa May believes EU leaders could be about to pull a fast one. And following all the lunges and feints in the Brexit fencing game, she might be right. After humiliating the PM in Salzburg over her Chequers plan, they were all lovey-dovey again yesterday. Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk suggested a deal was tantalisingly close and could even be concluded in as little as  days. But even this pair of dyed-in-the-wool Eurocrats realised we might suss them trying to pull the wool over our eyes, so they conceded that November was more likely.  Mrs May is right to be cautious. The EU is expected to unveil a new Brexit plan this week and we’re being softened up with all this matey talk. Juncker and Tusk are not our mates. Their priority is the best interests of the EU – not the UK. Which, in fairness, is how it should be. That’s what they’re paid for. So as we enter the home straight of the Brexit negotiations, let’s all get real. The EU’s plan to stick the Irish border in the Irish Sea is a non-starter. So is Mrs May’s assertion that it is for them to compromise with us. Compromise requires both sides giving ground. Concessions must be made. The only realistic hope of a frictionless Irish border is a customs union. And the only way that customs union can work isit encompasses the whole UK. That will mean some restrictions on our trade outside Europe. Mrs May must accept them. And so must Jacob Rees-Mogg’s band of Brexiteersthey want to do what’s best for Britain. This newspaper wishes Brexit wasn’t happening. But we respect the will of the British people. And we accept we are leaving Europe. Now we want Brexit to be a success. That requires both British and European politicians to stop parading their egos and start marching in step.

Paige sighs as she kneels down by the drain, listening to the echoing sound of cheeps that comes from below the ground. ‘Don’t worry, I’ll get your babies back,’ she calls to the anxious duck nearby. Reaching the long pole down between the slats of the the drain, she gently probes around before bringing up four fluffy ducklings. ‘No matter how many years I do this job for, ducklings never get old,’ says Paige. ‘It’s quite common for a mother duck to walk across the drain, but when her chicks try to follow behind, they’ll slip through the bars and get completely stuck. It’s very distressing for the mother, so reuniting them is wonderful.’ Paige has always been an animal lover. As a child she kept African land snails as pets, horrying her mum by letting the -inch creatures crawl all over her, leaving slimy trials in their wake. From a very young age, she knew she wanted to work for the RSPCA, and at the age of  she landed a position at her local RSPCA rehoming centre. As much as she loved rehoming the cats, dogs and assorted furry creatures, she’d always dreamed of rescuing animals herself. Then, three years ago, she scored her dream job as an Animal Collection Officer. And her le has been a whirlwind of animalactivity ever since.‘It’s the best job in the world!’ says Paige. ‘There’s nothing more rewarding than helping animals in distress, especially when you see them recovering well at the hospital. Every day is dferent – one day I’ll be untangling a bird trapped in a fishing net, the next I’ll be helping a baby deer with a broken leg.’ Paige’s job involves attending several call-outs a day from members of the public, covering a large part of Suffolk and Norfolk. Although she sometimes has assisted the Complaints Officers as they sort cases of animal cruelty and neglect, she mainly looks after wildle who have found themselves in dficult situations, or pets that have got lost.  Training involves everything from learning how to handle dangerous dogs to exotic creatures, and she was taught how to work at heights by the Fire Brigade in case of any creatures stuck in trees. Not all the animals Paige helps are of the sweet and fluffy iety. ‘Sometimes people will bring back an accidental guest in their luggage – we’ve had a snake that travelled in someone’s suitcase from Mexico,’ says Paige. ‘My area also covers a port, and sometimes the big shipping containers bring in lizards and huge spiders from tropical countries. We had a call-out for a huntsman spider as big as my hand, and I’m petried of spiders. I let my colleague handle that one, and we took it to an exotic specialist.’ Sadly, Paige sees a lot of animals that have been hurt because of people’s careless actions. Many of her call-outs are for creatures caught up in rubbish, from hedgehogs snared in plastic to swans entangled in wire. The local seal colony is also under threat from thoughtless humans. ‘The seals are so inquisitive and often get caught up in stuff left at the beach,’ says Paige. ‘I’ve rescued seals with frisbees stuck round their necks, or snared up in bikini bottoms. They’re very dficult for us to catch because they’re so strong – we have to wait until they’re very weak before we can rescue them.’  Paige lives with her boyfriend Adam and a frac-stone Dogue de Bordeaux called Hooch. ‘Hooch can’t believe all the smells on me when I get home at the end of the day. Before I’m even allowed through the door, he’ll snf me up and down,’ laughs Paige.‘He must be so confused by all the scents of swans, geese, rabbits and deer on me. He was a rescue dog who I brought home for the weekend and he never left. Honestly, I need my boyfriend to keep me under control –it wasn’t for him, I’d live in ahouse full of animals!’But, inevitably, Paige does end up bringing her work home with her, particularlyit’s late at night and the nearest animal sanctuary is closed. ‘I once found a nest of baby blue tits whose mother had been killed,’ she recalls. ‘It was late, and I knew they’d need feeding throughout the nightthey were going to survive, so I popped the whole nest in a box and took it home. I had it on my side of the bed so I could feed them baby bird food through a syringe without getting up. At about am, my partner leapt out of bed because he could hear all these birds singing. He was so confused he tried to close the bedroom window. I just started laughing and then he clocked that I had a whole nest of birds by the bed.’ There’s also a tough part of Paige’s job. Sometimes, animals will be too sick to help, particularlythey’ve been hit by a car. Because they could be a long drive from the nearest vet, Paige is trained to be able to put down animals that are in pain and beyond saving. ‘The first time I had to put an animal down I got in the van and cried and cried,’ says Paige. ‘I still remember it now: it was a fox that had a really nasty, infected broken leg. It couldn’t walk and the bone was sticking out. Putting it down was awful and upsetting, but you just have to know that you’re doing it for them, so they’re not going to be in pain anymore.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"banksy mystery man spotted filming","story":"NewsIs this Banksy  Mystery man spotted filming exact moment £m picture self-destructedPictures from inside Sothebys in London show four people who could be Banksy as a painting self-destructed moments after selling for £millionShareCommentsByTristan Cork:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news weird-news video rare-banksy-self-destructs-shredder-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Secretive artist Banksy may have been in the room when one of his paintings dramatically self-destructed moments after it sold for poundmillion.A shredder inside the frame destroyed the artwork as stunned onlookers gawped inside a London auction house. It raised questions about how the device was triggered - with many believing Banksy himself was there to make sure the stunt ran smoothly. And Bristol Live has revealed that there WAS a mystery man there with a gadget hidden in a bag, which appeared to be the device used to start the shredder up. So we have two, possibly three, candidates for Banksy -indeed he was there at all.  The Instagrammer The first is a man pinpointed by The Sun . This man appears in the first video to emerge on social media of the scene at Sothebys.The video was posted on Twitter by American-based journalist and PR woman Vanessa Hernandez, and can be viewed at the top of this article. It shows the artwork emerging from the bottom of the shredder, and then pans around an incredulous auction room, where everyone has reached for their phones. The Sun claim that a man with thick-framed glasses, standing just in front of Vanessa, could well be Banksy. Why they think that is because seconds after the shredding happened, Banksy’s official Instagram page published a photo of the artwork that appears to have been taken from the exact spot that man is standing, holding his phone and taking a picture. He is also standing roughly where the person who filmed the scene for the subsequent reveal video on Banksys own website was standing.The Sun also claim that the man’s appearance bears a resemblance to other pictures of Robin Gunningham, the Bristol street artist that has long been claimed is Banksy, although how they can tell this from a blurred side shot of his ear, is unknown.  There is a second - and maybe even third - possibly, quite apart from a fourth possibility that Banksy wasn’t even there at all anyway. The second is another man, shown more clearly in Vanessa’s video, standing a couple of yards behind The Sun’s main suspect, who is also photographing or filming the scene - at pretty much the same angle as the first. Weirdly, this man also has thick-framed dark glasses on, and a suit with bright white shirt cuffs visible. He also has a hint of a beard, and also bears a resemblance to previous pictures of Banksy that have been claimed are the elusive artist. The man with a bag of electronic gadgets  And finally, there is a third man that Bristol Live can reveal is claimed to have been there - and to have been the person who actually activated the shredder. A photograph sent to Bristol Live shows what appears to be a man sitting in the same Sothebys auction house room, but with some kind of electrical device in a bag between his knees. This man has a distinctive white scarf on, and a wide bracelet or watch. He also has dark glasses on, and has a hoop earring and seems to be wearing some kind of hat, headscarf or cap as well. The image, sent to Bristol Live from someone connected in the street art world in Bristol, was captioned ‘Banksy’s little helper’, while the photo itself has the ‘side-eye emoji’ on it, asthrough a snapchat filter.

The source said: “The ongoing feud between Meghan, her sister and her father has so far been played out in public interviews and communication across the Atlantic via aides and shyrepresentatives.  “This was a huge move on the part of Meghan’s sister to try to see her face to face and the fact she was turned away speaks volumes. “This is the closest Meghan has come physically to that side of her family since she married into the royal family but palace staff had clearly been instructed not to allow her access.” In a bizarre moment during her visit  days ago, Samantha refused to leave the palace area and instead went on to buy royal merchandise – including Meghan and Harry masks – from a souvenir stand to take back to America.  Samantha, who suffers from MS, was accompanied by her partner, who pushed her wheelchair up to the entrance. But while the guards kept her out, it seems nothing can protect the Royals from the further embarrassment. In May, Meghan’s father, Thomas, , was exposed for selling pictures to the paparazzi ahead of the wedding. He failed to walk her down the aisle after suffering a heart attack following the scandal. He then gave his first British TV interview and leaked details of private conversations with Harry and Meghan before telling US press he felt frozen out. Samantha, Meghan’s half sister from her father’s first marriage, has vented her fury since she was denied an invite to the wedding. She called Meghan, , “cold” for ignoring their dad, accused her of fake waves and smiles, called her the DuchASS and labelled Harry a “wuss”. Meghan’s half brother Thomas, , has also added to the circus. He slammed Meghan when he was also missed off the wedding invite list and has called for his sister to make amends with their dad. But Samantha’s visit brings a new level of embarrassment to the former Suits star. The source added: “It was a scene that will bring huge humiliation for the newlyweds who have not seen Meghan’s father or her siblings since they wed in May.” "},{"url":null,"title":"money expert martin lewis says","story":"NewsopinionMoney expert Martin Lewis says stop buying presents and warn friends not to expect Christmas gts nowThe savings guru has called on people to create their own Pre-Christmas No Unnecessary Present Pact with friends and familyShareCommentsByMartin Lewis:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsopinionMartin Lewis says people have disconnected from the reasons we give gts \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Christmas has wrongly become a retail festival. Instead of a joyous occasion, for many the season of goodwill causes unhappiness, debt and worry. So say it loud, say it proud and say it NOW: “I won’t be buying you a present this year.”Many buy gts for others that they know they won’t use, with money they don’t have, causing themselves stress they don’t need. It may feel too soon to be discussing Christmas. But this conversation needs having now, before most people start buying gts. It won’t work to stop giving unilaterally, it must be done by consensus. We’ve disconnected from why we give gts. Gt giving was once a form of social banking. Take a wedding. Older members of a community, who were usually more financially stable, gave younger people gts and money to help them get started in le. Then as that couple aged, over the years they paid it back, by giving gts at younger couples’ weddings.  Yet Christmas is a zero-sum game. You give to me, and I feel obligated to give back to you at a roughly similar value. To fulfil that obligation, we often buy things we know recipients won’t want, just to tick the box. This tit-for-tat giving means most people end up with tat – cluttering houses, costing money, and filling landfills. It does no one any good. What about the gt of giving  Some respond with “the joy of giving”. Yet even that may be selfish, as it can mis-prioritise people’s finances and create a financial burden. Imagine that I know my mate Noella is hard up. To be generous, I buy her a nice pound smelly bath bubbles and salts set. Then… she feels obliged to buy me something back. The net financial effect is Noella has spent her money to receive the bath bubbles I gave her. If she’d been free to choose, she might have put the cash towards buying shoes or other essentials for her children. Therefore by giving her a present and feeling generous I’m shyactually dictating her spending. Sometimes the best gt is releasing others from the obligation of having to give to you. It’s time for us to get off this gt-giving treadmill.

The conversation started when he saw her on FaceTime wearing her glasses and no make-up and asked their daughter: Ew! what was that hideous beast  The mum left the room as she didnt want to make a fuss in front of their little girl, but called him later on to tell him she was very upset.  But instead of an apology, he told her she was being too sensitive and even threatened to mute her phone calls and messages.She was very upset and shared the story on Mumsnet to see what other parents thought.She wrote: Little bit of backstory. Sorry its long but want to avoid drip-feeding. Husband is away with work. FaceTimed and was speaking to children, DD [darling daughter] moved the phone round and I came into view. Glasses on no makeup. H with a dead pan voice makes gagging noises and says Ew! what was that hideous beast  to DD. I left the room so as to not disrupt their conversation but was pretty upset.  I called him back after the DC were in bed. Explained that I had found it hurtful. He told me that it was a joke. When I asked what the joke was meant to be, he said the joke was that he didnt like my glasses. I said that I was upset and that I didnt want him to make that joke again. To which he responded that I was too sensitive and that he couldnt promise he wouldnt say it again. This followed.

It started with alcohol-fuelled Freshers’ Week, then wild Michaelmas parties and Spring Balls before May Day madness, when piddled undergrads leapt naked from a bridge into the River Cherwell. At exam time the “town v gown” row flared as celebrating hordes in mortar boards sprayed champers and pelted each other with flour and eggs, catching locals in their crossfire.  That was before hedonistic antics of posh boys’ drinking societies like the Bullingdon Club and the Piers Gaveston Society.

Homeless man beaten to pulp by teenage thugs given new lease of le by kind strangers“Fletch will zip up the tent and tell me not to come out until they’re gone. “But then you’ll get other people who’ll come up and give us pound, pound, because they see us here all the time. We move, but our tents don’t. “People think we are begging for drugs, alcohol, whatever, but we are out here for a living. “There’s been times we’ve stopped people jumping in the water.” It isn’t the first time Hellen has been pregnant. She says she has a daughter she saw the other day. “I was by McDonalds, and I heard someone and I thought ‘I know that voice’. I turned around and she gave me pound but told me I’d have to beg the other pound for a bottle.” Her friend Fletcher, , has deep-vein thrombosis in both legs, and has suffered two heart attacks, and three strokes. He said: “We survive the best we can, without committing crime, which is hard. “I’ve been here ten weeks in this tent. I’ve come from Port Talbot, where they say they say they’ll help me with property, but I’ll have to find one first. They tell us to find something on Facebook - but how can you get Facebook here  “I’ve only got a tent. We’ve got nada. We’re third class citizens. The police don’t help or anything.” The unpredictable treatment by the public is just one of the ongoing challenges faced by people living on the street. Emergency shelter is limited. Charity The Wallich has a limited number of beds at its base on The Strand, as do the Missionaries of Charity, and charity Caer Las. It is one of the reasons that calls have started to be made for the establishment of a ‘safe zone’ in Swansea - an area which can provide sleeping space, a roof, and basic toilet facilities. Earlier this summer, something similar opened in Bristol - a -bed -hour homeless night shelter made possible with pound, government funding, which has increased the number of emergency bed spaces in the city from  to .  It’s an idea being championed in Swansea by Plaid Cymru. The party’s candidate for Gower is financial broker John Davies, who has for the past six years been working with night shelters in Swansea, and more recently joining weekly soup runs which provide hot food and clothes for the homeless. Pantygwydr Church in Uplands, and Bethel Chapel in Sketty, are two churches which provide support for the homeless. “It can be quite intimidating on the streets,” he said. “People are vulnerable, but they get treated in an awful way. They have to hide just to exist. “Sometimes they are not safe from each other, and sometimes they have people coming out of pubs who are drunk who start beating them up. “It is evident no-one is looking after them. A safe zone would be a place where they are looked after. It could be something like a portable cabin, or a converted shipping container. “It doesn’t have to be elaborate, just somewhere they know they can get a good night’s sleep, and know they are not going to get beaten up. “The cost would not have to be huge, and it would save the money spentpeople are arrested and have to go through the prison system, when they would come out more agitated.”  Another homeless man Daniel, first started living on the streets in  following the death of his father. He said: “I’m in a BB at the minute so I’m alright, but a safe zone would help. “It would be good from a social aspect as well, because it keeps us together. “I don’t get grief because I play it safe. I walk around, I’m nice to people, I’m nice to police. “But you do hear people saying ‘ you junky, get a ******* job, I’m not paying for your crack habit, whatever’. “I’ve been homeless about two years. I just come out of jail. I committed a burglary, drugs and that. “A safe zone would be handy. I’d say have it near the beach, you could put up tents there. You’d be helping the community and making people aware.”  And another homeless man, Dan, also found himself arrested for begging. He said: “I got arrested the other week waiting for a chip shop to open on Bryn y Mor Road. Two officers said I was begging but I didn’t have nothing out in front of me, I was just sitting down. “Instead of punishing us, why not help us  Because many a time they’ve said they are going to do this, do that, but I’ve seen nothing. “I try and find somewhere where it is quiet and out of the way, so I feel safer. “Sometimes I sleep on the Pantygwdyr church steps and also the Jehovahs Witness church, there’s a bit of shelter there. Basically, wherever I can find a bit of shelter where it is quiet for the night. “I’d love a place, like a safe zone. I need a bit of support, a bit of guidance, a bit of help.” John, who has been sleeping rough for more than ten years, agreed: “This place really needs shaking up. “There are more and more places being built for students, but what about us who already live in the community  “We often get abused. We have rocks thrown at us, everything, just for sitting there. “It’s worse when people are leaving the pubs. What we want is like a community club, or a community space. “There is nothing at the moment for anyone. Some of the police move us on, sometimes they don’t. “They can move us on, but we’re only going to go down the road, or somewhere .

roarie be dundees deacon of hope","story":"Former Arsenal kid Roarie Deacon’scoincided with Dundee’s first league victory of the season – could he be the piece that’s been missing from their Premiership jigsaw The -year-old, who signed from English National League side Sutton United last summer, has missed the entire start of the season after having ankle surgery.Picking up the injury in the final game of last season, the enigmatic attacker ed for the final six minutes of the club’s first league win of the season – at the seventh time of the asking – at Hamilton and, in the process, set up the second goal.And hiswas hailed by manager Neil McCann.He said: “Roarie Deacon I am really pleased about getting back in because we have suffered some real injury problems of late.“He hadn’t featured at all, he’d only had  minutes of football all season before Saturday but I knew putting him on he could secure the ball because he is so strong.“You can’t get close to Roarie and he turned the boy beautully, then he had the composure.“I have to commend the other boys as well because they were still trying to get into the box at that stage to get the killer goal.”Deacon himself was delighted to be back in action after his y spell out.A process that was extended after an older injury reared its head once more.His debut season was also curtailed by injury with a troublesome thigh problem picked up in December at Hearts keeping him out of action for a big chunk of the middle of the campaign.And, on histo training this season, he hurt the same thigh once more.Deacon said: “I had ankle surgery the first week into pre-season.“I twisted it and damaged ankle ligaments in the game against Partick and through the summer it didn’t heal itself.“The surgeon didn’t want to operate initially but it didn’t heal itself so we made the decision to go under the kne to sort it out.“I was supposed to be back a little earlier than this but on the first session back I re-injured my thigh, a problem I had last season, so I needed a bit of intense rehabilitation on that to get back.“Now, though, I am ready to go and I’m fit.”With goals being a real issue for the side – just four scored in their seven league games and half of them against Accies at the weekend – Deacon’sis a timely boost for the Dark Blues.In fact, he’s only played around six minutes this season but has already had a hand in a quarter of their league goals.Coming into the side struggling for goals and points, though, hasn’t ruffled Deacon in any way.And Dundee fans will be hoping his direct running and ability to go past people is the key that unlocks defences with tough matches against Kilmarnock on Saturday and then Livingston, Hearts and Celtic in the next month.The former Sutton man admits he’s surprised the Dark Blues find themselves bottom of the table as he s to fitness and has backed them to get up the table,they keep doing what they’ve been doing.He added: “I am very surprised, everyone is surprised.“No way we thought we would come in, do well in pre-season, and then come in and after six games not have a point on the board.“However, after Hamilton everyone is positive, you can’t not be because the way we’ve been playing it’s not like we’ve not created chances or played well despite not getting points.“Everyone is buzzing about in training, raring to go and wanting to do well for Dundee.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bb72b1824e5c.jpg ","title":"closed dundee gp practice closes its doors for good","story":"A Dundee

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

She explained her fascination with how each portrayed the concept in very dferent ways, from the peaceful portrayal of moonlit nature to expressions of personal  emotion, struggle and grief.The first work Anna played was Scriabin’s second Sonata, Sonata Fantasie. The ‘moonlit’ first movement was exquisite and the execution of the theme and pianissimo accompaniment at the end was stunning: the helter skelter finale was brilliant.Chopin’s Fantasie in F min, which followed, took us into the realms of personal struggle and, with Anna’s innate musicianship, she made cohesive sense of what can appear a somewhat fragmented work.To end the first part of the recital we heard a flawless rendition of Beethoven’s much-loved Moonlight Sonata, and despite the high octane speed of the finale one could hear every single note.After the interval came Mozart’s D min Fantasia. This deceptively easy-looking short piece, executed perfectly by Anna, demonstrated how dficult it is to play his music where every note and phrase requires minute attention.To conclude her recital, Anna chose Schumann’s great Fantasie in C. This work, while dedicated to Franz Liszt is, in the first movement at least, more an outpouring of his frustration at being denied the hand of his beloved Clara with all its sudden changes in mood. The very technically demanding second movement – a march – is more of a dedication to Liszt and was a thrilling listen. The final slow transcendental movement, which could well have been inspired by the opening movement of Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata, took us into a world of ethereal tranquility.After much applause Anna gave us Rachmaninov’s Prelude in G# min. Op. No. as a fitting encore.After this ‘fantasy’ journey one could only join with those who have been so impressed by the depth and power of Anna’s musicianship. Her ability to squeeze the last drop of emotion from every phrase was very special and a privilege to experience. Finally, to walk out into the clear night air and see the moonlight reflected off the sea like shards of silver seemed an apt end to an evening of fantasy.PIC:Pianist prodigy, Anna Feorova.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings.

Luckily Batman, PH’s Mr Rory Hall sprung into action to free the cute creature. The superhero was accompanied by sidekick Robin- or rather the school’s janitor Brian Robb. The pair worked together to prise open the window and get the winged animal to safety, while other staff members stood below with a safety net.

Saying hello to Cathy and Suzanne as they passed the Geoff Shaw community centre where the after school club meets was often the only interaction some of the pensioners from the Thistle Housing complex had. When Polmadie Fire Station donated a snooker table to the club nearly three years ago, Cathy and Suzanne saw it as an opportunity to persuade elderly residents to leave their armchairs and drop into the centre for a game of snooker and a chat. A resident from the housing complex spread the word among his neighbours and soon eight men were going to the centre to while away their afternoons and evenings with a game of snooker and friendly banter. Glasgow Le’s Mark Hudson suggested establishing a sports hub in the centre and advised Cathy and Suzanne how to apply for funding.

Now they are friends who are in and out of each other’s homes. “It is just wonderful, seeing the dference in their lives,” said -year-old Suzanne, of Toryglen. “Seeing them from hardly walking to totally changing is marvellous. One man did not go out the house after losing his we a couple of years before, and he just loved the company.” Volunteers Cathy and Suzanne organised a bus to take the neighbours on a day trip to Ayr - and the appreciative group paid for the pair’s seats to the seaside. The two women are now planning their annual pensioners’ Christmas lunch at which kids from the after school club will delight diners by singing carols. In nominating her mum and Suzanne, Meika told the Reformer: “Some of these men had not even been outside their doors in over a few years, so this got them back into the community. Most recently, they have set up a memories group where they meet and talk about the past. “These groups have created a great feeling and the residents have created a great relationship with Cathy and Suzanne and also give the kids from the after school a wee hello when they pass by.” Choking back the tears as Meika presented them with the Stems’ bouquets, Cathy said: “I am speechless. We don’t often get a pat on the back. That’s not what we do this for. But to be acknowledged like this is simply wonderful.” To nominate someone for a hand-crafted bouquet from Stems, send your name, address and contact number, the name of the person you wish to nominate and information about why you think they deserve to receive the Bouquet of the Week to: Say It With Flowers competition, Rutherglen Reformer, One Central Quay, Glasgow G DA, or email news@rutherglenreformer.

rural parts of Scotland being used as a cross-border dumping ground.Waste crime is estimated to cost the UK economy around poundm a year and is known to include the illegal transport and dumping of waste by hauliers travelling from England, Wales and Northern Ireland.But now illegal cross-border waste haulage and disposal is the target of a series of new multi-agency interventions.The pound.m Le Smart Waste Project clampdown is led by the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyand co-funded by the European Union.In tandem with police forces across Britain and the English, Welsh and Northern Irish environment agencies, the drive out waste crime initiative involves a series of road stops, site visits and awareness-raising activities to remind hauliers of their responsibilities and the laws.Kath McDowall from SEPArsquos Waste Crime Investigations Team told us: \"Intelligence gathered by the Le Smart Waste Project indicates that waste is being hauled from England and Wales and illegally deposited in Scotland.\"Several companies are known to be involved and many of these are under investigation by SEPArsquos Waste Crime Investigation Team for criminal offences.\"There are also indications of serious and organised crime group involvement in the transport, sale and disposal of illegal waste ndash so itrsquos vital that we work with partners across the UK to tackle this issue.ldquoWaste crime will not be tolerated and SEPA will, with its partners, pursue and take proportionate action against those who seek to profit from waste crime.Hauliers and building companies who ignore strict legislation can be hit with a fine of up to pound,, the loss of their operating licence and even a jail sentence.Agencies have been carrying out road checks on routes into Scotland in recent weeks.The multi-agency team pulled vehicles coming from Northern Ireland on ferries last month as well as making stops on the A into the Scottish Borders and Aat Gretna earlier this month.Waste crime flyers have also been distributed to service stations and truck stops either side of the England Scotland border.Lynsae Tulloch, Chief Operating Officer of the Scottish Business Resilience Centre, said: \"Illegal waste management is a blight on our environment, our local communities and businesses.\"These illegal waste sites mean foul odours, water pollution, pest infestations and the increased risk of fire, which results in essential funds from the public purse being erted to cover the clean-up costs.ldquoCritically, criminals involved in the illegal movement and disposal of waste are erting income from legitimate operators, depriving them of turnover.\"Some haulage firms are also being used to transport waste to disposal sites ndash without them even knowing theyrsquore involved in illegal activity.\""},{"url":null,"title":"portrait-of-success-for-becky","story":"A LOCAL photographer is in the frame after being recognised by her profession.Becky

identied major repair and refurbishment works were required.Engineers arrived at Galafoot on August  to begin the scheduled  weeks of work.But by early September it emerged the scale of deterioration in both the concrete sections and steel reinforcements beneath the surface was much greater than initially anticipated.Amey announced that full night-time closures would be required to finish the deck repairs, waterproofing and resurfacing by the scheduled October .But with just over a week until the planned completion date they have extended the timescales through to November.And bosses have also announced that engineers willto complete the extensive repairs in February.Ameys bridges manager Stuart Wallace said: ldquoThese refurbishment works were originally intended to prevent the further deterioration of the bridge structure by repairing defects at an early stage.\"This work has subsequently uncovered several previously hidden defects that far exceeded expectations and this is the reason for the increase to the construction programme.Since the introduction of a one-way system for west-bound traffic across the bridge with east-bound vehicles having to use the winding B near Abbotsford, there have been many reports of drivers ignoring temporary road signs.And many other drivers are using Melrose Road and Lowood Bridge, which causes tailbacks at rush hour.Rather than continue with repairs to Galafoot over the festive period and into the new year, Amey has opted to finish on November  andthree months later.Mr Wallace added: ldquoThe local community has shown incredible patience and understanding with the repair programme to date.\"Having listened to their concerns, we consider it prudent to avoid further disruption over the busy holiday season.\"This strategy will also mitigate against the possible impact that winter weather might have on this workldquoOnce again, we want to thank road users, businesses and residents for their goodwill, and we

and phone calls from concerned constituents about the recent building work in Bowmore.It has seen a footpath being built over one side of Bowmore#s rugby pitch.I had a meeting with the Islay rugby team and heard directly about their concerns.I have also contacted Argyll and Bute Council#s planning department numerous times, and, on September , I spoke with James Macintyre of Macleod Construction and made my views very clear on this matter.The potential new G pitch and footpath are much needed and more than welcome.That said there have clearly been large failings in the consultation process and this must not happen in future.In order to find the best way forward MacLeods will need to move rugby posts to new positions, using new sleeves and with an Islay Rugby presence during the operation.Leveling off of the west side of the pitch must be carried out using good soil with a view to extending the level pitch by several meters.Material for a ryelock fence should be provided by MacLeods and or others, and permissions given for construction of a standard fence.This fence should run between the timber fence at the rear of the housing estate and the timber fence at the car park, in a line running along the pitch side edge of the new path across the rugby pitch.This should make the extended area as near dog-free as possible and solve the serious fouling problem which unfortunately continues to exist.Regardless of how many of my fellow Ileachs feel, about where this pathway has been built and the lack of proper communication, the hard working front line workers, of Macleods are only following orders and any hostility directed towards them is unhelpful and unfair.If these changes and additions to the building works are made all parties will be happy and Islay will have a terric rugby pitch.Bowmore locals will have a new foot path and Islay can hopefully look forward to the prospect of a wonderful new G pitch in the future.Despite the upset caused by this issue it has been great to hear from so many of my constituents.Councillor Alastair Redman,Portnahaven,Islay."},{"url":null,"title":"rhunahaorine primarys playground

Reports that some of their friends had been seen near the town made the magistrates fear that they may try to help the prisoners escape.But what was troubling them more was the ldquoburdensome cost and inconvenience of incarcerating so many people. A decision on their fate was needed quickly.The town authorities had followed the law by putting them in prison. In fact, the law was clear that they should all be executed.But since there were women and children among them the Haddington authorities had hesitated to carry this out.They needed guidance and instruction from the Privy Council, and so a rider was dispatched with a letter asking for instructions, and the prisoners had to wait to hear of their fate. What had these people done to be under sentence of death It was nothing they had done. Their crime was who they were. They were gypsies just to be a gypsy was a capital offence.It was Arthur of Whittinghehame who had apprehended the families. The scene of this raid is not recorded.Was it a night raid, dragging women and children from their tents  Had they been families passing en route or camped nearby. Whole families were taken, but perhaps some escaped.Those who fled were perhaps the ones later seen near Haddington, worried and concerned about the fate of those imprisoned. No resistance seems to have been offered, forit had, the violence would have certainly been noted and used against them.They were accused of no crime other than that of being gypsies. It was a Privy Council edict in  which first declared the death penalty for being a gypsy in Scotland.It was written into statue by an act in .The Act called on all ldquogood subjects to apprehend gypsies and for the local authorities to imprison them and ldquoexecute to death the said Egyptians, either men or women. .And so these families were victims of a law that aimed to ethnically cleanse Scotland of gypsies. The Act was motivated by racist hatred and the only evidence needed to condemn someone to death was a Gypsy name, being known as a gypsy, or just associating with known gypsies.When the reply from the Privy Council arrived it was brutally clear in its instructions.It said there was a need to set an example to ldquothe rest of that infamous byke, thereby comparing gypsies to a nest of wasps or hornets.It continued: ldquoThe lords of secret counsel ordains the sherf of Haddington or his deputes to pronounce doom and sentence of death upon the men, and the women without children ldquothe men to be hangit and the women to be drowned.The women with children were to be spared death, but were to be ldquoscourgit threw the burgh of Haddington and burnt on the cheek.They would then be banished from Scotland. The Provost and bailies of Haddington were ordered to speedily carry out this sentence as stated. We can only assume these instructions were adhered to with little delay. If so, the executions will have been in public, and must have been a scene of horror, possibly witnessed by the friends and relatives.They were not the first gypsy families to suffer this persecution. In fact a number of gypsy families living in the Roslin area of Midlothian had previously been rounded up in . They had committed no crimes and kept a low profile. The Privy Council even complained that they were living ldquoasthey were lawful subjects. Their crime however, was to be ldquopart of an outlawed race and they were taken to Edinburghrsquos Tolbooth. The men were hanged and the women and children were banished from Scotland forever under pain of death.The aim of the persecution was to rid Scotland of Gypsies all together. So Gypsy families found themselves living like the wolf, hunted and in constant danger of capture. The Act of  was only part of it. An even earlier edict had empowered the masters of salt pans and coal mines to capture and enslave gypsies and other ldquovagabonds for servitude in the mines and salt pans.Many miners and salt panners at that time would have been enslaved gypsies. In many ways, their experience of state persecution and social discrimination mirrored that of the MacGregors, a Highland clan who were proscribed at much the same time.And like the MacGregors many gypsy families changed their names to avoid being identied.Others felt forced to changed their lestyle and hide their true identity, while some lived on the edge, with a constant risk of imprisonment or death. This was why there was a concentration of gypsy families close to the English border, as the laws were dferent in England.The attempt to exterminate gypsies from Scotland failed, they survived despite the persecution.But most of the misery and injustice caused remains unrecorded by history, although is not unforgotten by the gypsy community.In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries gypsies often shared the road with other travellers, many from the Highlands or Ireland, creating a gypsy traveller tradition with distinct cultural dferences between them, but a shared ldquonon-settled lestyle.But even when the laws were no longer enforced, the social attitudes towards gypsies and then also travellers excluded them.They were too dferent in the way they looked and dressed, and especially in the way they lived their lives. They had their own language and didnrsquot fit in. So I was told when I was wee.I grew up with derogatory comments in the playground about lsquoTinksrsquo and lsquoGyposrsquo. Such attitudes had been passed down by adults. Without knowing it I absorbed the idea that they were a people not to be trusted or liked. It was all self evident to me at the time because so many people were saying it.The truth is, of course, no community is all good or all bad, and choosing to select something bad to justy a blanket prejudice of a people is racism and intolerance of dference. I was angry later that I had been taught to demonise a people I knew nothing about. I discovered their history, not just their persecution, but their cultural and economic contribution to our country. Gypsies and travellers are rightly proud of their traditions, and I believe they are not ldquoother, but an important part of Scottish le and culture.It is sad that so many gypsy and traveller families, even today, hide their identity because of the discrimination they may face. And that discrimination still remains entrenched I think. I overheard a very loud ldquodiscussion about gypsies on a bus last week in which derogatory terms were used to describe them.It reminded me of things I was told when I was younger, and which I once believed to be true. It echoed the language used in the  Act and made my spine shiver.I didnrsquot challenge these comments, but I think I should have, constructively and politely. But to be honest I was afraid to.Irsquom ashamed about that ndash silence is the ground on which intolerance and hatred can grow."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-brewing-for-coffee-shop-and-drive-through-takeaway","story":"The Motor Fuel Group has applied to East Lothian Council for planning consent for the outlet on land to the west of the existing Shell petrol filling station on Edinburgh Road.

It was a lovely calm and sunny day, perfect for filming,I was halfway through the story when a group of local teenage lads approached. It seemed they were drinking and I anticipated them disrupting the filming.But I continued telling the story as it had been a perfect take up until that moment.The lads paused for a moment then all sat on the concrete walkway watching me and the film makers. They said nothing and seemed to be listening.I was able to complete my story uninterrupted.And as I walked away in the final shot I made eye contact with the lads and they respectfully waited until the filming had stopped before shouting, ldquoJohnny Moat forever! Then they got up and walked away.It was an unexpected and powerful moment for me.My assumptions about the lads had been utterly challenged as well.This was more than six years ago but I was reminded of it when I visited Johnny Moat this week with my wee boy Lewis.We were having our weekly storytelling walk in the Pans, a three-hour period between his nursery pick up and when I have to pick up his sister Skye from the Infant School.We just walk together visiting dferent places, and I tell him stories and he does the same.Most of his stories this day involved a T Rex or Raptor, which in his imagination wander about Prestonpans.So our respective tales were a bit dferent in content and style, but what is vital at this age is that he hears stories and is allowed to tell them freely.I told him the story of Johnny Moat and he said it looks like a whale.As we wandered from Johnny Moat up to Preston Tower, we stopped at what we call the lsquoStory Stonesrsquo.Here a small circle of stones sit underneath a cherry tree, with the tower looming behind. It is a perfect place to tell stories.Lewis gave me a new version of his T Rex tale here. I couldnrsquot understand all his story, but I got most of it.Then he said it was my turn so I told him a child-friendly version of the tale of the Green Lady. It made him want to go and look in the windows of the tower, which we did.The final story began at the old doorsquocot in the gardens by the tower. I explained it was a house for pigeons, but Lewis was having none of that.ldquoNo daddy, he said with a serious face, ldquoa lion lives there.ldquoReally  Can you tell me the story of the lion  I asked. And so he obliged.It was a great story, and we tracked the lion to the ancient Mercat Cross, where the unicorn sits on top of the pole ldquolooking for the lion.Then he spotted the lion on the  bus coming from Tranent.ldquoWill it eat the people  I asked.ldquoNo, he said asIrsquod asked an inappropriate question, ldquoitrsquos a nice lion.And so with the lion having left town, we headed for the Infant School to pick up his sister, but still keeping a look out for the T Rex.On the surface this may all seem a bit unusual, wandering about telling random stories that often didnrsquot make huge sense.But I value this time with my son, and as a storyteller I know the importance of it.Storytelling in this way when our kids are young helps develop what is called oral narrative ability, which gives a child the skills to explain and describe things, and develop their understanding of words and language.It fires their imagination and research shows that this can help with the enjoyment of reading and writing later on, and of telling and hearing stories.That night my son unexpectedly ed to the story of Johnny Moat.I had earlier told him it had fallen down and is lying face down in the sand and itrsquos too heavy to put back, but hopefully one day there will be a way.Like all kids his age, he took a while to process his thoughts on this. And these thoughts came out at bedtime.ldquoThe T Rex can put the big stone back, he said. I admired his total faith in the abilities of the T Rex.ldquoYes, maybe, I said. He fell asleep holding his T Rex which, for him, symbolises so much more than just an extinct dinosaur.As I headed downstairs, I thought about the connection between this day and the day over six years ago when I unexpectedly told the story of Johnny Moat to some teenage lads.Stories weave through us and bind us in a shared identity. But it made me sad that Johnny Moat still lies forgotten with his face in the sand.So Irsquom going to start looking for the T Rex of the Pans, whoever that may be, who can help. He or she must be out there somewhere. Or perhaps there is a crowd of them.The hope is that once my son is a teenage lad himself, he will be able to sit on the Girdle Rocks with Johnny Moat and tell the legend."},{"url":null,"title":"group-objects-to-750-new-homes-at-windygoul-south","story":"A planning application for the site was submitted last month by Walker Group Ltd.The site plan extends Windygoul South to the Charles River Research Institute and Carlaverock Farm.But at a TECC meeting, members voiced their concerns over the proposals.Robert McNeill, community councillor, told the meeting: ldquoIn all my years on the community council, I canrsquot recall us making a formal objection about any developments in Tranent.ldquoWe try to be very proactive to any problems and find a solution.

Enough is enough. The community canrsquot take it any longer.David Forrest, TECC chairman, shared these concerns, pointing out the lack of infrastructure as the main reason for objecting to the plans.He said: ldquoGrounds for an objection has to be that the infrastructure in Tranent couldnrsquot cope with another  houses on the south side of Tranent.ldquoAll that traffic would be travelling through the centre, whether itrsquos to get to Edinburgh or just to go shopping.ldquoTranent is unique, traffic-wise, in East Lothian.

The whole idea of being able to change someones outlook on le or change someones path in a positive way is incredible.\"A good teacher has the potential to have a positive influence on a pupil for the rest of their le. Eventhat only ever happens once then that is remarkable and the thought of having that impact is what drew me in.\"Sixty-year-old Glasgow-born Aileen Barrie, who lives in Airdrie, voices the same passion for teaching despite more than half a letime in the classroom.Now retired, the geography teacher said: \"I loved teaching. I loved being in the class with the children. When the door was shut and I was in with the kids that was the bit of the job I always loved.\"But her experiences in North Lanarkshire also left her disillusioned with the way schools were being run, with increasing pressures placed on teachers, mounting paperwork, cuts to resources and dwindling pay.\"It was things outwith the classroom that got to me eventually and I took early retirement. The level of assessment has become ridiculous with folder upon folder for each pupil.\"I felt isolated because of the constant cuts to support staff at a time when more pupils were coming into the classroom with increasing levels of dficulties.\"Overall, the pressure and stress definitely got worse. I always brought work home and when you enter teaching you expect that, but latterly it was well above what was acceptable.\"The \"last straw\" for Mrs Barrie was a request by her headteacher that she teach modern studies and history as well as geography to first year pupils.\"It was a financial move because it was easier to timetable, but I have got a science degree with geography and I havent done any history or modern studies since I was at school,\" she said.\"What does that tell us about the level of esteem we hold these subjects and these pupils in - that anybody can teach them without any qualications  It really angered me.\"Mrs Barrie is not alone in her concerns. A disturbing survey published earlier this year suggested a majority of Scottish teachers would not recommend the job to others.The poll by the Educational Institute of Scotlandteaching union found  per cent of respondents were unlikely to endorse the career to others while only two per cent would be \"very likely\" to do so.The greatest concern was spiralling workload, while changes to the curriculum and qualications, teacher shortages and stagnant pay were also highlighted as key areas of dissatisfaction.Like Mrs Barrie, teachers also raised concerns about the lack of support staff at a time when inclusion policies have led to an increase in pupils with more challenging behaviours.This apparently widespread disenchantment with teaching appears to be having an impact on recruitment and retention.Just over a decade ago there were more than , teachers in Scotland, but by  this had fallen to just over ,. While numbers have improved since then progress has been marginal.While teacher numbers will increase or decrease over time to reflect fluctuations in pupil numbers, the dficulties schools face in filling vacancies is a key indication of the popularity of teaching.This summer, just weeks before the start of the new school year, there were  unfilled vacancies across  of Scotlandrsquos  council areas.Many of the local authorities most affected serve rural areas including Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, Moray, the Highlands and the Western Isles.There have also been shortages of specialist teachers in key subjects such as mathematics, physics and computing. The Scottish Government has responded by increasing the number of teacher training places available, but some of the targets in shortage subjects have not been met.In addition, new figures revealed by The Herald show more than a thousand teachers under the age of  have left the profession in the past two years, with teaching watchdogs highlighting lucrative offers overseas as well as pressures in Scottish classrooms.At a time when teachers are moving towards strike action over the latest impasse in salary levels, Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS, argues the issue of pay is critical in restoring wider respect for the profession with a \"boom and bust\" approach in recent decades the underlying problem.Teachersrsquo pay has decreased signicantly since the McCrone Agreement of , which followed an independent inquiry on pay and conditions. A recent international report also concluded the pay of Scottish teachers was relatively low when compared to other graduate professions.Mr Flanagan said: \"Coupled with the countryrsquos continuing slide down international comparisons on pay, Scotlandrsquos teachers have endured a real-terms pay cut over the past decade.\"This has created a situation where teaching is no longer a desirable career for many graduates, with serious implications for teacher recruitment and retention and for education provision in many parts of the country.\"Seamus Searson, general secretary of the Scottish Secondary Teachers Association, agrees pay is critical, but believes a wider review of the expectations on teachers is just as important.\"What is expected of teachers now is becoming unmanageable. There are no curriculum leaders any more and declining support staff so teachers are on their own with responsibility for all sorts of extra duties. Pay is a big issue, but the workload is the biggest problem.\"The Scottish Government argues it is working hard to make teaching as attractive and accessible as possible and that recent figures show the tide is finally turning.John Swinney, the Education Secretary, said: \"We know there are challenges to overcome in teacher recruitment in Scotland, but we are facing these head on and the steps we are taking are working.\"Teacher numbers have increased for the second year in a row and there are now more primary and secondary teachers than at any time since  and the ratio of pupils to teachers is at its lowest since , this is welcome progress.\"But are there other factors at play  The issue of teacher shortages is not one that just affects Scotland. Some , teachers in England quit the profession in  representing about nine per cent of the workforce.Ken Muir, chief executive of the General Teaching Council for Scotland, argues wider societal factors are in part responsible for the current dficulties around teacher recruitment.Teaching, particularly in the primary sector, has always been heavily dominated by females, but in recent decades opportunities for women in other professions have increased substantially.\"One of the good things about Scottish society is that we have opened up more opportunities for women to embark on a much wider range of careers than was every the case before and teaching, because of its dominance of females, suffers as a result of that,\" said Mr Muir.Mr Muir also believes new post-Millennial \"iPad generation\" have a dferent attitude towards their careers than was the case in the past.\"We are seeing youngsters who have been exposed to a dferent type of background who are much more inclined to try something out and,it doesnt work, then they press the reset button and try something ,\" he said.\"That kind of mentality is something we are seeing much more of in teaching and it is one of the reasons why we cannot retain some of the younger teachers.\"The first couple of years are the most dficult andyou are one of these Millennials who is used to hitting the reset button when they are playing computer games then they take that kind of thinking into how they see their career and look for something .\"There is also a fear that intense political scrutiny on education with rival parties seeking to undermine the governments credibility on its self-styled \"defining mission\" is also fuelling negativity, which is then mirrored in the media.Brian Boyd, emeritus professor of education at Strathclyde University, believes there is a responsibility on politicians and journalists to think carefully about whether the narrative being created around education reflects current classroom experience. But he also believes teachers have a responsibility to talk up the job.\"There is so much negativity around schooling from political parties scoring points and that gets through to young people and they dont see it as a job for them. It seems to me we have to change that and at least sell teaching as a worthwhile profession with a high intellectual content.\"There is something in the psyche of teachers that makes them self-deprecating and they tend to talk teaching down to others and yet these are often teachers who love the job and have always been very enthusiastic about it.\"Probationer, Nicola Day, , who is currently teaching in a primary school in Fe, cant think of a better career than teaching and is happy to talk it up, but she also wonders whether ministers are genuinely listening to the concerns of the profession.\"Before becoming a teacher you have to make sure you really want to do it because you have to put your whole self into it. If you dont care with every fibre of your being then you are not going to be able to do it.\"That makes it a very tough job and the more dficult teaching is made because of curriculum changes or more paperwork or lower pay then the harder it will be to attract people. I think politicians need to listen to teachers more because so many voices in the profession are in agreement that these are the issues that need to be tackled.\""},{"url":null,"title":"government-set-to-back-world-leading-reforms-on-lgbti-education-in-schools","story":"The changes, which followed a campaign spearheaded by two equality activists, include relationships, sexual health and parenthoodeducation and an overhaul of how homophobic bullying is recorded.Ministers are believed to be sympathetic to a package of reforms that were produced by a range of stakeholders including the Catholic Church.Founded in  by Jordan Daly and Liam Stevenson, the lsquoTime for Inclusive Educationrsquocampaign was set up to combat homophobia, biphobia and transphobia in schools by calling for LGBT \"inclusive education.According to critics of the status quo, the support offered in schools for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex pupils is either patchy or non-existent.The TIE campaign urged MSPs to sign up to its five-point plan, which included a teacher training programme on LGBT issues, a reformed system for recording bullying and provisions relating to RSHP education.It also called for legislation requiring schools to be proactive in tackling bigotry, as well as better data collection.A majority of MSPs endorsed the TIE demands and the SNP Government responded by setting up a working group.The body, which included Mr Stevenson and Mr Daly, as well as representatives from the Catholic Church and the Educational Institute of Scotland, was asked to advise Ministers on the TIE pledges and make recommendations.Members of the thirteen-strong group are said to have largely backed the TIE pledges, including RSHP education, bullying and ensuring LGBT issues are covered in the curriculum.It is understood the group issued a report to the Scottish Government recently and Ministers are expected to announce support for the recommendation within weeks.However, the group has not backed a legislative approach, which paves the way for the reforms to be implemented without a new law.An SNP source described the recommendations as \"world leading\".The report comes nearly  years after the Labour-led Scottish Executive faced a backlash for repealing anti-gay legislation relating to schools.Under the Thatcher Government, local authorities were banned from promoting homosexuality, a policy which was believed to be discriminatory.The former First Minister, Donald Dewar, described the law as a ldquobadge of shame and made repeal an early priority for his administration in .However, SNP donor and businessman Brian Souter opposed the move and funded a private referendum in a bid to halt repeal.The Daily Record newspaper and the Catholic Church in Scotland, led at that point by Cardinal Winning, were also vocal opponents of Dewarrsquos policy. MSPs voted by  to  to abolish the ban.A TIE spokesperson said: \"We are delighted with the suite of recommendations in this report, as agreed upon by the LGBTI Inclusive Education Working Group, and they address the issues raised in our campaign pledge.\"These recommendations will deliver LGBTI-inclusive education in Scottish schools, thus transforming the educational experience for generations of LGBTI young people. We now hope that they will be accepted in full by the Scottish Government.\"Green MSP Ross Greer said: ldquoThis would be a monumental victory for the TIE campaign, LGBT young people and Scotland as a whole. Jordan, Liam and the team of volunteers at TIE have in just a few years and on a shoestring budget completely transformed the debate around inclusive education and it looks like itrsquos about to pay off.\"If the recommendations are as robust as is believed and the government commits to implement them in full, they will have the backing of a majority of MSPs and Irsquom sure of most people across the country.

Independence was only mentioned in passing.But such a sht raises dficult questions for Ms Sturgeon, who is edging towards her fourth anniversary as First Minister. If she quit tomorrow, what would her legacy be  In what way has she shted the power balance inside Scotland Politicians can achieve much in four years. By , Attleersquos Labour Government had created the NHS, legislated for a ldquocradle to grave welfare state and nationalised the railways.In Mrs Thatcherrsquos first term, the Tories clamped down on ldquoclosed shop arrangements in trade unions and allowed council tenants to buy their own homes. Many ofTony Blairrsquos most successful policies were pushed through in his first four years.A like-for-like comparison would be unfair on Ms Sturgeon. Attlee, Thatcher and Blair enjoyed huge majorities and had the full powers of the state to alter society fundamentally.However, Ms Sturgeon did inherit a majority from Alex Salmond, but lost it at the last election. She has also more powers at her disposal, including on tax and social security, than any of her predecessors. Our fth First Minister has the opportunity to effect transformational change.It is dficult to paint Ms Sturgeon as a leader with a radical record. Minimum unit pricing of alcohol was a bold move, but technically the legislation passed when Alex Salmond was First Minister. Integration of health and social care was a massive change, but have the public noticed Other policies seem symbolic rather than substantive. Ms Sturgeonrsquos child poverty targets become measurable in  and she wants Scotland to become ldquocarbon neutral twenty years later. It is easy to set targets which will fall on others to meet.As for plans to create a National Investment Bank and a publicly-owned \"not-for-profit\" energy company, these initiatives fall squarely into the category of ldquoyet to be delivered.Ms Sturgeon can expect to be judged on the three totemic issues she can influence: the health service closing the educational attainment gap and cutting poverty levels.On the NHS, which she used to run, some health boards have been so badly managed that they over-spent their budgets and incurred poundm in bail out loans. The Government solution is to wipe out the debts. Even SNP loyalists believe the move sends a message that financial profligacy will eventually be subsidised.Education - the First Ministerrsquos top priority - is faring little better. Swinney had to shelve plans for a ldquogovernance bill and support for P assessments has crumbled. Some of the poundm ldquopupil equity fund money given to headteachers has been spent reversing budget cuts previously passed on by the Government.For Ms Sturgeonrsquos critics, there is no golden thread running through the piecemeal, incremental changes implemented by her Government. They want a vision and a narrative, not a re-spray or a minor refurbishment.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard asked Ms Sturgeon the best question last week, which was ironic given the appalling time he was enduring with his warring colleagues. He noted the child poverty target for  but said: ldquoWhat is her target for  Ms Sturgeon avoided the question. In other words, a Government which believes itself to be on the centre-left does not appear to have a twelve-month target for taking poverty in the right direction.She also got her figures wrong.

In all cases where this action has been taken, the suspension will be regularly reviewed.Members could also be compelled to make ldquoappropriate restorative action, such as an apology, forced to ldquoundertake appropriate training, or be punished with ldquoany other proportionate sanction or requirement.Angus MacLeod, the current national secretary, said in his introduction that the proposals amounted to a ldquomodernising of our disciplinary processes and an enhanced approach on ldquobullying, harassment and social media use.Mr Neil, who has been an MSP since  and who served in the Salmond and Sturgeon administrations, told the Herald on Sunday.ldquoWe need to be very careful what we are doing here. There may be circumstances when it is perfectly justiable to suspend somebody right away, but it should be under very, very strict criteria.

Only He can determine someones journey.\"We believe that it is sending the wrong message to young people. There are plenty of homosexuals from all religions and they need support in the right way. This is not it.\"We heard at the service what many people think about events such as this. The feelings are quite strong but we are not here to confront anyone, we are just sharing Gods word.\"Many people feel that it is not about gay rights but the growing drive for a secular society here on the island.\"Churchgoers on the Isle of Lewis had issued a last-gasp demand for the council to ban the gay pride march in Stornoway.The Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland said it found \"this particular sin . . . especially evil and defiling in the eyes of the Lord\".In a letter signed by Allan MacColl of the Outer Isles Presbytery, the church urged Comhairle nan Eilean Siarto refuse permission for any public gatherings \"which promote the homosexual lestyle, beginning with the event planned [today]\".But the council, who refused to fly the LGBT rainbow flag because it apparently contradicted its flag policy - and also did not have anybody to put it up and take it down at weekends - said all the events would be allowed to go ahead, under the councils equalities policy.Organisers of the event say they have received a lot of support from organisations including NHS Western Isles, Stonewall, the Equality Network and local arts centre An Lanntair.Funds were also raised on the day for the local branch of the Penumbra mental health charity.The organisers say the event is about showing youngsters on the island that they have support as they contemplate issues surrounding their sexuality on the deeply religious island.Flags and balloons were available for people to carry while children were welcome.Some shop fronts were also decorated with the rainbow flag in honour of the event.But while it passed without incident, some marchers made obscene gestures as they passed Rev David Fraser as he carried a placard bearing the words \"repent\" and \"abomination\".Marcher Alison McCabe said she was taking part in support of a -year-old she looks after who is exploring her sexuality.A committed Christian herself, she says the message being sent out by the protestors is the wrong one.She said: \"I am a Christian myself and I believe that God loves everyone. Those protesting can confuse youngsters into believing that He would disapprove.\"I would like to think that the world has moved on and everyone should respect each other regardless of faith or sexuality.\"I was brought up to believe in love your neighbour, I still believe that and that is the message we are trying to get across\".Fittingly, the march took place under a rainbow as curious shoppers looked on as their usual Saturday in the town centre was briefly interrupted by a riot of colour and drag queens.One of the marchers, Jay Butler, says she hopes the townsfolk are supportive of their cause and the deep isions that appear are not as large as in previous generations.She said: \"God loves us all and that is what most people round here believe.\"We are here to embrace change and the majority of people are the same.\"We all should take that path and thats the way it should be\".Susanne Erbida, who is a member of the organising committee, said the group had thought it was ldquotime for the Western Isles to show support for the local LGBT+ community, especially in light of recent events.She explained: ldquoIt is a celebration of acceptance and tolerance, a happy, peaceful and positive event.ldquoWe want to show that it is ok to be dferent, that LGBT+ people do not have to be afraid to go public with their sexuality. That there is nothing wrong with being gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and anything in between.Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan backed the event - even though the former Scottish Government minister voted against same-sex marriage in Scotland, saying at the time he \"favours the traditional definition of marriage\" - in contrast to the position of the majority of the SNP government.\"An event like this would probably not have been possible here a few years ago. The fact that it is taking place now is a very welcome sign of how the islands recognise ersity as a strength. In particular, it is a sign of how more and more people recognise the rights of LGBT people,\" he said in a message of support.But the Rev. Graeme Craig, Minister of Stornoway Free Church , said as the march passed by:\"This is a sad day for the islands. Whatever form sexual immorality may take, it is nothing to be proud about.\"This event is sad and shameful. It will point people, particularly the young, in a wrong direction when it comes to identity, relationships and sexual fulfilment.

I told my father I could do better, and at the very least I could make them mathematically elegant. He dared me to prove it, and I did. I must admit I didnrsquot realise I had invented something new, he spotted it.Unlike mill wheels, the Carruthers Wheel can operate at a range of speeds, dependent on river flow, and could help power remote communities with no access to the electrical grid.Carruthers said: ldquoItrsquos a simple design that can be scaled to any size. A -metre diameter wheel at Bannockburn Falls would supply enough electricity for  Scottish households. A -metre diameter wheel at Lindsayrsquos Mill Weir would supply enough electricity for  Scottish households.ldquoSmaller more domestic sized versions of the Carruthers Wheel may be profitable in those areas of Scotland where there is a limited grid supply.ldquoI canrsquot give names of rivers because wersquore in negotiations, but we are looking at estates and farms, as well as small communities in the Highlands, where getting electricity to areas not attached to the grid would be worthwhile, because they would not need to use as much diesel or oil.The innovative design was tested at Abertay Universityrsquos hydrology lab by senior lecturer Rebecca Wade and her students.Wade admitted she was sceptical when she first received a call from Carruthers three years ago. ldquoWhen somebody phones you up and says theyrsquove reinvented the wheel of course you think hang on a minute, but I was intrigued, said Wade.Carruthers explained to Wade that her wheel can be used directly in river channels, rather than requiring a steady flow from a separate mill stream or mill lade.The Carruthers Wheel can cope with four times the water volume of traditional models thanks to hydro-dynamically designed blades.Wade said: ldquoPenny applied her mathematical understanding to how you might literally reinvent the wheel, reshape the blades, and understand the way in which the forces and action of water was working on the blades to maximise the power output.ldquoItrsquos so exciting that shersquos taken that pure mathematical knowledge and applied it in principal, just in the way the engineers hundreds of years ago were doing.ldquoThis wheel dfers from traditional water wheels in the same way that wind turbines dfer from windmills ndash they are old technology with a modern twist, harnessing natural resources to produce electricity, rather than grinding flour.Following successful lab tests, the team is now investigating potential demonstration sites in the east of Scotland.Wade said: ldquoWersquove been looking at some sites in Dundee and Edinburgh. Wersquove identied several sites that have existing weirs and wersquore speaking to landowners at these sites at the moment.Carruthers has set up a Perth-based Carruthers Renewables Ltd with her father to market the design overseas.She said: ldquoWe have the UK patent. Itrsquos the first water wheel to be patented in  years. We now have to go for the international patent.Carruthers also revealed she only began studying engineering in . ldquoIrsquom in my forties and I was always steered towards maths because thatrsquos what girls did when they showed an interest in science in engineering. Irsquom now gaining from the change in attitudes.ldquoI was just looking at water wheels as a mathematical exercise and itrsquos taken over my le. I now realise I probably should have been a civil engineer from day one.THE RISE AND FALL OF WATER WHEELS IN SCOTLANDThe first water wheels in Scotland are most likely to have been the type known as Norse Mills ndashsimple horizontal wheels with no gearing which were used to grind corn.These mills were in use in Europe more than  years ago, but it is not known when they arrived in Scotland. The Norse Mill at Shawbost on the Isle of Lewis and the Dounby Click Mill on Orkney are restored examples.The Romans brought with them the undershot, or stream wheel, and the overshot water wheel, both of which are vertical water wheels with gearing. One type of Roman mill once seen in Scotland was the tide mill. This was an early method of harnessing tidal power, and a growing number of archaeological remains are being found by drones over our coastline, such as at the Fe Ness ruins.Prior to the industrial revolution the most common form of water wheel in Scotland was the undershot. One example is at the Preston Mill, East Lothian, which was seen in the television series Outlander. Another example of an overshot wheel is the th century New Abbey Mill in Dumfries.In  John Smeatonrsquos scientic paper on water wheels heralded both modern industrial water wheels and the modern profession of civil engineering. By this time there were  mills on the Dighty Water in Dundee, making it Europersquos hardest working river. At the peak of innovation, the increased output of water wheels powered the UNESCO World Heritage Site at New Lanark.With the maturing of steam power, industrial wheels fell into disuse and the last commonly used water wheel, the Pelton Wheel, was patented in . This wheel was further improved by putting the water under pressure and the first high-efficiency water turbine was born."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Sturgeon shouldn t be afraid of a People s Vote on Brexit - it s the only referendum she s likely to get","story":"Yet, arguably the case for Scots to be given a choice is all the greater.

Academics created the experiment to understand what drives our internal body clock when itrsquos cut off from the outside world.Kane said: ldquoIn the first couple of hours what struck me most was how deafening silence is. The bunker is underground, itrsquos soundproof. The white noise was just phenomenal, and it never left the entire ten days. Any noise that I made scared me because yoursquore not used to that quietness. Yoursquore there with your own thoughts and nothing , and thatrsquos terrying. And it was damp and cold and dark.Evolutionary biologist Ella Al-Shamahi, who oversaw the experiment, said: ldquoAltering our daily rhythms is bad for our health. Studies on sht workers show thatwe regularly disrupt our sleep, wersquore at a greater risk of diabetes, heart disease and cancer. So, understanding our biological clock couldnrsquot be more important. To do that we need to strip away the trappings of modern le and even the natural rhythms of sunrise and sunset.ldquoExperiments like this have driven participants out of their minds.In a documentary about the experiment, to be shown on BBC Two this week, Kane is seen growing increasingly confused and frustrated as the isolation and darkness led to a deterioration of his mental health.Kane said: ldquoI was feeling more and more down because I was not exercising properly and was not getting daylight. Irsquom also a social person and I enjoy the company of other people. Without those three things, I found myself getting to the point where I could see how I could slip into depression or anxietythat isolation had continued beyond the ten days.In day three of the experiment, control of the lights in the bunker was taken away from Kane and he started taking unexpected naps because he had no way of knowing the time of day.By day four, Kane thought he was in day five. His sleeping pattern became more and more erratic, he began to struggle to concentrate on simple tasks and he found it increasingly dficult to exercise.His biological clock effectively moved thirty minutes every day, meaning he was going to bed later and getting up later.In the later stage of the experiment, Kane was woken at am ndash in the middle of his night ndash for the ldquojet lag phase. Al-Shamahi said: ldquoItrsquos ashersquos flown from New York to London.She saw Kanersquos reaction speed, physical performance and mental ability ldquotake a nosee. ldquoThatrsquos because his body is completely out of sync, she explained. ldquoHersquos active when he should be resting and resting when his body is ready to be active. Long term this misalignment can harm the health of sht worker and regular jet lag sufferers. Therersquos a strong link to mental health, too.As the end of the experiment approached, Kane was confused about how many hours remained. He said in the documentary: ldquoI have a small, niggling worry that this may not actually be day ninehellipit is doing my head in.Kane is seen roaring with frustration. ldquoYou can see how easy it would be to unwind psychologically, he said.He was free to leave the bunker at any time, but as a former Royal Marines Commando who survived tours of Iraq and Afghanistan, he was determined not to give up. ldquoMe being me, I was loathe to do that, he said.At the end of the experiment he emerged blinking into the sun at the height of summer, and immediately had to put on sunglasses to cope with the glare.Kane said: ldquoIt was like The Matrix. My senses were heightened. I could almost smell inidual plants around the bunker.Later that day he was on a flight to Greenland to film a documentary with naturalist Steve Backshall.ldquoEight hours coming out of the bunker I was standing in a fjord at two orsquoclock in the morning in broad daylight thinking, what the f**k has just happened, he said.Al-Shamahi added: ldquoWhat Aldo put himself through inside the bunker was completely extreme, but from an evolutionary perspective, the way most of us live now is also extreme.ldquoWe spend all day inside dingy offices and use articial light way into the night.

This includes travel costs to attend training or to compete on the Scottish mainland, which he believes can be prohibitive.#Grants and sponsorship are available and invaluable, but finding ways to reduce costs remains a challenge,# he explained.“I was also told that for some girls and women, the macho image associated with certain sports can be a disincentive to get involved. In that respect, having good female role models is important and in Orkney we are fortunate to have a great many.#The success of Anna Tait and Rachael Sutherland at the last two Orkney Sportsperson of the Year Awards illustrates this perfectly, with Anna winning from an all-female shortlist that also included Sarah MacPhail and Hannah Beavan, and Amy Golder taking the top junior award. Meanwhile, Orkney Dragons go from strength to strength, attracting more girls and women into playing rugby.Increasing participation is something that Mr McArthur feels we should all be able to support.#Role models are part of that, but we need to look at ways of removing obstacles, whether that be to do with funding, facilities or even, as Anna Tait suggested, making the image of a sportswoman more acceptable to young girls.“When you see those inspirational people within your own community, it’s so much easier to say ‘well why not me #copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The other sites being considered for the initial roll-out include Glasgow, Ayr, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Fort William, Milngavie, Oban, Inverness and Aberdeen.The units will be fitted with technology that will enable them to digitally track water usage at each Top-up point, transmitting the data via cloud technology to specialists managing Scotland’s water networks. The resulting data will be used to calculate cost and plastic savings, along with the volume of water being consumed.Douglas Millican, Scottish Water chief executive, said: “Our research shows that people feel very positively towards the quality of Scotland’s tap water — now these state-of-the-art taps can provide access to enable water drinkers to enjoy it while on the go by carrying and using refillable bottles.”The Your Water, Your Le campaign aims to make tap the first choice for water drinkers wherever they are, and encourages businesses to make it readily available for staff and customers. Zero Waste Scotland, Keep Scotland Beautul and Scottish Natural Heritage, have also voiced their support.On average, a litre bottle of water costs about p, so topping up daily from the tap, could save £. a day, nearly £ a year.For further information, visit yourwateryourle vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She called for the creation of prearranged collections for businesses seeking to deposit large amounts of cash, after the review recognised that such arrangements could be improved.The MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch said: \"As the MSP for Beauly and Kyle, I am of course disappointed that the RBS branches in both towns are to close.\"While I recognise branch use has been declining in both of these areas, there are still well-documented and legitimate questions regarding security and disabled access in the alternative banking provision.\"The review plainly states that the branch closure in Beauly will cause dficulties for vulnerable customers and so as the constituency MSP I am calling on RBS to work with me to put measures in place to provide specic support for them. I hope RBS will work with me to listen to the views of the community council to ensure there are better routes and provision in the Beauly area.\"The union Unite slated the announcement by RBS, arguing that the bank had simply gone through the motions of reviewing the cases before pushing ahead with its original plans.The unionrsquos regional officer, Lyn Turner, said: \"The Johnston Carmichael review was entirely predictable and nothing but a rubber-stamp of RBS management decisions. Sixty communities out of an original  with branches earmarked for closure will now be marginalised by this so-called review. Unite will request to meet RBS urgently to discuss the impact.\"Simon Watson, managing director of personal banking at RBS pledged to provide banking alternatives in Kyle and Beauly. He said: \"We know branches are important to many communities, but equally we know that fewer people are using them as more people bank online. In every case of a branch closing we are committed to providing the best possible range of alternatives.\"Sunday  Oct  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.I also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last  years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.Some parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability..."},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"Marc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves.

The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League.

He said: \"The trust is devastated to hear of yet another setback at Cairngorm, and we hope a timely solution can be found for customers and staff. We are disappointed it took a month since the funicular closures started for either HIE or Cairngorm to make a statement, and would urge them to be more forthcoming in future on what is a critical issue for the area.\"We hope we can be part of the solution and HIE will engage meaningfully with the trust in forming contingency plans and on any effect this issue has on the overall strategy for Cairngorm.\".He said: \"If HIE hadnt been in such a hurry to remove the Ciste chairs last year they may have had something to fall back on but too late for that now. The only real hope is that when the snow arrives it lies all the way down to the Cas car park so that at least the surface lts can run.\"Badenoch MSP Kate Forbes MSP said the obvious priority is to ensure that the funicular is safe.

Added to this, a further four football pitches worth of the reserve land would be temporarily lost to the construction site to accommodate the construction activities and the associated diggers, cranes and other heavy machinery.\"But the effects of the road scheme on the reserves wildle will extend far beyond the extent of roadworks activities.\"The noise and activity associated with the A construction works, and the increased traffic flows and the imposing road structure once the road is completed, will cause many birds to keep their distance and not attempt to nest or feed within several hundred metres of the road site.\"Transport Scotland has bought land at Dellmore near Insh Marshes and proposes to convert some of this to wet grassland to accommodate the homeless wader bird species from Insh. While RSPB Scotland has welcomed this, the charity said it will be hard to convert this land for the waders, and maintain it as such over the long-term.The spokeswoman said: \"It is far from guaranteed it will provide suitable habitat, and evenit does, the new habitat will not be big enough or suitable to rehome all of the waders that would be made homeless. Neither will it address other harm to wildle.\"Karen Birkby, RSPB Scotlands site manager at Insh Marshes, said several suggestions made to Transport Scotland to minimise impact on the nature reserve have been ignored.Aviemore Community Council made similar claims last week that their concerns had fallen on stoney ground over plans to construction the dual carriageway on the village side of the current A as part of the Dalraddy-Slochd section. They said it will impact on the popular Milton Woods.Ms Birkby said: \"We have continually made the case for protecting the exceptional wildle of Insh Marshes, minimising harmful impacts, and maximising environmental benefits such as enhancing or providing suitable new habitat nearby.\"While we welcome the intention of converting some land at Dellmore to wet grassland, it is far from guaranteed that it will provide suitable habitat for all the wildle affected.\"We understand the need for the A dualling but believe that it can be built in a way which minimises its impact.\"We have suggested several ways in which Transport Scotland could do this but disappointingly, they are not proposing these measures in the latest plans, so there is a real risk that the road scheme will result in long-term harm to a iety of wildle.\"We encourage local people to view the proposals online or attend the public exhibition and raise their concerns before the deadline of October .\"The proposals for Crubenmore to Kincraig went on show yesterday in Newtonmore Village Hall.

And it could yet be trebles all round for PJ MacKintosh’s men who are just one win away from clinching the premiership title to make it a hat-trick of senior trophies in , having already lted the MacTavish Cup earlier in the summer.After a frantic, but fairly even opening spell in which both goalkeepers made saves Newtonmore edged ahead on  minutes, and never looked back.Evan Menzies twisted away from his marker to rle in a shot from  yards which beat Stuart MacDonald, the Lovat keeper, at his near post. It was a bitter blow for a Lovat side striving to learn the lessons from defeat in last year’s final, when a slow start proved costly.Greg Matheson, the Kiltarlity side’s talisman, had the ball in the net but his effort was rightly ruled offside in what was a frustrating day for the Lovat attack.Newtonmore continued to make better use of the ball, and the wide spaces of the Mossfield pitch, and two goals on the stroke of half time all but settled the outcome.The second goal summed up the gulf in quality over the  minutes. The danger came after Lovat’s Craig Mainland shanked a shy on the right touchline, handing Newtonmore’s Jamie Robinson the opportunity for a hit-in of his own. From there his long looping effort was flicked to Glen MacKintosh who fashioned just enough space to steer a low bouncing effort beyond the ing MacDonald.Seconds later Menzies drilled in the third – another daisy cutter which crept in at the near post.When Marc MacLachlan, who had looked Lovat’s most likely goal threat, limped off after twisting his knee early in the second half the game was up for the Kiltarlity side.Newtonmore’s defence, in which youngster Crag Ritchie excelled alongside Rory Kennedy, Andy MacKintosh and Norman Campbell, held firm and keeper Kenny Ross would enjoy a largely trouble-free afternoon in what, at the grand old age of , was his first final.MacDonald made a terric save to deny Menzies a hat-trick, but the striker’s day was complete when he was awarded the Albert Smith medal as man of the match.He said: “Once we got our noses in front, with the defence we have we were always going to be tough to break down.“Hopefully there’s more to come – two points in the next game against Oban and we win the league, and that’s our target.”Lovat manager Fraser Gallagher conceded his team had been second best.“We didn’t have enough aggression in our defending in the first half, and put ourselves under pressure,” he added. “If anyone is going to knock them off the top it’s not because Newtonmore slip-up. Other teams are going to have to raise their standard. They should never be written off.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/logo.jpg","title":"skye based charity helps to save the live three people in five","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLisa MacInnes, director of the national organisation Save a Le Scotland has described the survival of Cherill Parryfrom Gairloch, Ian MacLeodfrom Inverness, and -year-old John Burgis from Port of Ness in Lewis — each of whom was treated with a LuckyBhere automatic external defibrillator — as “exceptional” and said that the work of the charity should “inspire other communities throughout Scotland”.On Saturday th June, Cherill Parry was walking her dog in Gairloch when she started to feel unwell. “I had been walking the dog and was feeling rough, so I went to the doctor. Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”Cherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.Having battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”Despite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of LuckyBhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like LuckyBhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be hereit wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”Three days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday th June, -year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took  to  minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”After being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.Having served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”During his  years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”On Wednesday th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, -year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.“John hadn’t been  per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was  — to take it easy, so we came home# We went to bed about  o’clock.”“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”Carol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled  and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about  years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”John was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”Carol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”Dr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by LuckyBhere is “truly le-saving”.“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every  seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by  per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.#The approach taken by LuckyBhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”Established in , LuckyBhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in  but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.In view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – LuckyBhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across theand breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.Last year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all  primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently  public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than  across Skye.Ross Cowie said: “We always said at LuckyBhere thatwe could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturdaywith the  Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.This season#s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on  points in the table # as goal dference isn#t factored in.Mallaig secured their place in tomorrow#s showdown after recording a fantastic - away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.Kyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved - home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.With the teams having scored  goals between them in the league this season # *including  in their three encounters so far, Saturday#s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.Having gone from - up to - down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.Mallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell#s side.Just as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor# side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.With only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon#s men.Ross Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side - ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.With less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon#s effort and with it seal his side#s playoff berth.After succumbing to a - defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting - win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts# unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.In stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before # which saw him earn a red card # Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.The south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.Kyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a  to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We#re still learning and hopefully improving.# #It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people#s expectations of you.# #I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.# #No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.#########################################-Article by Adam GordonAll images by Willie Urquhart."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales-large.jpg","title":"council wants scotrail to help ease disruption on stromeferry","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineScotrail are currently considering a proposal to terminate rail journeys at Strathcarron to allow road traffic to flow more freely through the ersion on the Stromeferry bypass.At a meeting in Lochcarron last week, Colin Howell , Highland Council’s head of infrastructure, said that the ‘road to rail’ ersion on the bypass, where important stabilisation work to the rockface is being carried out, could stay open to traffic for an extra  minutes each dayScotrail would agree to do this.

We have asked colleagues in the ScotRail Alliance to considerthere are any practical options further to minimise disruption to road users during the road works whilst still maintaining services upon which rail passengers depend.”Skye and Lochalsh MP Ian Blackford supported the introduction to the buses from Strathcarron.He added: “Network Rail seem to be sticking their fingers in their ears over this. A number of mistakes from both the rail company and Highland Council have led to the situation that we are in now and have been for some time.”“Network Rail must stop some of the trains coming from Inverness at Strathcarron and then arrange a bus service going onto Stromeferry. That would alleviate the ridiculous waiting times that passengers travelling by road are experiencing.”“The current way of working has caused no end of problems. We have kids being stranded on buses for hours and cues over  cars deep in both directions. To be fair the council at least seem willing to listen. We now need to get all parties round the table and hammer out a plan on this as quickly as possible, the current situation cannot continue.”"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27472  ","story":" Oisín Mac CannaDaly deserves credit for embedding the Irish language in multiple scenes across the film, serving to highlight the cultural and class gap between the occupying British forces and the oppressed Irish people. - Oisín McCann sets the scene of Famine struck Connemara at the height of An Gorta Mór.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere  on this is-land.Leo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society. They are not republican demands and it is long past that the British Government stopped prioritising its own selfish interests over what should be birth-rights of people they claim to represent.What is certain is that Direct Rule failed in the past and is not and never will be acceptable again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27474  ","story":" Mark MoloneyMartin said that while a decision on a merger with the SDLP or contesting elections in the North has not yet been reached, there were no circumstances under which Fianna Fáil candidates would not take their seats.FIANNA Fáil leader Mícheál Martin TD has confirmed that successful Fianna Fáil candidates standing in the North would take their seats in Westminster.

Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester.

It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society.

However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace process. test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8658944.1538772078!/image/image.jpg","title":"northern

When flying its important to work with the wind to plot the direction and path of a flight.Richard explained that hot air balloons work because hot air rises.By heating the air inside the balloon with the burner, it becomes lighter than the cooler air on the outside.This causes the balloon to float upwards, asit were in water. Obviously,the air is allowed to cool, the balloon begins to slowly come down.Henry Law, owner of The Little Ollie Balloon Team is a member of the retrieve team. He said he was delighted the balloon was able to make contact with Slemish. HISTORIC MOMENT He said: In order for me to retrieve the balloon when it lands, we use very precise location finders and two way radios, however I was able to see the balloon on the side of Slemish.Richard had radioed through to me to say he thought he would be able to make contact and Im so glad our on board GoPro camera captured the historic moment!Expalining how the balloon comes into land, Henry said: We normally like to land in a green field, and always try to seek the permission of the land owner before doing so.We pick non-crop fields and ones without livestock so as to cause no damage or inconvenience.Quite a large area is needed for landing as sometimes the balloon travels along the ground before coming to a stop, therefore the top of a mountain wouldnt have been safe to try to make a total stop.“However, making contact is a great achievement and we are so proud we were able to achieve it.

Although Rubys short le was filled with complex medical needs, it was a le filled with love from her parents Lisa and Andy, little brother Ezra and her wider family. Rubys mum Lisa told the : Ruby had the most precious personality. Anyone that met her - she took a piece of their heart straight away and they never forgot her. Ruby had to battle a lot day to day, but she done it with huge strength, she was fully depended on us   for all of her care. This was huge for us as a family. Ruby did not sleep at night. She had a lot of cerebral irritation and suffered from frequent seizures daily We, as her parents, were the only ones able to provide this care. This is where the Hospice played a huge part in our lives, Ruby attended the hospice for respite from the age of six months. The hospice is a home away from home that provides the most amazing care and love to the children and their families with full : medical care  . We, as a family, felt completely comfortable that Ruby was being cared for to the highest standard, in a place filled with love and joy. This gave us time to refuel to keep going that bit longer.The Hospice were also there for us in Ruby’s end of le care, we spent our final two days with her there, in the comfort of a home setting with the support of the nursing staff around us. This gave us precious time that we would never have got anywhere .We made memories that we will cherish forever and we are truly indebted to the Hospice for having such a signicant impact in our final days with Ruby. So, to remember Ruby on her birthday we are holding a birthday party fundraiser, with all money raised going to the Northern Ireland Childrens Hospice.The NI Childrens Hospice is the only one of its kind in Northern Ireland providing care to  children with le limiting conditions. The annual running cost of the Hospice is pound.million, that is for four rooms of the  the hospice has - the hope would be to get all  rooms funded and running.The government support is only % of this, thats why the Hospice relies so heavily on fundraising events to keep this facility running for families like ourselves.Lisa is also planning to launch a blogging website called chasingladybirds in October. This will help Lisa to share her own journey, Rubys le and in turn provide support for other families going through similar experiences.A face book page called Ruby Powells Journey and an instagram page ChasingLadybirds was the prelude to this, giving family and friends the opportunity to be updated throughout Rubys treatments and milestones.Lisa said: Everyone that knew Ruby knew that ladybirds was her wee thing.When she was only a few months old a ladybird landed on her toes one summer day and thats where it all started. In my journey of grief I decided that blogging might be a good outlet and a good way to share my story and journey of grief. Chasing ladybirds came from our connection of ladybirds with Ruby, and Chasing was down to we will always chase Ruby’s memory.We will never forget our memories and love for her - we will always chase every moment we had with her.Lisa and her family would love ityou can make it to Rubys Birthday Fundraiser.There will bouncing castles, soft play, face painting, nail painting, cake sale and a raffle with an array of great prizes. There will even be a live male wax at pm!The fun kicks off at pm until pm and most importantly all money raised goes towards this vital cause - a poignant and fitting way to remember little Rubys legacy.

My son was on the bus on this way into work when he looked over in the direction of the grave, he was shocked to see this massive tree lying on it, he rang me immediately and we headed up to speak to the cemetery staff.”It was during the course of a conversation with Council workers that Mr Osborne was informed that Council employees are not permitted to use chain saws to cut away fallen tress and that they have to wait on an outside agency coming in to carry out the work. He was also told he and his sons wouldn’t be allowed to do the job themselves.Gerry added: “I was shocked to hear this, I was more than willing to come up with my sons and remove the tree myself but I was told I couldn’t.“The cemetery staff have been very helpful and sympathetic, but the tree is still here over two weeks later, and it’s not exactly small. Whatone of us has an accident while we are here tending the grave  I understand that Belfast City Council’s hands are tied, they have been great, but we feel asthis outside contractor who has to carry the work out is in absolutely no hurry to do so, these are ridiculous health and safety rules.“The cemetery itself is beautul and very well kept by the staff, so whoever is responsible for cleaning up this mess needs to take a leaf out of their book and get on with it.”West Belfast Sinn Féin Councillor Stevie Corr said: “Under health and safety legislation council staff are not permitted to use chain saws, they are going through the proper process at the moment, but I know that is of no comfort to the Osborne family who are clearly and understandably upset.“I am a representative on the Strategic Cemeteries and Crematorium working group and I will raise this issue as a matter of urgency, I will also be raising the issue around giving our cemetery and park staff back the skills and authority to use chainsaws to cut down and remove obstructions like this. This is obviously outsourced and we want to bring it back in house again.”Cllr Corr added: “The matter was only raised with me today and we are already working on getting it dealt with.”A spokesperson for Belfast City Council said: “We are aware of a number of damaged and fallen trees at City Cemetery, caused by Storm Ali.

Dr Julie-Ann Maney, who was recalled to the witness box after giving evidence on Monday, explained that it appeared Caragh had \"respiratory dficulty\" and was \"breathing slowly\".Dr Maney added that respiratory arrest then caused her heart to stop and prevented oxygen from travelling to the brain.Mr ONeill was asked to check for signs of le, confirming each time he heard his daughter take and release a breath.\"I dont know whats wrong,\" he said, before through tears he added, \"I cant look at her.\"I tried to force a bottle in her mouth to seeshe would take it,\" he added, after stating that \"her eyes are closed and shes shaking.\"Shortly after emergency services arrived, the father was heard directing ambulance staff to his home. Seconds later, the call ended.Caragh spent two days in hospital before succumbing to a severe brain injury at half past one in the afternoon of February , .Dr John McCabe was the registrar at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children when Caragh was admitted. He told the court that trauma became the \"main dferential\" after speaking to Caraghs father at the hospital. The doctor displayed to the court the way in which Mr ONeill tried to revive his daughter, a movement he described as \"vigorous\". Counsel for Mr ONeill said it conflicted with that of another medic who gave evidence on the first day.Dr McCabe added that this did not change the approach to Caraghs treatment.Mr ONeill attended the inquest yesterday, which is set to last for five days."},{"url":null,"title":"a long drive home for armagh familys","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

One user joked it would soon be quicker to drive to Dublin than get through the airports security.Its thought bottlenecks occur because of people arriving at the airport too early for their flight while others show up at the advised time leading to more passengers than expected arriving at one time. The airport took to the social network to remind people to arrive at least two hours before departure.\"Carefully packing your bags at home can help us reduce the time it takes to get you through security,\" it tweeted.A spokeswoman added: \"We apologise to any passengers who suffered delays as a result of queues at security this morning.

It was not like it was going slow, it was just the sheer volume of people trying to get through.\"And by the time I got through it all the queue was just the same . It was a nightmare.\"He added: \"We went away for our holidays in the summer and had a  minute queue then. But you expect that over the Twelfth fortnight not at the beginning of October when it is mainly just commuters.\"The thing that really got me today was there was no one giving advice or even helping people who were about to miss their flights. There were some asking to get past to catch a flight and people were letting them through, but there needed to be better assistance.\"\"Had I missed my flight I would have missed important meetings today.\"The airport pledged to end long delays after it announced a new company would be taking over the handling of security. Wilson James will take over security operations on November .Belfast International Airport urged passengers to be prepared for security checks before arriving at the airport to speed the process along.\"Adhering to these guidelines and carrying only essential items in hand luggage can help reduce the need for manual checks at security, which can quickly cause queues to build up,\" the spokeswoman added.The airports guidelines include: Ensuring hand luggage is not densely packedAll non-essential liquids are packed in hold baggageAny liquids brought through security must be in a l resealable plastic bag All laptops, tablets etc must be removed from  hand luggage Remove all coats, belts etc"},{"url":null,"title":"hopes of eu deal rise as pm to table new border proposal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

The march had been banned by the then Northern Ireland government but went ahead in defiance.As those taking part met police lines, officers batons and water cannon to break up the march with dramatic images broadcast around the world.The events of Saturday, October ,  were a watershed in the history of Northern Ireland with events on that day widely seen as the crucible of the Troubles. NICRA demanded an end to gerrymandering and discrimination and called for \"one man, one vote\".The campaign signalled the end of unionist majority rule at Stormont. It also changed the face of nationalist politics and put the story of Northern Ireland to a global audience. ‘Euphoria’ followed violence at Londonderry civil rights protest  Ed Curran: Duke Street in Londonderry, where the RUC baton-charged civil rights protesters  years ago today, is widely seen as the crucible of the Troubles...

He paid tribute to the vision of former SDLP leader and Nobel laureate John Hume.

were united in their determination to combat the deep inequalities which scarred Northern Ireland – inequalities in housing, voting, and policing.The association demanded the principle of “one person, one vote”, an end to gerrymandering, elimination of discrimination in the allocation of government jobs and housing, the repeal of the Special Powers Act, and the disbandment of the Ulster Special Constabulary.Derry was a Catholic and nationalist city, administered for decades by a Protestant and Unionist majority.Mr Higgins added: “Although rooted in the soil of the North and summoned to confront the structural inequalities within the society of Northern Ireland, the Civil Rights Movement was part of a global struggle for human rights – a vision of human rights that extended beyond personal or inidual rights, a demand that stretched to collective rights, to shared rights.”He urged a new spirit of global solidarity, the same spirit and qualities demonstrated by the Civil Rights Movement of  years ago."},{"url":null,"title":"optimism increases that brexit deal can be secured soon","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

Of particular interest to local readers will be sections on Saul mdash the place of Patrickrsquos landing.Observing the interest of those outside Ireland on St Patrick, John began thinking seriously about his book project five years ago.He said: ldquoSt Patrick is so obviously supported across the world ndash what is it that causes that support ldquoI was brought up outside Downpatrick in Loughinisland. I assumed I knew everything about St Patrick. I wanted to see ndash what do we know about St Patrick  I wanted to go back. I wanted an anthology of peoplersquos writings throughout the centuries, build up a picture of what he was and what he means throughout our history over , years.John said some of his findings were a ldquototal surprise, such as the article by Maureen Donnelly lsquoThe Altar Stone of Saul Abbeyrsquo. This details how the altar stone on which Patrick is said to have celebrated Holy Communion ended up on a wagon owned by a man who wanted it for the doorstep of his new house at the junction of Saul Street and Scotch Street in . But the wagon overturned, the stone broke and it found its way instead to the Catholic Church in Saul.ldquoI never realised there was an altar stone of St Patrick actually in Saul chapel, John said. ldquoI went three times to try and see it. I could not get in the first time as there was a ceremony on. It took me a bit of time to find it. This is one of the earliest and possibly holiest relics in Ireland open to all to see.John said he was also ldquoblown away by a stained-glass window, lsquoPatrick Arrives in Saulrsquo, in Saul Chapel.ldquoThe three windows are designed so the three windows show one image, he explained. ldquoIt is absolutely beautul.John is the author of many books, including The Irish Christmas Book and The Unkindest Cut: A Cartoon History of Ulster -, as well as books on the Irish famine and the United Irishmen.Surrounded by sites linked to our patron saint in Downpatrick, John believes at times we ldquocanrsquot see the woods from the trees.He points to the massive success of less important sites in the south, or how such a historical location would promoted ldquoto the nth degree in the US.ldquoI think that is the challenge for people here today, he said. ldquoThere is so much scope, there really is. I think we lose the wood from the trees. So many stories, so many things to pursue.Interestingly, his research points to an attitude from some in the south of Patrick being a ldquonorthern saint. There is also, of course, the increased secularisation of Ireland.ldquoBut there are still a massive amount of people who are people of faith, John continued.ldquoWe live in an area of huge historical importance.

Evenyou didnrsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. Itrsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.Thatrsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.Irsquod say that you canrsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.Itrsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really donrsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I donrsquot think theyrsquore going about it in the best way.If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as yoursquore passing.If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to seethere are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isnrsquot going to do me much good.A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isnrsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the storersquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where theyrsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.We wouldnrsquot have had the ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that therersquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go therethey donrsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast arenrsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but itrsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, wersquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so therersquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses canrsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. Itrsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.If Translink brought back opentickets, Irsquom sure wersquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break. Some people are understandably cautious of driving in unfamiliar places, especially towns but four hours on a bus in one day doesnrsquot leave much time for relaxing or shopping.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

definition of a victim to be amended to ensure that innocent people are no longer placed in the same legal category as bomb-makers.Mrs Foster was speaking after the DUP lodged its response to the Northern Ireland Office consultation on addressing the legacy of Northern Ireland’s past, the deadline for which was Friday.The party says the status quo is “unacceptable” and in its submission called for a statutory definition of collusion and new protections for veterans.New UK-wide legislation to improve the definition of a terrorist victim is necessary, she said.“In our opinion, there is a clear distinction in law between a terrorist perpetrator and their innocent victim,” she said.“To equate the two is morally wrong and indefensible.”Mrs Foster said: “The DUP has major concerns over elements of the draft Bill proposed by the Northern Ireland Office, and without signicant amendment, anticipate it will not meet the objective of properly addressing the legacy of Northern Ireland’s past.”The main amendments the DUP is calling for to the government’s bill are a statutory definition of collusion and new protections for veterans.“The attempts to tarnish the RUC and the armed forces have been aided by ‘collusion’ not being defined in law,” she said.“Going forward we want to see this defined so where cases of carelessness or incompetence are treated as misconduct cases as opposed to ‘collusion’.”Where UK veterans – of whatever campaign – have already been properly investigated there should be an end to “witch-hunts”, she added.The submission says on collusion: “We are supportive of setting out to define collusion in legislation, thereby excluding low level incompetence being used to claim wrongly that collusion was evident. We were asked by victims’ organisations to secure full criminal investigations for the victims of terrorism, and onlythere is evidence of criminal behaviour should security force actions necessitate a full investigation.” And it also presses for “legislation that will provide greater legal protection for the Armed Forces and Veterans so that they can no longer become victims of a witch-hunt, whether because of their service in Northern Ireland or in other parts of the globe”.Victim named after blaze found by chanceMichael D Higgins lauds civil rights protestors Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The submission also expresses concern about the new – and it says  – term of “non-criminal police misconduct”.It is supportive of the idea of a “new body” with“full police powers” to look into Troubles cases.It said the party regards such a move as “the best opportunity for justice”.“It is important that any new structures would be proportionate given % of deaths were caused by terrorists, and there should be an end to witch hunts against those in the forces of law and order who acted bravely, honourably, and appropriately,” said Mrs Foster.“We consider the status quo to be unacceptable, with innocent victims inexplicably the only group currently not seeing some level of progress with investigations.”The party is supporting a new police unit,necessary, because many victims still wanted the murders of their loved ones probed and there are legal reasons why it may have to be independent from the PSNI, she said.Morning View, page Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy  Cookies Policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8650865.1538135668!/image/image.jpg","title":"education","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to Johnston Press# Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Education   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Education Politics Crime Farming Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat News Politics Crime Farming Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Education      Comedian Patrick Kielty stands up for integrated educationNorthern Ireland comedian Patrick Kielty has given his backing to the integrated education sector.

None of them had been there before.“Presumably they were being built to fulfil some new requirement [for heat] but it was not clear what that requirement was – other than to harvest the RHI.”The examples led to a research paper which expressed concerns about flaws in RHI – both the potential for fraud and for ‘gaming’ the system, a manipulation of the rules, sometimes to an extreme extent, to the financial advantage of the applicant and generally outside the spirit of what is a subsidy meant to improve the environment.Millar Farr, a ‘role model’ for Royal Black Institution members, passes away Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Ofgem chief executive accepted there had been “signicant failings” on the part of Ofgem in that it did not pass on to Stormont multiple examples of how the scheme could be abused.He said that Ofgem staff were “trying to do their jobs” but “it seems clear that somehow they didn’t think it was their to deal with gaming of the scheme”, part of a wider hands-off approach by Ofgem which saw its role as simply administering RHI while the rules were set by the department.He admitted that “may not sound terribly impressive” but he believed it was the truth.He added, however, that there was a sense within Ofgem that it had warned DETI about the potential for abuse at the outset and DETI had not listened.Documentation which Ofgem has submitted to the inquiry shows that on multiple occasions it received allegations about how the scheme was being abused.One whistleblower said: “I have personally seen boilers installed in previously unheated warehouses with radiators covering most of the wall surfaces to keep the meter turning.”try catch     .               ..

Doug Beattie, Ulster Unionist MLA and the partys legacy spokesperson, and Arlene Foster, DUP MLA and leader Previous comments from DUP leader Arlene Foster are “signicant” as they stand “completely at odds” with what Mrs Foster has said more recently on the issues, he added. “She needs to state clearly where the DUP stand on support for the Historical Investigations Unit, and the legacy proposals in their entirety,” Mr Beattie said.“If as they claim that ‘all draft legislation will only be introduced...it is agreed with the DUP’ why on earth are we and others looking at draft legislation which has rightly been described by the Police Federation of Northern Ireland as a ‘monstrous circus’.“When you also consider that the DUP claimed in September  that ‘there is no proposal for an independent police force’, it calls into question their strategic direction given that the HIU will actually be a parallel police force with an all-powerful director in charge, operationally accountable to no-one.”The NIO’s consultation process to address the legacy of the Troubles was launched in May and had been due to conclude on September , before the deadline was extended to yesterday.In yesterday’s News Letter, Police Federation NI chairman Mark Lindsay emphasised that his organisation was totally opposed to the “ludicrous process” which, he said, attempts to equate terrorists with police officers.The proposals will fail to deliver closure to families, who will be given  hope that by blaming police officers they will get closure or convictions, he said.Doug Beattie said: “The Ulster Unionist Party has been absolutely clear – this is a scandal which must be stopped and the proposals scrapped.“The DUP can’t continue to hide on these issues. Changing the definition of a victim, although welcome, is not enough. It wouldn’t address the fundamental, structural flaws with the legacy proposals and the draft legislation which the DUP claimed that they have a veto over.”However a DUP spokeswoman responded that the “immoral definition of a victim” first appeared under the watch of the UUP.“It was under UUP stewardship the current immoral definition of a victim was first used,” she said. “It was under a UUP agreement that the prison doors were opened and murderous victim makers were released. It was under UUP stewardship that the RUC dismantled.October : Working class Protestants suffered from poor housing too, says Campbell Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“The DUP has a proud record of delivering for victims and support groups. Indeed Doug Beattie would do well to remember Mrs Foster and her family felt terrorism directly.”She added: “We will oppose any rewriting of the past and ensure victims always have access to justice. We encourage people to go to www.mydup and read our document – there is little to indicate that Mr Beattie has.”However UUP councillor Jeff Dudgeon also challenged the DUP to explain why it agreed “such horrendously dangerous approaches” in the Stormont House Agreement on which the proposals are based. “Merely changing the definition of a victim simply won’t cut it,” he added.try catch     .               ..

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

To date the  Accelerators have raised more than pound, for UK charities between them.The guests were given a tour of the House of Commons before the main event, hosted by Luton MP Gavin Shuker. Stonegate chief executive, Simon Longbottom, commended the graduates and the Stonegate development team.He said: ldquoPeople are at the heart of what we do.

As well as being a memorable occasion for the Accelerators, we believe it is important to help MPs understand the vital role that our company and the wider pub and bar industry play in offering, not just jobs, but worthwhile progressive careers, with arguably the best opportunity out of any industry to go from the bottom rung right to the very top. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is unacceptable and must be urgently addressed.“We are calling for clear and fair remuneration and reimbursement so that investment can take place to meet safety, quality and efficacy requirements.

The Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies dinner, with sponsor AL Goodbody, saw dozens of those making the list attend a grand gala dinner at the Ulster Museum in Belfast. They heard from guest speaker Andrea Leadsom, who restated the Governments commitment to no hardening of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and its determination to not have any customs border between NI and the rest of the UK. \"I am fully aware of your concerns as business leaders in relation to Brexit, particularly in relation to the border,\" she told her audience at the Ulster Museum. \"I know the success of many of your businesses, and your day-to-day lives, relies on frictionless trade and travel across the border. Let me assure you that we dont want this arrangement to change when we leave the EU.” The event also heard from Ulster Business editor John Mulgrew, who said companies across Northern Ireland were exhausted due to the deadlock at Stormont, and remain concerned over what damage a ‘no deal’ Brexit scenario could have on their bottom line. “It’s quite clear that anything that leaves us with a ‘no deal’ scenari, in simplistic terms, is not going to work, or be acceptable to you, and thousands of other businesses across Northern Ireland,” he said. And speaking about the lack of an Executive, he said: “Everyone here knows it’s not acceptable. Everyone here is tired talking about it, and wants it sorted now, rather than when it’s convenient for those who are supposed to be here to govern us.” Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said that since the Top  two years ago, little had progressed in how Brexit would be dealt with. “We would all have hoped that by now we would have some sense of what the future business environment might look like. But, sadly, that is not the case. “Every day at AL Goodbody, we’re getting calls from companies of all sizes, right across the Island of Ireland and beyond who are seeking some sense of clarity on Brexit-related legal matters. “That means, every single day, we hear that NI Plc is still grappling with that same ‘great unknown’ Mark spoke of at this event two years ago. \"And when you add to this the political deadlock and over  days without a local government, its no wonder our clients and the wider business community find ourselves in a very challenging situation.” The Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies magazine is the leading list of the region’s top businesses, ranked by turnover. Overall, pre-tax profits among those making the list grew by %, rising to £.m And turnover among the Top  increased by %, to just shy of £bn. Moy Park kept the top spot, for the seventh year running, with turnover of £.bn. And since publication, that turnover has grown further still.

For reference, this is one of probably more than a dozen trips I’ve paid to the country in the last decade.Antwerp is an accessible port city, known for its diamond quarter. Its main train station is also something to behold. Listed as one of the world’s most beautul stations, it fuses century-old architecture with grand ceilings, along with its multi-storey renovation in .The main town squares in Belgium’s northern cities each have a familiar style, with Antwerp’s Grote Markt akin to the capital’s larger Grand-Place. These spots are worth a dander around on a hot day, but expect to pay tourist prices at the raft of outside eateries which scatter the perimeter.Temperatures in Belgium tend to fall in line with the south of England – a warmer climate than Northern Ireland, with the mercury hitting the late s during the summer.On this latest trip, it was a high of C and a low of a little over -odd at night. Scorching, but with a crisp Belgian strong pale ale in hand, that’s all made right .In Antwerp, and Brussels, you’ll find a raft of beers from the six Belgian Trappist monasteries – highlights include Rochefort , Westmalle Tripel and the highly sought-after Westvleteren  –  and those from the more-modern producers, such as Brussels Beer Project and De Struise, fairly readily across the capital, and the surrounding areas.Frites Atelier is a popular spot for high-end Belgian frites, topped with items such as truffle mayonnaise, Indonesian peanut sauce and a stunning traditional Flemish stew. It’s normally bunged, but the system ensures you aren’t waiting long – and it’s definitely worth the visit.One of Belgium’s beer-known beer spots can also be found a short distance from the city centre. The Kulminator is a somewhat eccentric spot, run by a husband and we team. It has a traditional brown cafe feel, cluttered, but has the most extensive range of aged Belgian beers I’ve come across. To continue the beer theme, we headed to the small town of Lot – before heading on to Brussels for the rest of the stay.It’s home to Drie Fonteinen – one of Belgium’s most-revered sour beer producers and blenders. A couple of hours well spent with one-off brews and vintage offerings, paired with a platter of beer pate, cheese, bread and pottekeis – a fresh cheese spread, somewhere between a smooth cottage cheese and sour cream. Now, in Brussels there are more than a few great spots for both a wide-range of top-end Belgian brews, and a warm atmosphere.The central La Mort Subite is a grand cafe located close to Grand-Place, with a solid range of beer, while Delirium Cafe – known for having the largest selection of beer in the world – is worth a visit. If you’re going as a beer geek, peruse the vast ,+ bottle range and find something you can’t get back home, but be aware than it’s become a tourist mecca – with backpacking students filling it in the busy periods to get a filter-clad snap for their timeline.Moeder Lambic has two spots – one central and one further south. Both are superb, modern Belgian beer bars, with a strong tap selection and the best meat and cheese board in the city.Brussels has a couple of breweries in its city centre, but Cantillon is the place to visit for those who are either fully immersed in beer, or want to expand their palate.You can also eat well in Brussels, with lots of spots serving good meat, cheese and pate, with bistro fare such as Flemish carbonnade and rabbit cooked in gueuze beer. There’s also an undercurrent of ‘all-you-can-eat’ rib appreciation, with Amadeo – and similar spots in other cities such as Ghent. We also opted for the beer-friendly and cosy Nuetnigenough. Starters and mains include black pudding with gueuze beer sauce, veal meatballs and rabbit fricassee with gueuze.For seafood, the bustling outdoor Noordzee is a great place to stop off for very fresh mussels, prawns and crab.It’s dficult to know whether the city’s reasonable hotel prices, and flight costs –booked far enough in advance – are in part due to the terror attacks in . But Brussels is a city moving on from that particularly dark period in its modern history.We stayed at the five-star pole – a grand Art Deco hotel with spacious rooms. On this occasion we paid little over £ a night.Aside from places to eat and drink, the city centre is a very walkable place – it’s the sort of place that merits exploration. The city also boasts a thriving jazz centre, and it’s worth checking online to see what’s happening during your stay.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete.jpg","title":"meat merchant to expand into republic","story":"Posted on Monday October  by John Mulgrew Meat mogul Peter Hannan says he will expand the retail arm of his successful Co Down business into the Republic this year, Ulster Business can reveal.The Kildare-born businessman, who runs Hannan Meats in Moira, also believes that, following the negative outlook for the economy in the wake of the vote for Brexit, that the UK’s exit from the EU won’t happen.In an interview with Ulster Business, Mr Hannan said: “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit.

A company linked to Newry man Brian McConville, who runs the successful MJM Group, has submitted plans for the extension and refurbishment of  –  Donegall Square East. The works include a new extension, with plans for commercial use at the basement, ground floor and four floors, and office accommodation on the first to third, fth and sixth. A design statement from architects Hamilton says the design intention is “to remove any unsympathetic additions and alterations within the listed buildings, retain the original plan form of the buildings, and conserve all extant historic features”. That includes ornate cornices, ceiling roses and moulded timbers “all of which survive in relatively good condition throughout the building”. The design document says the “new work within the historic structure will follow conservation principles of maximum retention of historic fabric, minimum intervention, reversibility, honest, clarity and sustainability”. Brian McConville’s MJM Group is one of Northern Ireland’s fastest growing companies. MJM Marine is MJM Group’s main business, based in Newry, and headed by founder Brian McConville. It was set up in  by Mr McConville, and carries out work for many of the world’s top cruise liners, including Star Cruises.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam.

Alan was a little out, but not by much, writes Justin Rush.  The automation of processes has been one of the hottest discussion topics in . Given that recruitment of staff is a tremendously time intensive process, and one which requires consistency it must surely be a perfect candidate for automation  Well yes… and no. Automation can assist a great deal, but it can’t do everything, not yet anyway.  It is important to know, candidates that are active in today’s employment market are more and more accustomed to using automated chatbots as part of the recruitment process. Non-human involvement equates to zero bias, and therefore reinforces fairness. This is a massive plus point. In a survey by Allegis, % of candidates stated they were comfortable interacting with AI and recruitment chatbots in the early stages of the application process. An even larger proportion - % - were comfortable with chatbots taking care of interview scheduling and preparation.  So what benefits can your business gain from appointing a Recruit-bot Streamlining the applicant journey, by ensuring consistency in the recruitment process and asking screening questions and answering FAQs.Ranking applications, this can be undertaken fairly and quickly based upon candidate submissions. As a result shortlisting is quick and clean.Scheduling assessments and tests, this can be straightforward and without human involvement.   responses, your bot will can exist across your website and all social channels simultaneously.  Your recruitment is now ‘always on’ engaging with potential hires.Repetitive tasks eliminated, creating reports, sending on-line forms or adding candidates to a management system can be a thing of the past.  So automation can really help, especially when volume of applications is a potential issue and you need consistency, or when you are recruiting globally across time zones and don’t want to miss out on a potential inquiry.  Some issues do still remain, despite the efforts of articial intelligence to do it all. In the main, these are the human factors, for example, the assessment of certain competencies that are essential for a job such as team-working.   At present, bots aren’t quite ready to handle the intricate aspects of the recruitment process that require patience and finesse. Answering more specic questions that more specialist professionals may want to ask about a job opportunity, selling the career opportunity or negotiation of salary and terms. These aspects are not part of any readily available algorithm… yet.
