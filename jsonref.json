I had to say to personal my trainer “I can’t do that, because I will wet myself”. It gets embarrassing,’ Danielle added.The problem continued in a series of awkward situations, which include getting hayfever and weeing whenever she sneezed.The star appeared on the show with her mum Jackie (Picture: ITV1)Danielle – who’s mum to Archie, Harry, George and seven-month-old Ronnie – revealed that the £2000 treatment has since made her life easier.However, her fiancée, electrician Michael O’Neill, was originally against it as he thought it was for cosmetic reasons.Brushing off his worries, she quipped: ‘I don’t think a man can understand what it’s like until you actually give birth, what it’s like to sneeze and wet yourself.’When quizzed about the high price tag, she added wants it done on the NHS to help other people with incontinence – but the This Morning doctor said in its current state it wasn’t plausible.Where is Holly Willoughby\u0027s outfit on Wednesday\u0027s This Morning from?Bringing her mum Jackie along for the procedure, the star completed the non-invasive treatment in just under 30 minutes.In what ‘sounds more painful than it is’, the laser treatment burns the inside of the vagina to create collagen to help tighten it.The results are so good, her mum wants one now too!This Morning continues weekdays from 10.30am on ITV1.If you\u0027ve got a story, video or pictures get in touch with the  Entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we\u0027d love to hear from you.MORE: Where is Holly Willoughby’s outfit on Wednesday’s This Morning from?MORE: Danielle Lloyd feared for baby Ronnie’s life when he got stuck during labour"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sei_7829541-e1524652023680.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"diana princess kate middleton not royal familys titles explained","story":"Diana, Princess Of Wales, was known as the People’s Princess (Picture: Tim GrahamGetty Images)Prince William and Prince Harry’s mother Diana is most commonly known as ‘Princess Diana’.This has led to much confusion, however, over why Diana was given a Princess title when Kate Middleton has never been made a Princess following her marriage to Prince William on 29 April 2011.Kate still adopted a fancy title – Her Royal Highness The Duchess Of Cambridge – or Catherine, Duchess Of Cambridge. But she isn’t ‘Princess Kate’.So why was Diana given a Princess title and Kate was not?Well, the fact of the matter is: she was never given a Princess title.Diana’s official title upon marrying Prince Charles Of Wales on July 29 1981 was actually Her Royal Highness The Princess Of Wales. She was also known as Diana, Princess Of Wales.(Picture: DAVE LEVENSONREXShutterstock)And while Diana – who was formerly known as Lady Diana Frances Spencer – may have had Princess within her full name, it was never her formal title, which would require Princess coming first, followed by her first name, much like Princess Charlotte.In fact, Diana herself admitted that her public-given title of Princess Diana was not formally correct.Kate Middleton wears Princess Diana’s tiara (Picture: Rex)Prince William was born His Royal Highness Prince William Of Wales – and is referred to as Prince William as he was born into the royal family – the Queen gifted him a new title on his wedding day, becoming the Duke Of Cambridge.This is why Kate – whose full name is actually Her Royal Highness The Duchess Of Cambridge, Countess Of Strathearn and Lady Carrickfergus – became a Duchess instead of having ‘Princess’ within her title.So while Diana indirectly became princess upon marriage, for someone to assume the title of Princess, they must be born into the Royal Family, just like Princess Charlotte is a Princess because of her father’s status.However, if Harry and Meghan were to have children, they would not automatically be called Prince or Princess as there’s another layer to the Princess rule.Meghan and Harry’s children would be given the title of Lord or Lady, taking the surname Mountbatten-Windsor – a nod to Prince Philip’s family name.In 1960, the Queen passed a ruling which only entitled the children or the grandchildren of the sovereign to take the title of Prince or Princess.However, for the grandchildren to take the titles, they must be born to the sovereign’s son – not daughter.In the case of Zara and Peter Phillips, for example, they are the children of Princess Anne. Anne is the Queen’s daughter and as the children of the monarch’s daughter, they do not hold a royal title.Zara Phillips, pictured with husband Mike Tindall, is not a Princess as she was born to the Queen’s daughter – not a son (Picture: Max MumbyIndigoGetty Images)All of their cousins are children of the monarch’s sons – Charles, Edward and Andrew – so their children do get the royal titles, such as Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.So why are Prince George and Princess Charlotte allowed to carry the coveted titles?In 2012 – one year after Kate and William married – the Queen allowed all children of William and Kate – her great-grandchildren – to take the Prince or Princess titles too.The ruling does mean, however, that Princess Charlotte’s children are unlikely to be called Prince or Princess, just like Princess Anne’s children were not.Harry and Meghan’s prospective children could be upgraded to Prince or Princesses when the line of succession to the throne changes as Prince Charles ascends the throne.Prince Harry would then likely become HRH The Prince Henry, meaning Meghan would become HRH The Princess Henry.The following line of succession accounts for Mike and Zara Tindall\u0027s second child, due this summer.1st - Charles, Prince of Wales (b. 1948)2nd - Prince William, Duke of Cambridge (b. 1982)3rd - Prince George of Cambridge (b. 2013)4th - Princess Charlotte of Cambridge (b. 2015)5th - Kate and William\u0027s third child, a baby son who is yet to be named (b. 23 April 2018)6th - Prince Henry of Wales (Prince Harry) (b. 1984)7th - Prince Andrew, Duke of York (b. 1960)8th - Princess Beatrice of York (b. 1988)9th - Princess Eugenie of York (b. 1990)10th - Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex (b. 1964)19th - Baby Tindall (due this summer)20th - David Armstrong-Jones, 2nd Earl of Snowdon (b. 1961)Of course the Queen may also choose to make an exception for Harry’s children, if he and Meghan choose to start a family, like she did for William.It is thought Meghan Markle will become Meghan, Duchess Of Sussex when she marries Prince Harry next month – the Queen is anticipated to be gifting Harry the title of Duke Of Sussex, much like she did for William on the day of his marriage.If Harry retains his current rank – His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales – Meghan will undoubtedly take on the feminine version of his title, becoming known as Her Royal Highness Princess Henry of Wales.MORE: When is pregnant Zara Tindall’s baby due, where in line to the throne will they be and when was her wedding?MORE: Kate and William’s royal baby name – when will it be revealed and what will their son likely be called?"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/23/18/4B77748900000578-5646889-image-m-50_1524502857003.jpg","title":"Duchess Cambridge safely gives birth boy","story":"Look radiant in a red dress like the Duchess in Jenny PackhamShop the ready-to-wear line here at NET-A-PORTERThe newest member of the Royal family has finally arrived, and of course all eyes are on the doors of the Lindo Wing to get a glimpse of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s baby boy.

Kate gazes adoringly at her newborn little...Kate Middleton royal baby LIVE: Latest news on new prince\u0027s...Share this articleAccording to a source, Kate and William are ‘very keen’ to make sure George and Charlotte are as involved as possible with their new brother, ‘hence the dash back to KP’ before bedtime last night.The couple are also determined to keep things as normal as possible for George, as he has just gone back to school for the summer term and they do not want his routine disrupted.For his part, William is good with the children in the nursery — one quality of his father Prince Charles that Diana acknowledged.    Prince George talks to his great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth ahead of the Christening of his sister Princess Charlotte  Prince Charles with Prince William and Harry pictured inside Kensington Palace (left) and the family with Princess Diana (right)          The grounds of Kensington Palace where the new prince has been taken this evening following his arrival today           An official pictured released for Prince George\u0027s birthday           Prince George, wearing a white dressing gown, greets Barack and Michelle Obama          Prince George plays with the Cambridge\u0027s family dog Lupo in the grounds of Kensington Palace‘It’s the home of a modern couple, lots of photographs of the children and the bits of artwork they bring home from school,’ says a friend.‘It’s a welcoming home, but William does guard their privacy and he limits the number of outsiders who are let in to the family circle.’ Evenings are often spent in front of the television with a take-away curry from Malabar in Notting Hill — collected by one of the orderlies, not delivered.          George and Charlotte wait in the window of Kensington PalaceWilliam has succeeded in creating something of the warm family atmosphere he found with the Middletons when he first knew Kate. But, as working royals, he long ago accepted that his and Kate’s home could never be quite like theirs. He’s matched them in one area, however — like them, he now has three children.By last night everything had been made ready in the Peter Rabbit-themed nursery to welcome home George and Charlotte’s new baby brother. I gather there are some new additions to the nursery, but no fresh licks of paint.There are, however, lots of new soft toys already — some from George and Charlotte — and many baby presents have also been delivered to the Palace.Officially, the couple say they won’t be hiring a maternity nurse to help with the early days of the new arrival. Insiders say Kate plans to breastfeed her new baby, but no one would think less of her if she did decide to call in specialist help, particularly during the night (a maternity nurse will normally sleep with the newborn and take the baby to its mother to be fed).After the birth of Prince George in 2013, Kate was on her knees with exhaustion because he hardly slept, and wanted his mother’s constant attention.When George was born, William and Kate had the builders in at Kensington Palace and were still living in cosy two-bedroom Nottingham Cottage.They almost immediately headed off to the Berkshire home of the Duchess’s parents.          The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge pose for photographs in the garden of Kensington Palace with their son George and dogsBy the time Charlotte arrived two years later, the £4.5 million refurbishment of Apartment 1A had been completed. With five reception rooms, three master bedrooms with adjoining dressing rooms and bathrooms, there is certainly plenty of space.The imaginative transformation includes a night nursery where Charlotte and George sleep, and a day nursery for playtime.On the first floor are the master bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms, and his-and-hers dressing rooms.          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle appeared in the grounds of Kensington Palace, where they live in Nottingham Cottage, after they announced their engagement.On the top floor, reached by a lift, are nine further bedrooms for staff, while a basement area where the photographer Earl of Snowdon once had his darkroom is now a well-appointed gym with laundry and luggage rooms nearby.The kitchen, on which the couple spent £170,000 of their own money, is the heart of this royal home, and where they like to entertain close friends and family.For more formal occasions guests, who arrive through a bright and airy entrance hall with intricate cornicing and black and white flagstones, are shown to one of the two drawing rooms — in one there is a grand piano and cream sofas with floral scatter cushions.Soon enough, the latest addition to the House of Windsor will no doubt be crawling all over them with mischief in mind."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/22/13/4B6C251F00000578-0-image-m-14_1524400230755.jpg","title":"Kate Middleton baby Prince Charles Middletons expected visit new royal baby","story":"Dress like a Duke in William’s blazer by Polo Ralph LaurenShop it here at MATCHESFASHION.COMThe whole Cambridge family were pictured at the Lindo wing at various points of the day that the newest addition arrived.

The lack of supply is pushing up prices, leaving young families struggling to get on the ladder.The Government believes that building 300,000 homes a year in England by 2025 is the answer and has ordered local authorities to outline suitable locations.Last month Prime Minister Theresa May warned that if councils don\u0027t build enough houses they will lose their right to determine where they are placed. Sajid Javid, Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, told them he\u0027d be \u0027breathing down their neck\u0027.But Britain\u0027s latest housebuilding drive has led to fierce debates within communities about where these properties should go. At one extreme are the Nimbys (Not In My Back Yard) who don\u0027t want any housebuilding in their neighbourhood for fear the construction would ruin their views and be too noisy.At the other you have a new breed of campaigners nicknamed \u0027Yimbys\u0027 (Yes In My Back Yard) who want housing to help their children and grandchildren raise families.The majority sit somewhere between, pushed and pulled by these factions.          Against: Anna Martin, pictured with daughters Iona (centre) and Annabel, walks and jogs in the woods most days of the weekEastleigh, which must build 14,580 new homes by 2036, is a prime example of the new dynamic. It was one of 15 councils shamed last year for being too slow to put a plan in place. Now the council has revealed a proposal to build nearly 2,000 more homes than required.It has sparked uproar among the residents guiding me around the area. They\u0027re concerned that one in three houses is earmarked for greenfield land around Stoke Park Wood, and the idea of a road through the middle appals them.They tell me one Yimby is pushing this development more than anyone else — Keith House. The Liberal Democrat leader of Eastleigh Borough Council, who has held that role for more than 20 years, claims the development will create jobs and bring in extra council taxes.\u0027It has been known and accepted for years that we need to build more homes in the right places,\u0027 he says. \u0027While this shift from buying to renting is fine in London and other big cities, there isn\u0027t the stock in the suburbs and on the South coast.\u0027There is a change of tone in the housing debate as people realise that it\u0027s their sons and daughters who can\u0027t afford homes.\u0027It\u0027s clear why families would want to live in a location such as this. You\u0027d have rural Hampshire on your doorstep while being a 30-minute drive from Southampton and within commuting distance of London.And Mr House is adamant he can deliver the schools, roads and other facilities that will be needed here.\u0027All too often councils put the houses up first and then fail to deliver on the infrastructure,\u0027 he says. \u0027We\u0027re committed to putting that in — it\u0027s in the plans.\u0027          Lib Dem councillor Keith House claims the development will create jobs and bring in extra council taxesBut resident Bruce Mitchell, 55, a civil servant, accuses Mr House of ignoring overwhelming opposition. More than 30 people, including environmental experts and charities, spoke against the proposals at a meeting in December that ran on until after 1am, he says.The mayor, deputy mayor and three councillors have quit the Lib Dems over the plans, to run as independents. Even Eastleigh\u0027s Tory MP, Mims Davies, says the move was \u0027panicked and rushed\u0027.Helen Kerris Shaw, 39, who runs an animal charity where the development will be, says: \u0027I\u0027ve volunteered at the charity since I was nine and it\u0027s quite shocking to think it might all be bulldozed over.\u0027Anne Martin, 46, who walks and jogs in the woods most days of the week, says Mr House isn\u0027t thinking about the quality of life in the area.\u0027There are very few places you can go and have such quietness,\u0027 she says. \u0027It is just so short-sighted.\u0027Anne\u0027s daughter Iona, 11, who was highly commended in the British Wildlife Photography Awards, says the road will be like a \u0027Berlin Wall\u0027 for animals which live in the woods.According to the Woodland Trust, just 2 per cent of the UK is ancient woodland which has existed since records began in 1600 in England and Wales, and 1750 in Scotland.Jack Taylor, of the Woodland Trust, says light and road pollution are major threats to wildlife that rarely get mentioned. \u0027These woodlands could be saved with thoughtful design, and people in Eastleigh are right to be alarmed,\u0027 he says.Environmentalists are also concerned that the new road will damage the nearby Itchen river, which has European Special Area of Conservation status. TV naturalist Chris Packham, who grew up in nearby Southampton, has described the plan as \u0027eco-vandalism\u0027.Kate Beal-Blyth, 40, is a member of local action group Action Against Destructive Development.She\u0027s lived in Eastleigh most of her life, running a television production company, and says the group recognises the need to build but says that, with a new railway station and motorway junction, these could be nearer the centre of the borough.          Green belt: One in three houses in the Eastleigh development is earmarked for greenfield land around Stoke Park Wood\u0027We desperately need new homes — they are just being built in the wrong place,\u0027 she says. According to the Campaign to Protect Rural England, there is space on brownfield land — which has previously been developed — to build one million homes around the country. Many sites already have planning permission so homes can go up straight away, the group says.But PricedOut, which aims to help young people get on the housing ladder, says that won\u0027t be enough. It claims much of the green belt isn\u0027t as beautiful as people think — and banning new-builds prevents people from living near work.Mr House agrees. \u0027Every time we have had major development there is inevitable local opposition,\u0027 he says. \u0027But in this case, there is no alternative solution closer to the town centre with the right infrastructure.\u0027Mr House insists he wants to protect the woodland and says the council is not building more homes than Eastleigh needs, as the plan takes into account long-term trends. He says 35 per cent will be affordable housing, with a mix of different property types.          Kate Beal-Blyth is a member of Action Against Destructive DevelopmentSome communities may be able to avoid the sort of disputes that are splitting opinion in Eastleigh.One idea gaining popularity is to fill empty homes before building new ones. More than 11,000 homes across the UK have been empty for at least ten years, according to the Liberal Democrats. About 216,000 have been empty for six months. The Government announced last November that it would allow councils to charge double tax on properties that have been unoccupied and unfurnished for two years or more.The Intergenerational Foundation think tank says the Government should focus on filling empty rooms in homes. There are 25 million spare bedrooms in England, it says, adding that many houses are owned by empty-nest pensioners in family-sized houses.For many the costs of downsizing — estimated by Money Mail last year at £29,000 on average — are too off-putting. Experts such as John Godfrey, Theresa May\u0027s former head of policy, say a stamp duty tax break for downsizers could free up these properties for growing families.Mrs May has also suggested former shops could be turned into homes as more people buy online. She says Britain should look to build up as well as out — which could mean using spaces above shops, too.The Prime Minister plans to relax planning rules so people can add two more floors to many properties.Some experts have even suggested building above car parks. Property agency JLL says it has identified 868 car parks within a mile of a station in London that could support an average of 90 homes each. Another concept gaining popularity is the prefab home. These houses are fabricated in factories in as little as 20 days.           Picturesque: The River Itchen which borders the proposed development is one of the world\u0027s most exclusive fishing areasThey are then transported to the necessary location where they take just a few hours to erect. The benefit would be building more homes more quickly, limiting the disruption and noise that cause concern to many Nimbys.The Government hopes that garden towns — whole towns and villages built in commuter belt territory — will also provide room for thousands more homes. Some 14 developments were approved last year from Cornwall to Cumbria. Five in the corridor between Oxford and Cambridge are in the pipeline.Mrs May says she\u0027s working to speed up the planning process to boost housebuilding. Plus there will be a crackdown on developers who sit on land and wait for its value to rise to maximise profits.Yet for residents in areas such as Eastleigh, where councils are under pressure to build thousands of homes right now, these alternatives are emerging too late.Unless enough people back an affordable, sustainable alternative — and win over councillors whose reputations are on the line — campaigners may be fighting a losing battle.It could mean some of Britain\u0027s most beautiful rural areas, whether the locals like it or not, change irrevocably. And as Eastleigh\u0027s 11-year-old photography star Iona Martin is at pains to tell me, that\u0027s causing a great deal of heartache.v.bischoff@dailymail.co.ukOne year fixed rateNo fees to use abroad £150 Expedia voucher to sign up"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/23/21/4B7873C500000578-0-image-m-52_1524514421607.jpg","title":"Todays Mac Cartoon","story":"    ‘Really?

Villers-Bretonneux is now home to the main Australian Memorial of the Western Front.At Villers-Bretonneux, Turnbull and Philippe on Tuesday unveiled a memorial plaque at the new Sir John Monash Centre museum which is named after the Australian general responsible for taking the town.Turnbull and his wife, Lucy, also visited the grave of her great uncle Roger Hughes who was killed by a German shell in 1916 five days after arriving on the Western Front as a young military doctor.Turnbull said in an Anzac Day message that Australians remember veterans of every generation who risked their lives for their country.

Turkish casualties were estimated at 250,000.At the Australian War Memorial in the capital Canberra, an estimated crowd of 38,000 - 10 percent of the city\u0027s population - gathered in the cool autumn darkness for the dawn service which began with a lone soldier playing a didgeridoo.\u0027The attendance at this year\u0027s dawn service shows the enduring connection so many people have to Anzac Day,\u0027 Memorial Director Brendan Nelson said in a statement.

Alder Hey, therefore, won the right to end his life.                                                      Alfie\u0027s parents have been locked in a bitter legal battle with Alder Hey, who insist it is in the two-year-old\u0027s best interests to die because he is in a \u0027semi-vegetative state\u0027 and has a degenerative neurological condition doctors have been unable to diagnose. But the Pope has supported Alfie\u0027s parents Tom Evans and Kate James in their wish for him to be treated at the Bambino Gesu Hospital in Rome and last night he was granted Italian citizenship yesterday in the hope he can still be sent abroad.  On Monday a 200-strong crowd gathered outside Alder Hey and some even tried to force their way in through the doors but were repelled by police. Mr Evans said it became obvious he was breathing \u0027within a few minutes\u0027 of life-support being withdrawn, although doctors re-intervened after he asked them to help.He said: \u0027I sat down with the doctor, it was a lengthy talk for about 40 minutes and he ended up saying that I\u0027m right, and I was right, I\u0027ve always been right.\u0027Mr Evans continued: \u0027They say Alfie\u0027s suffering. Well look at him now. He\u0027s not even on a ventilator and he\u0027s not suffering.\u0027Asked what intervention doctors had made, he replied: \u0027They left him for six hours without food, water and oxygen.\u0027I felt blessed when they confirmed they were going to give him his water and his oxygen.\u0027He\u0027s now on oxygen. It\u0027s not changing his breathing but it\u0027s oxygenating his body.\u0027He is still working, he\u0027s doing as good as he can.\u0027But we do need him to be supported ... in the next hour it\u0027s going to be hard but we will need him to be supported in the next hour or two.\u0027Because he\u0027s been doing it for nine hours totally unexpected, the doctors are gobsmacked and I do believe he will need some form of life support in the next couple of hours and I think he ought to be respected and given that.\u0027            Protesters outside Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool where Alfie is being treated          A large number of police are outside the hospital to prevent demonstrators trying to get in          Some supporters have held an overnight vigil for Alfie after it was announced his life support had been withdrawn          Alder Hey has urged parents only to bring children to A\u0026ampE if there is an emergency and also asked Alfie\u0027s supporters to stop calling its switchboard    Alfie Evans\u0027 father Tom speaks to media and a large crowd outside Alder Hey hospital on Tuesday morning after announcing his son was breathing unassisted             The removal of life support comes after the family lost a \u0027last-ditch\u0027 appeal last night to delay the withdrawal of treatment and mount a further legal challenge             Police attempt to keep protesters, one pushing a pram, out of the hospital\u0027s revolving door            The Pope, who previously met Alfie\u0027s father, intervened again in the case to say he hoped the boy\u0027s parents would be able to seek new treatment      His parents Tom Evans and Kate James have battled through the courts to save their sonMay 2016: Alfie Evans is born apparently perfectly healthy, but misses numerous developmental milestones in his first seven monthsDecember 2016: Alfie catches a chest infection causing seizures, and is taken to Alder Hey Children\u0027s Hospital in Liverpool where he is put on life support.

The European Court of Human Rights refused to intervene in the case.Speaking outside the hospital on Monday night, Mr Evans: \u0027I\u0027m stood here now and Alfie is still here. Why? Because I\u0027m still fighting for him, I\u0027m still fighting and so is Alfie. I have been in touch with the Ambassador of Italy. My son belongs to Italy. I love Alfie and I love Kate, I will not give up.\u0027 Around 100 people remained outside Alder Hey Children\u0027s Hospital awaiting news on Alfie Evans while a line of police officers guard the main entrance, with more police stationed at other entrances. Pope Francis said on Twitter: \u0027Moved by the prayers and immense solidarity shown little Alfie Evans, I renew my appeal that the suffering of his parents may be heard and that their desire to seek new forms of treatment may be granted.\u0027 A source close to the Evans family said a UK judge would hold an urgent telephone conference with Italian legal representatives to discuss Alfie\u0027s plight.Alfie\u0027s father met the Pope last week to ask for asylum, kissing the pontiff\u0027s hand and begging him to \u0027save our son\u0027.The head of the Bambino Gesu Pediatric Hospital, which is administered by the Vatican, also travelled to Liverpool in a bid to have the boy transferred, saying Pope Francis asked her to do everything \u0027possible and impossible\u0027 to save him.The hospital previously offered to help in the case of Charlie Gard, who died from a rare form of mitochondrial disease that causes progressive muscle weakness, including in his organs.            Alfie Evans is in a \u0027semi-vegetative state\u0027 and has a degenerative neurological condition            Tom Evans pictured with the Pope, who has thrown renewed support behind the family    Bambino Gesu, a children\u0027s hospital owned by the Vatican and known as the Pope\u0027s Hospital (pictured), has secured a plane ready to jet Alfie Evans to Rome today.The hospital has contacted Aldey Hey Children\u0027s Hospital  about Alfie\u0027s transfer and has also sent doctors to his bedside.Bambino Gesù is the largest paediatric hospital and research centre in Europe.The hospital has a staff of almost 2,600 including physicians, researchers, nurses, clinical technicians and office staff.Its slogan is: \u0027You think about your child, we\u0027ll think about everything else\u0027.It was also heavily involved in the tragic case of Charlie Gard and had also offered to care for him before he died last year. Bambino Gesu was criticised last year after the publication of a damning investigation in the Italian Press, which accused Bambino Gesu of putting profits before the welfare of children.The scandal occurred before boss Mariella Enoc joined the hospital.                                                     Their case went before the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) after it was rejected by the UK\u0027s Supreme Court, but judges in Strasbourg also refused to intervene, saying the application was \u0027inadmissible\u0027.Following the decision, around 200 people gathered outside Liverpool\u0027s Alder Hey hospital, as supporters blocked the road outside the hospital, linking arms and chanting, \u0027Save Alfie Evans!\u0027 Dozens had ran towards the main doors before police officers stationed inside and out strung across the entrance blocking the way, and after after a short stand off the crowd retreated to gather around 100 yards away on the road outside. One woman described the crowd as \u0027terrifying\u0027, saying: \u0027Everyone just ran and were going for the doors, pushing police out of the way - but they weren\u0027t going to get in past the police. \u0027I understand people want to support Alfie and I\u0027ve got a lot of respect for people who want to support him but I\u0027ve got respect for the hospital as well because they\u0027ve saved my little girl\u0027s life.\u0027 Another woman whose child is being treated at the hospital after being in a car accident and whose son had a separate appointment at the hospital said: \u0027We support Tom and Kate but we don\u0027t support them storming.\u0027We were walking out and I had my baby in a wheelchair. I was getting tossed and turned by coppers trying to get out and my baby was terrified,\u0027 she said. Some Twitter users compared the case negatively to the national euphoria following the birth of the royal baby on the same day. One said: \u0027A royal birth means nothing to me I\u0027d rather focus my attention to things closer to home and show my support for Alfie Evans. All the best little man.Another said: \u0027My thoughts are with Alfie Evans today, not the royal baby.\u0027          Some of the protesters attempted to get into the hospital as police guarded the entrance   Judge slams \u0027fanatical and deluded\u0027 legal adviser to Alfie Evans\u0027 parents who wants to launch private murder prosecution if the boy dies but \u0027doesn\u0027t have his best interests at heart\u0027Judge slams \u0027fanatical and deluded\u0027 legal adviser to Alfie Evans\u0027 parents who wants to launch private murder prosecution if the boy dies but \u0027doesn\u0027t have his best interests at heart\u0027 A High Court judge has harangued \u0027pro-life\u0027 campaigners advising Alfie Evans\u0027 parents especially the \u0027malign hand\u0027 of a Russian-born law student he branded \u0027fanatical and deluded\u0027. Mr Justice Hayden slammed Pavel Stroilov, who works for the Christian Legal Centre (CLC) and believes Alfie\u0027s doctors should be prosecuted for murder if he dies at Alder Hey in Liverpool.CLC is part of a Christian campaign group called Christian Concern known for its opposition on abortion, homosexuality and \u0027gender identity\u0027 issues, which its supporters claimed  has been \u0027promoted globally by influential child abusers\u0027.Mr Stroilov, who is not a practicising lawyer but has been advising Alfie\u0027s father Tom Evans, was accused of giving him \u0027false hope\u0027 by the High Court judge. On Monday Mr Stroilov filed a private prosecution accusing doctors treating Alfie of murder and yesterday the judge described him as a \u0027fanatical and deluded man\u0027 whose advice had come \u0027perilously close\u0027 to contempt of court.The family\u0027s former lawyer Mary Holmes, who took their fight to the High Court and Strasbourg, has also said the pro-life lobby are exploiting the little boy and his \u0027desperate\u0027 parents.She said: \u0027These people I don\u0027t believe are in it because they love Alfie - when this case is over they\u0027ll move on to the next\u0027.

At the weekend a 20 year old man was stabbed to death in Finsbury Park - less than two miles from the playground in Holloway. The stabbing was close to the home of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn It is not the first time police have been filmed messing around while in duty. The Met was severely criticised in March when after posting a ‘selfie’ of beat officers at a murder scene in Stratford, east London, in March - just hours after a young man was killed.Salisbury Police was blasted in the same month when two more officers took a grinning selfie in front an overturned car on a snowy motorway.A mother only found out her daughter had flipped her car on a treacherous road after police tweeted the photo in front of the crash site.Meanwhile police in Humberside came in for criticism after 18 officers were photographed riding the dodgems at a funfair while others looked on last October. One of the riders was Chief Superintendent Darren Downs, who posted a picture on Twitter and described having a \u0027fantastic afternoon at the fair\u0027.   A witness who recorded the footage told MailOnline that she witnessed the officers playing on the slide, using the swings and climbing the monkey bars that are meant for toddlersAnother senior officer, Inspector Scott Snowden, also posted a series of pictures on social media and wrote: \u0027Cops having a bit of well earned fun with people at the fair!\u0027. Angry local residents said the police should have been out on patrol and not enjoying the rides at Hull Fair last October. A Met Police spokesman said: \u0027We know that Londoners want to see police officers patrolling their neighbourhoods, and the Met is committed to doing just that. \u0027Police officers need to be approachable and visible in all areas of London. Having seen the short video clip - but without further details of the circumstances or for how long officers had been in the playground - we can\u0027t comment further.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/25/08/4B880EAA00000578-5654787-image-a-4_1524642103741.jpg","title":"Mother 37 embezzled 92 000 IVF","story":"Debbie Stevenson, 37, pictured with her husband Michael, stole the cash from the firm where she worked in Glenrothes, FifeA mother who was desperate for another child embezzled more than £92,000 for IVF, a court heard.Debbie Stevenson, 37, of Boldon Colliery, Tyne and Wear, started stealing the cash from the firm where she worked as a bookkeeper in 2014.She used the money to pay for costly fertility treatment, involving trips to Greece, and gave birth to twins in 2015.But she continued siphoning off money from packaging firm The Pitreavie Group in Glenrothes, Fife, until January 2017,Stevenson, who also has an 18-year-old son, feared she would be sent to prison and parted from her children, Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court was told.A judge deferred sentence to allow assessment of suitability for a restriction of liberty order.

Showing the work of 15 leading international photographers in unique locations, this year’s theme, Up, centres on a subtle call to action. The festival’s directors, Lucille Reyboz and Yusuke Nakanishi, say participants were asked to illustrate how social change can be encouraged through self-awareness, action and creation.The use of unusual architectural spaces, from a disused printing works to the sanctuary of a temple, gives the festival a distinct flavour and adds another atmospheric dimension to each photographer’s work.The South African-born photographer’s installation, presented in a former ice factory and anchored by a series of portraits and video exploration of devastated living spaces, seeks to connect people affected by flooding and the catastrophic impact of industrial and environmental change. The Tidelines series is a collection of water-damaged photographs that provide a moving testament to the memories of family life before the floods.Exhibited in the depths of the disused ice factory is the astonishingly personal work by Alberto Garcia-Alix. Renowned for his raw, hedonistic portraiture, the maverick Spanish photographer’s early images focus on some of the people in his life. The photos set the scene for a dreamlike, retrospective film that is woven together with video, still images and his poetic narration, detailing a life led against the grain of convention and the lost aspirations of youth.Regarded as one of the most radical and influential photographers of his generation, the Fukase retrospective is a festival highlight. The extensive exhibition features the acclaimed series Ravens, which explores the artist’s battle with depression, as well as his vivid photographs showing the wild side of his beloved cat, Sasuke. The jewel in the crown is his early colour work, which was previously published but never exhibited. Viewed in its entirety, the Fukase display gives a deeper understanding of the variety and complexity of the photographer’s work.Izumi Miyazaki, one of the rising stars of the festival, is also the star of her work. Reminiscent of Magritte, at first glance her vivid use of colour and character seems whimsical, but her intent is a serious exploration of surrealism that leaves the viewer charmed and unsettled in equal measure. Miyazaki draws inspiration from her daily life, including what she has eaten.The Kyoto central wholesale market is the inspired venue for K-Narf’s tribute to the proud work ethic that is respected in Japanese culture. On the opening day of the festival, the photographer’s almost lifesize portraits of market traders caused a stir of excitement as members of the local community recognised their friends and colleagues. The project is centred on the local people and preserving their respect for the next generation, K-Narf says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e6481ee8eee612f9a724c852d23b4cbd24403db/118_2_1468_1247/master/1468.jpg?w=740\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4828b011ecff939b1c321ef202a3736 740w","title":"tsb online banking mobile app paul pester business live","story":"Some customers find that internet banking is restricted - or still not working, despite CEO saying it’s up and runningNeil De Silva, a DJ and part-time model from Glasgow was unable to pay for additional luggage because he couldn’t get his TSB card to work, leaving him stranded in Thailand:“I ended up missing my flight to Singapore after my card was declined.

The amount of permissions the app wanted was outrageous so I emailed them to say that I wasn’t happy and that from 25 May when GDPR comes into force I’d be contacting them every day to delete the unnecessary data that they were collecting via the app. “A very rapid response suggested that I order one of their basic devices instead, which I did. Credit where credit is due, it arrived promptly yesterday, just in time for the new system to be live. Except of course it’s not live. The system is still down. Also the basic device seems incapable of doing anything at all.

I don’t want to be in this family. I’m going to live somewhere else for ever.”By “somewhere else”, it turns out he means “on the front doorstep in East Finchley” by “live” he means “stand sulking” and by “for ever” he means “45 seconds”. There’s my little chip off the old block! He really has inherited his father’s rugged inidualism, defiance of convention and hunger for distant horizons.But both of us are put to shame by the unnamed Australian 12-year-old who, when his mum and dad cancelled the family holiday to Bali, thought, “Bugger that for a game of soldiers”, and went anyway. That is, he made free with the parental credit card, booking flights and a nice hotel online, then grabbed his passport and did one.He was reported missing, but nobody thought to check the airports (why would anyone have thought to check the airports, to be fair?) so it was nine days before it emerged that he had hopped on a plane in Sydney, changed in Perth and smartly checked into the Bali hotel he had booked, saying he was waiting for his sister to arrive.The report I read did not, regrettably, specify how he was found, but I like to think he was on a sun lounger in some garish board shorts, sporting a large soft drink with an umbrella in it, smiling winningly at the passing ladies. He is quoted as saying of his unaccompanied jaunt: “It was great because I wanted to go on an adventure.”What a little scamp! This unnamed lad joins a distinguished lineage of literary runaways that includes Treasure Island’s Jim Hawkins, Frankenstein’s monster (last seen “going on an adventure” on an arctic ice floe), most of Joseph Conrad’s heroes, and Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone 2: Lost In New York – which, unless I miss my guess, is where he learned how to talk his way into a hotel.As much as our reaction to this story will be to tut-tut about safeguarding procedures and joined-up policing, and how unimaginably awful it would be had our own children absconded like that, there’s a part buried in all of us that just thinks: what a baller! The adult face is a mask of horror the inner child yelps with envy. How many of us earnestly packed the contents of our piggy banks, a penknife or catapult and some essential provisions into a knotted hanky and ran away from home – only to be scooped up by our parents three-quarters of an hour later, having stopped to eat our Marmite sandwiches at the bottom of the street? In reality, running away from home – really running away from home – more often than not ends badly. Yet that does nothing to quash the romantic fantasy of circuses, a life at sea, or – as in this case – white sands, palm trees and drinks with umbrellas in them.And the fantasy has a grip on us because the older we get, the less courage we have. We may long to leave our lives and head out on the road like Woody Guthrie, Jack Kerouac and Reacher or The Littlest Hobo, but we won’t. Even when we were younger and less sensible, we didn’t. But we like to imagine we would have. So much so, that sometimes we pretend we did. Do you remember Tony Blair’s claim, soon debunked, that as a child he had tried to stow away on a flight to the Bahamas?Bali boy really did it, and he did it, in a sense, on behalf of all of us. Next time Jonah heads for the front door, I’m going to clasp him proudly to my bosom, slip my credit card into his pocket and whisper: “Run, Forrest, run!” into his ear. I may catch a certain amount of uphill from my wife, the police and members of the below-the-line commenting community, but it will be worth it.

References to the unhappy state of loneliness are scattered throughout the Bible. As the 17th century poet John Milton reminded us: “Loneliness is the first thing which God’s eye named not good.” However, it was only in the early modern era that people started talking about loneliness as a standalone problem. Until the 19th century, loneliness tended to be associated with the physical state of being apart from society or company. During the 19th century, loneliness became associated with people’s inner state, and philosophers such as Kierkegaard were preoccupied with the fear of loneliness.Until the 21st century, loneliness was principally a problem addressed by theologians, philosophers, sociologists, poets and artists. In recent times it has become an issue for health professionals. Unfortunately, once a dimension of the human condition becomes framed in the language of medicine, it is only a matter of time before it acquires the status of an epidemic. Inevitably, health professionals in the US have sounded the alarm on the loneliness epidemic.Loneliness is the fashionable new problem in the UK. Earlier this year the UK government appointed Tracey Crouch into the newly established post of minister for loneliness. The appointment follows a series of alarming reports about the prevalence of loneliness among elderly people this month the problem expanded to include young people. The Office for National Statistics reported that “young adults are more likely to feel lonely than older age groups”. Earlier this week, a study claimed that “lonely millennials” faced a variety of health and social problem.The medicalisation of loneliness mystifies a condition for which there is no cure. Loneliness often expresses the difficulty that we have in understanding our place in the world. When people struggle to come to terms with their self and find it difficult to gain affirmation, loneliness can assume the form of an existential crisis. The philosopher Hannah Arendt described loneliness as “that nightmare which, we all know, can very well overcome us in the midst of a crowd” when we feel “deserted by oneself”. She argued that this nightmare is a symptom of the difficulty we have in engaging with ourselves.Arendt believed that the destructive effects of loneliness could be contained through the habit of conversing with oneself. She called this “silent dialogue of myself with myself” solitude. For Arendt, solitude had a positive connotation. She wrote that “though alone, I am together with somebody (myself) that is”.Arendt’s attempt to convert loneliness through an inner dialogue into solitude offers one way of coming to terms with our estrangement from ourselves, Others, such as the writer Maya Angelou, found refuge in music. “I could crawl into the space between the notes and curl my back to loneliness”, she wrote. Still others, such as the existentialist feminist writer Simone de Beauvoir, embraced loneliness and sought to harness its creative force. What they all understood was that we can exist with loneliness through finding value in our solitude. Meaning, rather than a cure, helps us deal with the problems of existence.• Frank Furedi’s How Fear Works: Culture of Fear In The 21st Century will be published in June by Bloomsbury Press."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b342ed817d7b31e63361b9c931ea8e872ac729b/0_223_3872_2324/master/3872.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8404301181a1d6fc452da4b92023860","title":"ask hadley fashions male gaze","story":"It’s heartening that younger readers should care about patriarchal brainwashing, says our fashion fixer, but we should trust our inidual agencyI dress in ways that I choose to because I am influenced by a society and fashion industry that tells me what is attractive and in many ways (I still believe) is aimed at the male gaze. Therefore, can this be counted as my own, semi-empowered choice, or am I kidding myself and submitting to the patriarchy? Lia, age 15What a terrific question, Lia! I often think that all those tedious oldsters who wang on about how young people today are narcissistic snowflakes who only care about how many likes they get on Instagram really should spend some time with actual young people instead. Because, if they did, they would see that young people are so much more engaged and curious about the world than any teenagers I knew in the 1990s, primarily including myself there. I mean, I kept myself busy as a teenager: wondering whether I fancied Graham or Damon more (Graham, always) clearing my Friday nights for a big night in watching Whose Line is it Anyway? and Eurotrash or getting various parts of my body pierced at Kensington Market. But worrying about patriarchal groupthink I was not.You know, Lia, you can spend a lot of time getting all Chomsky on yourself, worrying about whether you think and behave the way you do because you have been brainwashed by the culture around you, or, conversely, whether you are the unique soul who has the mental strength to fight against this. Can I suggest an alternative perspective? Be aware of the influencers around us, sure, but trust yourself and your fine mind to maintain your inidual agency. Any 15-year-old who worries about patriarchal brainwashing is not going to fall for a boohoo advertising campaign. Equally, do not operate under the bad-faith assumption that anyone who thinks or dresses differently from you is a sleepwalking, mainstream fool. Accepting your and others’ inidual agency means accepting that everyone should take responsibility for their actions. Putting theirs down to them being brainwashed by the patriarchal overlords lets everyone off the hook. Own your choices, Lia, and do others the respect of letting them own theirs.As to your clothes: yes, of course, you are influenced by the fashion industry. After all, you can only wear what you can buy in the shops, and the shops are the fashion industry so, unless you want to be one of those people who get interviewed on daytime TV because they insist on dressing as badgers, what choice do you have? But this does not mean you are not making a choice. After all, you are not buying everything in the shops are you? You are making choices from the options available. This is not submitting to the patriarchy this is opting against the badger onesie.But let’s talk about the patriarchy, shall we? Sure, some clothes are definitely aimed at the male gaze, but a vast amount are not. As websites such as Man Repeller have celebrated, and as endless men have groaned about, quite a lot of fashion is not about looking sexy – it is about looking weird. Prada, Comme des Garçons and Junya Watanabe are just some of the high-end labels that have built their success on rebelling against conventional ideas of sexiness. But aside from that, even if the fashion industry was entirely concerned with the male gaze, the only question you have to ask yourself is why you choose the clothes you wear. Do you want to make every boy stare at you? Or do you just like that jumper, no matter what the boys think? If the former: yes, that is a bit tragic. If the latter, enjoy your jumper!Finally, one last thought. You ask if your clothes can be your “semi-empowered choice”. I realise we live in an era in which anything, from taking selfies to buying shoes, can be described as “empowering”, but this is, really, just nonsense. Empowerment is about revolution for the group, it is not about shopping for the inidual. So do not worry about self-empowerment when you are shopping just think about buying the things that you genuinely love. And enjoy them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0394e7c40126085879289e828deed1196e0630a6/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2126e6a9e2013db0d760ada484b63e6c","title":"biggest style secret designer meghan markle royal wedding dress","story":"With less than a month to go until the royal wedding, speculation is mounting, with Stella McCartney, Erdem and Christopher Bailey among the runners and ridersThe London-based label designed by thirtysomething Australian couple Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo is the odds-on favourite. Britain’s only haute couture house would be a patriotic choice with a full-service couture atelier handily situated close to Markle’s Kensington home. What’s more, the aesthetic – think superyacht glamour – has the requisite scale for the cathedral proportions of St George’s Chapel. January’s haute couture show closed with a wedding dress in double-faced duchess satin with a draped sweetheart bodice embroidered with Swarovski jewelled leaves, grand flounced skirt with pearlescent micro beads and scalloped lace veil. A semi-sheer black gown by Ralph \u0026amp Russo was the most eyecatching look in the couple’s portfolio of engagement photos. A “well-placed source” has apparently been briefing the press from the atelier that there is “talk of lace”, possibly the least revealing revelation in bridal fashion history. The duo have “declined to comment”.The woke choice. The strongest statement Markle could make would be to emphasise ethics with a sustainable, ethically sourced and made gown by Stella McCartney. When I interviewed her last week, McCartney definitely did not deny being The One. (On the other hand, having your name on lists like this one is good PR, so why deny it, even if the phone never rang?) Markle has worn Stella McCartney several times, including the caped gown she chose for the Queen’s birthday party at the weekend. Plus, the McCartneys are, in a way, British royalty. But while McCartney has made wedding dresses, including a corsetted gown with a long train for Madonna’s Scottish castle wedding in 2000, she is not really known for frills or romance. Her sleek, streamlined aesthetic is a more natural fit for Markle’s everyday wardrobe than for a wedding day. Very possibly a contender for a slinky gown for the evening reception.A persistent outlying rumour links Christopher Bailey, the outgoing Burberry designer, with the wedding dress. Bailey has a longstanding relationship with Markle, having dressed her character on Suits. “I wear a lot of Burberry on the show because Rachel’s whole aesthetic is someone who comes from money and has a real classic design sensibility,” Markle has said. Points in favour: Burberry is a marquee name of British fashion the fashion industry would be utterly charmed by a royal swansong for the universally liked Bailey he is a discreet, mature character who could handle the palace and be trusted to keep a secret. Burberry is known for trenchcoats, not fairytale glamour gowns, but Lily James’s inky red-carpet showstopper at February’s Baftas was by Burberry. So you never know. Backstage after Erdem’s most recent London fashion week show, he explained that his inspiration this season was Adele Astaire, Fred Astaire’s sister, who married into the British aristocracy. Later that day, at a fashion week reception at Buckingham Palace, his long-term client the Duchess of Cambridge made a beeline across the room for a chat. So I did ask, obviously, but he just giggled and raised his eyebrows. Make of that what you will. Erdem has Canadian connections in common with Markle, who lived in Toronto for six years. She has also worn Erdem’s clothes for years, choosing a printed maxi-dress for a wedding she attended with Harry in Jamaica last year. The recent expansion of Erdem’s small London team has added fuel to this fire. Aesthetically, this would be the most fashion-forward choice. Last year, he took the young Queen Elizabeth’s meeting with Duke Ellington at a jazz club as a starting point for a catwalk collection of rewired, quirky royal glamour. A charteuse silk gown with a tulip shaped skirt featured dense black embroidery and three outsize red silk bows at the breastbone, worn with flat mules and a quiff. Two words: Norman Hartnell. The logic against Sarah Burton creating a spectacular Alexander McQueen gown for the royal wedding is that Burton created a spectacular Alexander McQueen gown for the last royal wedding seven years ago. But history shows that this does not rule Burton out. Norman Hartnell designed the Queen’s wedding dress in 1947, and her sister Margaret’s in 1960. A second dress commission would strengthen the ties between the royal family and Alexander McQueen, perhaps the most iconic British fashion label of modern times. The royal family set a lot of store by trust, and Burton did an exemplary job both of designing the dress and of not breathing so much as a word about it. The “Fab Four” of William and Kate plus Harry and Meghan is a compelling new framing of the royals, and this would give it an elegant symmetry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cc1329955f64b1f583a81696403febf14b89a2d/316_57_1956_1174/master/1956.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb5b14541fec30bd5eb3088ab4167f5a","title":"arsene wenger leave arsenal not my decision","story":"• Speaking before Atlético tie, manager says he will not retire• ‘With two or three additions, this team can fight for title’Arsène Wenger has provided the clearest indication yet that he did not want to leave Arsenal by revealing the timing of the decision was not down to him. The manager of almost 22 years announced last Friday he would depart at the end of the season, with the understanding being he jumped before he was pushed.Gazidis and the rest of the club’s hierarchy had been increasingly worried about the team’s poor Premier League performance and it had become clear they did not want to retain Wenger for the final season on his contract.Wenger was asked on Wednesday – before the first leg of the Europa League semi-final against Atlético Madrid at the Emirates Stadium – why he was quitting when he had another year to go on his deal. “The timing was not really my decision,” he replied. “For the rest, I have spoken about it already.”The 68-year-old made it plain that he intended the seek another job in management – “I will continue to work, that’s for sure,” he said – while he believes his successor will inherit a team that, with a few correct moves, can win the Premier League title.“This group of players deserves something special. I want to do it for them, to achieve something with them because I feel they have a special mental quality. My biggest satisfaction would be to be successful together with the group of players that I have. I’ve seen them behave the whole season and they deserve it.“It will be a Champions League night, of course – on a double level. First of all, a ChampionsLeague position is at stake, more for us than them and secondly because the two teams are two clubs who are used to playing in the Champions League. That is why I believe it is a Champions League night.”Luis Enrique, the former Barcelona manager, is the favourite to take over from Wenger. Arsenal’s head of football relations, Raul Sanllehi, worked with Enrique at the Camp Nou and is believed to be pushing his case.“I have a high opinion of Luis Enrique,” Wenger said. “I do not want to influence the job for the next manager but of course I have a high opinion of him.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2b5f6a6e7dc55ed3daafc9ce4f0594a27889177/0_71_1444_866/master/1444.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f713744cf6401b05f4e98378b247e2c","title":"brazil womens copa america chile everyone happy","story":"Brazil met expectations but hosts Chile, who have now qualified for the World Cup, hope to have transformed women’s football in the countryOver two weeks in Chile, South America’s finest female footballers faced off in the Copa América Femenina. The tournament was a huge success thanks to the efforts of the players promoting the women’s game on and off the pitch. The authorities watched in amazement at the continent’s overwhelmingly positive reaction.Brazil won all their games en route to a seventh title. The chemistry between the experienced Marta and Cristiane, who have played together since they were teenagers, was the catalyst, while Formiga, in her 23rd year wearing the yellow jersey, commanded the midfield, with veterans aided by the younger players such as Bia and Monica.In seven matches, 13 Brazilians scored, a sign of their squad depth. The success of Brazil surprised no one all of their squad play professionally in leagues across the world, whereas their opponents, for the most part, do not make a living from football.Brazil’s dominance stems from an immense pool of talent, often developed abroad, and decades of work at grassroots level, something the other nations are having to play catch-up with. Officials banned women’s football from 1941 to 1981, to protect them from the ‘dangers’ of the sport. Despite that, women continued to play in secret.They have since faced a battle to create stable leagues and garner resources from their federation. Their dominance in the Copa América is not down to national investment in the women’s game nor the federation’s support. Cristiane’s public retirement last year arrived with a letter from players to the federation, painting a damning portrait of mistreatment.This Copa América was the most exciting, a tremendous achievement considering most of the 10 teams were “inactive” less than two years ago. The momentum of collective protests and new initiatives laid the foundations for the game’s revival.Chile defeated Argentina 4-0 on Sunday to secure a remarkable second-place finish in the final stage’s four-team group. Chile’s players were buoyed by hosting the tournament and it sends the country to the Women’s World Cup for the first time. After years of disarray, Chilean players formed a union in 2016. The first of its kind in the region, Anjuff (The National Association of Women’s Football Players) created alliances with the male players’ union, NGOs and clubs.Chile bid for the Copa América in the hope of creating a new fanbase for women’s football there. Although initially upset that the tournament would not be held in the national stadium in Santiago, the women recognised the opportunity to connect with the provinces, playing at two grounds in the north-west of the country. For the first time the entire tournament was televised, the team prepared thoroughly and attendances were impressive. Camila García, a FIFPro board member and founding member of Anjuff, believes there is a great appetite for the sport on the continent.The final match between Chile and Argentina pitted two teams against one another who have suffered similar problems. For most of the players, Sunday’s game was the most important of their lives. Chile’s defensive line was stoic, led by the goalkeeper and captain, Cristiane Endler, and the centre-back Carla Guerrero. Argentina face a play-off game against a team from Concacaf to qualify for the World Cup in France next year. While disappointed, they have no reason to be ashamed.Brought together a few weeks before the tournament, Argentina were unable to count on much support. Six months ago the team held a strike because their training fee – less than £9 – went unpaid. Yet from the start they showed determination, with convincing wins over Bolivia and Ecuador. In their first match, Soledad Jaimes adapted a gesture from the men’s game during her goal celebration. Jaimes cupped her ear, to say: “I can’t hear you paying attention.” The team took the symbol for their group photo.Colombia, who have appeared in the previous two World Cups, went home disheartened with a fourth-place finish. They started well and Catalina Usme was the tournament’s leading scorer. In the final phase they lost steam and missed the leadership of their injured captain, Natalia Gaitán.Colombia had reasons for optimism. This year marked the inaugural season of the country’s professional women’s league. Following a defeat by Brazil on Sunday, journalists were quick to criticise the squad, with El Tiempo’s sports editor describing their performance as “inexcusable”. It seems hardly fair given that the team went nearly a year without a coach and faced superior competition.Even those who exited early expressed their enthusiasm for the tournament. Ecuador’s Suany Fajardo registered surprise at the level of play and the organisation, saying: “Whichever team will go on to the World Cup, I think they’ll make a good run at it.” The Uruguay forward Sindy Ramírez agreed: “This tournament was quite competitive, it shows women’s football is on the rise and getting the attention it deserves.” Ramírez’s team-mate Yamila Badell expressed delight at full stadiums and saw it as a testament to previously unfulfilled potential.It is easy to bemoan the state of women’s football in South America, but it is an image the players want to move away from, with or without the help of the governing bodies. They are willing to sacrifice their financial well-being and their bodies to represent their countries. Despite innumerable frustrations, most describe the experience as a dream come true. Hopefully their national associations and Conmebol, the regional federation, are listening. The message is clear: get on board, or get out of the way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c365a51f70b5dd39240ad42d2d776277df84349f/0_60_2878_1726/master/2878.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed21efa183c2e70e4f16982fe7c5148f","title":"jurgen klopp liverpool roma champions league semi final","story":"The manager’s measured assessment of the exhilarating 5-2 Champions League semi-final victory contrasts with the blame game of his Roma counterpart Eusebio Di FrancescoUefa ranked Liverpool the No1 team in Europe in February 2009 based on a five-year period of success and consistency under Rafael Benítez. A month later they revelled in that status with a 4-0 destruction of Real Madrid that took Benítez’s team into the Champions League quarter-finals, following a semi-final appearance in 2008, a runners-up spot in 2007 and the ultimate triumph in 2005.Klopp’s Liverpool cannot compare with that body of work in only his second full season as manager. His team have, however, reached a level of exhilarating attacking brilliance in this Champions League campaign that their predecessors would envy. And just like the quality of Salah’s goals, they are improving.The 5-2 first leg romp over Roma made it 38 goals in the Champions League this season for Liverpool. It is 44 when the qualifier against Hoffenheim is included. With 10 goals apiece, Salah and the crucial Roberto Firmino now share the record for most goals in a single European campaign by a Liverpool player. Along with Sadio Mané, who should have had a hat-trick on Tuesday, they form the most prolific forward line in the competition – 28 goals and counting. And Liverpool have scored in each of their six European away fixtures this term.Roma’s obligation to attack in Stadio Olimpico next Wednesday will whet Liverpool’s appetite for more. “I learned tonight that we can win the second leg, too,” admitted Klopp, though he was in no mood to celebrate after losing Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to a serious knee injury.Post-match interviews are framed by emotion but the contrasting approaches of the managers in the aftermath of the first leg also bodes well for Liverpool’s pursuit of a sixth European Cup.Eusebio Di Francesco, the Roma coach, abdicated responsibility for the high defensive line and three-man rearguard that invited Salah to destroy his former club with one of the finest inidual performances in Europe that Anfield has witnessed.It was his players’ fault, Di Francesco claimed, for losing too many inidual duels and allowing the Liverpool midfield to launch the “lethal” breaks that Roma had focused on stopping in training. “My Roma players don’t need to tell me about Salah,” ran the headline on the ’s interview with Di Francesco this week. Someone should have done.“We don’t need miracles” was the gist of the Roma coach’s message as he inevitably invoked memories of their quarter-final comeback against Barcelona. As others quickly pointed out, Liverpool achieved a level of dominance over the Italian side on Tuesday that the Spanish league leaders never did, not even during their 4-1 first leg victory at Camp Nou.Roma were given hope at Anfield by the two late away goals that followed Salah’s substitution. It is unlikely to be hope but the magnificent Egyptian that kills them in the return.Klopp took a different line to Di Francesco by accepting responsibility for a scoreline that everyone at Liverpool would have embraced before kick off. “If someone wants to say it is my mistake they scored two goals because I changed the striker I have no problem with that,” he said, having pointed out that it was one defensive lapse and one penalty decision that enabled Roma to close the gulf.The real threat of Salah’s exit was to limit Liverpool to five. Just the five goals, in a Champions League semi-final, and with Oxlade-Chamberlain adding to an ominous injury list Klopp had every reason to protect the forward line that is slicing through Europe.Oxlade-Chamberlain has been an increasing influence on the Champions League campaign but is not expected to play again this season after his knee buckled when challenging Aleksandar Kolarov at Anfield. Adam Lallana and Emre Can are also long-term absentees, although Can does have a chance of returning from a back injury before 26 May. His rehabilitation may just have stepped up a notch at Melwood today.Georginio Wijnaldum was formidable when he replaced the England international against Roma, however, while Jordan Henderson and James Milner – whose nine assists are the record for a Champions League season – were again outstanding in Europe as they turned the semi-final in Liverpool’s favour. The last three senior midfielders standing at Anfield will get no relief in the days ahead. On to Stoke."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2dca3080fd5b52fffbda374a254f7a45f2133b05/5_305_2693_1616/master/2693.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8806e01a4446fd6f9b946c4b4eb4269","title":"leeds owner defends myanmar tour andrea radrizzani","story":"The owner of Leeds United has defended the club’s highly controversial decision to play two post-season friendlies in Myanmar, a country accused of ethnic cleansing and human rights abuses against its Muslim Rohingya minority.Andrea Radrizzani, the Italian businessman who became the full owner of Leeds last year, even suggested the tour may be beneficial in raising awareness of what the United Nations has called a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing”.Leeds are due to face a Myanmar National League All-Star team in Yangon, also known as Rangoon, and the country’s national team in Mandalay next month. This is despite the club being fully aware of the violence that has caused 700,000 of the Rohingya population of Myanmar to flee the country in the last eight months.“I have spent over 10 years living in Asia and Myanmar is a country I have visited on many occasions,” Radrizzani said. “I am aware of the serious issues within the country but I also know that it is a beautiful place filled with incredibly warm and welcoming people. “This was a carefully considered decision and we knew it would be controversial but this is about people not governments. It has never been my intention, nor that of the club, to get involved in a political debate in Myanmar. However, if because of the tour we further highlight the ongoing serious issues in certain areas of the country, then maybe that is a positive thing.”The violence committed against the Rohingya people has centred on the northern Rakhine province where entire villages have been razed and horrific acts of violence committed by the military against men, women and children. Leeds’ tour will be sponsored by AYA, a private Myanmar bank implicated in ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya. But Radrizzani denied there was any financial incentive to the club of playing the matches in Myanmar, also known as Burma. “The club is not receiving any fee to play,” he said. “Rather I see this both as a personal initiative to support local football and a way to introduce the name of Leeds United in the fastest growing country in south-east Asia.”Some Leeds players are understood to be wary of travelling to Myanmar and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office guidance is to “check travel advice before travelling”. The FCO advises against “all but essential travel” in some areas of Myanmar, although not the areas that Leeds will play in.

Thirty-four years the Giallorossi had waited to play in another European Cup semi-final, only to be ripped apart by a player they had sold to Liverpool 10 months earlier.Two late goals at Anfield restored the faintest of hopes but did Italians really believe this Roma team could repeat the Champions League second-leg comeback they achieved against Barcelona?Defeat hurt more for the fact it was orchestrated by the former Roma player Mohamed Salah. “Those hands placed together asking for forgiveness will not make the goals any less bitter,” observed Matteo Pinci in La Repubblica of the player’s refusal to celebrate. That newspaper, along with several others, called the Egyptian worthy of a Ballon d’Or.“The past is a beast,” wrote Pinci’s colleague Maurizio Crosetti. “The past is cruel, with long nails. Roma found it suddenly on top of her, flesh torn by ‘Mo Sala’, as they call him here. He is the worst nightmare they feared, and which arrived punctual as anything. It was like being caught in a story written by Stephen King, who had been sleeping badly due to indigestion, and who got up to start writing instead.”Even the statistics seemed to taunt Roma. “Salah was sold for €42m before bonuses,” noted Davide Stoppini in Gazzetta. “The same player went past the 42-goal mark against Roma: almost as if to demonstrate that he is worth more, much more, too much more.”Corriere dello Sport’s editor, Alessandro Vocalelli, however, seemed the least willing to give up the ghost. “If it is true that this result was a heavy one, Roma showed once again that they are alive, that they have the character of their manager, that they can punish the English players’ moment of relaxation and a defence – that of the Reds – which is anything but invulnerable,” he insisted in his front-page editorial.His newspaper also pointed a finger of blame at the officials, labelling the referee, Felix Brych, “a disaster”. “A clear foul on Strootman on the goal that opened up the game,” wrote Vocalelli. “An offside on Liverpool’s third goal‚ two grave errors in a match that at that point still wasn’t yet decided.”Other newspapers also picked up on the offside, though most relegated it to a footnote. “This Roma team was too broken to be true,” reflected Gianni Mura in La Repubblica before acknowledging they had at least shown character at the end. Still, he pondered: “How many times do miracles repeat themselves?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad6c837eca1d8b85f80835c4fd1d7361cb3c85f1/0_413_2365_1419/master/2365.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=067f9a338ac1e1207f7027edb58a76b9","title":"bake in the box cake only an idiot could mess it up","story":"This bake-by-numbers convenience food is from the same school as boil-in-the-bag – what could go wrong?Dr Oetker’s Bake in the Box sounds like a cautionary tale adapted for Netflix, but is actually a cake. If you’re looking for nuance in the kitchen, this is not for you. But\u0026nbspif you are time-poor, appliance-shy or incompetent,\u0026nbspthen it is. It is so straightforward to make, so utterly bake-by-numbers, I half-expected to find it came with a sachet of enzymes to help you digest the thing. Alas not.Dr Oetker launched its baking kits late last year with little fanfare. The German-owned food company’s UK branch is based on an industrial estate in Lancashire opposite Crossleys, a company that repairs caravans – another sort of box. Yet Dr Oetker has become one of the leading manufacturers of frozen foods and baking equipment. It dominates the market. Put simply, the bake in the box cake is evolution.I get my hands on the lemon and poppy seed loaf (other varieties include banana and choc chip, and double chocolate). To make it, you remove the lid and empty the mix into the box. Whisk seven tablespoons of milk in using a fork (since we’re on a convenience tip, I use the same tablespoon) and pop into an oven, preheated to 190Cgas mark 5. Remove after 10 minutes, score a 1cm-deep groove down the middle of the cake and return to the oven for a further 20\u0026nbspminutes.This is convenience food from the same school as boil in the bag and microwave meals: all designed to help “overcome the barriers consumers face when it comes to home baking”, says the company. It’s a valid argument, although there’s something conflicting about the almost tyrannical convenience and the fact that it still takes 30 minutes to bake. But it works, and the cake is fine: lemony, dense, too sweet but adequate.The good news is that Dr Oetker didn’t try to gender it with a pink box, or deploy a fun font to make it look hip. The bad news – and I discovered this after eating the cake\u0026nbsp– is that Dr Oetker has a Nazi past. Richard Kaselowsky, a past owner of the firm, was a “leading supporter” of Hitler. The company’s president at that time – and son of the original doctor – Rudolf-August Oetker joined the Nazi party in the 1930s, news that was later exposed by his son, August Oetker – to his credit – because, according to a spokesman: “The business felt it important to be transparent about any mistakes that were made in the past, set the facts straight once and for all and do everything to prevent anything like the Third Reich happening again.” So\u0026nbspthere you go.But back to the cake. Dr Oetker’s Bake in the Box is ridiculously simple to make – it would take a colossal muppet to mess it up and yet, I did. Halfway through, I\u0026nbspdecided to add lemon juice to zhoosh it up – but in my attempt to rip up the rulebook, as it were, I\u0026nbspended up ripping the box.

But what do you think? Send us your thoughts and responsesOur community of 70 families is facing being made homeless by our landlord, who wants to knock down our estate to build executive-style houses to sell for profit. They are rare houses of a specific construction – built by the National Coal Board in the 1950s – and can be modernised without being knocked down. We have organised a lot around this application. We’ve put signs up with our “Save our homes” logo and have a banner prominently displayed. We have residents’ meetings, a regular newsletter updating residents, a website and a change.org petition, as well as a Facebook account and are hoping to have a local demo in May. We have even organised a bat survey on the building to see whether any bats shelter in the property – which protects a building from being demolished, as a last resort. We feel our landlord is making contradictory statements about whether we will get to keep our tenancies. In some cases they say they won’t be able to decide on the tenure of the new homes until they have planning permission, but at other points they have said it is unlikely we will be forced out or that we would be made to leave at all. This is confusing, as the planning application – to bulldoze over where we live and replace it with new houses – has always stayed the same. Our campaign has had some success so far. There are lots of objections on the planning site, not just from our estate but from friends and family outside, and others who have heard about our campaign. Due to the large number of objections the decision will go before a panel where we will get the chance to have our say, probably in June. But amid all this campaigning, we are fearful it may amount to nothing. While many of us on the estate are low-income families, we are all private tenants, and feel it is harder to get the same national attention and outrage that is received when social housing is being demolished. How can we protect our homes and stop the demolition of these rare, truly affordable homes that are so vital to our sense of community, home, and the right to be housed for low-income groups in Leeds?What an impressive campaign, and what a sad situation. A local demo will be a good way to broaden your appeal. Think about holding it earlier – with local elections coming, you can show politicians you are serious, and that local people care about this campaign.Look through Leeds council’s local plan, and check whether this development disagrees with its aims in any areas, be it around affordable housing, the environment, or conservation – this is important for the panel. Refurbishment is generally a greener option than demolition, and that should play a strong role in the council’s considerations. And think about other possible interest groups you can bring in, like ex-mining communities that care about the legacy of these properties.I spoke to successful housing campaigners for you. Glyn Harries, from the New Era campaign says to start thinking about direct action. Decide for yourselves: what happens if push comes to shove? What are you willing to do? And are there concrete actions you can start developing now? Make it clear that you are willing to take non-violent direct action. One simple thing, is deciding to make a clear statement on whether you plan to leave your homes. Dr Stuart Hodgkinson from Leeds University says: “They might be private renters with fewer rights, but if all 70 say they have no plans to leave, it will be a big financial operation to evict them all.”Consider your options: could you create a non-profit organisation and seek to buy the homes yourself, with fundraising? If you don’t want the homes to be demolished, you should also get expert advice. Find out what all the costs will be – of eviction, redevelopment, or potential homelessness – so you can make people aware of what costs the private developer may be avoiding, and who will end up paying for it – for example, in their tax bill. And look at the cost of alternatives, like bringing these homes up to a decent standard instead of demolition.Look into the developer too: find out what other companies it has links with, look into its accounts at companies house, see what other developments it owns, and talk to residents from those homes to see how they live – all these things will help you to know what you’re up against, and just what kind of company it is.You have a lot of friends out there – activists who have won successful campaigns, like New Era and Sweets Way have offered their contacts, and the Butterfield estate could have good advice. Let me know if you want more details. Generation Rent has agreed to put you in touch with iniduals where you are. Hodgkinson has asked me to pass on his number.Finally, say Harries and Hodgkinson, celebrity doesn’t hurt. You’re a well-oiled machine, but if you had a well-known Yorkshireperson backing your cause, it would bring huge public attention. Think about who that might be.• What do you think?

Any news organisation needs to have independence and be protected to do its job. You want there to be independence.”The company also said it would not look to acquire a majority interest in any UK newspaper for at least five years, a shot at the Sun and the Times owner Murdoch whose takeover bid is being scrutinised over concerns that taking over Sky News would give him too much control of UK news media.This month Disney “expressed an interest” in buying Sky News – regardless of whether its takeover of Fox and Sky is successful – in an attempt to help solve the plurality issue that is slowing up Murdoch’s bid and see off Comcast.“My own opinion is there is unlikely to be a large minority shareholder,” he said. “The most likely scenario when it is done, more likely than not, is that we would end up with most, if not all, the shares. But we are comfortable either way.” While 21st Century Fox said it remained committed to its offer for Sky and was “considering its options”, meaning potentially raising its bid, analysts believe Murdoch has to clear any offer increase with Disney.“Murdoch is out of this now, there is another kingmaker in Disney he will pick up the phone and solicit a higher bid as Fox is now worth a lot more in total,” Alex DeGroote, a media analyst at Cenkos Securities, said.Under the terms of their agreement Fox has “broad parameters” to increase debt or buy or sell assets without breaking its deal with Disney. But in “certain instances” Fox cannot act without Disney’s approval. In addition, Disney cannot make its own direct bid for Sky without the written consent of Fox.“The independent committee is mindful of its fiduciary duties and has consistently sought to maximise value for all shareholders,” Sky said.Comcast said its offer was warmly received by Sky.Disney, which has called Sky a “crown jewel”, is keen on the broadcaster’s streaming and on-demand service, Sky Now, as it seeks to compete with Netflix.“In reality, this is likely to be about what Disney is willing to pay for Sky as Disney will be the buyer of the Fox assets,” Ian Whittaker, analyst at Liberum, said. “We think that FoxDisney will counterbid. Ownership of Sky would seem central if Disney wanted to expand its plans to build a direct to consumer network in North America into Europe as it would give Disney the number one pay-TV operator in the UK, Germany and Italy.”“It’s derisory, far too low, bids for Sky must start at a minimum of £15-plus, putting its value at over £27bn,” he says. “Sky’s independent directors can’t accept Comcast’s offer, I don’t know any Sky shareholders that would now entertain a £12.50 offer, it is not plausible.”DeGroote believes Comcast’s formal offer could spark further bidders to emerge. “This will bring into play a number of parties that have not yet shown their hand, such as potentially Netflix and AT\u0026ampT, depending on the outcome of its Time Warner deal,” he said. “An investment memorandum will be distributed involving everyone: Amazon, Google, Apple – they will all be encouraged to take a look.”Comcast said taking over Sky would result in savings of $500m annually “with only limited impact on headcount expected”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/971d4bcf64fbaef30f3f6839807761e52483317d/134_0_3270_1963/master/3270.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f1931b0e1592c9cc993e30237141ba9","title":"uk among the worst in western europe for press freedom","story":"Latest global ranking places Britain behind Uruguay, Samoa and Chile for restrictions on reportersThe UK has one of the worst environments for press freedom in western Europe, according to a global ranking that places Britain below the likes of Uruguay, Samoa, and Chile for restrictions on reporters as they seek to hold power to account.Reporters Without Borders, which campaigns for journalistic freedoms, said the UK ranked 40th out of 180 countries on its annual World Press Freedom Index, leaving it ranked between Trinidad \u0026amp Tobago and Burkina Faso.The campaigning organisation cited proposals to introduce tougher press regulation, the government’s campaign to limit encryption on services such as WhatsApp, and restrictions by Labour and the Conservatives on journalists’ access to politicians during the 2017 general election as evidence of a “heavy-handed” approach towards the media in the UK.Other concerns include law firm Appleby using British courts to sue the  and the BBC over the publication of the Paradise Papers, plus the fact the BBC political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, required a bodyguard for her protection while attending last autumn’s political party conferences. Reporters Without Borders’ UK bureau director, Rebecca Vincent, said Britain’s ranking was “unacceptable for a country that plays an important international standard-setting role when it comes to human rights and fundamental freedoms”.“We must examine the longer-term trend of worrying moves to restrict press, and hold the government to account,” she added.Scandinavian countries scored highest on the list, with Norway taking top spot. Italy was the only western European country to have a lower ranking than the UK. Canada ranked 18th, Australia was 19th, while the US came in at 45th. New Zealand gained five place to rank eighth.  editor, Katharine Viner, launched the report at the ’s office in central London, warning the worldwide “situation in terms of press freedom is getting worse”. She said journalists should not forget to campaign for press freedom in the UK, in addition to other countries. James Harding, who until recently was in charge of the BBC’s news operation, said that while misinformation on social media was widely discussed it was often the actions of governments that caused real damage.“For all the discussion of fake news, there is much more pervasive problem of state news, which is the problem of governments and politicians encroaching on the media,” he said.They were joined by reporter Matthew Caruana Galizia, the son of murdered Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who said the public should be aware that even in Europe journalists were being killed as a result of their work.“Her murder has really resulted in a national trauma that is going to take us decades to recover from,” he said. “There is no one who has stepped up to claim that spot and continue the fight that she was fighting.”He urged others to step up and continue her work. “It was easy for the people she was reporting on – all they had to do was eliminate her and they thought that would eliminate the story.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/165594c0a018e5bc8fd44af1d6f1e0afe783a7f1/0_259_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89b37447697d392ce493954db0ee14b2","title":"help to buy agency writes down loan on flat over grenfell style cladding","story":"Woman whose London flat has slumped in value is told she can pay back £10,000 of £95,000 loanThe government has agreed to virtually wipe out a help-to-buy loan on an apartment in a London block with cladding similar to that used at Grenfell Tower, it has emerged.It will make the write-down on the grounds that the value of the flat in Greenwich has been reduced from £500,000 to £50,000 because the developer has no plans to remove the cladding. The concession raises the prospect of multimillion-pound losses for the government scheme on any flat that goes into negative equity. This is because, unlike high street mortgages, help-to-buy loans can be redeemed on the sale value of the property rather than the value of the original loan.Homes England, the agency responsible for the loan, wrote to Cecile Langevin last week to say it had agreed she could pay back her loan at the knock-down valuation. She recently got her flat revalued in light of the cladding issue and discovered that it had collapsed in value. The developer and freeholder Galliard is locked in a legal dispute over the cladding and has no immediate plans to remove it. Langevin wrote to Homes England in March to ask if she could now pay back the loan at the current value and, after some delay, it has now responded to say that under the rules this is possible. “Homes England has now determined that you may proceed with the redemption of your help-to-buy equity loan based on the valuation provided … ie at a market value of £50,000,” it said in a letter.Homes England declined to comment on Langevin’s case but said: “Every case received by the Homes England mortgage administration team is considered on its own merits and will take in to account the local circumstances of each building. We will allow redemption of a loan if it is within the rules of the scheme.”A charity that is campaigning for leasehold reform in the UK to liberate home owners from onerous contracts with freeholders said it was time the government took action forcing the removal of such cladding. Martin Boyd, a trustee at Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, said: “The leaseholders in cladding flats have faced a huge amount of stress and worry over the last 10 months and have now seen their homes massively devalued. If the government is also going to suffer by having to write down these help-to-buy loans, it might finally encourage the sector to help develop a more workable solution. It’s not just the private and shared owners impacted by this problem.”He said social housing landlords would also be experiencing significant devaluation on their properties, which could put them in breach of their loan covenants.

Davis was chastised by the chair of the Brexit committee, Hilary Benn, for having to leave its latest hearing on Wednesday to prepare for urgent cabinet talks on the matter.But before leaving, Davis was adamant that time was still on his side as he seeks a way through what has become the biggest crisis of the Brexit negotiations so far.“I do not expect the solution to be an extension of the customs union,” Davis told the committee member Jacob Rees Mogg. “I would view that on my part as a failure.”He was also dismissive of the possibility that MPs may force his hand through a series of threatened Commons rebellions. “I will not enter into hypotheticals,” Davis said. “I expect the government policy to be upheld.” A further extension of customs union participation – beyond the already agreed 21-month transition phase – has emerged as a possible fallback because the government’s alternative customs proposals will take time to implement.EU members (plus Turkey, Andorra, Monaco and San Marino) trade without customs duties, taxes or tariffs between themselves, and charge the same tariffs on imports from outside the EU. Customs union members cannot negotiate their own trade deals outside the EU, which is why leaving it – while hopefully negotiating a bespoke arrangement – has been one of the government’s Brexit goals.\u0026nbspSee our full Brexit phrasebook.Continued participation in a customs union would not on its own ensure frictionless borders after Brexit owing to the need for shared single market regulations too, but obviating the need for so-called “rules of origin” customs checks is seen by business groups as a vital part of keeping trade flowing freely.Davis said the best solution from a British perspective was a comprehensive free trade agreement combined with a deal to recognise shared regulations and customs procedures.“If you don’t have a tariff or a quota then that makes all of the customs agreement options easier,” he said. “It doesn’t make them go away but it makes them easier. The issue then comes down to regulatory issues and rules of origin.”If this ambitious deal, or the alternative technological suggestions, cannot be agreed with the EU, the Brexit secretary acknowledged that a proposed plan C to align all regulations was still acceptable as an “emergency parachute”. But he iadded that the issue could wait until a final withdrawal deal is struck in October rather than meet an “artificial” June deadline pushed by Brussels.MPs have expressed concern that such an approach will give them little time to scrutinise any deal struck before Brexit, and even then this would only be a political statement rather than a binding treaty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bde9518d751ec3c59282e9b720fefd6ad36f412/3_1671_1549_929/master/1549.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4f54ea7ce2289fa5e028c7fc2b25ee3","title":"labour drops candidate mandy richards after manchester bombing tweets","story":"Mandy Richards, selected to stand in Worcester, suggested attack may not have happened Labour has declined to endorse a controversial candidate who suggested that last year’s Manchester Arena bombing may not have occurred, effectively removing her as a prospective MP.The decision over Mandy Richards was made after an emergency meeting of the party’s ruling body on Tuesday night. Richards, selected as the party’s candidate for Worcester last week, had claimed on her Twitter account there were “no images ... of physical damage” from the bombing last May, and also said there was a “convenient shortage of evidence” in the murder of the MP Jo Cox.A panel from Labour’s national executive committee, including Unite’s Jim Kennedy, the GMB’s Cath Speight and Islington councillor Claudia Webbe, called Richards to an emergency meeting on Tuesday night to explain herself, the  understands. The decision has been taken not to endorse her candidacy.The NEC has the power to remove a candidate if he or she has concealed anything that might be likely to bring the party into disrepute. Richards allegedly did not fill in the form correctly, nor did the selection committee question her about her social media history.Richards has been placed under “civil restraint” by the high court, preventing her from bringing any legal action without judicial approval.She is reported to have made “false and vexatious claims” against MI5 and MI6 and a long list of others, including her GP and Thames Water. The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, was called to give evidence against her at the high court, where she said Richards was an “obsessive” whose claims “cannot be true”.Questions are likely to be asked about how Richards passed the selection process, having previously been shortlisted for another target seat in Telford several weeks earlier.Applicants are explicitly asked in the application form and by the interview panel to disclose anything in their background, personal, political or financial, past or present, which could have any potential to embarrass either themselves or the party. Richards was told by the panel she had broken the rules when she did not disclose any information in response to that question in the application form or interview. The panel decided that was a “lack of judgment that is not compatible with the high standards the party expect of candidates and elected representatives”.Richards has said she is a supporter of Jeremy Corbyn, but sources at Momentum, the grassroots leftwing movement, have insisted it does not back her, and said they did not back any candidate in the seat, which has a 2,500 Conservative majority.A source close to the NEC said the committee had decided to take swift action. “The panel is people from right across the political spectrum,” the source said.Both Kennedy and Webbe are key allies of Corbyn on the committee. “This is not a factional decision but a unanimous one that no one else on the NEC would block,” the source said. “There will be plenty of others now who want to contest that seat.”On Tuesday night, members of the local Worcester party’s committee met to discuss the selection, agreeing to back the NEC’s decision.Richards stood by her claims against the public bodies in a tweet earlier this week, saying: “If being a victim of domestic harassment and standing up for my rights makes me a fantasist then shame on those levelling such taunts, as it is clear they would rather have women and black people suffer in silence than seek advocacy and resolution.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25548b5b49886f78df87ce8fb40bf31ebced6bf0/0_105_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38515e40319ccdad03c917a0195c5af8","title":"labour mps march with jewish colleague to party hearing ruth smeeth","story":"Corbyn ally Len McCluskey says MPs are damaging the Labour party and its leaderThe general secretary of the Unite trade union, Len McCluskey, has accused Labour MPs who have complained about antisemitism of “smearing” Jeremy Corbyn, and called for them to be “held to account”.In an article in the New Statesman, McCluskey, who is a close ally of Corbyn and his team, says: “I look with disgust at the behaviour of the Corbyn-hater MPs who join forces with the most reactionary elements of the media establishment and I understand why there is a growing demand for mandatory reselection.”Unite was the largest single donor to Labour’s 2017 general election campaign and the party’s new general secretary, Jennie Formby, was previously a senior officer at the union.McCluskey denounces some Labour MPs by name, including “Chris Leslie, Neil Coyle (my own MP), John Woodcock, Wes Streeting, Ian Austin and others”, calling them “a dismal chorus whose every dirge makes winning a Labour government more difficult”, and accusing them of “working overtime trying to present the Labour party as a morass of misogyny, antisemitism and bullying”.He adds: “You would have to go back a long way to find such a sustained smearing by MPs of their own leader and their own party as we are seeing now.”And he warns that “promiscuous critics” who “wish to hold Corbyn to account can expect to be held to account themselves”.The mention of mandatory reselection will alarm some Labour MPs. Corbyn’s political secretary, Katy Clark, is currently carrying out a wide-reaching review of democracy in the party, which some fear could result in proposals that would make it easier for backbenchers critical of the leadership to be removed by their local parties. McCluskey says he is “personally not in favour” of mandatory reselection but “lost that argument overwhelmingly”.McCluskey’s pointed intervention came as Corbyn attempted to show he was getting to grips with the antisemitism row, after Jewish leaders expressed disappointment about the outcome of a meeting on Tuesday night.About 40 MPs marched with their colleague Ruth Smeeth to a party disciplinary hearing.The Labour leader’s spokesman said on Wednesday that Formby would make tackling antisemitism her top priority, and Corbyn would “lead the drive to eliminate antisemitism in the party”.He said there were currently 90 cases under investigation – with 18 waiting to go through the NCC (national constitutional committee) – Labour’s most senior disciplinary body. He added that over the last three years there had been 300 complaints and 20 people had been suspended in the last fortnight alone. understands the McCluskey article was not cleared with Corbyn’s office in advance.On Wednesday about 40 Labour MPs and peers marched in support of their Jewish colleague Ruth Smeeth before she gave evidence at an expulsion hearing against an activist accused of berating her at the launch of Labour’s antisemitism inquiry.MPs including the shadow environment secretary, Sue Hayman, the former shadow Northern Ireland secretary Owen Smith and the Jewish Labour movement chair, Luciana Berger, formed a protective ring around Smeeth as she entered the hearing in London.The Labour activist Marc Wadsworth will have his case heard by the NCC, which has the power to expel members. The hearing comes 22 months after the first complaint was made against Wadsworth, who challenged Smeeth at a the launch of Shami Chakrabati’s inquiry into antisemitism, accusing her of working “hand in hand” with the media.Labour Against the Witch-Hunt, a campaign group set up to protest against expulsions, turned out to support Wadsworth at the hearing in Westminster. Several people shouted: “Free Palestine,” as the MPs walked past.Berger said the MPs who had joined Smeeth were “looking for action” against antisemitism. “Warm words are nice, but in and of themselves they are not enough, and that’s why we’re here with our colleague Ruth Smeeth. She has an incredible amount of support,” she said.MPs said they had decided to support Smeeth because she had initially been told by the party she would be responsible for her own security walking to the hearing. Streeting, who organised the delegation to accompany Smeeth, said: “I was proud to see so many Labour MPs and peers from across the party – including shadow ministers – accompanying Ruth this morning in a show of friendship and solidarity. But no victim of abuse should ever have to walk through a protest against them to give evidence to a hearing. It is an appalling state of affairs.”Other MPs accompanying Smeeth included prominent backbenchers Stella Creasy, Jess Phillips, and Margaret Hodge, alongside Smeeth’s fellow Stoke-on-Trent MP Gareth Snell. Also there were Lord Dubs and the chief executive of the Holocaust Memorial Trust, Karen Pollock. Creasy said other MPs were likely to need similar support at future hearings. “No one should go through something like this in the movement they dedicate their lives to fighting for. Sadly, more MPs may be likely to need support in many more hearings like this in the coming months,” she said. Labour MP Chris Williamson, a former shadow cabinet minister, also attended the hearing as a witness supporting Wadsworth.Speaking outside the hearing, Wadsworth said he was not antisemitic and that he had endured “almost two years of trial by media”. He added that much of the reporting around his case had been incorrect. Asked whether he thought he would get a fair hearing, he said: “I reserve my view on that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/205aa0d6f0036bfebf0a32090faed4308e968e7d/0_162_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0ffb1e2d4a888d176d8078b0ef03354","title":"pmqs may corbyn david davis amber rudd windrush questioned by commons brexit committee politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs, Amber Rudd giving evidence to MPs on Windrush and David Davis giving evidence to MPs on BrexitMore from the Treasury committee.

It has led to people being treated in a manner that has been universally condemned, he says.The Commons home affairs committee is about to start its hearing on the Windrush scandal.The first three witnesses are: Adrian Berry, chair of the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association Lucy Moreton, general secertary of the ISU border officials union (who was interviewed about this on Today last week) and Satbir Singh, chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants.Amber Rudd, the home secretary, is due to give evidence at 4.30pm.In a statement ahead of hearing Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said:We still have so many unanswered questions. It is appalling that so many of the Windrush children should have been treated in this way. We need to know what is going to be done on compensation for people that have lost jobs, homes, livelihoods or even been locked up as a result. And we need to know what is going to change.Although the home secretary has said that the Windrush scandal should cause a culture change in the Home Office, we still don’t have clear answers about how things went so badly wrong or how something similar could be prevented in the future. Nor do we have enough details about how wider policies are going to be addressed, and how they are going to make sure other legal residents aren’t treated in the same way.Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary and Jeremy Corbyn’s most powerful ally in the trade union movement, has launched a blistering attack on those Labour MPs who have criticised Corbyn for not doing enough to tackle antisemitism. In an article for the New Statesman, he says some MPs are “working overtime trying to present the Labour party as a morass of misogyny, antisemitism and bullying”. He also says their behaviour has strengthened the case for mandatory reselection.The full McCluskey article does not appear to be online yet, but George Eaton has written up the highlights here. Here is an extract from Eaton’s article. Eaton says that McCluskey:Condemns the “few” antisemites in Labour (“any is too many”) and argues that “combating their views is not merely legitimate, but essential”. McCluskey adds: “I have fought antisemitism and antisemites all my life, including physically on the streets on occasion, and I need no lectures from anyone else on the subject. I am not sure that some of the voluble backbench critics of Jeremy Corbyn can say as much.”Denounces Labour MPs “such as Chris Leslie, Neil Coyle (my own MP), John Woodcock, Wes Streeting, Ian Austin and others” as “a dismal chorus whose every dirge makes winning a Labour government more difficult”. He accuses them of “working overtime trying to present the Labour party as a morass of misogyny, antisemitism and bullying”.Writes that he “understands” why there is “a growing demand for mandatory reselection” of Labour MPs and warns that “promiscuous critics” who “wish to hold Corbyn to account can expect to be held to account themselves”.In his article McCluskey also says:You would have to go back a long way to find such a sustained smearing by MPs of their own leader and their own party as we are seeing now ...Their determination to ide the party into pro- and anti-Corbyn factions, despite the huge increase in Labour’s vote secured last year ... ultimately pollutes everything it touches. That includes the work against antisemitism ...To watch as these so-called social democrats tried to demean and attack, in front of our enemy, a decent and honourable man who has fought racism and antisemitism all his life and who has breathed life and hope back into the hearts of millions, especially the young, made my stomach churn. To see Tory MPs cheer and applaud them was shameful.David Davis has opened the door to parliament agreeing to the demand that we get a people’s vote on the final Brexit deal.His admission that the government will have to respect any decision by parliament to amend any motion or legislation on the final Brexit deal makes it clear that while Brexit is a big deal, it’s not a done deal.Now that a member of the cabinet has told parliament that MPs have the power to order a people’s vote, the government have finally recognised their previous claim that MPs only have a choice between their deal and no deal is dead and buried.Brexit is too important to be left to 650 MPs at Westminster - the 65m people of the UK deserve to be heard too.We have made considerable changes to the bill to reflect issues raised by members and by the devolved administrations. It is indeed disappointing that the Scottish government have not yet felt able to add their agreement to the new amendments and we sincerely hope they will reconsider their position.Mike Russell, the Scottish Brexit minister, has accused the data firm Cambridge Analytica of lying after the company disputed Scottish National party claims their contacts were restricted to a single meeting.In a statement issued on Tuesday afternoon, Cambridge Analytica bolstered claims by its former executive Brittany Kaiser to the Commons culture committee last week of numerous contacts between it and the SNP in February 2016 – claims the SNP has continued to deny. It stated they spoke to two SNP representatives “on a number of occasions in early 2016. These contacts included the SNP’s initial approach to us, a conference call, a meeting in London, a number of emails and a further phone call. Our discussions were about providing the party with a platform to help manage their data. “The SNP were keen to work with us, but they said that the timing was not right.”Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell, who is the SNP’s chief executive, have faced heavy criticism for failing to disclose even to its own parliamentarians that it had met Cambridge Analytica, even though its MPs led attacks at Westminster on the Conservatives over their links to the data company and its parent SCL.The SNP has continued to insist only one meeting took place and finally admitted it was with its former new data guru Kirk Torrance, but only after he was outed by the news website CommonSpace on Monday.Neither Torrrance nor the SNP has said what the meeting was about and what information was shared. Challenged on BBC Radio Scotland, Russell said the firm’s claims were a “smokescreen” to deflect attention from other controversies. He said:The situation with the SNP is entirely clear and I repeat it. A meeting was set up in London, one person attended on the SNP’s behalf and attempts by the company to follow up the meeting weren’t reciprocated.The SNP has never worked with Cambridge Analytica, used any of its services or paid them a penny. And why? Because they are cowboys and clearly we now know they are lying cowboys.Neil Findlay, Scottish Labour’s campaign director, said the SNP had to respond with far more candour. “This version of events directly contradicts what the SNP has been saying for a week now – and what Nicola Sturgeon said at first minister’s questions on Thursday,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4d6565930eccf9a9dda0576e50e0e110a535db5/0_138_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ad32fa38d8040fdc05d66ae4a96894a","title":"swedish archaeologists uncover brutal 5th century massacre","story":"A three-year dig has uncovered the shocking violence with which the inhabitants of the coastal village of Sandby Borg were struck downArchaeologists in Sweden have uncovered startling evidence of a massacre more than 1500 years ago, when the inhabitants of a small village were struck down in their houses or as they fled along the street, and their bodies left to rot where they fell – with their treasures including beautiful jewellery and Roman gold coins.At Sandby Borg on the shore of Öland island, off the south-east coast of Sweden, there was no escape. In one house an old man was smashed on the skull so that he fell into the fire in the open hearth, where his body was charred to the bone. In another a teenage boy, possibly trying to flee, tripped over a body lying on the floor, and died where he fell.Such an aura of horror clung to the site that when archaeologists went in to uncover the gruesome facts, local people warned them they should keep well away from the green mound within the low stone wall.After three seasons of excavation, with less than a tenth of the site excavated, the team which publishes its findings today in the journal Antiquity, believes they have uncovered evidence of a catastrophic end to the life of the village – “a single event that made time stop – like a shipwreck but on land”.In the mid 5th century Sandby Borg had been a prosperous village built within the walls of a ring fort. After the attack nobody ever came back either to bury the dead, to loot their precious possessions or to take their valuable livestock. The dead – nine in just one house – rotted where they fell, lying in their houses until the roofs decayed and collapsed in on them, or sprawled in the village street, and their animals starved to death in their pens.Scattered among treasures including Roman gold coins, silver gilt jewellery, silver hair ornaments, intricate glass beads and cowrie shells from the Mediterranean, the archaeologists even found scraps of the last meals, including half a herring still lying by a hearth, and cooking pots where they were last set down until crushed by the collapsing roof.Ludwig Papmehl-Dufay, an archaeologist from the team at the local museum, which began excavations after warnings that the site was being targeted by treasure hunters, said that while no written or oral history of the massacre survived, there were persistent stories that it was regarded locally as a dangerous place. “I do find it most likely that the event was remembered and that it triggered strong taboos connected to the site, possibly brought on through oral history for centuries.”The archaeologists hope to return to the site this summer, but after three seasons of excavation have uncovered enough mysteries to keep them busy through several winters.  Stuffed into the skull of one man they found four sheep’s teeth.  Papmehl-Dufay suggests that they may represent a final insult, the opposite to ancient beliefs of placing a coin or other small valuable with the dead to pay for passage to the afterworld, instead a contemptuous curse to prevent it. Nearby they found one bone from a tiny arm, the first evidence that children were not spared.Among all the covetable possessions found among the three houses excavated and the 26 bodies discovered, they found no weapons – they speculate that they may have been taken as trophies, and could still lie dumped as a ritual offering into a nearby bog.Öland is a low island off the Swedish coast in the Baltic Sea, and in the Roman period it was wealthy. The Roman gold coins, and the luxury imports found among the scattered corpses, may represent wages earned fighting as mercenaries. The island has rich archaeology including foundations of more than 1000 stone houses, thousands of cemeteries and graves, and at least 15 ringforts – of which only Sandby Borg seems to have come to such a gruesome end in the turbulent decades when the Western Roman Empire collapsed and local tribes vied for power. The Kalmar county museum has a small exhibition about the site, and hopes to create a larger permanent display on a story which even the archaeologists working on it found uniquely disturbing. Only three of the 53 houses have been fully excavated, but test pits show that many more human remains still lie waiting for their story to be told at last."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/beb197a4ef8aec1fc9c5b036d8ea40e661cefc3f/0_88_3440_2064/master/3440.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94b42b17a895f69f13e505b53bf2ffd9","title":"moeen ali england test side ipl interview","story":"The England all-rounder’s appraisal of his Ashes and New Zealand tour reveals something of an identity crisis but he is relishing the IPLWhen Moeen Ali was taken aside by Joe Root in Christchurch last month and told he would sit out the final instalment of England’s troubled Test winter, the overriding emotion that followed was not one of frustration.Having never before been dropped during a 50-cap run in the side – one that was interrupted only once by injury – Moeen actually thanked Root for his honesty and sticking by him for so long. But by his own admission, this hook from the stage should have come sooner.“When I didn’t play the last Test in New Zealand it was a relief,” says Moeen at the Taj hotel in Mumbai during what is a hectic Indian Premier League schedule with his new team, Royal Challengers Bangalore.“I could have been dropped three Tests earlier – I probably should have been – but Joe said he sees me as a match-winner and, with 50 matches of experience, they wanted to give me a longer run. It was almost like: ‘Right, now I can actually work on my game and mentally have a break from the pressure of playing.’ When it’s my time again, I will be ready.”But how did it come to this? Only last year Moeen was the toast of the England team, with the beaming smile that sits above a luxuriant beard dominating the sports pages during a man-of-the-series performance against South Africa. His 252 runs and 25 wickets – the latter including a hat-trick at The Oval – was an English record for an all-rounder over four Tests.The Ashes, however, was a different story. Injured in the buildup, Moeen went on to average 19 with the bat and 115 with the ball over the course of the 4-0 defeat. His own appraisal reveals something of an identity crisis for a player whose selfless, team-first approach had seen his role forever in flux.“I have been up and down the batting order and it’s difficult. People don’t always realise that. If you look at my last 18 months, I went to from batting four and five in India – scoring two hundreds – then to No 7 as second spinner at home before dropping to No 8. When we got to Australia I was down to bat six, then went to seven when the series started. You don’t really know your role.“You do your best but I think I’m going to try and get back in as a batsman first, spinner second. The problem is, because I have played more than others – say if Jack Leach is in the same team, or Liam Dawson or Adil Rashid before – I’ll still get seen as the senior spinner because I’m more experienced.”Has he been too nice for his own good? “I have been told in the past that’s my downfall but I’d rather be too nice to be honest. I set out in cricket to make friends. I’d rather people say they enjoyed playing with him and he’s a good guy, not he’s a good player but a bit of a so and so.”Moeen has always viewed himself as a batsman first and only Root, 11, and Alastair Cook, seven, can boast more than his five Test centuries since his debut in 2014. However the 30-year-old talks of his game “missing something” – perhaps a ruthlessness – and he cannot yet put his finger on it.Gary Kirsten, the former South African left-hander who heads up the RCB batsmen, is being tapped up for insight but whatever follows, we all hope it does not come at the expense of those buttery drives.The above could paint Moeen as a cricketer licking his wounds but it could not be further from the truth. Just as he did not get carried away last year, he is not down now either. He is loving his time in the IPL even if a lack of game time hampers his Test ambitions in the short-term.“If you asked me to play in the IPL for free, I would have done,” says Moeen, whose auction price of £187,000 was around a seventh of that of Ben Stokes. “I literally would have come for the experience, especially with the players at RCB like Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers, Brendon McCullum and Quinton de Kock.“And I’m wanting to train all of the time. Even today we’re not down to but I have asked to do some extra time. Sometimes in the same environment, you maybe lose a bit of that. So I think the IPL has come at a great time, getting different ideas from new voices.”Such as? “For example I have never worked on power-hitting. I’ve just always batted and when days have gone my way, it’s been nice. But with Trent Woodhill, one of the coaches, I’m learning different ways to hit the ball.“In Twenty20 it’s not always about straight drives and high elbows. It’s amazing how far you can hit the ball. I’ve always been able to hit the ball far but not consistently like I have in practice over here. I’m enjoying it so much.”With that Moeen heads off to his extra training session. Doubtless Worcestershire, two defeats from two upon their return to Division One this year, could do with his services and when it is put to him that this first-class absence means the Pakistan Test series at the end of May will likely come too soon, he replies: “It will be tough. But I know my time will come again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c8f3f742a18a7a21174d15b618a7b237e04e60/0_163_3985_2391/master/3985.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14ba13706bc4e255cd811803d1d9f997","title":"novak djokovic woes worsen defeat to qualifier martin klizan barcelona open tennis","story":"Novak Djokovic failed to make the last 16 of his fifth tournament in a row when he lost to the 140th-ranked Martin Klizan 6-2, 1-6, 6-3 on Wednesday in the second round of the Barcelona Open.Djokovic, trying to return to form after a lingering right elbow injury, got off to a slow start but rebounded to force a third set.

The goal wasn’t to cut down on the catering bill. It was, like almost everything Amazon does, focused on two aims: efficiency and scalability. The former is obvious. A smaller team spends less time managing timetables and keeping people up to date, and more time doing what needs to be done. But it’s the latter that really matters for Amazon.The thing about having lots of small teams is that they all need to be able to work together, and to be able to access the common resources of the company, in order to achieve their larger goals.“You can add new product lines without adding new internal structure or direct reports, and you can add them without meetings and projects and process in the logistics and e-commerce platforms,” Evans notes. “You don’t need to fly to Seattle and schedule a bunch of meetings to get people to implement support for launching makeup in Italy, or persuade anyone to add things to their roadmap.”Amazon is good at being an e-commerce company that sells things, but what it’s great at is making new e-commerce companies that sell new things. The company calls this approach its “flywheel”: it takes the scale that can smother a typical multinational, and uses it to provide an ever-increasing momentum backing up its entire business. The faster the flywheel spins, and the heavier it is, the harder it is for anyone else to stop it.Perhaps the best example of that approach in action is the birth and growth of AWS (previously called Amazon Web Services). That’s the ision of Amazon that provides cloud computing services, both internally and for other companies – including those that are competitors to Amazon in other areas (both Netflix and Tesco use the platform, for instance, despite Amazon also selling streaming video and groceries).It started, like so many things at Amazon, with an edict from the top. Every team, Bezos ordered, should begin to work with each other only in a structured, systematic way. If an advertising team needed some data on shoe sales to decide how best to spend their resources, they could not email analytics and ask for it they needed to go to the analytics dashboard themselves and get it. If that dashboard didn’t exist, it needed to be created. And that approach needed to cover everything.From there, it was almost an afterthought to take the obvious next step, and let others use the same technology that Amazon made available internally.AWS is large enough that it is dealt with on the same tier as the entire rest of the world. AWS is large enough that Netflix, a company that accounts for around a third of all internet traffic in North America, is just another customer. AWS is large enough that in 2016 the company released the “Snowmobile”, a literal truck for moving data. The companies that work with AWS move so much information around that sometimes the internet simply cannot cope. So now, if you want to upload a lot of data to Amazon’s cloud, the company will drive a truck to your office, fill it with data, then drive it back. If you need to upload 100 petabytes – that’s roughly 5m movies in 4k with surround sound – it turns out there’s no quicker way to do it than driving it down the freeway at 75mph.While AWS saw Amazon open up its internal technology to external customers, another part of the company does the same trick with Amazon’s actual website. Amazon Marketplace launched in 2000, allowing third-party sellers to put up their own wares on the site. The feature has expanded over the years to become a major plank in the company’s quest to be the “everything store” – the one destination on the internet you need to go to to buy anything in existence.Marketplace goes one better than the pizza rule, allowing Amazon to expand into new sectors without needing to employ a single extra employee. The variety of things sold on Amazon is now so huge that its internal computer scientists faced a problem. “E-commerce companies such as Amazon … process billions of orders every year,” a team of Amazon researchers wrote. “However, these orders represent only a small fraction of all plausible orders.” The solution? Train an artificial intelligence purely to generate plausible fake orders, to better guess how to market brand-new products.Increasingly, then, Amazon resembles less a big-box retailer such as Tesco or Walmart, hovering at the edge of town sucking up commerce and killing the local high street, and more a shopping mall: independent retailers can exist, and even make a tidy living, but only if they get a slot in the mall itself – and if they always remember that the real moneymaker is the landlord.Since 2014, Amazon has added a third flywheel to its business: artificial intelligence. The company has always been near the leading edge of the industry, most obviously in its neural-network-powered recommendation algorithms. But, until recently, that approach was scattershot, segmented, and hardly world-class (think of the last time you bought something on Amazon only to have it recommended to you for weeks afterwards. “You like duvets? Why not buy 10 more?”). That changed when the company decided to build the hardware that would become the Echo. In classic Amazon fashion, it started at the end and worked backwards from there, writing a “press release” for the notional future product and then trying to figure out what expertise needed to be developed – or bought – to make it. Need a personal assistant? Buy Cambridge-based True Knowledge, once working on a Siri competitor, and you get Alexa. Require far-field voice recognition, letting you hear people on the other side of the room? Start working on that now, because no one’s really cracked the problem.Institutionally, the bulk of the Alexa AI team still sits under AWS, using its infrastructure and offering another tranche of digital services to third parties who want to build speech control into their devices. But the economies of scale that come to AI are unique. There’s the value to the data, of course: the more people use an Echo, the more speech samples it has to train with, and so the better the Echo becomes. And beyond that, machine learning technologies are so fundamental, and so general purpose, that every advancement Amazon makes ricochets throughout its business, increasing efficiency, opening up new fields, and suggesting further avenues of research.But nothing lasts forever, and even Amazon has its weak points. The two-pizza rule, for instance, may be a good strategy for building an infinitely expandable company, but it doesn’t lend itself to a pleasant, stress-free working environment. Amazon has long faced criticism over its treatment of warehouse workers: as with many companies in its sector, huge valuations and high-tech aspirations sit uneasily alongside the low-paid, low-skilled work that makes the company tick over. Where Amazon differs from companies such as Deliveroo, Apple and Facebook is that the highly skilled employees sitting in the headquarters have almost as many complaints. A New York Times exposé from 2015 described employees crying at their desks and suffering near-breakdowns from the pressure they were put under. The company’s rapid employee turnover is legendary, with insiders describing a sort of Forth Bridge of technical debt: someone leaves, and someone else has to rewrite all their code to make it understandable to the people still there – but by the time the rewrite is finished, the person doing the rewriting has also left, requiring someone else to start the whole process again.But the one thing that’s been true from day one is that Jeff Bezos sits at the top of the food chain, with direct control of a $740bn (£530bn) business matched by few other bosses. It would take a bold gambler to bet against the company right now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da8f70cca6dd9de6a2e0632fe04108d6bf980319/0_604_4096_2457/master/4096.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da744d519edeb8c23d941db462bbf69b","title":"european commission ai artificial intelligence","story":"Move to boost AI research amid concerns Europe is losing ground to US and ChinaBrussels has called for a €20bn (£14bn) cash injection for artificial intelligence research, while pouring cold water over controversial plans to give robots human rights.The European commission wants governments and private companies to boost research and innovation spending on AI, amid rising concern that Europe is losing ground to the US and China, where most leading AI firms are based.Health, transport and agriculture are among the areas the commission would like researchers to prioritise. But the commission distanced itself from proposals to give the most advanced robots the legal status of personhood.“I don’t think it will happen,” Andrus Ansip, a commission vice-president in charge of digital single-market policy told journalists. “I don’t think my vacuum cleaner has to get human rights.”Last year a committee of MEPs argued that robots should have a form of electronic personhood, raising the idea of machines being sued in law courts. The proposals were made under the parliament’s own-initiative powers, meaning they had no implications for EU law.The commission said it would appoint a committee to draw up ethical guidelines on the use of artificial intelligence. The group of experts from business, civil society and academia will be convened by July to consider AI and its impact on society, including work, social inclusion and privacy.Commission officials stressed they wanted a human-centric approach to AI policy. “Robots will never become humans,” said Elżbieta Bieńkowska, the European commissioner for industry.Researchers have said Europe risks being left behind, as the US and China ramp up spending. US tech firms have been luring top British PhD researchers with six-figure salaries. In an attempt to stop the brain drain, leading scientists have drawn up plans for a vast multinational European AI institute. Named the European Lab for Learning and Intelligent Systems – or Ellis – it would have centres in a number of countries, including the UK.Last month Emmanuel Macron, the French president, announced €1.5bn in public funding for artificial intelligence by 2022, in a move to turn France into a “startup nation”.To meet the €20bn target, the commission promised to increase its spending by €1.5bn in 2018-20, under the EU research programme known as Horizon 2020. It hopes this will trigger €2.5bn in extra spending through public-private partnerships.The UK is among a group of 24 European countries that signed a declaration this month pledging a European approach to artificial intelligence. “It can ... solve key societal challenges, from sustainable healthcare to climate change and from cybersecurity to sustainable migration,” the ministerial declaration said.Against the backdrop of Brexit, tensions have flared over Britain’s role in EU scientific projects. The UK is considering plans to launch its own satellite navigation system as a rival to the EU’s Galileo, amid a row over information security.Greg Clark, the business secretary, has taken legal advice on whether the UK can reclaim €1.4bn it has invested since the project’s launch, the Financial Times reported.Bieńkowska, who will be delivering the project, said she would be speaking to the secretary of state later on Wednesday. “The fact is that the UK, Britain, will become a third country from 30 March next year and of course we are assessing the consequences ... both for the 27 member states and for the UK.”She said it was “the right time to start thinking about adjusting cooperation” on Galileo, adding that her main priority was to deliver the satellite navigation system “on time and on budget”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71316fe786e10dce40aaa2a492f087f4adc390f1/95_35_809_485/master/809.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a18ef68170fe79cd32ff34b3eae49164","title":"google gmail new ai confidential mode features smart replies greater offline access expiring emails improved safety features headline redesign","story":"Smart replies, greater offline access, expiring emails and improved safety features headline Google’s major redesignGoogle is implementing the biggest overhaul of its popular Gmail webmail service in five years, bringing a new look, advanced AI-powered features and improved privacy.Two years in the making, the redesign is intended to help Google better compete with Microsoft’s Outlook on the business side and modernise consumer email by bringing features from its Inbox email client into the main Gmail experience.“This is an entire rewrite of our flagship, most-used product,” said Jacob Bank, product manager lead for Gmail, which 1.4 billion people use each month.For consumers, headline features include the ability to snooze emails, as you would with an alarm clock, until a specified time or date, and what Google calls “nudge”, which displays messages with quick reminders that you haven’t responded to certain messages so that “nothing slips through the cracks”.The smart reply feature, found within Google’s Gmail app on smartphones that suggests quick reply phrases based on the content of the email, will also be rolled out to the web. Google said its new AI-powered features required Gmail to be underpinned by its self-developed Tensor processing chips, and that it had also restructured email storage databases, unifying three duelling systems for syncing messages across devices as part of the overhaul.Cosmetic changes also bring Gmail in line with Office, placing Google’s calendar, tasks and note-taking services within the same page as emails and alongside existing instant messaging options.Google has also improved Gmail’s phishing protection, with new, more dominant warnings about suspicious emails, and a new “confidential mode” that allows users to send emails with expiration dates, prevent the forwarding, copying, downloading or printing of emails and revoke previously sent emails. Emailers can also dictate that recipients have to input a one-time password to read certain messages, in an attempt to ensure that only the intended recipient receives the information.How this will work between Gmail and other email systems such as Microsoft’s Outlook or similar remains to be seen, but recent high-profile corporate data breaches have increased the company’s desire to lock down email.While many of the new features will be rolled out to the consumer version of Gmail first, it’s clear that Google’s approach for its email service has changed from consumer-centric to business-centric as it pushes its commercial G Suite products to business. Google is accelerating its efforts to poach business from Microsoft’s dominant Office system of email and apps, using Google Docs, Gmail, calendar and Hangouts instant messaging systems. Analysts estimate G Suite generated about $2bn in revenue last year, 10 times behind Office.One of the things holding G Suite back for businesses has been limited offline capabilities. Gmail now offers up to 90 days of emails offline, allowing users to search, write and manage messages without internet access in the browser.The changes to Gmail will roll out over the next few weeks with consumers able to opt into the new look by selecting the “Try the new Gmail” option under settings once it is available. Changes to the G Suite system will require system administrators to turn on options before they are available to workers using the Google tools."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb62211994aef7c3a63fc44367ac27e122b87d2d/0_129_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6372adc3d04ad52b639259c360b57920","title":"jeff bezos the boy who wanted to colonise space","story":"From a young age, the Amazon founder had dreamed up unlikely-sounding schemes. And then one took offIn 1994, Jeff Bezos held 60 meetings with family members, friends and potential investors in an attempt to persuade them to invest $50,000 (£35,000) in his revolutionary idea to create an online bookshop. He failed to convince 38 of them, and 24 years later some of them still cannot bring themselves to talk about what life might have been like if they had taken a punt on Bezos and this “Amazon thing” that the then 30-year-old hedge fund manager wouldn’t shut up about.They have given away $68m of it through their Bezos Family Foundation, which focuses on education. The foundation’s mission statement is a Winston Churchill quote: “What is the use of living, if it be not to strive for noble causes and to make this muddled world a better place for those who will live in it after we are gone?”Bezos’s parents have also given $65m to Seattle’s Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Jackie Bezos, who was 17 and still in high school when Jeff was born, said the donation was: “The gift of time for all those people who will benefit from new treatments and cures. It’s the gift of more hugs, more graduations and more moments.” Bezos tweeted: “My parents rock.”Many industry experts reckon Amazon – which has spread its tentacles into webhosting, TV production and high-end grocery chain Whole Foods – is growing so fast that it will overtake Apple, (Alphabet) Google and Microsoft to become the first trillion-dollar company. Amazon has a market value of $750bn (£538bn) – at Monday night’s share price – making it nearly three times the size of Walmart and more than 30 times the size of the UK’s biggest retailer, Tesco.Bezos has been very, very rich for a long time, but he has only recently started to really spend his billions. In 1999, when he was already worth well north of $9bn, Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, were still living in the one-bedroom apartment in Seattle they had rented when they moved to the city to set up Amazon five years earlier. That year the couple bought their first big house, a $10m mansion on Lake Washington, in the city’s most chichi neighbourhood.Today, however, Bezos owns almost a dozen homes across the US, and is the country’s 25th-largest landowner, according to the Land Report, a magazine that tracks US land ownership. He has made his first tentative steps into giving away a fraction of his fortune, but Bezos seriously lags behind his technology billionaire contemporaries in philanthropy. Bezos would still be the world’s second-richest man if Microsoft founder Bill Gates had not given away more than $36bn. Gates, along with Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Netflix’s Reed Hastings and dozens of the world’s other billionaires have signed up to the Giving Pledge commitment to give away at least half of their fortunes. So far, however, Bezos has not joined up. After being questioned about his apparent reluctance, he tweeted a request for ideas for a “philanthropy strategy”. Last year, he tweeted to thank his 400,000 followers for their input and promised “more to come”.Bezos made his first big donation earlier this year: a $33m grant to a scholarship fund for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the US as children. TheDream.US donation will fund scholarships for 1,000 participants of Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (Daca) programme, who are often called Dreamers. Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for federal grants or loans, and are prevented from accessing state aid for tuition in 44 states. President Donald Trump has made life harder for Dreamers by announcing the end of Daca.Bezos’s previous biggest donation was also political: $2.5m to a campaign to defend same-sex marriage law in Washington state (the state that includes Seattle) in 2012. Jennifer Cast, a former Amazon employee who is a lesbian, emailed Bezos directly on a Sunday asking him to please consider donating between $100,000 and $200,000. “I want to have the right to marry the love of my life and to let my children and grandchildren know their family is honoured like a ‘real’ family,” Cast told Bezos. “We need help from straight people. To be very frank, we need help from wealthy straight people who care about us and who want to help us win.”Bezos replied on the Tuesday: “Jen, this is right for so many reasons. We’re in for $2.5m. Jeff \u0026amp MacKenzie.”Bezos, whom Trump has repeatedly attacked for avoiding tax at Amazon, did not acknowledge the politics of his Dreamers donation. He said the gift was in recognition of the help given to his father, who was one of 14,000 students who fled to the US from Cuba in the early 60s. His mother married Mike when Jeff was four years old, and he was legally adopted.Jorgensen, a unicyclist and bicycle shop owner, did not know he was the father of a billionaire until he was tracked down by journalist and author Brad Stone. In research for The Everything Store, his biography of Bezos, Stone turned up unannounced at Jorgensen’s Road Runner Bike Center shop in Glendale, Arizona in 2013.“I didn’t know where he was, if he had a good job or not, or if he was alive or dead,” Jorgensen told Stone. Jorgensen died in 2015.By all accounts, Bezos was gifted from a very early age. When he was a toddler he used a screwdriver to dismantle his cot because he wanted to sleep in a real bed. His genius at school is recorded for posterity in a 1977 book Turning On Bright Minds: A Parent Looks at Gifted Education in Texas, which profiles a sixth-grade Houston pupil called “Tim”. Tim, who was enrolled in a gifted children programme, is described as reading dozens of books far in advance of his years and of being incredibly interested in science. The author described him as “friendly, but serious” and of general intellectual excellence, but according to his teachers “not particularly gifted in leadership”. Tim was revealed in Stone’s book to be a pseudonym for Jeff Bezos.While Stone was widely praised for such an intimate portrait of Bezos, one reviewer on Amazon gave his book one star (the lowest possible). The reviewer was MacKenzie Bezos, who said it was littered with “numerous factual inaccuracies”.Bezos met MacKenzie at D E Shaw, a hedge fund run by computer scientist David Shaw, who is known as “King Quant” because of the firm’s pioneering role in high-speed quantitative trading. Until he met MacKenzie, when he interviewed her for a job at the hedge fund, Bezos had attempted to apply analytics to finding love. He called it “women flow” and reckoned he could increase the number of women he’d have a chance with if he took up ballroom dancing.In a profile of MacKenzie to promote her novel Traps, she told Vogue that it was she who had chased Bezos and not the other way round. Within three months, they were engaged and after another three months they married. Shortly afterwards Bezos described his idea for selling books over the internet, and while admitting she had “no business sense whatsoever” she could see “how excited he was” and agreed they should leave New York for Seattle to explore his idea. Seattle was chosen because it was close to a big book distributor and under US law the company was only required to collect sales tax for in-state sales.At high school near Miami, Bezos decided he wanted to go into space when he grew up. But, his ambition was not to be an astronaut he wanted to colonise space. He was named valedictorian of his high school class and when he graduated in 1982, the Miami Herald asked for an interview. The 18-year-old Bezos told the paper he wanted to “build space hotels, amusement parks and colonies for 2 million or 3 million people who would be in orbit”. “The whole idea is to preserve the Earth,” he told the paper. “The goal was to be able to evacuate humans. The planet would become a park.”Recently a Bezos-owned rocket called New Shepard sent a mannequin named Skywalker into orbit and the billionaire’s Blue Origin space tourism and exploration company is planning to send its first customers – including Bezos – into space next year. Blue Origin is funded by Bezos selling roughly $1bn-worth of Amazon shares a year. No prospective passengers have yet been named, but Bezos has publicly extended an invitation to Trump, tweeting that he would “reserve him a seat on the rocket, adding #sendDonaldtospace.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7d5d13aae7543c086f54da414187552f7a564e3/0_223_6686_4011/master/6686.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e95eb2b85ddd8053f39faf6512fbebda","title":"twitter profit second quarter social network","story":"Company posts first-quarter profit of $61m on revenues of $665m, comfortably ahead of analysts’ expectationsTwitter has struggled since it went public in 2013 and user growth has slowed dramatically.

Pashinyan led nearly two weeks of protests against Serzh Sargsyan – Armenia’s most powerful politician for more than a decade – prompted by accusations that he had manipulated the constitution to cling to power.The latest protests will be a crucial test of whether the opposition can maintain its momentum after Sargsyan’s resignation. Karen Karapetyan, the acting prime minister and an ally of Sargsyan, suggested on Wednesday morning that a parliamentary election could be held to end the political crisis. “If Pashinyan is the people’s choice, the people can elect him,” he said.In a video appeal posted on Facebook after he led thousands of people on a march, Pashinyan said: “The Republican party is thinking about taking advantage of Serzh Sarksyan’s resignation and wants to keep power.“We can’t agree on the appointment of this party’s representative as prime minister and we can’t allow this corrupted system to continue to exist.”He urged supporters to “come to the square and finish the velvet revolution”.Pashinyan played a key role in ousting Sargsyan, organising many of the protests and calling for the prime minister to go in a televised exchange, before being imprisoned and then released. He had been due to start talks with the ruling party on Wednesday, but they were cancelled late on Tuesday.Sargsyan was a close ally of Vladimir Putin and Russia is closely watching events in the former Soviet republic, where it has two military bases. On Tuesday, the Kremlin said it was pleased the situation appeared stable for now.The Armenian president, Armen Sarkissian, another ally of the former prime minister, was sworn in as president earlier this month after being elected by parliament.Under a revised constitution approved in a 2015 referendum, most state powers shifted to the prime minister, while the presidency became a largely ceremonial post. In another move likely to prolong the political crisis that has rocked one of Russia’s closest allies from the former Soviet Union, Pashinyan said he was ready to be the country’s next prime minister “if people put this responsibility on me”, and would keep up pressure on the ruling elite until it agreed to real change.In Los Angeles, thousands of demonstrators attended a rally on Tuesday to mark the 103rd anniversary of the Armenian genocide.Reuters contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a85a1ee8ecd1abd9d1d26dc9653ae4221d100699/0_340_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef667141e426216e9abb77282366d2fe","title":"world penguin day quiz test your knowledge of our flightless friends","story":"Everybody loves penguins – but how much do you know about them?It is World Penguin Day, so what better way to celebrate than to test your knowledge of penguins, and their appearances in history and popular culture, while also looking at pictures of penguins?

He has no retirement fund in place and would use the Lifetime Isa to save for the long-term futureUnfortunately, the nature of being self-employed means there’s no regularity in how often I’m paid. Projects can be sporadic and uncertain. Invoices can be delayed, projects can drag on or I can just not win work for a while. If I don’t work, I don’t make money. It’s a scary and risky career but it’s very rewarding at times.I pay myself a set salary that helps me limit how much I spend each month, and keeps the money I shouldn’t spend in my business. I also put some of this salary into my savings. Anything extra I earn at the end of the year usually goes into my savings too. It’s definitely stressful though. I sometimes worry if I’ll carry on making enough money as each year passes, but if I can stay organised with my business and earnings, I can relax a lot more.As well as having an unreliable income, it’s also challenging having to calculate how much I’ll spend in expenses for my business and how much tax I’ll owe each year. There are days I wish I was employed again, so I could rely on a steady stream of income and know how much I can actually put into my savings each month. However, the upside of being freelance is that I can earn a higher amount each month than I normally would when working for a company, which makes the opportunity to save far greater.The main attraction of a Lifetime Isa for me is the prospect of having a retirement fund for when I’m older. Being self-employed, I don’t currently have a pension and it’s scary knowing I have nothing to fall back on. I’m hitting 30 this year and having a Lifetime Isa or a pension is a must for me now. I’m always one to want to find the best option possible and other Isas currently on the market don’t feel worthwhile any more.There’s nothing worse than constantly saving and never enjoying your money. My wife and I are hooked on travel and like to see as much of the world as possible. Aside from wanting to build a financial safety net for the future, our main saving goal is to have enough to enjoy ourselves along the way.Laura Lucas, 29, is a marketing assistant in Manchester and a lifestyle blogger in her spare time. She is considering a Lifetime Isa to save for her first houseI blog most evenings, which doesn’t provide much income, but I hope it’ll be my main job one day. Blogging is good in that I can save money that I might have otherwise spent on dinner out or a new outfit, because I’m lucky enough to get gifted these sorts of things. I feel like I’m currently working two jobs, one that I love but which doesn’t pay, and my main job that I rely on for income. My partner and I got engaged over Christmas, so we’re saving for a wedding in about two years’ time, as well as starting to think about buying our first home together. We’ll probably do the wedding on a budget with some special bits and bobs thrown in, but we’ll have to plan ahead to make sure we can afford the extravagant extras. I’d also love to have an engagement party in the next few months and it’s my partner’s 30th birthday this year, so even though we want to celebrate these occasions in style we might have to dial them down a little to save money. We both work really hard, so we don’t want to cut out anything like holidays or evening drinks with friends. I like to think I’m a good saver, and a Lifetime Isa would help us to save for our first house. It’s great to have something backed by the government to help young people save. It’s challenging these days but a Lifetime Isa encourages you to think long term about home ownership and retirement. I already have a couple of savings accounts that I sometimes dip into for Christmas and birthdays, holidays and more expensive purchases, but setting these accounts up can be stressful. It takes a lot of research and background work to fully understand what you’re getting when you sign up.At the moment, I’m not quite sure where I want to be money-wise. I’m grateful for my living situation and being able to live comfortably. However, there are many more things we’d love to do, like decorating our apartment and travelling more, but with our wedding and buying a house on the horizon, we’re trying to be a bit more sensible and only invest small amounts at a time in things we know we need."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7367799adc822bdfd24c4f8625cef7eff67e830/0_80_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35d69f76f4e11be8bdd1e38e50a78438","title":"my financial future can i have my brunch and eat it too","story":"The options appear to be: never socialise and stay in to save for a house, or live a normal, modern urban life and spiral into debt. But is there a third way?Sitting firmly in the middle of the millennial generation (those born 1981-2000) and I’m told I could easily afford to buy my first home in London if I just give up: coffee, my gym membership, an annual weekend away, takeaway food, and a mobile upgrade, or one night out a week, for five years – or avocados.Sure, London living is afforded by renting the equivalent of a dodgy hostel dorm, nights out revolving around two-for-one deals, and “side-hustles”, which is a glorified term for my three jobs. So, should I accept that I can’t have my brunch and eat it too? Living paycheck to paycheck isn’t the dream and maybe neither is owning a home, but there must be a way I could at least consider the option.I’m certainly not alone, but maybe we’re placing too much value on “Yolo” – apparently a typical habit of young people today – so I’ve asked Paul Bridgwater, head of commercial and proposition at financial services provider OneFamily, and millennial lifestyle and personal finance expert Lisa Rowan from The Penny Hoarder what they think – and luckily neither suggested a five-year period where I give up all that I hold dear.Is it really that hard to save in a big city or am I being led astray?Rowan suggests that, unfortunately, it’s not all in my head. “Affordable, low-amenity units are being replaced with luxury buildings that are simply out of reach for many people, especially young people in the early stages of their careers,” she says. “This competitive housing environment means more workers in their 20s and 30s are enduring long commutes from the suburbs or are living with several roommates in order to make the most of their budgets.” But, Bridgwater says, while it can feel unattainable without the help from “the bank of mum and dad” we do have the benefit of living in a connected, digital age that can help us achieve our financial goals.I really value my social life – do I have to give up a chunk of it for five years?No, says Rowan, but there are some hacks to help make sure you don’t spend most of your monthly wages during the excitement of payday. In short, be at least a bit prepared. “Knowing the type of activity upfront can help you determine whether an event is a social and financial priority for you – then, it’s easier to make compromises. You may skip on the 12-person birthday dinner at a fancy restaurant, but you can still meet the group for drinks or dessert afterward. You can still go on a bar crawl with your friends, but perhaps eat a hearty meal before you leave the house,” she says.Bridgwater agrees, and says it’s safe to assume that most of your friends are in the same boat, so be straight up with them. “Money is a bit of a taboo subject for any age group, especially in the UK. On a practical level, earnings, savings and debts are not really discussed and perhaps they should be,” he says. “Like anything else in life, by talking and sharing issues, interesting solutions will come to light.”OK, so maybe I should be budgeting. What are some handy guidelines?Bridgwater says that budgeting isn’t the same for everyone, but taking away the temptation to spend is often the easiest way to save. “Create different accounts for your big expenses (housing, bills and savings) and then set up a standing order into these accounts one to two days after your wages go in from your main account. You’ll then know the money you have left in your main account is money you can spend,” he says.So, can I think about saving for a big purchase and still keep seeing my friends?Yes, says Rowan: “You can have your instant and delayed gratification at the same time.” A product like OneFamily’s stocks and shares Lifetime Isa is a good start when considering your options. With a Lifetime Isa, for every £4 put in, the government adds £1 – so save up to £4,000 a year and get £1,000 as a bonus (available after 12 months). Lifetime Isas are available either based on cash investments, which can be preferable for first-time house purchases in the short-term or stocks and shares investments, which might be preferable if you are aiming to buy your first home in five or more years, as they offer potentially better returns over the longer term, but be aware that capital is at risk.For information on the OneFamily stocks and shares Lifetime Isa, visit OneFamily.

Photograph: Google Street Concerns are growing over the condition of a protected structure on one of Dublin 4’s most sought-after residential streets, which has been left unoccupied for more than a decade.The Victorian house at 13 St Mary’s Road in Ballsbridge has been in the possession of Permanent TSB since 2015, but despite growing property values has remained vacant.The house appears in poor repair and had been entered on Dublin City Council’s register of derelict sites until late last year, when the bank removed large amounts of rubble, litter and wooden hoardings from the front garden.However, the council said its conservation section will in the coming week carry out a more in-depth in inspection of the interior to determine if the house, which is on the city’s Record of Protected Structures, should be entered on its Buildings at Risk register, which aims to prevent the loss of heritage properties.Local resident Killian Mallin said he was shocked to discover the house had been removed from the Derelict Sites Register last year.“It has been empty and in a worsening condition for at least 10 years. But all it seemed to take was a clear-out of the front garden for it to be taken off the Derelict Sites register to me that is illogical when it is clearly so neglected.”While the house is unsightly, with a broken lintel above the front door and sections missing from the wooden side entrance door, the waste of a family home was the most frustrating aspect of the situation, said Mr Mallin.“This property would be a fantastic home for someone. Dublin is facing a housing crisis, with desperation even at the upper end of the market, yet it seems that unless a building is showing signs of imminent collapse the council won’t take action.”Local Fine Gael Cllr Paddy McCartan wrote to Permanent TSB last month asking its intentions in relation to the house, but said he has received no reply.“The bank has had control of this house for a few years now and it has a responsibility to address this situation. It is not good enough to clear the garden and leave it at that. In the current climate, any vacant premises which has the potential to be brought back into use should be a priority.”A spokesman for the bank declined to comment. However, it is understood that there are title issues with the property which have yet to be resolved.The house has been valued at €1.4 million in its current condition. A refurbished house two doors up went on the market last May at €1.9 million. Another house on the road was advertised for rent earlier this year asking €5,500 per month."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3473975.1524668198!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"don t trust social media for facts on eighth amendment fg","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar listens as Caroline and Michael McCarthy speak about their experience of having to travel to Liverpool for an abortion  due to a fatal foetal abnormality during a Fine Gael  event pressing for a Yes vote in the May 25th referendum on whether to repeal the Eighth Amendment. Photograph: Clodagh KilcoyneReutersFine Gael has warned people not to trust social media for facts surrounding the referendum on the Eighth Amendment.A number of senior Ministers held an early morning canvass on Wednesday morning in Dublin city centre, urging people to vote Yes in the referendum.Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy said a lot of people have made up their minds on either side but there is a significant number of voters who are undecided.The more people read into the question being posed in the referendum, the more inclined they are to vote Yes, Mr Murphy added.The Minister added: “One thing to be particularly careful of – because social media will play a dominant role in this campaign, for people who are younger – is to check the facts.“Just because a friend you trust has posted something or reposted something does not mean it is fact. You have a responsibility to get informed.”Mr Murphy was joined by Minister for Health Simon Harris, Minister for Education Richard Bruton, Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan, Minister of State Jim Daly and a number of Senators.Mr Harris said men should not feel excluded from the debate, insisting it is a matter for them too and that they cannot absent themselves from the conversation.Many have had to travel abroad with their partners from every single town and county throughout the country, Mr Harris added.“If it was a woman in our life, if it was a woman we know, would we want her to be treated with compassion and care – or would we want her to feel the cold shoulder?” he said.Mr Daly urged public representatives not to focus exclusively on the Yes or No side, because there is a huge middle ground that genuinely do not know how to vote.The Minister of State said it was the role of each TD and Senator to reach out to these people and ask them to understand the realities of abortion.“If this was my daughter in the morning who had a crisis pregnancy, what would I want for her? Would I want her to have the ability to obtain a termination here or have to go under a cloud of darkness and fear and guilt abroad to deal with it?”Fine Gael has a vote of conscience on this issue, but all senior Ministers are united on the question of repealing the Eighth Amendment.There are ided views on the legislation to replace it.

It’s on a relatively low scale and it can be addressed within this House.”He said: “Will you just please bring this to a conclusion.”Mr Dooley told the Minister he was at a loss as to “why you regret taking the call, why you’ve apologised for taking the call, why you’ve asserted that you’ll never take a call again if you did nothing wrong in the first instance”.He said Mr Naughten failed to understand that “by providing an insight into your thinking, a hunch, a personal opinion whatever it might be - that was confidential information” and the Minister gave it to a lobbyist “and he passed it on”.He said it was now part of evidence the Director of Corporate Enforcement is using as part of his campaign to appoint investigators.“So it was confidential information, Minister. That’s what you need to accept. That’s what you’ve identified as being regrettable for taking the call,” he said.Mr Naughten replied: “One I did not give any confidential information. Two I made it crystal clear that I would be guided by whatever advice I got from my officials and the file shows clearly that’s exactly what I did.”He said: “The reason I regret and apologise is this is the fourth day in a row in this House that we’ve been discussing this issue here regarding a 30 second conversation that I had giving an opinion that I sincerely regret giving and that’s why I’m apologising to this House and to the public out there that this House has been preoccupied about this for four days in a row.”In November 2016 Mr Naughten took a call from former government press secretary Eoghan O Neachtain who informed him that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission had accepted the proposed merger between INM and the Celtic Media Group.The Minister said it was likely the matter would be referred to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland but he would act on the advice of his department officials.Three weeks later in the Dáil he said he had not made his views known and would not do so.But Mr Naughten told Sinn Féin communications spokesman Brian Stanley, one of the TDs who asked questions about the proposed merger: “When I was here in the House, I had an active file in front of me at that stage, and it was a very different situation at that point.”He did not have a file and his role in the process had not started when he spoke to the lobbyist.“And I’ve been at pains to try and point that out,” he said. “And I do sincerely regret it.”Mr Stanley said: “You told me . . . you had absolutely no idea, I think you even shook your head, as to what you were going to do with it”.He added: “I accept the fact that you have apologised. What we must do now is make sure that we tighten up all this area.”The Sinn Féin TD asked Mr Naughten: “Would you agree that unofficial contacts with lobbyists for Ministers has to stop?”The Minister replied: “I won’t be taking calls from lobbyists.”We send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":null,"title":"stormy daniels michael cohen acts like he is above the law","story":"  April 17, 2018Michael Cohen forced to disclose Fox News presenter\u0026rsquos name during court hearing "},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

Children in developing countries who cannot access care are particularly vulnerable, Dr Zaidi added..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}People don’t think of vaccines as a poverty reduction tool but they areDr Anita Zaidi“Rotavirus is a disease that can kill within hours. Children can become severely dehydrated and die on the way to a clinic or hospital. But it’s not just about deaths. I’m a paediatrician and it’s important we do whatever we can to keep kids out of hospital,” she said.The Gates Foundation is highlighting the importance of vaccines with the launch of a video by Aardman Animations, creators of Wallace and Gromit. According to data from the World Health Organization there has been an 84 per cent fall in the number of measles deaths since the introduction of a vaccine against the disease. And so far this year there have been just eight cases of polio thanks to the global vaccination campaign.Heather Wright, executive producer at Aardman, said the campaign had a simple message: to urge parents and carers to get their child vaccinated.\u0026quotYou would throw yourself in front of a bus to protect your child so why wouldn\u0027t you get your child immunised?\u0026quot she said. According to the latest data 95 countries have introduced a vaccine against rotavirus, and 22 have plans to do so. These include many high-income countries such as the UK and the US, and low-income countries which receive financial help from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.However, around 75 countries have not introduced the vaccine: these include middle income countries such as China, Russia, Egypt and Chile which do not qualify for support from Gavi. Dr Zaidi said that countries had many competing priorities but stressed that the vaccine was not only good for a nation’s health, but also economic prospects. In many countries, where there is no system of health coverage, people face financial ruin when they or members of their family are hospitalised.Vaccines | Global coverage by the end of 2016A recent study looked at the impact of the introduction of various vaccines, including rotavirus, on 41 low and middle-income countries between 2016 and 2030. It predicted that as well as averting 819 deaths for every one million people vaccinated the rotavirus vaccine would also prevent 242,000 people from facing catastrophic health costs.Dr Zaidi said: “People don’t think of vaccines as a poverty reduction tool but they are. People in low income countries need to recognise what powerful tools vaccines are for reducing the health and financial burden of the poor.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Beekeeper says 700,000 of her insects may have been killed by rival in arson attack The dark ‘incel’ internet subculture praised on the Facebook page of the Toronto van attack suspectAlfie Evans\u0026#39 father threatens to privately prosecute three NHS doctors on conspiracy to murder charges Skeleton of child trying to shelter from Vesuvius eruption uncovered in PompeiiBanking heiress Kate Rothschild victim of a £500,000 jewellery burglary while her children sleptTrolls who abuse judges on social media could be prosecuted, suggests Lord Chief Justice European citrus crops threatened by devastating greening diseaseRoyal baby latest news: New prince meets family as world awaits name announcementEmmanuel Macron says we need to \u0026#39step up our game\u0026#39 in address to US Congress - watch liveMeghan Markle appears close to tears as she attends moving Anzac Day dawn service with Prince HarryThe Handmaid\u0026#39s Tale: 10 things we know so far about season 2Comment: The TSB meltdown shows why we\u0026#39ll never accept being slaves to technologySimpsons actor Hank Azaria \u0026#39willing to step aside\u0026#39 from playing Apu, after racism rowRoyal wedding guest list: Who did Meghan Markle and Prince Harry invite?Spanish politician tipped as future leader resigns in shame over shopliftingEuroMillions draw: Lucky Brit\u0026#39s numbers come in to scoop third highest UK jackpot everPrince Alexander of Cambridge?

I don’t know, we’re all just going to have to wait and see.“I’m thrilled for them all, it’s lovely - really good news.”Gun salutes have been fired in London by the King\u0027s Troop Royal Horse Artillery and the Honourable Artillery Company to mark the birth of the Duke and Duchess  of Cambridge\u0027s baby boy. The soldiers, horses and Guns of The King\u0027s Troop Royal Horse Artillery rode out from Wellington Barracks into Hyde Park for a 41 round salute.And the Honourable Artillery Company (HAC), the City of London\u0027s Army Reserve regiment, fired a 62-round Gun Salute from The Tower of London.Members of the Kings Troop Royal Horse Artillery fire a First World War era gun during a 41 gun Royal salute in Hyde ParkMembers of the Kings Troop Royal Horse Artillery on Tuesday afternoonGun salutes have also been used to mark other Royal eventsPunters have been racing to place bets on the possible name of the royal baby boy, with James and Henry catching favourite Arthur.Bookies still have the moniker of the legendary king as their top name, but are seeing Royal fans taking a punt on other choices facing the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.William Hill spokesman Rupert Adams said: \u0026quotHenry has been very popular overnight and might well be in the frame.\u0026quotThe firm has Arthur as 2-1 favourite, but the odds on Henry have been shortened from 14-1 to 10-1.Other popular names include James 41, Phillip 51 and Albert 61.Coral spokesman Harry Aitkenhead said: \u0026quotArthur is the hot favourite at the moment and ever since the birth yesterday our customers have been queuing up to get their bets on.\u0026quotJames, Albert and Philip have also been backed and anything else would be a major shock.\u0026quotHe added their favourite was Arthur 2-1, followed by James 4-1, Albert 5-1, Philip 6-1, and Alexander and Henry both with odds of 12-1.Click here for the latest odds on possible Royal baby names - and history behind them.Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s sister, is the first member of the family to be spotted at Kensington Palace today.The 34-year-old was pictured leaving the Royal couple\u0027s home after meeting the as-yet-unnamed baby for the first time.Pippa Middleton pictured leaving Kensington Palace on Tuesday afternoonThe birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s baby boy has been marked by  bell ringing at Westminster Abbey. Bell-ringers ring a peal from 1pm to celebrate the prince\u0027s arrival.The Prince of Wales said he and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, are \u0026quotboth so pleased at the news\u0026quot.Prince Charles said in a statement: \u0026quotIt is a great joy to have another grandchild, the only trouble is I don’t know how I am going to keep up with them.”The official commemorative souvenirs marking the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s baby son have gone on sale - before the new prince\u0027s name has been announced.Featuring a lion cub and unicorn inspired by the Royal Arms, the Royal Collection china is decorated with gold ribbons, silver pompoms and a coronet-inspired pattern.The pieces bear the words \u0026quotWelcome to our new royal baby\u0026quot and display William and Kate\u0027s coronet.The range of official commemorative chinaware to celebrate the prince\u0026#39s birth The official range includes a pillbox costing £35, a tankard for £39 and a plate priced at £49.Each item in the range is gilded with 22-carat gold and made in Stoke-on-Trent using traditional methods.There is also a pram-shaped woven decoration, made with glistening threads, delicate pearl detail, and embroidered on the back with \u0026quotRoyal Baby 2018\u0026quot, for £14.95.A middle name of the Prince of Wales, Arthur is also one of Prince William\u0027s middle names as well as the Queen\u0027s father, George VI.The legendary King Arthur was the mythical leader of the knights of the Round Table, who supposedly lived in the 5th or 6th century.Once popular, the name fell out of fashion, but has had a revival in recent years. Former prime minister David Cameron has a son called Arthur.Queen Victoria used to insist that the name Albert was used as a middle name by her descendants, if not a first, in honour of her much-loved consort Prince Albert.By choosing Albert or Bertie for a boy, the Duke and Duchess would be honouring Queen Elizabeth II\u0027s father, George VI, who was actually Albert Frederick Arthur George but always known to his family as Bertie.Shy, stammering Bertie was forced to become king when his brother Edward VIII abdicated, but won the nation\u0027s affection by standing firm in London during the Second World War.A lasting tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh might see the new Prince of Cambridge called Philip.Both Prince Charles and Prince William have Philip as a middle name.The Duke of Edinburgh - known for his dedication to duty and his acerbic wit - has been married to the Queen for more than 70 years and is the nation\u0027s longest serving consort.A Prince Freddie of Cambridge would have a historical link to the 1st Duke of Cambridge.Prince Adolphus Frederick lived from 1774 to 1850 and was a son of George III.He was apparently very fond of interrupting church services by bellowing out \u0026quotBy all means\u0026quot if the priest said \u0026quotLet us pray\u0026quot.William may want to pay tribute to his father - but perhaps as a middle name as it may be considered too similar to Charlotte.James could be chosen to signify the Duchess\u0027s affection for her brother, the baby\u0027s uncle, James Middleton.William already has a cousin James, the Earl and Countess of Wessex\u0027s son, Viscount Severn.James is a Stuart name. James I, son of Mary, Queen of Scots, had been king of Scotland for 36 years as James VI when he became king of England in 1603.They could choose William as a middle name for a boy, but also perhaps Michael as a middle name out of respect for Kate\u0027s father.Kate\u0027s grandfather on her paternal side was called Peter, while on her maternal side, her grandfather was Ronald.Thomas also appears several times in Kate\u0027s family tree, as does Francis.When it comes to godparents, the youngest Cambridge child might well be dealt the best hand yet. After seven years of marriage (and three children), the Duke and Duchess now know exactly who their real friends are.Plus, with 12 godparents between them, Prince George and Princess Charlotte have already ticked off all those their parents felt obliged to ask. Admittedly a few of their oldest and best friends have already been bagged – Emilia d’Erlanger, for example, is George’s godmother and Prince William’s friend, Tom Van Straubenzee belongs to Chalotte – but there are plenty more of their friends waiting in the wings, as well as a few close cousins. Click here for our best guestimate at who might be in the frame for possible godparents to the new prince.Some of the runners and riders in our shortlist in the race to become the youngest royal\u0026#39s godparents It would be a worst nightmare for most new mothers, but the Duchess of Cambridge had a close knit team of helpers on hand to help ensure she looked her best for her moment in front of the world\u0027s media.For the past few years, the Duchess has worked closely with former PA Natasha Archer and hairdresser Amanda Cook Tucker to ensure that her every public appearance is pristine.Natasha Archer and Amanda Cook Tucker arriving to tend to Kate after the birth of Prince GeorgeThe duo are often spotted loading vanity cases and suit carriers onto the royal jet during tours or lurking behind the scenes to tend to the Duchess whenever she needs.Here is everything you need to know about the Royal \u0026quotglam squad\u0026quot, who were on hand for the Duchess\u0027s Lindo Wing exit.Arthur remains the bookmakers\u0027 favourite for the new Royal baby\u0027s name, but James is the most popular for inidual wagers placed with Ladbrokes.James  has seen the largest amount of bets and money placed since the Duchess of Cambridge gave birth.It is the same name as the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s brother, James Middleton.

Rohan Deb Roy says we must rethink research and practice to escape this dark pastSir Ronald Ross had just returned from an expedition to Sierra Leone. The British doctor had been leading efforts to tackle the malaria that so often killed English colonists in the country, and in December 1899 he gave a lecture to the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce about his experience. In the words of a contemporary report, he argued that “in the coming century, the success of imperialism will depend largely upon success with the microscope”.Teenage vandals sentenced by judge to read history booksRoss, who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine for his malaria research, would later deny he was talking specifically about his own work. But his point neatly summarised how the efforts of British scientists was intertwined with their country’s attempt to conquer a quarter of the world.Ross was very much a child of empire, born in India and later working there as a surgeon in the imperial army. So when he used a microscope to identify how a dreaded tropical disease was transmitted, he would have realised that his discovery promised to safeguard the health of British troops and officials in the tropics. In turn, this would enable Britain to expand and consolidate its colonial rule.Ronald Ross at his lab in 1898 Calcutta (Welcome Collection)Ross’s words also suggest how science was used to argue imperialism was morally justified because it reflected British goodwill towards colonised people. It implied that scientific insights could be redeployed to promote superior health, hygiene and sanitation among colonial subjects. Empire was seen as a benevolent, selfless project. As Ross’s fellow Nobel laureate Rudyard Kipling described it, it was the “white man’s burden” to introduce modernity and civilised governance in the colonies.But science at this time was more than just a practical or ideological tool when it came to empire. Since its birth around the same time as Europeans began conquering other parts of the world, modern Western science was inextricably entangled with colonialism, especially British imperialism. And the legacy of that colonialism still pervades science today.As a result, recent years have seen an increasing number of calls to “decolonise science”, even going so far as to advocate scrapping the practice and findings of modern science altogether. Tackling the lingering influence of colonialism in science is much needed. But there are also dangers that the more extreme attempts to do so could play into the hands of religious fundamentalists and ultra-nationalists. We must find a way to remove the inequalities promoted by modern science while making sure its huge potential benefits work for everyone, instead of letting it become a tool for oppression.When a slave in an early 18th-century Jamaican plantation was found with a supposedly poisonous plant, his European overlords showed him no mercy. Suspected of conspiring to cause disorder on the plantation, he was treated with typical harshness and hanged to death. The historical records don’t even mention his name. His execution might also have been forgotten forever if it weren\u0027t for the scientific enquiry that followed. Europeans on the plantation became curious about the plant and, building on the slave’s “accidental finding”, they eventually concluded it wasn’t poisonous at all.Instead it became known as a cure for worms, warts, ringworm, freckles and cold swellings, with the name Apocynum erectum. As the historian Pratik Chakrabarti argues in a recent book, this incident serves as a neat example of how, under European political and commercial domination, gathering knowledge about nature could take place simultaneously with exploitation.For imperialists and their modern apologists, science and medicine were among the gracious gifts from the European empires to the colonial world. What’s more, the 19th-century imperial ideologues saw the scientific successes of the West as a way to allege that non-Europeans were intellectually inferior and so deserved and needed to be colonised.A racist caricature of European scientists visiting Africa. The severed head on the right is that of Ronald Ross (Welcome Collection)In the incredibly influential 1835 memo Minute on Indian Education, British politician Thomas Macaulay denounced Indian languages partially because they lacked scientific words. He suggested that languages such as Sanskrit and Arabic were “barren of useful knowledge”, “fruitful of monstrous superstitions” and contained “false history, false astronomy, false medicine”.Such opinions weren’t confined to colonial officials and imperial ideologues and were often shared by various representatives of the scientific profession. The prominent Victorian scientist Sir Francis Galton argued that the “the average intellectual standard of the negro race is some two grades below our own (the Anglo Saxon)”. Even Charles Darwin implied that “savage races” such as “the negro or the Australian” were closer to gorillas than were white Caucasians.Yet 19th-century British science was itself built upon a global repertoire of wisdom, information, and living and material specimens collected from various corners of the colonial world. Extracting raw materials from colonial mines and plantations went hand in hand with extracting scientific information and specimens from colonised people.Leading public scientific institutions in imperial Britain, such as the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and the British Museum, as well as ethnographic displays of “exotic” humans, relied on a global network of colonial collectors and go-betweens. By 1857, the East India Company’s London zoological museum boasted insect specimens from across the colonial world, including from Ceylon, India, Java and Nepal.The scientists who used this evidence were rarely sedentary geniuses working in laboratories insulated from imperial politics and economics. The likes of Charles Darwin on the Beagle and botanist Sir Joseph Banks on the Endeavour literally rode on the voyages of British exploration and conquest that enabled imperialism.Sir Hans Sloane’s imperial collection started the British Museum (Paul HudsonWikipedia)Other scientific careers were directly driven by imperial achievements and needs. Early anthropological work in British India, such as Sir Herbert Hope Risley’s Tribes and Castes of Bengal, published in 1891, drew upon massive administrative classifications of the colonised population.Map-making operations including the work of the Great Trigonometrical Survey in South Asia came from the need to cross colonial landscapes for trade and military campaigns. The geological surveys commissioned around the world by Sir Roderick Murchison were linked with intelligence gathering on minerals and local politics.Efforts to curb epidemic diseases such as plague, smallpox and cholera led to attempts to discipline the routines, diets and movements of colonial subjects. This opened up a political process that the historian David Arnold has termed the “colonisation of the body”. By controlling people as well as countries, the authorities turned medicine into a weapon with which to secure imperial rule.New technologies were also put to use expanding and consolidating the empire. Photographs were used for creating physical and racial stereotypes of different groups of colonised people. Steamboats were crucial in the colonial exploration of Africa in the mid-19th century. Aircraft enabled the British to surveil and then bomb rebellions in 20th-century Iraq. The innovation of wireless radio in the 1890s was shaped by Britain’s need for discreet, long-distance communication during the South African war.In these ways and more, Europe’s leaps in science and technology during this period both drove and were driven by its political and economic domination of the rest of the world. Modern science was effectively built on a system that exploited millions of people. At the same time it helped justify and sustain that exploitation, in ways that hugely influenced how Europeans saw other races and countries. What’s more, colonial legacies continue to shape trends in science today.Imperialist Cecil Rhodes planned a railway and telegraph line to connect Africa (Alamy)Since the formal end of colonialism, we have become better at recognising how scientific expertise has come from many different countries and ethnicities. Yet former imperial nations still appear almost self-evidently superior to most of the once-colonised countries when it comes to scientific study. The empires may have virtually disappeared, but the cultural biases and disadvantages they imposed have not.How to fix all of your sleep problems with scienceYou just have to look at the statistics on the way research is carried out globally to see how the scientific hierarchy created by colonialism continues. The annual rankings of universities are published mostly by the Western world and tend to favour its own institutions. Academic journals across the different branches of science are mostly dominated by the US and Western Europe.It is unlikely that anyone who wishes to be taken seriously today would explain this data in terms of innate intellectual superiority determined by race. The blatant scientific racism of the 19th century has now given way to the notion that excellence in science and technology are a euphemism for significant funding, infrastructure and economic development.Because of this, most of Asia, Africa and the Caribbean is seen either as playing catch-up with the developed world or as dependent on its scientific expertise and financial aid. Some academics have identified these trends as evidence of the persisting “intellectual domination of the West” and labelled them a form of “neo-colonialism”.Not all international collaborations are equal (US Army AfricaFlickr)Various well-meaning efforts to bridge this gap have struggled to go beyond the legacies of colonialism. For example, scientific collaboration between countries can be a fruitful way of sharing skills and knowledge, and learning from the intellectual insights of one another. But when an economically weaker part of the world collaborates almost exclusively with very strong scientific partners, it can take the form of dependence, if not subordination.A 2009 study showed that about 80 per cent of Central Africa’s research papers were produced with collaborators based outside the region. With the exception of Rwanda, each of the African countries principally collaborated with its former coloniser. As a result, these dominant collaborators shaped scientific work in the region. They prioritised research on immediate local health-related issues, particularly infectious and tropical diseases, rather than encouraging local scientists to also pursue the fuller range of topics pursued in the West.In the same study, 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the scientists based in developed countries did not acknowledge their collaborators in poorer countries as co-authors in their papers. This is despite the fact they later claimed in the survey that the papers were the result of close collaborations.International health charities, which are dominated by Western countries, have faced similar issues. After the formal end of colonial rule, global health workers long appeared to represent a superior scientific culture in an alien environment. Unsurprisingly, interactions between these skilled and dedicated foreign personnel and the local population have often been characterised by mistrust.For example, during the smallpox eradication campaigns of the 1970s and the polio campaign of past two decades, the World Health Organization’s representatives found it quite challenging to mobilise willing participants and volunteers in the interiors of South Asia. On occasions they even saw resistance on religious grounds from local people. But their stringent responses, which included the close surveillance of villages, cash incentives for identifying concealed cases and house-to-house searches, added to this climate of mutual suspicion. These experiences of mistrust are reminiscent of those created by strict colonial policies of plague control.Polio eradication needs willing volunteers (Department for International DevelopmentFlickr)Western pharmaceutical firms also play a role by carrying out questionable clinical trials in the developing world where, as journalist Sonia Shah puts it, “ethical oversight is minimal and desperate patients abound”. This raises moral questions about whether multinational corporations misuse the economic weaknesses of once-colonised countries in the interests of scientific and medical research.The colonial image of science as a domain of the white man even continues to shape contemporary scientific practice in developed countries. People from ethnic minorities are underrepresented in science and engineering jobs and more likely to face discrimination and other barriers to career progress.To finally leave behind the baggage of colonialism, scientific collaborations need to become more symmetrical and founded on greater degrees of mutual respect. We need to decolonise science by recognising the true achievements and potential of scientists from outside the Western world. Yet while this structural change is necessary, the path to decolonisation has dangers of its own.In October 2016, a YouTube video of students discussing the decolonisation of science went surprisingly viral. The clip, which has been watched more than 1m times, shows a student from the University of Cape Town arguing that science as a whole should be scrapped and started again in a way that accommodates non-Western perspectives and experiences. The student’s point that science cannot explain so-called black magic earned the argument much derision and mockery. But you only have to look at the racist and ignorant comments left beneath the video to see why the topic is so in need of discussion.Inspired by the recent “Rhodes Must Fall” campaign against the university legacy of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes, the Cape Town students became associated with the phrase “science must fall”. While it may be interestingly provocative, this slogan isn’t helpful at a time when government policies in a range of countries including the US, UK and India are already threatening to impose major limits on science research funding.More alarmingly, the phrase also runs the risk of being used by religious fundamentalists and cynical politicians in their arguments against established scientific theories such as climate change. This is a time when the integrity of experts is under fire and science is the target of political manoeuvring. So polemically rejecting the subject altogether only plays into the hands of those who have no interest in decolonisation.Alongside its imperial history, science has also inspired many people in the former colonial world to demonstrate remarkable courage, critical thinking and dissent in the face of established beliefs and conservative traditions. These include the Indian anti-caste activist Rohith Vemula and the murdered atheist authors Narendra Dabholkar and Avijit Roy. Demanding that “science must fall” fails to do justice to this legacy.The call to decolonise science, as in the case of other disciplines such as literature, can encourage us to rethink the dominant image that scientific knowledge is the work of white men. But this much-needed critique of the scientific canon carries the other danger of inspiring alternative national narratives in post-colonial countries.A campaigner during a March for Science protest in Melbourne (Wikipedia Commons )For example, some Indian nationalists, including the country’s current prime minister, Narendra Modi, have emphasised the scientific glories of an ancient Hindu civilisation. They argue that plastic surgery, genetic science, aeroplanes and stem cell technology were in vogue in India thousands of years ago. These claims are not just a problem because they are factually inaccurate. Misusing science to stoke a sense of nationalist pride can easily feed into jingoism.Meanwhile, various forms of modern science and their potential benefits have been rejected as unpatriotic. In 2016, a senior Indian government official even went so far as to claim that “doctors prescribing non-Ayurvedic medicines are anti-national”.Attempts to decolonise science need to contest jingoistic claims of cultural superiority, whether they come from European imperial ideologues or the current representatives of post-colonial governments. This is where new trends in the history of science can be helpful.For example, instead of the parochial understanding of science as the work of lone geniuses, we could insist on a more cosmopolitan model. This would recognise how different networks of people have often worked together in scientific projects and the cultural exchanges that helped them – even if those exchanges were unequal and exploitative.But if scientists and historians are serious about “decolonising science” in this way, they need to do much more to present the culturally erse and global origins of science to a wider, non-specialist audience. For example, we need to make sure this decolonised story of the development of science makes its way into schools.Students should also be taught how empires affected the development of science and how scientific knowledge was reinforced, used and sometimes resisted by colonised people. We should encourage budding scientists to question whether science has done enough to dispel modern prejudices based on concepts of race, gender, class and nationality.Schools need to teach the non-Western history of science (Wikipedia Commons)Decolonising science will also involve encouraging Western institutions that hold imperial scientific collections to reflect more on the violent political contexts of war and colonisation in which these items were acquired. An obvious step forward would be to discuss repatriating scientific specimens to former colonies, as botanists working on plants originally from Angola but held primarily in Europe have done. If repatriation isn’t possible, then co-ownership or priority access for academics from post-colonial countries should at least be considered.This is also an opportunity for the broader scientific community to critically reflect on its own profession. Doing so will inspire scientists to think more about the political contexts that have kept their work going and about how changing them could benefit the scientific profession around the world. It should spark conversations between the sciences and other disciplines about their shared colonial past and how to address the issues it creates.Rohan Deb Roy is a lecturer in South Asian history at the University of Reading. theconversationor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This is what that signifiesInstead, the judge said the best Alfie\u0027s parents could hope for was to explore the options of removing him from intensive care either to a ward, a hospice or his home.But a doctor treating Alfie, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said that for Alfie to be allowed home would require a sea change in attitude from the child\u0027s family, and they feared that in the worst case they would try to take the boy abroad.Mr Justice Hayden ruled out his family\u0027s wishes to take the child to the Bambino Gesu hospital in Rome, following interventions from the Pope and the Italian authorities.Alfie has been at the centre of a life or death treatment battle, with his parents, Mr Evans and Kate James, trying to block doctors from withdrawing life support in a sometimes acrimonious six-month dispute which has seen a series of court battles.A last-ditch appeal in which the Italian Ambassador granted Alfie citizenship of Italy in order to take him to Rome for treatment failed on Monday.And a late night court hearing heard by telephone by Mr Justice Hayden and lawyers for both sides confirmed his earlier decision permitting life support, helping Alfie to breathe, to be withdrawn.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesA statue in honour of the first female Suffragette Millicent Fawcett is unveiled as Prime Minister Theresa May and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan look on during a ceremony in Parliament Square.

A spokesperson for the European Commission’s Brexit negotiating team said the scheme’s application to the UK would be part of discussions on the future relationship, where chief negotiator Michel Barnier has so far been unwilling to cut special deals for Britain.“Today’s agreement is another important step in protecting the EU’s external borders,” said Valentin Radev, the interior minister for Bulgaria, which is currently chairing the European Council. “By knowing who is coming to the EU before they even arrive at the border, we will be better able to stop those who may pose a threat to our citizens.”On Wednesday ambassadors from the EU countries confirmed an agreement reached on the ETIAS scheme between the presidency of the European Council and the representatives of the European Parliament, who must agree any new EU laws. The European Parliament will now have to vote on the plan, which will also have to be signed off by the European Council.One year to Brexit: What is still needed to complete a deal with the EU?The EU says the new scheme will “improve internal security, prevent illegal immigration, protect public health and reduce delays at the borders by identifying persons who may pose a risk in one of these areas before they arrive at the external borders”. Because it applies to the whole Schengen passportless area and not just the EU, travellers to countries outside the EU such as Norway, Iceland, and Switzerland would also be hit.Data submitted in the online application would be processed against EU police and Interpol databases, with further checks made against anyone who raises flags. Countries that already need visas to travel to Europe will not be covered by the scheme, given that tighter restrictions are already in place on them. Airlines and ferry lines will also have a new responsibility to check whether travellers who need documents have them, with coach operators scheduled to pick up the same rules three years after the scheme\u0027s introduction.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

The announcement, set for Wednesday, consists of £250 million of new money spread across the two years.Officials say the aid will be focused on keeping medical facilities in the region open, as well as training doctors and nurses – amid estimates that 478 health facilities have been attacked or destroyed and at around 830 health workers have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in 2011.Western countries plan to bypass Russia\u0027s UN veto over SyriaMinisters from dozens of countries across the world met with NGOs and donor countries on Tuesday in the EU capital on the first day of the so-called Brussels II summit.Opening the international meeting at a joint press conference UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura insisted that a political solution had to be found to the civil war“We\u0027re seeing in last few weeks, days, that military gains, territorial gains and military escalation do not bring a political solution, has not brought any change. On the contrary,” he said.Speaking at the same joint press conference, Federica Mogherini, the EU’s foreign affairs chief, echoed Mr de Mistura’s comments, saying there was a need to “return to the political process under the UN auspices to start real, meaningful political negotiations that are clearly the only way forward for the country”.The first day of the summit mostly consisted of government liaising with NGOs and aid groups on priorities and strategies to help alleviate civilian suffering. Closing the Tuesday sessions, EU humanitarian and and crisis commissioner Christos Stylianides described the day’s sessions as “fruitful”.The British government’s message on the first day of the summit focused on Russia’s role in the conflict, with international development secretary Penny Mordaunt warning that “flagrant disregard for international norms” would cause more “misery and destruction”.Mordaunt said Britain wanted to defend a “global rules-based system that keeps all of us safe”.“Russia’s flagrant disregard for international norms and laws poses a grave threat to the global order we rely on for our collective security. In wielding its UN veto twelve times on Syria, it has given a green flag to Assad to perpetrate human rights atrocities against his own people,” she warned.“We’re here to address the urgent humanitarian needs in Syria and the wider region, but all of us here know that the only solution to end the suffering in Syria is a political settlement that brings peace. The longer they delay, the more people are going to die, and the more misery and destruction will be inflicted on Syria.”Syria bombings: US, UK and French military air strikes wreckageSyria bombings: US, UK and French military air strikes wreckageThe wreckage of the Scientific Studies and Research Centre in the Barzeh district, north of Damascus, which was targeted by the US, UK and France air strikes.A Syrian soldier films the damage of the Syrian Scientific Research Center surrounded by papers and rubble.Firefighrers extinguish smoke that rises from the damage.

Calling for an immediate ceasefire, she is expected to say that “Syria is now one of the most dangerous places on earth for aid workers and medical staff”. She will continue: “Medical facilities and schools have been deliberately targeted, aid has been blocked to starve communities into submission, and rape and sexual violence have been deployed as routine weapons of war.“Today’s pledge of UK aid support will help keep medical facilities open in the face of relentless attacks so doctors and nurses can save the lives of innocent Syrians, as well as helping the millions of Syrian refugees sheltering in neighbouring countries. But today can’t only be about pledges of money and we cannot allow anyone to turn their backs on the global rules and standards that keep us all safe.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Then I’m like wait a minute b*tch are you in labor?!!! pic.twitterp6SMEfunP0Determined not to give birth in an airport, Ms Freeman made it to her hotel room and began searching on YouTube for the best way to deliver her baby. Filling a bath with warm water and grabbing two towels – one to bite onto, and one to wrap the baby in – she began pushing once her contractions started happening every minute. My contractions were already at a minute a part lol I was late as hell.

My little surprise bundle of international joy!Speaking to The Independent, Ms Freeman said her family were left absolutely stunned.No one had a clue, she said. But they were all extremely excited. It’s my parents\u0027 first grandchild and he makes the fifth living generation on my mum’s side.As soon as I flew back they all came to visit, bearing gifts and spoiling Xavier. They found out about four days after I gave birth to him while I was still in Istanbul. So of course they called every single day, wanting to talk to him and see pictures and videos and checking in to make sure we were okay.Looking back on the birth now, Ms Freeman says despite the risks, she probably wouldn\u0027t change a thing. What it’s like to give birth at the Lindo WingThe experience taught me so much. I learned how to be resourceful and calm under pressure. I was able to bond one on one with my son from his first breaths, she said. I’m thankful that everything went well and I was able to deliver a healthy baby, she added. I know everyone isn’t always so fortunate but I appreciate the experience and hopefully he’ll think it’s an amazing story when he’s older!Though Ms Freeman\u0027s birth was a success, the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) strongly discourages women from giving birth alone. “Whilst the RCM recognises that every woman has the right to give birth without professional assistance, there are potential risks for both mother and baby and for that reason the RCM would strongly discourage women from giving birth by themselves and without professional support or skilled medical help, an RCM spokesperson told The Independent.“The RCM also believes that the more we develop maternity services which enable women and midwives to get to know each other and for women to trust their midwife the less likely women are to choose to give birth without a midwife present.”On the huge reaction on social media, Ms Freeman said: I expected my friends to go crazy reading it but I didn’t expect it to get as big as it did. Though I probably should have, seeing as though everyone who knows the story loses their minds.I think all the tweets broke my Twitter.Read Ms Freeman\u0027s amazing story in full below.I still really don’t understand what’s so shocking about my delivery story.

The hotel had these sanitation baggies in the bathroom so I just picked it up by the cord and dropped it in the bag.

Our aim throughout these talks has been to protect devolution and make sure laws and policy in areas which are currently devolved remain devolved and this we have achieved.Contrastingly, Mr Russell told MSPs: The effect of the UK government\u0027s latest proposal remains this: the Scottish Parliament\u0027s powers could be restricted without consent.\u0026nbspThis is not something the Scottish Government could recommend the parliament approves.

We arranged all the logistical aspects with the embassy and Palazzo Chigi.\u0026ldquoUntil the moment they tell me everything is over, I will continue to hope but while I hope, at the same time I think we will not make it because they do not want to.
