That they belong.\u0027\u0027It doesn\u0027t feel good to have been working at the company that put that out there,\u0027 Terra Field, a software engineer at Netflix, wrote in a Medium post.\u0027Especially when we\u0027ve spent years building out the company\u0027s policies and benefits so that it would be a great place for trans people to work.\u0027Three employees including Field were reportedly suspended last week after crashing a virtual meeting for executives on the Chappelle special, but later reinstated. Another was sacked for leaking internal data about the cost of the program.The walkout and rally have drawn support from film and television celebrities such as Jameela Jamil (The Good Place) and Jonathan Van Ness (Queer Eye), who have recorded a video message expressing \u0027love and support\u0027 for the movement.\u0027This has been such a challenging time I\u0027m sure for all of you,\u0027 Van Ness said in a video released Wednesday by the activist group Team Trans. \u0027It really is so often the trans, non-binary and intersex folks who actually advance theses conversations so often at risk to themselves and to their careers.\u0027Van Ness identifies as nonbinary.\u0027I know it\u0027s not easy. I know it\u0027s scary. I have so much respect for you and so much love and gratitude for you for sticking up for the LGBT+ community\u0027s right to dignity and safety and respect,\u0027 said Jamil. Acclaimed comedian Hannah Gadbsy - who has her own popular Netflix specials - last week called the streaming giant an \u0027amoral algorithm cult.\u0027Chappelle has been accused of mocking transgender people in the past, but remains hugely popular.In The Closer, he describes a US rapper who \u0027punched the LGBTQ community right in the AIDS,\u0027 compares trans women to the use of Blackface, and jokes about threatening to kill a woman and stash her body in his car.Chappelle - who is black - also argues that white gay people \u0027are minorities until they need to be white again,\u0027 and that LGBTQ communities have made progress in a few years that black people have not enjoyed in decades.Netflix trans employees and allies release a list of demands ahead of the walkout - The VergeNetflix Employees Stage Walkout to Protest Dave Chappelle Special - Variety"},{"url":null,"title":"Britney Spears fianc Sam Asghari spotted house hunting Jeffree Stars mansion","story":"   Last year, at her father\u0027s request, the conservatorship (the one dealing with Britney\u0027s personal affairs, not the conservatorship controlling her finances) was temporarily transferred from Jamie to her long-time caregiver Jodi Montgomery.While he blamed his stepping down on health issues, Jamie\u0027s decision came amid accusations that he had gotten into an altercation with Britney\u0027s then 14 year-old son Sean Preston, now 16.Kevin Federline - Britney\u0027s ex and the father of Sean and his brother Jayden James, 15 - made a police report and took out a restraining order against his former father-in-law after the incident in which, reportedly, a \u0027very angry\u0027 Jamie broke down the door of a room Sean had locked himself in and \u0027shook\u0027 the frightened teen.Finally last month, a judge  suspended Jamie as the conservator of Britney\u0027s personal life and $60 million estate after 13 years, appointing accountant John Zabel as a temporary conservator. The suspension comes as allegations of his mistreatment of his daughter - including secretly recording her calls and messages - have ramped up the furor over his conservatorship."},{"url":null,"title":"Taliban BEHEAD womens youth volleyball player report claims","story":"Share this articleAfghanistan\u0027s female volleyball players tell of threats and fear - BBC Sport"},{"url":null,"title":"Speed booster jabs save Christmas say experts amid calls Covid Plan B enacted","story":"Share this articleCovid restrictions: Some Plan B measures to support testing and the NHS are set to happen in parts of England"},{"url":null,"title":"Politicians told need overhaul political correct Prevent","story":"Share this articleSome campaigners have raised fears that the rules risk stifling the free press, \u0027silencing marginalised voices\u0027 and introducing \u0027state-backed censorship\u0027.The Prime Minister was asked by Sir Keir Starmer to use the \u0027inescapable desire\u0027 of MPs in the aftermath of the killing of Sir David to \u0027clamp down on the extremism, the hate and the abuse that festers online\u0027.Speaking in the Commons, the Labour leader said \u0027arrogant\u0027 social media firms should be made to take responsibility.\u0027It\u0027s three years since the Government promised an Online Safety Bill but it\u0027s not yet before the House,\u0027 he said.\u0027Meanwhile, the damage caused by harmful content online is worse than ever. Dangerous algorithms on Facebook and Instagram, and Hope Not Hate have shown me an example of violent Islamism and far-Right propaganda on TikTok.\u0027Julian Knight, chairman of the Commons culture committee, said: \u0027We find ourselves in an unworkable situation where, at the whim of the Prime Minister at the despatch box, the process of scrutiny of this important piece of legislation to tackle online harms will be undermined.

But using online social media, keyboard warriors post accusatory, aggressive messages often based on conspiracy theories and lies. Our timelines and inboxes are awash with threats,\u0027 Mr Hancock and Ms Huq wrote.They pair said female politicians, particularly from ethnic minority backgrounds, received the worst online abuse but white men were not immune, citing one social media post calling for Mr Hancock to be executed live on BBC One.The murder of MP Jo Cox, they wrote, had been followed only weeks later by \u0027unprecedented vitriol\u0027 surrounding the EU referendum.\u0027This time we must make permanent changes to tackle the problem and set public debate on a better path,\u0027 they said. \u0027The online harms bill is a good start, but it does not yet tackle anonymous abuse.\u0027It is a particular problem that libel laws don\u0027t work in the internet age. It is hard to prove that a single post by a social media user with a few hundred followers causes significant damage, but when that post is shared and added to by hundreds or thousands of others, it has the same effect as a defamatory newspaper piece in days gone by.\u0027Saying politicians also needed to treat each other with respect, Mr Hancock and Ms Huq said threats could no longer be ignored and that a permanent campaign was needed \u0027because \u0027keep calm and carry on\u0027 is no longer an option\u0027."},{"url":null,"title":"No10 reduce time boosters six months FIVE Jeremy Hunt says","story":" Health minister Maggie Throup responded: \u0027The JCVI (Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation) have provided the advice that it should be a minimum of six months from the second jab.\u0027She reassured the Commons that \u0027the immunity doesn’t fall off a cliff edge\u0027. She said \u0027it has waned slightly\u0027 but \u0027they still have a huge amount of immunity over and above those who are yet to get their first jab\u0027.And Ms Throup asked for people to come forward \u0027as soon as they are eligible\u0027.The JCVI — which directed the UK\u0027s vaccine roll out — approved booster doses for over-50s, the vulnerable, care home residents and healthcare workers last month.But it said the top ups should only be given six months after the second dose because this was the \u0027sweet spot\u0027 for boosting immunity.Professor Wei Shen Lim, the head of their vaccines unit, said at the time: \u0027We want to suggest a six-month limit as a lower limit because we don’t want people to feel they need to rush to have this booster dose.\u0027Getting a booster dose too early might mean getting a dose when they don’t actually need to have a vaccination because they still have a high level of protection.\u0027And, as we have seen with the first and second dose, it may be that a longer interval to the third booster dose may actually be beneficial in the longer term.\u0027It takes about two weeks after a third dose is administered for it to bolster immunity against the virus. Britain\u0027s booster drive is lagging far behind the first vaccine roll out with just 4.05 out of 8.7million eligible people in England (47 per cent) having received their top up doses to date.  NHS England data also shows only 27.8 per cent of care home residents have received their crucial third vaccine, alongside 14.1 per cent of care home staff, despite the two being high priority groups.

Image: iStockThe meeting between Government officials and the hospitality sector has ended.The expectation is that the Government will shortly issue the full guidelines in relation to the reopening of nightclubs and music venues, as well as revised guidance for pubs and restaurants.It is understood that a number of issues remained unresolved between parties at the end of the discussion. The first meeting which began shortly after 4pm was postponed for over an hour after it emerged the nightclub guidelines were not ready. Sources said that the capacity in pubs and restaurants will not be 100 per cent but will be the maximum number of customers that can be allowed under social distancing rules. While some have put that figure at 70 per cent capacity, sources said in many cases it will be much higher. Nightclubs will be allowed to operate at 100 per cent capacity. A concession that has been given to pubs is that if there is a designated performance area and a designated dance floor, dancing will be allowed to live music in those circumstances.A member of the hospitality industry involved in the talks said: “There are still quite a number of issues that we are not happy with.”In a tweet earlier, Adrian Cummins of the Restaurant Association said that the rationale Government officials used for the stricter rules on social distancing in restaurants and pubs than in nightclubs was because the latter had “a younger and lower risk demographic. Restaurants and pubs are an older demographic with a higher risk factor.”Earlier, Minister for Culture and Arts Catherine Martin said the decision by the Government to allow 1,500 people stand at concert venues and 100 per cent capacity at nightclubs represented real progress when it came to the reopening of the sector. Speaking to the media outside Government Buildings on Thursday night, Ms Martin said at that point that talks were ongoing but progress had been made. She pointed to 100 per cent capacity at nightclubs and also to the change whereby people will be able to order drinks at bars and then return to their seats. “Unfortunately that is the one constant that throws up something at us and complications arise.”Referring to correspondence from the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet), she said: “The Nphet letter arrived late on Monday night. The three party leaders met and we had to go straight into negotiations which we did on Tuesday with the industry. “We hope this is progress for them. It’s the best we can do. It is moving in the right direction. We have to be cognisant of Covid too. It may not be what they hoped for on October 22nd but it is still further progress on where we were in the last few days.”She insisted that engagement had happened and had been ongoing since Tuesday. “My priority has been finding a position that would allow everyone to show progress and at the same time respect where we are at with Covid,” she said. The Restaurant Association of Ireland (RAI) gave a “guarded welcome” to the new guidelines for hospitality. “Whilst social distancing remains within restaurants, pubs and hospitality on the advice of public health, the increase in table numbers and return of multiple bookings is welcome. “We are calling on every restaurant, pub and hospitality venue to abide by the guidelines, do the right thing to protect our customers, staff and the health of the nation. Our industry is moving forward in the right direction,” said the RAI’s chief executive Adrian Cummins.The Government has made a major concession to live music venues by dropping the requirement that all people attending concerts will not be allowed leave their seats. Ms Martin has confirmed that up to 1,500 people attending music concerts will be allowed to stand, with the remaining members of the audience sitting. In effect, it means most music venues in the country - with the exception of a few such as the 3 Arena and the INEC in Killarney - will be allowed to have the entire audience standing during the performance. In addition, Ms Martin has indicated that nightclubs will also open with 100 per cent capacity. This was an issue of contention during talks between Government officials and representatives of the hospitality industry. There has also been significant progress on bar service, with both sides close to agreement on a system where people can queue for drinks at the bar. However, patrons will not be allowed to linger or remain at the bar but must return to the table once they have collected their drinks. It was agreed on Wednesday that all hospitality venues can have multiple table bookings with a maximum of 10 per table.Earlier, Ms Martin told RTÉ: “For our live venues, they will be open to standing area of 1,500 now. So we’ll have the standing, with the combination of 100 per cent seating.”The measures, which includes extended opening hours beyond 11.30pm, are set to be reviewed in the coming weeks.Ms Martin said that the measures were important to support an industry that had been closed since March 2020.“This is what we’re doing to balance public health,” she said.Venues will have to follow certain rules, including the use of Covid passes and enforcing the wearing of face masks for anyone not drinking or dancing.The meeting between Government officials and the hospitality sector to finalise guidelines for the reopening of nightclubs and music venues was earlier delayed by an hour because of problems with the draft text. The meeting began but was quickly postponed when an issue arose around the wording and definition of ‘nightime economy’.The meeting resumed at around 6pm. Representatives from the Restaurants Association, Hotel Federation and the two publicans associations, as well as representatives of live music venues, met with officials from the Department of Tourism, and the Department of Enterprise. The State tourism agency, Fáilte Ireland, is expected to issue the guidelines to allow the reopening of nightclubs and live music venues later on Thursday evening. The sector has been shut for 585 days and is due to reopen on Friday. - Additional reporting PA"},{"url":null,"title":"president hosts statistical society seminar on same day as armagh event","story":"President Michael D Higgins hosted a seminar in Áras an Uachtaráin to honour the 175th anniversary of the founding of the Irish Statistical and Social Inquiry Society.  Photograph:Tony Maxwell President Michael D Higgins hosted a seminar in Áras an Uachtaráin to honour the 175th anniversary of the founding of the Irish Statistical and Social Inquiry Society on the same day as a religious ceremony in Armagh to mark 100 years since the partition of the island. President Higgins declined to attend Thursday’s event in St Patrick’s Cathedral over his concerns that the title and its reference to partition in 1921 meant the event was politicised.Instead, the President responded to the keynote address given to the Society’s President Danny McCoy - who is chief executive of IBEC - on sustainable development at an important milestone for the society, which was founded in 1847. The chair of the Climate Change Advisory Council Marie Donnelly also delivered a response. The title of Mr McCoy’s speech, “Sustainable Development: ‘Still’ The Opportunity for Irish Economic Policymakers”, almost exactly mirrored an address he gave almost 30 years ago when delivering the Barrington address. The only addition to the title was the inclusion of the word ‘Still’. In his address, he revisited his speech from 30 years ago and explored what was meant by sustainability in the early 1990s, and how policy makers had responded to it. Mr McCoy, who was then with the Economic and Social Research Institute, said he knew little about sustainability initially but was encouraged by Professor John Fitzgerald to “delve into the deep end of the environmental agenda, of which I knew: precisely nothing. “My familiarity with the scientific periodic table was stretched as I had to quickly learn what sulphur, carbon and ozone were about and identify their symbols too. As the Irish government in 1990 held the then European Community rotating presidency, with the lofty ambition of it being declared a “green presidency”, there was plenty of interest in the work. “(We) worked on topics like acid rain, nitrate pollutants and carbon pricing. Our joint work on energy sustainability and potential double idends from carbon taxes within a macroeconomic model felt like being at a knowledge frontier, particularly as the UN Earth Summit in 1992 brought forward many research requests which could best be summarised as “what’s all this environmental stuff about?”. Perhaps, some things remain constant.”Mr McCoy told the audience that the Irish economy and society were at markedly different states of development back then relative to other nations. He said that the remarkable economic growth that happened after that but “sustainable development failed to advance in lockstep”. He said climate change presented “formidable difficulties” for policymakers in the 1990s and still do now. He said there was uncertainty in respect to how effective specific response options would be in actually averting potential climate change. Looking at the situation now Mr McCoy told the audience that “more people live on Earth and they do so in better economic conditions and in more peaceful, stable political environments than at probably any point in history”. He said the threat from global warming remained contested in some quarters but nothing like the scepticism that which existed in the early 1990s. “The scientific and statistical evidence amassed in the last thirty years is far from incontrovertible but appears compelling. The IPCC results appear credible from empirical evidence and the one experience I have personally come to appreciate is that truth is the not the most important characteristic in environmental politics: credibility is…“Credibility in the global warming hypothesis has grown dramatically in the last thirty years..He criticised the arguments that mitigation and not adaptation was always and everywhere the only outcome and that offsets in other jurisdictions were somehow morally repugnant.He said he remained optimistic that the sustainable development challenge can be met, perhaps not in the initial short-term timescale the IPCC recommends, but by human ingenuity and solidarity every anthropogenic problem can be tackled. Every epoch through time teaches us that with sufficient statistical and social inquiry most challenges can be overcome.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Industry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"blow independence trade figures show scotlands reliance rest","story":"Nicola Sturgeon’s case for independence has been dealt a blow after Scottish businesses increased their reliance on trade with the rest of the UK.Unionist politicians said new figures, released on Thursday, proved that the SNP’s plan to leave the UK and rejoin the EU as an independent state would cause “huge economic damage” and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs.Exports to England, Wales and Northern Ireland rose £2.5 billion, to £52 billion, in 2019. Meanwhile, trade with the EU also grew but at a slower pace, increasing by just £420 million to £16.4 billion.The rest of the UK accounted for 60 per cent of Scottish exports, compared to just 19 per cent for the EU and 21 per cent to the rest of the world.“These figures are further proof of the enormous benefit Scotland derives from being part of the UK,” said Liz Smith, the Scottish Tory economic spokeswoman, said.Hundreds of thousands of Scottish jobs are reliant on us being part of the Union.It goes without saying that Scotland separating from its most important trading bloc would wreak huge economic damage - and yet that\u0027s exactly the nightmare scenario the SNP, with their independence obsession, are hell-bent on creating.Ms Sturgeon argues that it makes sense for Scotland to leave the UK for the EU, because the European Single Market is seven times larger than Britain’s. However, the official statistics released by her own government show that Scottish trade with the rest of the UK is worth more than three times that with the EU. Pamela Nash, chief executive of the Scotland in Union campaign group, said: “Whatever you think of Brexit, it’s clear that leaving the UK and seeking to rejoin the EU – which is far from guaranteed – would be catastrophic for jobs and livelihoods.”A spokeswoman for the Scottish Government said: “These statistics for 2019 show a strong underpinning performance in Scotland’s exports before the twin economic shocks caused by the global pandemic and EU Exit.“The main driver for a growth in exports to the rest of the UK was an increase in electricity exports, helping to keep the lights on in England and Wales.More from NewsThe Queen spent night in hospital after cancelling Northern Ireland visit, Palace saysPrue Leith accuses assisted dying critics of ‘scaremongering’Cop26: Fears grow that Glasgow climate change summit will fall short of its lofty aimsLaura Kuenssberg ‘in negotiations to step down as BBC political editor’Strictly’s health curse strikes again as Judi Love tests positive for CovidThe NHS isn\u0026#39t facing another Covid crisis and Sajid Javid knows itMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"handed keys culture silicon valley","story":"When my nine-year-old says the word “radio” she waggles her fingers in the air to put speech marks around it. As if it’s a thing that doesn’t really exist: something people once believed in, like Christianity or the four humours, but which now seems comically unlikely. I noticed this the other day, when we had a little tussle about whether to play pop music or Radio 4 in the kitchen. “You people!” she chuckled indulgently. “With your ‘radio’.”One reason for this disbelief may be that we have no actual radios in our house. Like 33 per cent of UK households (an amazing statistic, considering the technology only launched five years ago), we have voice-activated smart speakers instead. The two need not be mutually exclusive, of course. You can ask Alexa to play whatever you like, including thousands of radio stations from across the world. But it’s a different beast, culturally. An actual radio – a box with antennae and a limited range of options, from which burbles a series of familiar voices – is something you can really get to know.I sometimes worry that my children are growing up in a country with limitless cultural choice, but not much real culture at all. The digital revolution is creating a vast, pan-global but essentially American civilisation. We get our news from Facebook, arguments from Twitter, television from Netflix, shopping from Amazon, and now “audio content” from one of the three Silicon Valley robots who dominate the UK’s voice assistant market: Siri (Apple), Alexa (Amazon), and Google Assistant.These robots are characterless, but not neutral. Their algorithms decide which search results we get served. According to a new government-commissioned report, some UK broadcasters are concerned that their radio stations are being downgraded by digital voice assistants, while others appear to get bumped up through paid promotion. Quite apart from these dark machinations, there’s a danger that British radio stations will simply get lost in the blizzard of content. This has already happened to BBC TV, which is almost invisible to the children of the Netflix Youtube generation.American culture was already dominant when I was a child: we all craved burgers and Daisy Dukes. But the cultural infrastructure was still British, which meant we got to see and hear plenty of ourselves. It wasn’t always edifying: mediocrities abounded, then as now. But they were our mediocrities. Representation matters, as the social justice warriors say. You have to see it to be it!Although Britain still produces world-class actors, directors and musicians, increasingly they go through the digital mincer of the streaming services and come out… not quite American, perhaps, but Amer-ish. Glossy and Californian, like Adele. Or transatlantically vague, like the cast and set of Sex Education.The best and most surprising TV show I’ve seen for ages is the BBC comedy Alma’s Not Normal, on BBC Two. It’s surprising not just because it manages to wring laughter from unlikely material – prostitution, heroin addiction and a childhood in care – but because everything about it feels so British, from the Bolton accents to the grimy pebble-dash and even the litter caught in the grassy verges. Another surprising thing: although the pilot episode won a Bafta, there hasn’t been much social media buzz about it. But perhaps that is inevitable. As long as our algorithms are made in Silicon Valley, our culture will be too.More from NewsThe Queen spent night in hospital after cancelling Northern Ireland visit, Palace saysPrue Leith accuses assisted dying critics of ‘scaremongering’Cop26: Fears grow that Glasgow climate change summit will fall short of its lofty aimsLaura Kuenssberg ‘in negotiations to step down as BBC political editor’Strictly’s health curse strikes again as Judi Love tests positive for CovidThe NHS isn\u0026#39t facing another Covid crisis and Sajid Javid knows itMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"laura kuenssberg negotiations step bbc political editor","story":"Laura Kuenssberg is in talks to step down from her job as the BBC\u0027s political editor, according to reports.The journalist, who has been in the role for six years, could be replaced and made a presenter of the Today programme, according to claims first reported by Jim Waterson, \u0027s media editor.Waterson is the partner of Jess Brammar, the BBC\u0027s executive news editor, who took the role in September this year amid controversy about her previous criticism of the Government.The report suggested a wider reshuffle at the corporation is under way, with Jon Sopel, the North America editor, known to be leaving his role and speculation that other high profile figures are set to change jobs.  A BBC spokesman said: The North America editor role is currently being advertised internally and the role will go through the normal recruitment process. It\u0027s a bit soon to start speculating about the outcome of this, let alone other jobs which aren\u0027t actually vacant.Senior corporation sources have expressed frustration at the speculation. However, the broadcaster would not confirm on Thursday night whether an inquiry would be launched into the leaked information. According to , Sopel, who has announced that he will be moving back to the UK, will be in the frame for the political editor position should Kuenssberg move on. He would be replaced by Sarah Smith, the current BBC Scotland editor, it has been reported, leaving her position vacant.  Another role that could be left empty is that currently held by Huw Edwards, who is reportedly considering his future. But one understood not to be under discussion is that of Andrew Marr, with inside information suggesting he will be kept in place for royal coverage in the event of the Queen\u0027s death.If Kuenssberg moves to the Today programme, the flagship Radio 4 current affairs show will have a roster of six presenters.She became the BBC\u0027s first female political editor in 2015 and has covered two elections and the Brexit referendum. Accusations of bias led to a petition for her removal from the role over coverage of Jeremy Corbyn, and it was reported that she required a bodyguard during the 2017 election. More from NewsThe Queen spent night in hospital after cancelling Northern Ireland visit, Palace saysPrue Leith accuses assisted dying critics of ‘scaremongering’Cop26: Fears grow that Glasgow climate change summit will fall short of its lofty aimsStrictly’s health curse strikes again as Judi Love tests positive for CovidThe NHS isn\u0026#39t facing another Covid crisis and Sajid Javid knows itCovid vaccine booster wait could be cut to five monthsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/N0O0lX8z/poster.jpg","title":"uk covid infection rate europe","story":"Article bookmarkedFind your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profileDon\u0026#x27t show me this message again✕✕CloseRelated video: UK Covid-19 cases surge, hospitals strained Cases of Covid-19 in the UK are currently among the highest in Europe and are higher than they were this time last year, when parts of England were under local lockdowns.The vaccine has meant that although case numbers are elevated, there are fewer cases of people with serious illness having to be treated in hospital.

Follow Covid news - live: NHS chiefs urge government to implement winter ‘plan B’Figures show that the number of people testing positive for coronavirus currently stands at more than 40,000 per day. Hospital admission numbers are still below levels seen last autumn, although they are rising gradually.According to Professor Neil Ferguson, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) from Imperial College London, there are “a number of reasons” why the UK currently has higher infection levels than many other European countries.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the professor suggested that the UK has “lower functional immunity in our population than most other western European countries” for a number of reasons.According to Professor Ferguson these reasons include the vaccine rollout starting earlier in the UK than elsewhere and the fact that “we relied more on the AstraZeneca vaccine”.There are other suggestions that less mask wearing, more relaxed rules around mixing and a slowing vaccine rollout could also be behind the surge in figures. But why exactly are cases of Covid rising in the UK?Waning immunity?The UK was one of the fastest countries in the world to rollout the Covid-19 vaccine, meaning that immunity of some of those who were first vaccinated may be lower now.A study of Covid test results of vaccinated people who logged their symptoms in an app, suggested that after about five or six months, the protection against catching the virus wanes significantly.Join our new commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesView  comments"},{"url":null,"title":"covid families blast head sand","story":"Exclusive: Covid families beg Boris Johnson to start Plan B to avoid another Christmas catastropheAs new infections top ,, bereaved families have urged ministers to trigger their Covid Plan B as they mourn those \"we will never again see across the table from us on Christmas Day\"Members of Covid Families for Justice outside Downing StreetByPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political EditorRachel Wearmouth:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | commentsFamilies who lost loved ones to Covid today warn ministers sticking their heads in the sand as the virus spreads may leave Britain in a Christmas catastrophe.Campaign group Covid Families For Justice beg Boris Johnson to not repeat your mistakes and jeopardise the lives of people across the country this festive season.The familiesapos emotional plea comes as health chiefs confirm , more infections and a further  deaths.

Last winter tens of thousands of us lost loved ones and we will never again see their faces across the table from us on Christmas Day.

Scientists, however, fear waning immunity among the elderly and vulnerable could spell trouble in the months ahead. Speaking to reporters during a visit to Northern Ireland on Thursday, the PM said there was no need to change course. “The most important thing people can do now is get that booster jab, he said.

The Health Secretary made the claim at a No press conference last night, despite deaths hitting  in the last week.One Labour MP said it showed a sickening disregard for all the lives being lost.But Boris Johnsonaposs official spokesman said today: He was simply pointing out that on a purely factual basis the number of deaths per day is signicantly lower than we have seen at the peak, when we didn’t have the protection of our vaccine programme, and the greater treatment. Told the Health Secretary was not, in fact, doing that, Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman replied: Like I say, every death is clearly a tragedy. It is factually accurate that deaths are signicantly lower thanks to our vaccine rollout.  Askedthe Prime Minister agreed with Mr Javid, the spokesman said: Every single death that’s taken place during this pandemic is a tragedy. And the government continues to do everything possible to protect lives and take action where necessary to ensure lives are protected. And of course protect livelihoods as well and we’ll continue to do so. Mr Javid made the comment last night as he warned Covid cases could soon top , a day. He said: The NHS is performing with distinction, and I’d like to thank everyone who’s working so hard to keep us safe. And we’ll do what it takes to make sure that this pressure doesn’t become unsustainable and that we don’t allow the NHS to become overwhelmed. Deaths remain mercully low, but they are still sadly over  a day. This pandemic is not over.  Thanks to the vaccination programme, yes, the link between cases and hospitalisations and deaths has signicantly weakened, but it’s not broken. So we must all remember that this virus will be with us for the long term, and that it remains a threat. UK deaths within  days of a positive test reached a peak of more than , a day at the height of the second wave. Shadow health minister Justin Madders tweeted last night: Since the start of September there have been , deaths from covid.That is more than the total deaths for April, May, June, July and August combined. That is not mercully low Sajid Javid.Labour MP Richard Burgon added: Sajid Javid just described Covid deaths as mercully low. Current daily Covid death figures are equivalent to over , deaths per year. This shows a sickening disregard for all the lives being lost. Lobby Akinnola, spokesperson for Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice said: The health secretary has a track record of flippantly causing hurt to those of us who lost loved ones, whether it be implying our loved ones cowered from the virus or the idea that newly , loved ones losing their lives each week is mercully low. Perhapshe would at long last meet with us he could have it explained exactly why his words were in such poor taste  “A long time ago experts suggested , deaths would be a good outcome but here we are,  deaths a week and over , dead with the virus - in what world is this mercully low  “The only mercy many of us have received were NHS staff helping us say good bye to our loved ones. “Sajid Javid needs to choose his words more carefully, perhaps he could start by saying he will now implement a plan B to save lives and will meet with us to learn the lessons from our loved ones losses  Mr Javid and No refused to implement Plan B, which would see compulsory masks and vaccine passports in some spaces, despite NHS chiefs begging for action now. No admitted the NHS faces a very challenging winter but claimed it is not under signicant pressure yet. A spokesman also refused to say how many deaths it might take to kick in Plan B. “We don’t put a specic threshold on a particular metric because things need to be looked at in the round, focusing too much on one particular metric would be unhelpful and can be misleading in some circumstances, he said. But Carol Popplestone of the Royal College of Nursing said: The pressure on services is already unsafe and unsustainable and is heading in one clear direction. Denying the problem does not help patients nor staff.  “Next week’s Budget is a chance for government to put both long and short-term investment into health and care services.”But Mr Javid warned restrictions are more likely toduring Christmaspeople fail to wear masks when appropriate. That is despite many Tory MPs not wearing masks in the Commons chamber. On reports household mixing could be restricted under a Plan C, a No spokesman said: Neither ministers nor officials are working on those proposals, that’s not accurate. You’ve seen Plan B… that is what we would move to as a next steprequired.

Doctors accused ministers of being wilfully negligent by failing to implement Covid Plan B, which would see theof masks, working from home and use of vaccine passports.Health Secretary Sajid Javid claimed that the NHS was facing a sustainable level of pressure as the winter approaches and said further curbs would not be brought in at the moment.But he raised the threat of new restrictions before Christmaspeople didnapost get their booster jabs. It comes as Cabinet Office officials were said to be discussing plans to curb household mixing - which could form part of a “Plan C” -booster jabs donapost bring the virus under control.  Health Minister Ed Argar said plan C was not being actively considered and insisted current measures are working. Boris Johnson insisted that Government was sticking with its winter Covid plan despite the high number of infections. Speaking during a visit to a school in County Antrim, the Prime Minister said: The numbers of infections are high but weaposre within the parameters of what the predictions were. We are continuing with the plan we set out in July. We are watching the numbers very carefully every day, he said. The numbers of infections are high but we are within the parameters of what the predictions were, what Spi-Mand the others said we would be at this stage given the steps we are taking. We are sticking with our plan. But thereaposs an almighty row brewing over whether the Government is on course to repeat last yearaposs mistakes by taking lockdown measures too late in the face of spiralling infections. Hereaposs what we know about the plans to battle the virus this winter.  What is the Covid winter plan  The Government published a blueprint on how it intends to battle Covid over the colder months in September. The UK is currently following Plan A, which relies on booster jabs for the over-s and other vulnerable groups, as well as jabs to  to -year-olds to keep the virus at bay. It also advises people to wear masks in enclosed spaces, although it is not mandatory. But there are mounting fears that the booster programme is moving too slowly, with reports of chaotic rollouts for in care homes. And infections have been on the rise, with , cases as of am on Wednesday. Hospital admissions stand at  on average per day over the last seven days, up from  a week earlier, a rise of %. Scientic experts have warned that the UK is probably already close to , cases a day. The worrying figures have prompted calls for the Government to do more to curb the spread of the virus.  What is aposPlan Bapos  The -page Winter plan contains a list of tougher measures known as Plan B, which will be deployedthe NHS in England comes under unsustainable pressure. Masks would become mandatory in certain settings, and vaccine passports would be made a legal requirement for nightclubs, outdoor festivals and football matches. Brits could be ordered to work from home againthey can, and there will be public information campaigns to communicate the change of risk to the public. What needs to happen to move to aposPlan Bapos  The Government has refused to say explicitly - but we can take some educated guesses. The aim of the Covid winter plan is to ensure the NHS does not come under unsustainable pressure. This means keeping a close eye on the number of people being hospitalised with the virus, as well as whether the link between infections and hospitalisations remains weak. Vaccine efficacy is also key as the success of the UKaposs vaccine rollout has been crucial to easing Covid restrictions. The presence of any deadly new iants is also a key factor, so ministers are keeping a close eye on a new strain called AY.., which some are calling Delta Plus.Plan B might not all be imposed at onceministers do hit go on the plan. Boris Johnson previously described it as a number of dferent shots in the lockercases started rising. What is aposPlan Capos - and will household mixing be banned  Cabinet Office officials are said to be discussing a ban on household mixing before Christmasboosters fail to bring the virus under control. Health Minister Edward Argar said the plan wasnapost being actively considered but the Government would always look at ways to prevent the virus spiralling out of control. But a Whitehall source told the : The focus is very much on measures that can be taken without a major economic impact, so keeping shops, pubs and restaurants open but looking at other ways to reduce the risks.” Downing Street insisted neither ministers or officials are working on those proposals and there were no plans to move to Plan B at the moment. The national ban on indoor meet-ups was lted on May  after being in place for the last lockdown. It remained in place after shops and pubs reopened as experts suggested people were more likely to ignore social distancing guidancethey are at home with their friends and loved ones. What about foreign travel  Rules around international travel have just been relaxed, with the old traffic light rules scrapped and replaced with a single red list. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has also announced that day  PCR tests can be replaced with cheaper lateral flows from next week, to make holidays cheaper for families. None of this gives a sense that the Government is planning to scrap foreign travel again and there is no mention of ending overseas travel in the winter plan. Will there be another lockdown  Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was the latest top Tory to rule out ato a national lockdown. Boris Johnson is desperate to avoid a lockdown - and it would only ever be imposed as a last resort due to the widespread disruption to peopleaposs lives. Working from home is one of the big levers the Government can pull to reduce the spread of the virus, as well as banning household mixing. It is likely that these measures would be imposed before the Government even considered a full lockdown. And remember - we didnapost have the vaccine last winter, which is the best protection we have against the virus.

Danielle, who runs a dance school, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, said: “I had always been obsessed with baby dolls and I’d always pretend to be pregnant in games with my sisters when we were young. “I was starting to panic in the last few years that I hadn’t found aposthe oneapos and I started joking about using a sperm donor and going it alone. “But then I actually thought aposwell, why not apos and looked into it. “It was the best decision I ever made. “Now I have a gorgeous baby boy and I just can’t stop staring at him.”Danielle found the Facebook group ‘Single mums by choice’ and knew from there that having a baby by herself was definitely something she wanted to do.  After getting fertility tests, she was encouraged to try sooner rather than later as her AMH levels were low- which check your egg count. “It felt right to do it,” she said. “I knew I wanted to be a mum and luckily my family were all really supportive of my decision.” Danielle picked out her sperm donor from a sperm bank, costing her £, and started her IVF journey in November  which cost an additional £,. “I’m really indecisive but picking the sperm donor wasn’t as bad as I thought,” she said. “You see pictures of the donor as a child and information about them and the one I picked seemed really sweet. He is cm, a slim build, has dark brown hair and brown green eyes. Itaposs quite similar to my features but in the end it was the way he came across as a genuine, caring person in his answers to question that drew me to him. Danielle had her mum Carolaposs help with the injections before she was then ready for her egg collection in December . “It was really nerve wracking, then finding out how many eggs I had but I found out I had five fertilised and three of them made it from that, she said. Danielle then had an embryo transfer and had to wait  days until she could find outit had worked or not - thankfully it worked. “They phoned me and told me I was pregnant, and I couldn’t believe it,” she said. “It was the best Christmas present ever. “My pregnancy ran smoothly with the cravings of oranges and ice lollies and I loved feeling my baby kick, roll and stretch in my tummy.” But at  weeks Danielle started to get very thirsty and was told at  weeks that she had gestational diabetes. She had to have a scan to check the size of the baby and was told he was only lbs and there wasn’t enough amniotic fluid around him. Danielle had to be induced the next day and had to make a panicked call her sisters to make sure they were there for the day. Luckily both Jasmine, , and Lianne, , got there just in time to be her birthing partners and Danielle gave birth to Robin on th August at Lister Hospital, Stevenage, weighing lb oz. “Seeing him for the first time was so surreal,” Danielle said. “My first night was scary but I’m in such a bubble of being a mum. “I don’t get anything done because I just stare at him. “I can’t believe he is mine. “Robin will always know how he came into this world from very young. “I’m the happiest I have ever been, and I am so glad I did it.”Do you have a story to share  Email jessica.taylor@reachplc.Comment MORE ON BabiesBanksHospitalsPregnancySingle mumStarting a familyIVFSperm donationFertility\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Nottinghamshire Police have received  reports of spiking, and in  of the instances the victim believes they were spiked by a needle. All of the cases occurred in October, with the first of these  were reported on  October , the force has said. The majority of the victims have been young women, mostly students, but there are also some young men who have reported similar cases. The Nottinghamshire Police say: A number of victims reporting being spiked by some sort of injection have reported effects consistent with a substance being administered.  In one case an injury has also been sustained which could be consistent with a needle. Most of the attacks occurred over the weekend of October , but thankfully no other linked crimes were committed as a result of the spiking. The force states that it is working with the University of Nottingham, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham City Council, East Midlands Ambulance Service, Public Health and hospital trusts as part of their enquiries. They have put in some measures in response to the reports, including police dogs being taken out with officers on Saturday  October on patrol in the city.  Superintendent Kathryn Craner, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “We are working really closely with our partner agencies throughout Nottinghamshire and have met as recently as today. “I would like to reassure people we are working incredibly hard to investigate these reports and are placing a lot of resources into these enquiries and also have a dedicated team of detectives working on any reports made to us. “I understand that these reports and those from other cities are concerning but want to reassure people that we have been working with our partner agencies and licensed premises throughout the city to help tackle any reports of spiking.  “By taking a multi-agency approach and coming together to work on these reports we are able to use a vast amount of resources.Zara Owen, , previously told the Mirror that she believes she was spiked with a needle while on a night out on Monday  October.She had visited Pryzm nightclub in Nottingham and does not remember anything that happened after she entered the club despite not drinking much and never having blacked out before.

Now itaposs happened to me, itaposs much stronger in my mind. Iaposll be more aware and make sure [my friends] are all okay.

The fear factor is still there but I would like to think that I can go out and measures will be in place so I can have a stress free evening. I donapost know what weaposre supposed to do.  Nadia Whittome, the Labour MP for Nottingham East, told the BBC: What we really have to be careful of is that this conversation doesnapost become one about what women can doand putting the responsibility on women. Women should be able to go out freely and enjoy themselves without fear of assault, sexual or otherwise, and this is part of a much wider problem of male violence, from sexual harassment to rape. Speaking about the dficulty in finding a solution, she added: After Sarah Everard in particular, trust in the police is at an all time low - itaposs been shattered.

Dr Amy Kavanagh, who has been visually impaired since birth, was paired with her Ava a year ago but despite her dog’s training she says they are regularly put in danger by passers-by wanting to fuss over the animal. She shared her experiences and has even recorded a video from Avaaposs point of view after Guide Dogs revealed figures that show % of guide dog owners claim their dog is distracted by strangers at least once a day and % said it happens at least once a week. This comes as new figures from the Guide Dogs charity revealed that % of owners claim their dog is distracted by strangers at least once a day, and % said it happens at least once a week.  The charity also polled the public and found three in  Brits freely admitted to stopping and interrupting a guide dog while it was working by petting it. Dr Kavangh said: People will try and pet her or whistle at her while she is working and it can be confusing for me because she is my eyes.

It comes as flat-faced dogs continue to gain popularity, with The Kennel Club reporting a , per cent rise in the number of Frenchies registered in the last  years. As of , brachycephalic breeds account for one fth of the nation’s dog population, but owners often don’t realise that their pets could be in pain. A survey from the Royal Veterinary College revealed that  per cent of short-nosed dog owners couldn’t recognise the signs that their brachycephalic dog was struggling to breathe.  Blue Cross has launched a series of mock adverts around London calling on British brands to stop using these animals in their ad campaigns, in a bid to prevent a welfare crisis using the hashtag #endthetrend. Brachycephalic describes any dog whose muzzle looks like it has been flattened or squashed inwards. Their bottom jaw is often disproportionately longer than their upper jaw, and the dog may look as though their lower jaw sticks out. Some of the breeds that are considered as ‘brachy’ include pugs, French bulldogs and Boston terriers - with Persian cats and Lionhead rabbits also affected. And as a result of them being used to promote products that are often completely unrelated to the dogs, they’ve been given a fashionable status, and are often popular with celebrities.Fetch. Chase. Eat. Sleep. Repeat. is a new podcast from TeamDogs which takes a sideways look at what itaposs REALLY like bringing puppies into your le.Every week hosts Hannah Jones and Karen Price will be joined by celebrity dog owners like Strictly Come Dancingaposs Shirley Ballas and Coronation Street actress Samia Longchambon to chew over the adventures - and misadventures! - of puppy parenting. There will be a new episode every Tuesday and you can download it from wherever you get your podcasts from.The dog pod is brought to you by Pooch and Mutt, who are pack leaders when it comes to healthy pet food for the body and mind.

Famous faces who love their Frenchies include Lady Gaga - whose were stolen earlier this year - as well as Dwayne Johnson, Reece Witherspoon and Hugh Jackman, whilst the likes of Nicola Roberts, Paris Hilton and Kelly Osbourne have favoured pugs. But Blue Cross - who have been helping sick, injured, abandoned and homeless pets since  - say that the obsession with these animals has caused a welfare crisis, having treated over , brachy pets in the last two years.Common procedures that the charity perform on these animals include: Brachycephalic Obstructive Airway SyndromeSurgery – which they say is ‘a complicated and stressful surgery for any pet to have to undergo’, but vital to widen their nasal passages and shorten their soft palate to improve their ability to breathe. Enucleation and eyelid surgery – surgery to repair or remove their eyes and mody their eyelids due to high rates of disease. Emergency Caesarean section - because many cannot give birth to litters naturally and need medical intervention. Blue Cross explained that these health problems have stemmed from a vicious cycle of over-breeding to meet the demand for these flat-faced, four-legged friends, many of which now no longer even resemble their healthy ancestors that came just a century before them. A spokesperson for the charity added: “This has led to these breeds being seen as the latest ‘must have’ and an increase in impulse buying – often leading to pets being sold on or given up when their owners realise they cannot cope or afford vital vet bills for treatment associated with their breed. It has also led to a huge rise in the cost of puppies, particularly during the pandemic, which has sadly meant a huge rise in dog theft across the UK – with research showing that these breeds are often specically targeted.” The new End The Trend campaign asks brands to pledge to phase out the use of these pets in brand materials by the end of .  The mock advertisements have been placed in  high-profile train stations in London, including Charing Cross, London Bridge, St Pancras, Victoria and Waterloo.As part of the campaign, the charity has launched a petition which members of the public can sign to urge their favourite brands to commit to this pledge. The petition can be found here:www.bluecross.org.uk endthetrendBlue Cross vet, Caroline Reay, added: “Brachycephalic pets, like Frenchies and pugs, have soared in popularity in recent years. With their compelling big eyes and baby-like faces, our obsession with their appearance has created an animal welfare crisis. “As these breeds grow in popularity, there is a rise in parallel of unscrupulous breeders looking to cash in on a trend. Our veterinary hospital teams are treating more and more very unwell pets who are experiencing health complications caused by breeding for a characteristic ‘flat face’. “Frenchies, Pugs and Persians have become the poster pets for advertising, no matter the product, and behind those cute faces can lie horrying health problems.

Little Lukas was born at .pm at the same hospital where James was treated, and weighed lbs oz. James, from Pudsey, said: “All I was thinking about was surviving for my family, and for my son.  “I need to get through this for Lukas.

James added: “I closed my eyes and looked up to the sky and just said no way, I looked at my hands and they were bloodied and I knew someone had stabbed me.”  Following surgery, James had to learn how to walk again and has been told he will need to be on antibiotics for the rest of his le.

Footage taken by a motorist in the adjacent lane yesterday morning shows the HGV pushing a white Volkswagen VW down the busy stretch of motorway near Luton. The panicked motorist can be seen waving his arms, trying to get the Gregaposs Couriers lorry to realise another vehicle has tagged along for the ride. As he waves, the motorist can be heard yelling: F*****g stop! He points towards the front of the multi-ton vehicle and adds: Stop you f****** idiot. The HGV driver then realises whataposs happened and pulls over to the hard shoulder. Greg Krysztofowiciz, , Transport Manager for Gregaposs Couriers, told Mail Online he was shocked to see the video, but that it was not his [the driveraposs] fault.He added: The driver of the Volkswagen pulled in too close to the lorry when he tried to overtake him, my driver did not see him, and he swears to God he did not feel the car. The driver was listening to the radio at the time, and immediately pulled over when he saw fellow motorists waving their arms and raising the alarm. Mr Krysztofowiciz said the driver of the VW - who was unharmed - was aged  or . After the incident, police came to check whether the lorry driver was under the influence of drugs and alcohol, but he tested negative. As his truck wasnapost majorly damaged, he was allowed to continue on his journey, Mr Krysztofowiciz said. aposMy driver is of course not pleased with what happened and was shocked when he saw the video too, he told the Mail. aposBut he is experienced and has been working for me for eight years, he of course did not do it on purpose.apos Mr Krysztofowiciz warned motorists to be careful when overtaking lorries on the motorway. The size of the vehicle, and the driversapos high seat, mean road users can easily slip into a blind spots - including one directly in front. Bedfordshire Police confirmed they received a report of an incident around am on the M. They did not attend because Highways England were at the scene, they added.

Angela Artis, , was travelling back to Charlotte, in the US, with husband Darien and son Mason when they were forced off the plane at Heathrow where they were making a connection. Their holiday to Santorini, in Greece, where the couple were renewing their wedding vows, turned sour on thevia Heathrow. After being removed from the American Airlines flight  last Sunday, the airline provided overnight accommodation and rebooked the Artis family onto the following day’s flight. Mrs Artis claimed it was impossible to keep a mask on a two-year-old and that there was a baby near them that wasn’t forced to wear a face covering.  She said having got on board the plane initially everything was fine with the flight crew and her son was even given a lollipop. It turned sour, she claimed, when another flight attendant came over.She told the: “But about  minutes before the flight was due to take off another attendant came over and pointed a finger at my baby. She said aposhe needs to put a mask on or he’s got to go” in a very rude way.Mrs Artis said that her heart dropped as she had no idea it was a strict policy because she claimed that she had been able to travel before without him wearing a mask. Mrs Artis added that other flight crew in the past have accepted it is not feasible to keep the mask on a two-year-old “for more than five minutes”. She said: We had tried to put it on him for the first few minutes but he just couldn’t keep it on, it’s dficult for a baby to even physically breathe with a mask on. She said that the plane then taxied back to the terminal and the family was forced to get off the plan with an announcement that it was due to a child not wearing a mask. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Transportation Security Administration directives mean that American Airlines requires passengers aged two and older to wear face coverings at all times while indoors at airports and onboard. In a statement, the airline said: On Oct. , American Airlines flight  ed to the gate prior to departure from London Heathrow to deplane a party failing to comply with the face mask requirement. After agreeing to comply with the face mask requirement, all iniduals were rebooked for travel on the next flight to Charlotte the following day.

Leo Gomez-Franqueira family lives in Wimbledon with his parents, who say he was saying the word papa at three months old.He also grew his first tooth at the same age and at six months old was standing independently, MyLondon reports. When he was  months old he knew all the letters in the alphabet, and knew all the flags of the world before he was one. His mum says that Leo has a gt, and that they always knew he was special. Mum Teresa said: He was really only a aposbabyapos for four to five months.  After that, he was just so advanced. Itaposs like having three kids in one. He needs constant stimulation and is always wanting to be doing something. Teresa and Leoaposs father, Inaki San Pedro, both originally from Spain, decided to visit a psychologist when Leo was two. After an assessment, it was revealed that he had a higher IQ than Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawkins - placing him in the top two per cent of the population. As a result, he was invited to Mensa, the largest and oldest high IQ society in the world, and became the youngest member at two. He could communicate in  dferent languages by one, Teresa explained. He plays multiple instruments including the cello.  For a gted kid, itaposs important that you get them checked out, the sooner, the better. He could name all the flags in the world by one.

You constantly have to keep him engaged and entertained. My husband is in charge of Leoaposs activities and you need to keep him challenged and motivated. And it seems Leo is interested in a whole host of hobbies and wants to give everything a try. Along with learning languages, he loves Kung-Fu, playing football, golf and tennis, as well as playing on his iPad or Nintendo Wii with his dad.  Even though heaposs highly intelligent, heaposs really like a normal seven-year old at times, Teresa said. He likes his games heaposs still childish at times even though heaposs mentally very mature. He loves playing with his friends. Leo is still learning about the world and his interests, even though he is two to three years more advanced mentally for his age. Teresa knows he wants to do everything but the main thing for her is that he finds his passion and works hard. She said: The most important for us is that he is happy and finds what he loves.

Their daughter Posie-Aurora Sadler-Smith, one, recently took her first steps - on her new prosthetic limbs after having an amputation. The tot was diagnosed with fibular hemimelia upon birth. The disability - where part or all of the fibula is missing - usually only impacts one leg, but Posie was missing nearly all the bones from both her lower limbs. But Posie defied the odds and learnt to crawl, using all her upper body strength to toddle around, and even boost herself on the sofa for a cuddle with pooch Seuss.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Her parents faced the agonising decision on whether to amputate her limbs - in order to give her a chance at walking upright. And just after her first birthday, Posie had her left leg amputated at the ankle and was later fitted with prosthetic limbs - in her favourite shade of pink, naturally. She left her parents in floods of tears after taking her first tentative tiny steps, with her dadaposs support, later that day. Parents Jodie Weeder, , and partner Dominic Sadler-Smith, , admit they miss her perfect little toes but are in awe of their daughteraposs strength.  Jodie from Sudbury, Suffolk, said: When they strapped them on at the fitting it was like she suddenly wasnapost a baby anymore. She went suddenly from this little dinky girl to such a tall toddler. We never thought we would see her stand up. It was amazing. Prosthetics take a lot of getting used to, but It was amazing to see her stand up for the first time. She canapost stand on her own with them yet because the right one needs to be altered, so we have to hold her or she holds the furniture. Sheaposs incredible. Her upper body strength is amazing - sheaposs like a little Hulk. She fallsshe lets go, but she wonapost give up. She just gets up again. Sheaposll just try and try. Jodie, who has a cleaning business, and businessman Dominic, didnapost know whether their little girl would ever walk when they found she had a chromosomal condition at  weeks pregnant. We could have had a termination, but we werenapost giving up on her Jodie said. We just focussed on getting her here and thought: aposweaposll face whatever we faceapos. At birth, she was diagnosed with fibular hemimelia. She had no right knee or bones below it, and no left ankle with only one misshaped bone in that leg. Around one-in-fty-thousand little ones have the bone condition, but itaposs much rarer for both legs to be affected.She had to wear a brace to reposition her hips for three months. Determined Posie developed a speedy crawl at six months, and had her left foot amputated on July . Her right one remains but is shorter and missing toes. Emotional parents Jodie and Dominic watched as their only child stood for the first time when she got her first prosthetic legs on September . Her right knee is so unstable she canapost stand on her own yet, so doctors will help the family decide whether it would help Posie to amputate the right leg at her knee in October, to help her prosthetics fit better. Jodie said: Prosthetics take a lot of adjustment and getting used to: you donapost just pop them on for the first time and walk. As long as youaposve got the right support around you and people who love you are backing you you can do anything. There will always be hurdles out there in anyoneaposs le: youaposve just got to overcome them. Now the family will be walking  miles in two months, over weekends, with Posie in the pram, to raise money for the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, where she was helped.Click here to donate.Comment MORE ON HospitalsPregnancyMirror More Hopeful\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Also, wouldn’t it be freezing  I was intrigued enough to give it a go though, and took my first dip in August with one of my sons. ‘Plunging into the water, my first thought was – wow it’s cold! But actually, once you become acclimatised to the water temperature it feels wonderful. That first swim was really memorable, I came out of the water feeling revived and invigorated, and I knew I was a convert.’ Jenny persuaded three friends to form a wild swim gang with her and since August they have met weekly for a dip. ‘I don’t wear a wetsuit, it’s too much faff getting in and out of one, just a swimsuit and now I look forward to my swim all week. ‘Front crawling through open water, surrounded by the sounds and sights nature, it’s so amazing and it washes away the stresses of the week. It’s nothing like swimming in a pool, it’s both exciting and soothing, brilliant for body and mind. ‘It’s definitely going to get a bit nippier as we go into winter but I’m ready for the challenge!’ So in the spirit of taking the plunge and trying something new, e into a Zinger Popcorn Bucket soon - it is only around for a limited period, available until November .Download the app, head in store or order online.

Ladybridge Preschool, based in Bolton, posted on social media to say it was on the lookout for a new recruit who could transform themselves into a Disney princess and be able to sing out of tune in front of a crowd of tiny humans. Other requirements for the job, which involves looking after children aged two to five, includes having eyes in the back of your head and offering big, warm hugs whenever required. The viral advert reads: You must be comfortable about entering public places on your way home from work with unknown substances on your clothing.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. You must have the ability to read a story book upside down, with at least five interruptions per page.

It’s nothing short of a miracle and it’s all down to the incredible generosity of people in this country who never gave up on us.

South Kensington’s famous  Thurloe Square, aka The Thin House, became available for £, earlier this year. The architectural oddity, which is just ft at its narrowest point, is a two bedroom, two bathroom home set in historic former artist studios. Images from Rightmove show the flat is kitted out with a modern kitchen and filled with natural light. It has an open plan living area, which is .m long by .m wide, and a very long, but very thin, terrace.  While the staged photos of the flat make it look very liveable, there are a couple of potential reasons why no one has snapped up the basement flat in the  months itaposs been on the market.Likely the main reason is also the explanation for the house’s thinness, My London reports. Unlike other houses on the street, The Thin House is almost directly conjoined with the tube line that runs along the back of the property.  This could also go to explain why buyers might not be keen to pay nearly  grand for a flat that is disturbed by the noise and vibrations of a busy tube line. The house was built in such a way that it almost feels like an optical illusion, with its unusual wedge shape design making the whole house look rather bizarre. Rightmove describes the flat on its website as: “A beautul  bedroom,  bathroom home in fantastic decorative order in historic former artist studios.  “Located on one of the best Garden Squares in Kensington and Cha with direct access to a South facing Patio   Terrace as well as access to the beautul and dog-friendly Thurloe Square Gardens,” the description continues. The flat is situated in one of Londonaposs most affluent neighbourhoods, with good transport links to the rest of the city. With the London property market once again ramping up after a lockdown lull it will be interesting to see who,anyone, snaps up this architectural anomaly.

The letter is not out of character for the Duchess - who has always been political, Mr Jobson said. The Queen knew about her political views and ambition which could become embarrassing for The Firm, he added. Talking about the letter, Mr Jobson said: aposThis is what the Queen feared because now sheaposs free to say whatever she likes.  aposSheaposll now start talking about her political views and ambitions. aposAnd she might stir them up which then becomes embarrassing.apos While Mr Jobson thinks Meghan is sailing close to the wind, itaposs unlikely the letter will spark a backlash from the royals.  She’s sailing close to the wind, but will they say anything [the royals], no they won’t, Mr Jobson told The Mirror. The fact is they knew this was what she was going to be doing. She was always a political girl. Since the age of seven she was writing letters to Hilary Clinton.  The expert said as a US citizen, the Duchess is entitled to do what sheaposs doing. But husband Prince Harry is effectively barred from speaking on political matters because heaposs a Prince of the Realm. aposIf it was Prince Harry doing it I would say that’s a slightly dferent thing because he’s a Prince of the Realm, he said. And he is a British citizen and he’s kind of bound up by everything.When it was announced in February she and Prince Harry were to leave royal le a statement said the couple would continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty. Using paper headed ‘The Office of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex’ Meghan wrote: “Iaposm not an elected official, and Iaposm not a politician. “I’m writing to you at this deeply important time - as a mom - to advocate for paid leave.” The -year-old went on to discuss her upbringing painting a picture of an impoverished upbringing in Calornia. She added: “I grew up on the . salad bar at Sizzler,apos she said. aposI knew how hard my parents worked to afford this because even at five bucks, eating out was something special, and I felt lucky. “I started workingat the age of . I waited tables, babysat, and piecemealed jobs together to cover odds and ends.  I worked all my le and saved when and where I could—but even that was a luxury - because usually it was about making ends meet and having enough to pay my rent and put gas in my car. “I expect many of your constituents have their own version of that story, she continued, before attacking the US economic system. “Many of our economic systems are past their expiration date, and as you well know, too many Americans are forced to shortchange themselves when it comes to what matters to them, she added. Mum-of-two Meghan then acknowledged she does not now struggle the same way other parents who are not offered paid leave do.  She added: “In June, my husband and I welcomed our second child. Like any parents, we were overjoyed. Like many parents, we were overwhelmed. Like fewer parents, we werenapost confronted with the harsh reality of either spending those first few critical months with our baby or going back to work.” Closing her letter she recognised “how politically charged things can - and have - become,” but said the issue “isnapost about Right or Left, itaposs about right or wrong.” She told Pelosi and Schumer she “trust you will meet this moment” in helping pass legislation to give parents on the States paid leave after a baby. While the move created some backlash from the states, Mr Jobson stressed that Meghanaposs US citizenship gives her every right to lobby the officials she votes to elect.  However, the monarchy does not involve itself in Government issues believing it to be a clear breach of impartiality. Although still members of the Firm, in February it was revealed the couple would not be ing to royal duties. A statement by Buckingham Palace at the time read: “While they can no longer formally represent The Queen, the Sussexes have made clear that everything they do will continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty. The Sussexes will not use their HRH titles as they are no longer working members of the Royal Family. Whilst Harry and Meghan no longer use their royal titles, they were not officially stripped of them by the Queen. However, Prince Harry did lose three honorary military titles in a review of their exit agreement in February . Previously it has been rumoured, Meghan would like to enter politics with some claiming she even has ambitions to become US president.

Kylie Considine, from Midway, near Derbyshire, was out celebrating for a hen do of one of her mum’s friends when the night went awry. The -year-old had been on her way home after the night out in Burton last weekend, when she asked to stop at a cashpoint to pay the fare for her taxi. She crossed the road to get the money out, but when running back across the road to jump into the taxi and finish her journey home, she collided with another cab. The side of her body collided with the car and she spun up into the air before coming down hard on the windscreen.  Ms Considine, a former carer who is now a full-time mum, said she had “not been out for years as [she usually is] caring for the kids”.The last bar we went to was the Locomotive. I had one drink there and we left there at about pm,” she told Staffordshire Live. “Me and my sister Teigan rang for a taxi at around .pm. I remember getting into the taxi just after that and thataposs it.” Ms Considine said she came to around an hour after the brutal collision to find herself lying on the road with the police and ambulance team looking over her. Luckily there were no broken bones, but I was covered in scrapes and bruises,” she said. “One of my thumbnails had come off, as well as my toenails. The side of my body was covered in cuts. I turned my head and saw the taxi. The side of my body had hit the car and Iaposd spun up into the air, coming down on the windscreen.” She spent a night in the hospital at Nottingham and was discharged early the next day. Ms Considine doesn’t think what happened to her has sunk in yet, claiming the “whole thing doesn’t feel real”. “I was absolutely in agony through the whole weekend. I usually donapost like to just sit around, but I havenapost left the house this week. I couldnapost lt my arms properly at the weekend. My eldest son is still in shock and my daughter ran out and cried aposmummyaposs poorlyapos and mummyaposs hurtapos. I was just heartbroken. Iaposve lost a few minutes of my le as my mind is completely blank. Everything I know about what happened has been told to me. The doctor said that was because of the concussion.” The mum said the experience was “upsetting”, leaving her feeling vulnerable and unsafe. While she was now able to get herself out of bed, she said she wasn’t able to do much . A spokesperson from Derbyshire Constabulary said: We were called just after .pm on Friday October  to reports of a collision involving a car and a pedestrian on High Street at Newhall. The pedestrian, a woman aged in her s, was taken to hospital by ambulance for her injuries to be checked. It is not thought they were serious,” the spokesperson said.

Advanced clinical practitioner and single mum Clare Bryson from Perth, UK, wanted to transform a dated bathroom in a flat she owned to increase its value. But by sticking to a tight budget and doing the work herself, the -year-lod was able to spend just £. To complete the remarkable transformation, Clare shopped around for deals on paint and even used spray paint for the first time to decorate the  around the bath. Clare managed to complete the transformation in just three days while working in AE and also looking after her children. She was able to spend an hour or two at a time working on the renovation, and eventually finished around three days after beginning.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. After posting the video of her transformation to TikTok, Clare received over , views in one day, with thousands of people praising her renovation skills. I left home at sixteen and moved into a flat and started trying to do it up. I gave things a go I was wallpapering and painting kitchen cupboards back then, said Clare. Iaposm quite arty and Iaposve always had an interest in trying to make things look nice and doing it on a budget most of the time. I didnapost want to change the bathroom suite, because it was in perfectly good condition, but it looked dated, and I wanted to make it look nicer. I painted all the wooden items with black paint that I had leftover and just bought some more in a spray can. It was an experiment I spray painted the bath , the pedestal, and a little bit of the toilet. It looks much better now compared to before. Itaposs not everybodyaposs taste, but itaposs certainly prettier and more interesting now. Clare hopes to inspire other women to pick up the tools and give DIY a shot, sharing her videos on her YouTube channel, Blondy Builder, to give handy tips, tricks and tutorials, and says, whataposs the worst that can happen   A lot of the things on my page, Iaposve picked up from people who were giving it away for free, said Clare. I love to give things a second le by upcycling them. Last year, when I was doing up houses, I made a radiator cover from the wood from a door frame that was going to go in the bin itaposs about being clever with what you have. You also need to shop around for a good deal look for the best places to buy your paint and materials.  The most important things are planning and being creative. I think a lot of it is confidence as well. A lot of the stuff I do is to try and encourage people to give things a go. Iaposm a single female, and I think a lot of women donapost feel confident enough to do a bit of DIY. And Clare isnapost stopping here, as she revealed sheaposs currently renovating another flat.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Recent data suggests that it is on the rise in areas of England, with a new map showing where the Delta Plus iant could cause havoc this winter. The sub-iant has accounted for about six per cent of all sequences generated, the Health Security Agency said last week, meaning it is far from the dominant strain presently.  Adur, in West Sussex, has the highest proportion of Delta Plus cases where  per cent of new cases are down to the new iant. In East Lindsey, Lincolnshire, .% of their positive Covid tests are down to this new iant according to the Sanger Institute. Another hotspot where Delta Plus makes up a signicant amount of cases is in Torridge, North Devon where % of cases are accounted for by the new iant. Exeter, Swindon, Gravesham, Aylesbury Vale, Worthing, and the Isle of Wight are other areas where Delta Plus is increasingly prevalent, making up more than a third of cases in all of them.  Much of the east and north of England have the lowest rates of Delta Plus, with Norfolk and Northumberland registering very few Delta Plus cases. Dorset and Wiltshire are among the areas with the highest growth of the Delta Plus iant, with both recording over  genomes a week - how new iants are measured. Cheshire East, areas of the West Midlands around Birmingham and Coventry, and Aylesbury Vale all had similarly high rates of genomes per week. Oxford Vaccine Group chief Andrew Pollard said on Wednesday: Discovery of new iants is of course important to monitor, but it doesnapost indicate that that new iant is going to be the next one to replace Delta, Pollard told BBC radio. Indeed evenit does, Delta is incredibly good at transmitting in a vaccinated population and a new one may be a bit better but itaposs unlikely to change the picture dramatically from where we are today.  This comes as last night health secretary Sajid Javid resisted calls for a ‘Plan B’ even as cases continue to rise across the UK and  people died of the virus yesterday. Speaking in a press conference about a possible Plan B, he said: On this particular question we don’t believe the pressures currently faced by the NHS are unsustainable. Donapost get me wrong, there are huge pressures, especially in AE, in primary care for example as well. But at this point we donapost believe they are unsustainable. Javid warned that restrictions would “of course” Brits did not wear masks or get their booster jabs when able to.

The comet only passes earth every  or  years, but luckily itaposs possible to see the debris in the form of shooting stars every October.Luckily, the  Orionid meteor shower will be visible across the whole globe – including the UK. According to the Royal Museums Greenwich , the Orionids is one of the best known and most reliable meteor showers in the annual calendar. Andy McCrea, from the Irish Astronomical Association, also says that this particular meteor shower is extra special due to the sheer speed and brightness of the shooting stars.  Here is everything you need to know about spotting them tonight in the UK. What is the Orionid meteor shower  The Orionid meteor shower occurs every year sometime between October  to November . At its peak, up to  meteors are visible every hour. The Orionids receives it name because the meteors seem to emerge, or radiate, from the same are as the constellation. According to RMG, some people also view this particular meteor shower as extra special because the meteors are pieces of the famous Comet P Halley, or Halleyaposs Comet.  This famous comet only swings by earth every  to  years, which means those who may never see the one-in-a-letime event will get some compensation. What time will the Orionids peak in the UK  The Orionids are usually active between October  and November , but this year the peak falls tonight, on October .Luckily, the meteor shower can be seen across both the northern and southern hempishere, so it will be clearly visible from the UK – weather permitting.  In the UK it will peak between midnight tonightand dawn , which falls at .am BST. How to best spot meteors Luckily, you can spot meteors with the naked eye, so yo donapost need any special equipment. According to RMG, youaposll want to find a safe location away from street lights and other sources of light pollution. It continues: The meteors can be seen in all parts of the sky, so it’s good to be in a wide open space where you can scan the night sky with your eyes. Butyou trace the paths that the meteors take, they seem to originate from the constellation of Orion. Itaposs also a good idea to give your eyes a chance to adjust to the dark. Space recommends heading out  minutes earlier than planned to give your eyes a chance to adapt.

James Naughtie, , was spotted by Gordon Duncan downing a “large Chardonnay” at Bennet’s bar, in the Edinburgh suburb of Morningside in Scotland, before leaving to drive home. Gordon, who was previously a regular at the bar, was shocked when he noticed the presenter getting into his car, and reported the series of events to police. Gordon hasn’t felt comfortable going back to the pub he spent  years as a regular since the incident, he said.Speaking to Edinburgh Live, Gordon spoke of how he witnessed Naughtie “gulp down” the big glass of wine while chatting away to someone in the bar.“On this I decided to go outside and pretend I was on a call in the Bennets garden,” he said.  “The guy came out  minutes later and got into his new car and drove off. I took a picture of his car and noted the number plate too. “I then called police immediately.” Gordon explained that he doesn’t believe in drink drivers”. “Itaposs disgusting in this day and age where we have one of the best public services. People who drink drive should be sent to prison,” he said. “I was never afraid to report him, I hate drink drivers I would report him again or someone doing same thing.  Naughtie, , was spotted getting into his car after he had stopped off for a glass of wine at Bennets Bar in Morningside, Edinburgh.

Prosecutor Ross Price said: “Around pm in the afternoon the accused left Bennet’s Bar and a member of staff saw him getting into his vehicle and called police. “Officers made enquiries and attended at the accused’s home address at .pm and breathalysed him. “He confirmed he was the driver [of the vehicle] that afternoon.” Solicitor Sean Flanagan, defending, said his client had been driving to his Edinburgh home and decided to stop off at the public house “for one glass of wine”. The lawyer added Naughtie, whose address was given as Blackthorn Avenue, London, had only driven “a relatively short distance” from the bar to his home and had cooperated fully with police. Sherf Peter McCormack fined the motorist a total of £ and banned him from driving for  months. The sherf said Naughtie would be allowed to take part in a drink drive rehabilitation schemehe chooses which,passed successfully, would see his road ban reduced by three months.

Though she is also believed to be in aposgood spiritsapos. She was due to visit Hillsborough in County Down and attend a church service in Armagh commemorating the centenary of the formation of the country, but this was called off merely hours before.A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace said: The Queen has reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days.Her Majesty is in good spirits and is disappointed that she will no longer be able to visit Northern Ireland. The Queen sends her warmest good wishes to the people of Northern Ireland, and looks forward to visiting in the future. Ulster unionist leader Doug Beattie said: [The Queen has been] a source of great comfort during Northern Irelandaposs darkest days and provided lasting leadership as we moved into a new era for all our people Is the Queen ill At the grand old age of , the Queen is easily more susceptible to colds and viruses, but still recently declined a magazineaposs aposOldie of the Yearapos award.The Queenaposs private secretary, Sir Edward Young, said in a letter of rejection: Her Majesty believes you are as old as you feel, as such The Queen does not believe she meets the relevant criteria to be able to accept, and hopes you will find a more worthy recipient.There is not believed to be serious concern over her health and the decision not to travel to Northern Ireland is not related to coronavirus and was a precautionary measure. She has received both jabs and the booster and remains set to celebrate her platinum jubilee,  years on the throne, next year. The precaution may well have been put in place as the the Queen has already had a fairly extensive schedule over the last month.The Queen was at Ascot on  October, she then welcomed Microsoft founder Bill Gates and US presidential envoy John Kerry during a reception at Windsor Castle on  October.She used a walking stick in public for the first time recently, but she is nearing he late aposs.

It was presented to Edward VII in  and part of it was used to create the stunning .-carat heart-shaped diamond at the centre of a platinum brooch for Queen Mary. The Queen inherited the brooch in  - wearing it on numerous occasions. It got an outing in  during Her Majestyaposs annual Christmas speech and she also wore it to Princess Eugenieaposs wedding.

Click here to sign up .However, most memorably she wore it in a beautul photo of herself and Prince Philip outside at Windsor Castle for his th birthday in .The Queenaposs appearance alongside Prince Charles and Prince William at the reception for business leaders on Tuesday came a day before she cancelled a visit to Northern Ireland yesterday.  The -year-old monarch was feeling “a little tired” on Tuesday evening before royal doctors were called to her living quarters at Windsor Castle, it is understood. Upon waking on Wednesday morning, ahead of a planned departure from her Berkshire home at midday to travel to Belfast, the steely Queen was said to be “showing slight signs of a seasonal cold”. Her Majesty, who has had a jam-packed schedule of engagements since ing from her summer break at Balmoral, took a Covid test which confirmed she was not suffering from coronavirus.But palace medics advised her to take a period of “immediate rest” for the next few days. The nation’s longest-reigning monarch is resting at Windsor Castle but will still receive her ministerial red boxes which she will attend to. She is still expected at this stage to host a reception in Glasgow on November  for the Cop climate change conference.

However, the Act doesn’t apply to animals used for “scientic or educational purposes”. Animals are currently used to test things like the development of medicine and vaccines, studying how animal and human bodies work, and to test chemicals for their possible impact on human health or the environment. According to the RSPCA, it’s estimated that over  million animals are used for testing across the world every year.  The petition page reads: “A recent exposé showed harrowing footage of the factory farming of laboratory dogs in the UK. Experiments on such dogs, and other animals, are today widely reported to be entirely failing the search for human treatments and cures. “Current science from multiple fields proves that animal-based research and testing is not viable. The Government should therefore change the law to include laboratory animals under the protection of the Animal Welfare Act, to prevent their unnecessary suffering.” The campaign was set up by Ricky Gervais and actor Peter Egan, along with ‘Beagle Ambassador” Scarlett, a dog who was rescued from a lab after being tested on for two years. Beagles are a breed commonly chosen for animal testing due to their docile nature. The petition was launched after footage was released showing the treatment of dogs at an animal testing laboratory. In the video, the dogs can be heard whimpering as they are loaded onto a lorry in small cages. The footage then goes on to show a dog being fed an unknown substance through a tube, and bins labelled ‘dogs’ being wheeled out of the laboratory.  “It’s heartbreaking to hear these puppies crying out for mercy and help,” comedian Ricky said of the footage. “We need an immediate ban on this shocking animal cruelty.” The Government previously responded to the petition in August this year, saying: “The use of animals in scientic research remains a vital tool in improving our understanding of how biological systems work both in health and disease.” They also argued that the AnimalsAct , which means that anyone who wants to use animals for testing purposes must be licensed and get authorisation from the Home Office, is enough to protect affected animals.But campaigners are calling on the Government to carry out apublic scientic hearingto ban experiments on animals. Anopen letterby For Le On Earth, a campaign fighting against animal testing, which calls for the hearing to take place was signed by several famous supporters including Chris Packham, Paul O’Grady, and Dr Jane Goodall. So far, over  MPs have supported the motion.

Stuart Keeble, Suffolk County Councilaposs director of public health, told BBC Radio aposs Today programme that the virus is really working its way through that younger population at the moment. For me now it is also about trying to keep children in school. We have had around , pupils test positive in the last  days. If we can keep transmission rates down, we can also keep more pupils in school as well while the vaccine is being run out for  to -year-olds. He added that there was the risk the virus could spread through school children to the older population, their parents and grandparents.  Mr Keeble added: We have started to see that. We have started to see an increase over the last few weeks in that parent age group of those in secondary school. He also said they are now also increase in cases in over-s and this is a concern given, there are more vulnerable people in those age groups. This comes amidst growing concerns as cases and hospitalisations continue to rise in the UK as the country heads towards winter. Covid hospitalisations are up in every region of England and Wales, with the South East seeing the most dramatic increase of a % rise in hospitalisations in one week.  With , new covid cases yesterday, October , there has been growing calls for a ‘Plan B’ to deal with the issue.However, in a press conference yesterday health secretary Sajid Javid pushed back against the need for a ‘Plan B’ saying it was not time for it yet.He said that the NHS was not yet under “unsustainable” pressure and called on Brits to show their “Blitz spirit” and get their Covid booster jab.. Despite the NHS Confederation calling for a new approach, Javid said: I’ve got a lot of time for the NHS Confederation… they do a lot of good work.  On this particular question we don’t believe the pressures currently faced by the NHS are unsustainable. Donapost get me wrong, there are huge pressures, especially in AE, in primary care for example as well. But at this point we donapost believe they are unsustainable. He did call upon people to continue to wear face masks in enclosed spaces, but stopped short of making it mandatory. Javid warned that restrictions would “of course” Brits did not wear masks or get their booster jabs when able to.

Meghan addressed the letter to Senate Leader Chuck Schumer and Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, acknowledging she is not an elected official or politician, but wanted to speak as a mom on the issue.She also wrote about the sacrices working parents have to make not just in pursuit of the American Dream, but simply the dream of stability. Here we look at some of the things weaposve learnt about Meghan from her emotional letter...  In a bid to highlight her point about why paid leave is important for parents, Meghan drew on her own experiences as a child. And she recalled how going to eat out would be a special occasion as she could only do it thanks to her parentsapos hard work. She wrote: I grew up on the .salad bar at Sizzler - it may have cost less back then- but what I do remember was the feeling: I knew how hard my parents worked to afford this because even at five bucks, eating out was something special, and I felt lucky. And as a Girl Scout, when my troop would go for dinner for a big celebration, it was back to that same salad bar or The Old Spaghetti Factory - because thataposs what those families could afford to do too. She had to work from aged  to make ends meet Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .Meghan also revealed her experiences of holding down a series of jobs since the age of  in order to make ends meet. She wrote in the letter: I started workingat the age of . I waited tables, babysat and piecemealed jobs together to cover odds and ends. I worked all my le and saved where I could - but even that was a luxury - because it was usually about making ends meet and having enough to pay my rent or put gas in my car. She and Prince Harry were aposoverwhelmedapos after Lilibetaposs birthMeghan and husband Prince Harry are parents to two children - two-year-old Archie and four-month-old Lilibet.And according to Meghan both she and Harry were overwhelmed following Lilibetaposs arrival. She said in the letter: In June, my husband and I welcomed our second child. Like any parents, we were overjoyed. Like many parents, we were overwhelmed. Meghan didnapost have to worry about going back to work after Lilibet arrived Meghan points out that she and Harry were among the lucky minority that they werenapost faced with having toto work soon after Lilibetaposs birth. She revealed: Like fewer parents, we werenapost confronted with the harsh reality of either spending those first few critical months with our baby or going back to work. We knew we could take her home, and in that vitalstage, devote any and everything to our kids and to our family. We knew that by doing so we wouldnapost have to make impossible choices about childcare, work and medical care that so many have to make every single day. No family should be faced with these decisions. No family should have to chose between earning a living and having the freedom to take care of their child . Meghan believes paid leave should be a right  In a direct plea, Meghan calls for paid leave to be a national right for every American. She argues: Paid leave should be a national right, rather than a patchwork option limited to those whose employers have policies in place, or those who live in one of the few states where a leave program exists. If weaposre going to create a new era of family-first policies, letaposs make sure that includes a strong paid leave program for every American thataposs guaranteed, accessible, and encouraged without stigma or penalty. Meghan understands how isive politics has become In her letter, Meghan talks about the current political landscape and says she thanks politicians for considering her letter on behalf of her family Archie, Lili and Harry. She revealed: I know how politically charged things can – and have – become. But this isnapost about right or left, itaposs about right or wrong. This is about putting families above politics. And for a refreshing change, itaposs something we all seem to agree on. At a point when everything feels so isive, let this be a shared goal that unites us. So, on behalf of my family, Archie and Lili and Harry, I thank you for considering this letter, and on behalf of all families, I ask you to ensure this consequential moment is not lost.

A man has been arrestedEllie SImpson, whose sister was targeted in a Nottingham nightclubByCallum Parke:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct A man has been arrested days after a young woman was allegedly injected with a needle in a nightclub. The victim was rushed to AE and spent the night in hospital after the terrying incident, which allegedly happened last Tuesday in Nottingham. Ellie Simpson, the womanaposs sister, said her sibling was with friends in Stealth nightclub when she felt a pinching or scratching sensation on the back of her arm. She began to feel ill, and was taken to AE, where she spent the night on a drip.Ellie told Derbyshire Live that her sister, who studies in Nottingham but is from Derby, has been left seriously shaken by the experience. She said: Sheaposs OK now, but sheaposs still really shaken up and afraid to go out. She went out for a night out and had only had a couple of drinks, so had drank less than she would normally. They were trying to leave the club and on the way out she felt something on the back of her arm, a pinching or scratching sensation, and she canapost remember anything after that. The police took urine samples so I donapost knowthey will be able to find anything. I felt sick, because you see these things happen to other people. You never expect to have it happen to anybody that you know. And then I obviously felt angry, and you just question why, why does somebody want to do that  What were their intentions  Iaposm just thankful she was with a friend becauseshe wasnapost, what would have happened  Spiking is the act of adding alcohol or a drug to food or drink without the knowledge of the person who consumes it. Reports of spikings have been re across the country in recent weeks, with particular concern about the use of needles given the risk of infection with HIV.It is recommended by the NHS that anyone concerned about contracting HIV should use soap to clean the wound, and buy anti-HIV medication within  hours of the incident.Signs that a drink may have been tampered with include a foggy appearance, excessive bubbles, sinking ice or a change in colour. If someone has been spiked, it is recommended to tell a member of staff and to ensure someone stays with the victim, calling an ambulancetheir condition deteriorates. It is important to ensure they do not travel on their own, or drink more alcohol. But Ellie, who has herself been spiked while studying in Loughborough, says women can only do so much to protect themselves and that more should be done to create a safe environment for everyone. She said: Ever since that [Ellie being spiked], my sister has been a lot more conscious in terms of putting your hands over your drink. But when itaposs a needle, how do you stop that  You canapost. Unless you go out in a suit of armour, which weaposre not going to do. Evenyou do search people, itaposs like looking for a needle in a haystack. I personally I donapost know how youaposd go about stopping it, as metal detectors may not pick needles up as theyaposre so small. As women, we shouldnapost have to go out on a night out, thinking have I got my bag, have I got my keys, then thinking, am I safe to go out, am I going to get spiked tonight  It shouldnapost be like that. Boycotts of nightclubs across the country have been organised over the next fortnight in protest. Using the name aposGirls Nights Inapos, events are happening in Derby and Nottingham on Wednesday, October , to coincide with Wednesday nights often being busy student nights, with similar happening across the country into early November. But Ellie has said that anyone, including men, are welcome and encouraged to become part of the campaign for greater awareness and protection in clubs. To other men it must seem like we are blaming them, even though we know it is not all men. I suppose in a club environment, the only sort of way I would feel safe isyou could see a manaposs hands and know where they are, but how you do that  And you shouldnapost have to do that. But weaposre keen to say itaposs not all men. Nottinghamshire police have said that a -year-old man has been arrested after receiving reports of a number of incidents in recent days. He has since been released on bail. He was arrested on suspicion of possession of class A and class B drugs and cause to administer poison or noxious thing with intent to injure, aggrieve and annoy following an incident in Lower Parliament Street on October , four days after Ellieaposs sister was spiked.A petition for greater security checks for nightclubs has also reached over , signatures, surpassing the threshold needed for the matter to be debated in Parliament.

Katie Brady, , says the last thing she remembered of the night was placing her drink on the podium before she danced at the nightclub in Newcastle. After that she recalls nothing of her night.Katie, from Birtley, Gateshead, told Chronicle Live : I was told afterward that I had gone to the toilets and the door staff had to carry me out and give me water.[They said that] my eyes had rolled back into my head and that later on, I had just walked away from the bar. Luckily, I was using ABC Taxis and I managed to ring a taxi and it was a driver I knew who came.  He helped me into the taxi and to my front door where he knocked to make sure my mam would wake up. Katie was  at the time and said when she ed to her home in Bensham, her mum thought she was just drunk. I had no memory at all of that night, she said. My mam took a photo and told me that she heard me being sick and then heard a bang and said I had fallen backward in the bathroom. Bar staff later confirmed sheaposd only had one drink, leaving no other explanation in her mind other than a spiking. But she had no evidence so decided not to report it to the police. She believes this was the first time she was spiked, with the second happening several years later at a dferent Newcastle venue. Her drink was tampered with while chatting with friends at the bar, she said. Katie, who was then aged , said: My friend had served me the drink as she worked in the bar and we were stood by the bar which wasnapost very busy. I had my drink on the bar and no one was beside me and thataposs the last thing I remember. When I spoke to a friend afterwards, they said that one of the staff had said to her aposyou need to go and see [Katie] she is in a bad way.apos My friend took me to the bus stop and I managed to get the bus home. My partner said that when I got home I was throwing up black vomit and I passed out on the sofa. The bar checked for CCTV evidence but the way she was standing meant they could not see whether someone was looming behind her. Mum-of-one Katie says she was left shaken after the two incidents - and is now less confident about going out on the town. I have been really lucky... it could have been completely dferent, she said. It did scare me and I didnapost go out for a long time afterward. It is scary to think what could have happened. In an effort to look out for drinkers, three city centre venues have increased security and CCTV cameras as well creating safe spaces for vulnerable people to seek help. The Market Shaker, The Dog and Parrott and Pumphreys Newcastle are the venues taking action, with measures including offering lids for drinks and kits to test whether beverages have been spiked. Katie said she feels reassured by such measures and felt aposrelievedapos that action was being taken. I am so happy they are doing something like this, she said.

Anna Stephen had had four drinks before reaching a club in Edinburgh with a group of boys from the year above, who were known as the freshersapos dads as part of the uniaposs buddy system. Having been drinking for several years, the now -year-old knew her limits and was fully in control all night until she got out of the taxi by the venue. Thinking sheaposd had too much to drink, the bouncer blocked Anna from going inside and told her to go and drink some water. After staggering to Tesco to get some water and slumping on the floor, the student managed to stagger home to her friendaposs house. There she lay on the floor for hours, unable to talk and vomiting relentlessly.  While Anna was physically unharmed by whoever drugged her, the experience has shaken her deeply. Sheaposs unsure who specically spiked her, leading her to completely remove herself from the friendship group. The worst things about this whole experience was that I was unable to speak for most of it and didn’t feel in control of my body at all, but I remember everything so clearly, she told The Mirror. I’ve been spiked since, a couple of years ago in Ibiza, and the experience was the same. It makes me sick because it’s so frightening and would be sosomeone was attacked in this state too. Youaposd be unable to do anything to try and stop it. Anna is one of the many people who are bravely coming forward to share their experience of being spiked, following alarming reports that nightle predators are using needles to inject drugs into victims. Tammy Kendall is another woman whose been targeted in Edinburgh clubs - not just once, but three times, in three dferent venues.  On one occasion she was out with her dad when she suddenly started feeling really unwell. The -year-old blacked out and has no memory of the night. When she awoke the next day, friends told her sheaposd been so sick and delirious, she kept saying she wanted to kill herself. On another occasion she was kicked out of a club by a bouncer who thought she was too drunk, leaving Tammy to pass out on the street outside.  During the third she was relentlessly sick. It was the worst things I have ever experienced, she recalled. I couldn’t remember where I was, the date or who I was with. I couldn’t remember how I got home, I was being violently sick and I was spewing blood.Tammy and Anna are just two of dozens of people who have shared their experiences of being spiked in Edinburgh on a single Instagram post.The alarmingof the thread, and the distressing details of many of the comments, hints at how large a problem spiking is in the UK.  Figures obtained by the BBC show that there were , reported incidents in England and Wales since . Many incidents of drink spiking go unreported because people are unaware they’ve fallen victim to it, meaning the true number is likely much higher. What to do about such a common place yet upsetting issue is dficult. In the past week calls to increase security at bars and clubs have gained traction, yet some argue searches are easy to evade and may further discriminate against the already marginalised. Calls for women to take additional preventative measures have been knocked back by those who argue it should not be the victimaposs responsibility to foil perpetrators. Anna believes that the onus to protect victims lies in numerous places. I know it’s a big ask, but the clubs and pubs also have a responsibility towards the public as per licensing to make sure they are safe, she said. I also think we as the public can do more to help. Like the amount of people who just walk past people who’re struggling or those who are too embarrassed to askthey need help. We need to start being more forward thinking as a society and not be scared to ask someonethey are okay.

Stumbling, tongue-tied Maggie Throupcould barely read out her prepared statement. Embarrassing. It doesn’t matter, because it said nothing new. The Government is paralysed in the face of mounting Covid dangers. Ms Throup droned out the official line: Stick to Plan A. No Plan B, no ­mandatory face coverings on public transport or in schools, no vaccine ­passports for crowded events, noto social distancing, no push for homeworking. Nothing, except for some gratuitous advice to behave sensibly and wait until the end of the year for a “miracle pill” that could halve Covid deaths. But the crisis is now. The Government admits infection rates are soaring towards , a day. A new, more contagious iant of Delta is circulating, hospital admissions are rising and the death toll has surged to , a week. The booster campaign is sluggish, and vaccination of  to -year-olds patchy at best. In my village of Sutton and Crosshills the infection rate has doubled to . per ,. Covid is raging through North Yorkshire schools, and our academy has , pupils. I no longer shop at my Co-op during school breaks, because they congregate in groups without masks. Admissions to our local hospital are up %, and one patient has died. The outlook is bad, but Boris Johnson, in hock to his hardline Covid Recovery Group of free-market backbench MPs, resolutely buries his head in the sand. It is not a pretty sight, especially when he talks through his backside. He claims Covid is “under control”. Hardly. He should “take back control”. He’s completely out of touch with public opinion.

Saudi Arabia, the worldaposs biggest oil exporter, requested that the UN scientists delete their conclusion that the focus of decarbonisation efforts in the energy systems sector needs to be on rapidly shting to zero-carbon sources and actively phasing out fossil fuels. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Japan, which is hugely reliant on fossil fuels in its energy and transport systems, rejects a key finding in the report’s summary for policymakers detailing how coal and gas-fired power stations will, on average, need to be shut down within  and  years respectively to keep warming below .°C and  and  years to keep warming below °C. A director in Japan’s ministry of foreign affairs claims this paragraph is misleading and suggests deleting it “because the required retirements of fossil fuel power plants due to carbon budget depend on the emissions from other sectors as well as their capacity factor and the opportunities of CCS.” A senior scientist from Indiaaposs Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research, which has strong links to the Indian government, warns coal is likely to remain the mainstay of energy production for decades because of what they describe as the tremendous challenges of providing affordable electricity. India is already the worldaposs second-biggest consumer of coal. The documents obtained by Greenpeace contain , submissions by governments, companies and other interested parties to the IPCC, the UN body compiling scientic evidence on how to tackle climate change.  Greenpeace International chief Jenner Morgan said: “This is an insight into how a small group of coal, oil and meat producing countries continue to put the profits of a few polluting industries before science and our planet’s future. The key test for world leaders is whether or not they agree to rapidly phase out fossil fuels, as the science warrants. History will not be kind to themthey fail.” The IPCC said comments from governments are central to its scientic review process but that its authors have no obligation to incorporate them into the reports. It added: “Our processes are designed to guard against lobbying – from all quarters.” It came after the Environment Agency issued over  flood warnings following heavy rain on Wednesday night and early yesterday as Storm Aurore moved in from France.

The “super pod”, comprising an estimated  dolphins, can be seen stretching off into the distance, leaping out of the water as they race a whale-watching boat. The amazing scene was captured by the crew of the Catallac, the vessel travelling alongside the dolphins, while it toured the coast off Newport Beach, Calornia, USA. Super pods, which can number more than , dolphins, form where food is plentul, but usually gather in deep water and are far rarer in shallower seas. Jessica Roame, education manager at Newport Landing Whale Watching, which operates the Catallac, said the dolphins may also have been fleeing an unseen predator. “Porpoising out of the water at a high rate of speed is the fastest mode of travel for dolphins because there is less resistance in the air than in water,” she said.  “That’s why these dolphins move in this way when theyaposre in a hurry, and when hundreds of dolphins do this together, we call this a stampede.” Jessica said it was not known exactly what causes dolphins to stampede, but it was thought they could have been evading a predator or catching up to a food source. Jessica estimated that there were some  inidual dolphins stampeding in the video. A typical pod contains anything from two to . “Every time you see a dolphin on the surface, there are normally three or four dolphins underneath the surface,” she said. “They could be related family members in their pod, or multiple pods of common dolphins coming together, and likely this is because of food.”  Patrick Webster of Monterey Bay Aquarium, approximately  miles to the north, said a super pod sighting was one of the ocean’s “magical moments”. “It is fairly rare to see them this close to shore and so readily observable by people,” he said, following a sighting in . Itaposs a very special sighting nearshore of one of the oceanaposs magical moments often hidden away from human observation. “But to the dolphins, it was probably just another Monday.” Newport Landing Whale Watching runs daily whale and wildle watching tours of the Southern Calornia coast all year round.

Many have been using TV as inspiration, with the rise of names like ‘Maeve’ and ‘Otis’ from hit Netflix show Sex Education.Margot, after Margot Robbie’s appearance in The Wolf of Wall Street also saw a rise in popularity, as well as ‘Kylo’ from Star Wars’ Kylo Ren. Blogger Nick Winter found a more unconventional inspiration for his childaposs name - he used a mathematical algorithm.Yes, you can actually use mathematics to determine something like a baby name - who knew  It took a little bit of work though, and this method definitely isn’t for those with little patience. So, how did blogger Nick do it  Firstly, he downloaded the entire Social Security name database onto his computer, which had , names on it that have been used more than five times since . He then wrote his very own web app which ranked all the names according to  algorithmic ranking criteria.Maths-Whizz is a super clever virtual maths tutor which delivers interactive games, lessons and exercises for five to  year olds.To see how good it is at transforming home learning for parents, weaposve negotiated an exclusive % off price to make it £. for the first month.Seeyou like it first and sign up to a -day no-obligation free trial by you can do that here.

The  dferent ranking criterias were as follows:aposSpellabilityapos - penalises names which sound similar to other common names, since people will not know how to spell them. Pronounceability - penalises names which we think could be pronounced two dferent ways, or which have Rs in them.

The one-bed property, located in the heart of Edinburghaposs Grassmarket area, was previously used as a short-term holiday let for the millions of visitors who flock to Victoria Street every year – which is said to have inspired J.K. Rowling’s Diagon Alley. Located just minutes from Edinburgh’s top attractions, the flat is prime Potter real estate, neighbouring several of the cafés where the author wrote early chapters of the book franchise. Owners will also have Edinburgh Castle on their doorstep, which is claimed to have served as inspiration for Hogwarts. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. The flat’s front door opens into a hallway that contains secret storage space disguised by a long mirror . The impressive sized living space and modern kitchen-diner boast plenty of natural light and some wallpaper that fans of the franchise will recognise is similar to that of the magical photos which hang in the halls of Hogwarts.  A woodland-themed bedroom, hidden behind a fantastically concealed bookcase door, helps give the feel of being in The Forbidden Forest – though thankfully thereaposs no giant spider named Aragog in sight. A compact bathroom, with a double shower and a rustic copper coin floor, gives the newly-refurbished apartment an eclectic homely feel that any Weasley would be proud of. Other features of the pad include a wizarding chest, references to Gringottaposs Bank, antique books and a Diagon Alley sign.  Despite its bustling location, the propertyaposs newly installed slimline sash and case double glazed windows with handmade shutters are sure to keep the noisy moaning myrtles or dementor-like drafts at bay. While the flat was previously available to rent on Airbnb and was a hit with fans, it is now available to buy.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

After I get out of the shower Iaposm looking for ear swabs and Iaposm ready to put my toothbrush in the draw and I opened it and I see the pink toothbrush. I didnapost think much of it but something told me to snoop through the rest of his stuff so I open the bottom and I see all of those girl products. Prior to that visit I had seen he had Cantu shampoo but I didnapost think much of it because of his hair texture, [I thought] thataposs probably what he likes. She continued: But it threw me off when I saw the lotion. I was like I know heaposs not wearing no girl lotion. When she confronted him about what she found, he tried to convince her that it belonged to his friend and that she brought it over one time when she needed to take a shower. As she begins packing her stuff, he tells her not to be stupid because sheaposs just driven nine hours, and insists heaposll sleep on the sofa. But as she sits down to talk with him, she starts noticing suspicious-looking hairs on his carpet. He has a white rug and Iaposm looking at all of the hair, itaposs black but itaposs not curly. And Iaposm thrown off because itaposs long straight hair. I have brown hair but at the time it was black but not % straight so [I knew it wasnapost] my hair, she said.

I didnapost know what to do other than walk away. I was almost in shock, dude we had been together almost a year. Heaposd been step-daddy to my kids and all that, we were emotionally attached. The woman later found out he had been cheating on her with more than one woman, all thanks to the use of social media, and this was what pushed her to leave him for good.

Designer Nicole McLaughlin shared footage where rows of labelled folders were stacked neatly in her fridge, before she opened the apossandwichapos binder where cheese, meats, pickles, salad and slices of bread had been inidually stored in plastic folders. Each item is then taken out to be used to prepare a perfect sandwich, and other binders in the fridge are labelled condiments, drinks, breakfast, fruit, and desserts. But as viewers were left outraged by the system, Nicole pointed out that it was merely a project and in no way reflected her real-le fridge at home. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The video racked up an incredible  million views and Nicole, from New York, US, said: My projects are always about finding fun ways to reuse dferent things for entirely dferent purposes. One night before I was going to sleep, I suddenly had the thought aposwhatthe refrigerator was like a library and it was so organised apos I know some people already organise the food in their fridge into labelled containers so I thought itaposd be funnyI took it to the next level, and have it be super organised by whatever the type of food was. I had a folder with the sandwich ingredients separated out, there was a compartment for the cheese and one for the sandwich meat.  I had done a project with those binder sleeves a couple of months before, so I just had them lying in my house. Nicole filmed her creation while on holiday with her family, taking everything she needed with her, and said they thought she was insane but get what I do at this point. She added: Itaposs always so funny to see how people react. You assume most people will take it as a joke about a crazy scenario where you would organise your fridge in that type of way.  Some commenters took it really seriously, and I think itaposs really funny that happened. I had some people commenting aposthis is some psychotic organisationapos. I donapost take any of the comments to heart. Itaposs funny because Iaposm not really that organised, Iaposm not that way at all. My studio is usually crazy, but itaposs funny to take things to an extreme level to see peopleaposs reactions. I really liked the comments where people said things like aposthis is some serial killer stuffapos, or aposmy organisational skills could neverapos. I hope people got that it was a joke, and this isnapost how I actually live. And many viewers on TikTok didnapost hold back on judging Nicoleaposs project, as one said: I feel like sociopaths do this, like what is this  A second wrote: Gives me serial killer vibes. And another added: Now this is art. I see it as a representation of diet culture and those who calorie count.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Viral\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

We really need to speed it up or you know what  This pandemic is going to go on for a year longer than it needs to. The problem has arisen due to the lack of vaccinations in low-income countries, while high income countries have far higher vaccination rates. High income countries like the UK are supposed to be donating to poorer states and have pledged a total of  million, but has so far only delivered  million. Coming out of the pandemic is not only vital for peopleaposs general health and well-being, but to the economy and certain sectors that were hit hard when restrictions to work against the spreading of the virus came in. Why might the pandemic continue  One of the reasons why the coronavirus pandemic is still ongoing could be the fact that less economically developed countries with high populations are lagging behind when it comes to the vaccine.Some experts argue that without mass vaccinations across the world, the virus will be able to mutate to the point where the original vaccinations become obsolete, though this is typically dficult to predict.Experts told Massachusetts Institute of Technologyaposs Technology Review : If countries with large populations wait to be vaccinated for years, the virus will keep mutating—potentially to the point that the first available vaccines lose effectiveness. That will be bad for everyone, but poorer countries, with less access to updated vaccines, will again feel more of the impact.United States President Joe Biden said: To beat the pandemic here, we need to beat it everywhere.The aposCovax poolapos was meant to counteract this and make sure that countries who could not afford the vaccines had access to them, through subsidised costs. But some countries, like the UK and Canada have used to pool to get their own vaccines despite having their own contracts with major pharmaceuticals. Under % of the population of Africa has been vaccinated. In the UK  In recent months, many in the UK have deemed the pandemic to be coming to an end. Bars and restaurants have reopened and with vaccinations now widespread, nights out and indulgences in recreational activities have felt like pre-pandemic days. Over  million people in the UK have received at least their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine and  million their second dose. Vaccinations are now available for children over .  But with cases on the rise in the UK , the problem at home has risen to the point where health experts are advising the government reimpose some lockdown restrictions, known as apos Plan B apos. Covid- cases have the potential to overwhelm the NHS and stop patients with other ailments from receiving the care they need.NHS Confederation boss Matthew Taylor, which represents the healthcare systems in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, said: We are right on the edge – and it is the middle of October. It would require an incredible amount of luck for us not to find ourselves in the midst of a profound crisis over the next three months. What is Plan B   Plan B is the governmentaposs contingency plan for winter that would reintroduce some social distancing measures by asking people to work form home, reintroducing masks and working from home, as well as some events requiring vaccine passports. It would be a set back for business recovering from the pandemic, particularly those that were most affected such as hospitality, bars and restaurants and the air travel sector.The government has so far remained resolute in rejecting calls for the measure and business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said: This time last year we didnapost have the vaccine. We donapost want to go back into lockdown and further restrictions. A spokesperson for Prime Minister Boris Johnson added: As you know it’s something we’re keeping a very close eye on because of the strength of our genomic capability we are able to keep a very close watch on any iants that are emerging.However, during the height of the pandemic, the government became known for U-turns on such policies.

The Taliban does not allow women to play sport under their rule, and since taking control made it clear that it was a punishable offence to take part.  Coach Suraya Afzali says she was captured having failed to escape Afghanistan after the collapse of the previous government. But conflicting reports on social media said she had been mysteriously killed a week before the Taliban ed to power. All the players of the volleyball team and the rest of the women athletes are in a bad situation and they are in despair and live in fear, he said in the interview. Everyone has been forced to flee and live in unknown places. The new all-male Taliban government was formed earlier this year, with women excluded.  A spokesperson for the group says they should restrict themselves to aposgiving birthapos - and steer clear of politics and sport. According to an official in the hardline Islamist group, women won’t be allowed to ‘expose them or their bodies to the media’ by taking part in matches. The deputy head of the Taliban’s cultural commission said women’s sport was considered neither appropriate - or necessary. Ahmadullah Wasiq defended the decision to Australian broadcaster SBS. “I don’t think women will be allowed to play cricket because it is not necessary that women should play cricket,” Wasiq said.  “In cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered. Islam does not allow women to be seen like this. “It is the media era, and there will be photos and videos, and then people watch it. Islam and the Islamic Emirate do not allow women to play cricket or play the kind of sports where they get exposed.” Zahra Fayazi, a member of senior volleyball team who fled to the UK in August, described last month how a fellow player had been murdered by the Taliban.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

lead with so little time remaining.It was a bitter blow for the home side having put so much effort into earning at least a point, but hopefully it can be taken as another lesson in game management from an experienced and well-drilled opponent.Tomorrow , the Pupils are on their travels, taking on Paisley outfit Glenvale FC on league duty at the town#s Ferguslie Park.

This makes it illegal to intentionally or, in Scotland and Northern Ireland, recklessly injure or kill any gull or damage or destroy an active nest or its contents. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, it is also illegal to prevent birds from accessing their nests and, in Northern Ireland, it is illegal to disturb any nesting bird. In addition, the Mediterranean gull is protected under Schedule  of both acts. This makes it illegal to intentionally or recklessly disturb the birds at or close to their nest or to disturb their dependent young. However, the law recognises that in certain circumstances control measures may be necessary. Simple nuisance or minor damage to property are not legally sanctioned reasons to kill gulls.#]ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOThe Glasgow News says that there is now confirmation of the statement made recently that among the constituencies to be contested by the Independent Liberals at the next election is Argyll.This stronghold of Sir William Sutherland is to be attacked by that soldier-journalist-author, Captain R W Campbell, whose Spud Tamson, a wartime sketch, gained him some notoriety five years ago.

The sky was dark and lowering, but the rainfall was rather light.The electric storm increased to intense violence about pm and for about an hour and a half afterwards vivid flashes of lightning and peals of thunder were almost continuous, averaging about  flashes to the minute.When the fireworks were at their height, the sight was gorgeous, awe-inspiring and of a splendour which baffles description.The writer, when standing at Dalintober Quay, watching the lightning display, could plainly see with every flash the houses along the Askomel shore, the boatyard, the outlines of ships at the Old Quay, also the streets and buildings could be discerned with noonday clarity.Very often the flashes were double and treble and some even repeating themselves up to six times. The superb fluttering of light was of startling beauty and dazzling splendour, momentarily illuminating the sky from horizon to horizon.Accompanied by this brilliant display of lightscape were sharp cracks and outbursts of thunder, which rumbled, reverberated and re-echoed throughout the landscape with an eerie sort of foreboding effect.The phenomenon was characterised by a high percentage of fork lightning, which is most unusual in our temperate zone."},{"url":null,"title":"leader october 15","story":"It was encouraging to see a positive and constructive debate, with cross-party MSPs from across the region delivering a similar message.What matters now is what happens next.John Gurr, chairman of the Rest and Be Thankful Campaign group, has invited Transport Minister Graeme Dey and the area#s MSPs to join him in a journey along the route, #on the bus too,#desired.Whatever mode of transport Mr Dey choses to take one thing remains certain.

Surely they could be stored at the council depot, especially when not getting used.The grass throughout was cut and the loose grass was left lying in thick clumps, asit was a playing field, instead of a cemetery.This cemetery, in years past, won an award but I fail to see the same happening again with things as they are of late.The grass around the stones, at the sides and back, is not being cut, resulting in long grass and often ferns growing there are bollards lying loose which will undoubtedly result in damage to a car there are cones at the main car park, restricting the amount of cars that can park there, and there are also cones at the portable cabins the road in the cemetery is a total disgrace!I in no way blame the men who work in the cemetery as they are doing as they have been told to do, and I know they are taken from the cemetery to work where, resulting in those men not having the time to complete the work which is necessary to keep the cemetery in the condition it should be.I understand about cutbacks and lack of funds but I am wondering where the money goes that people have paid for plots and or council tax, which increase and yet there are even more cutbacks.My biggest concern is where has the respect gone The following is in response to the debate about the state of the A over Rest And Be Thankful in the Scottish Parliament last Wednesday, October .I fear that the current Rest and Be Thankful is a catastrophe waiting to happen and I think that there needs to be an urgency from the Scottish Government to deliver a medium-term and long-term solution for the people and businesses of Argyll.The Cabinet Secretary discussed the necessity to collect data for the end long-term solution and, as much as I appreciate that, it should have been done years ago and I completely understand the frustrations felt by businesses and travellers alike.The Cabinet Secretary also invited all contributing MSPs to walk the forestry road with engineers and I am going to write to him to accept that invitation."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week october 15 2021","story":"Graham took several nature and scenic shots while visiting south Kintyre recently, another of which we published last month.If you have a photograph you would like to share, please email it to editor@campbeltowncourier or send it via the Courier#s Facebook page."},{"url":null,"title":"tale of two halves as pupils lose out in paisley","story":"Campbeltown Pupils suffered late heartbreak last Saturday as they suffered a reverse away result to Paisley outfit Glenvale.Leading -

It was secured by what became the second of the famous Kintyre passenger transport company names, A  P McConnachie.Further new operators joined the fray and, as was common in those days, intense competition occurred everywhere in the country until regulatory route licensing was introduced in  with the arrival of the Road Traffic Act.Post Office mails and parcels contracts formed a key part of the Kintyre service network in a similar but much further reaching geographical spread, the now famous MacBraynes organisation of those times similarly carried parcels and mails to destinations across the western seaboard and western isles in its own fleet of buses and motor ships.In the mid-s,West Coast Motors obtained a contract to convey mails and parcels to and from Campbeltown and Glasgow.

In the latter period, new bus grants were obtainable under certain conditions resulting in some splendid coaches being purchased.In post war years, the company gradually built on its service network in Kintyre and Mid Argyll. In , it picked up the East Loch – West Loch Tarbert mail ship link from Tarbert-based Dickies then the Tarbert – Kilberry service from McEacherns in , the Lochgilphead Tayvallich service from McLachans in  and, perhaps somewhat prophetically, the Benderloch-based operations of McColls in .Without doubt, the most signicant developments in West Coast#s history occurred in the - period. During the s, William Craig had attempted to introduce a direct Campbeltown to Glasgow service but failed in this ambition then and at later attempts. Finally, in , these hopes were realised when the company became a joint operator, with Scottish Citylink, of the through service between the two locations.The s continued to see signicant developments. Firstly the acquisition, also in , of the buses and Mid Argyll routes operated by Lochgilphead-based Stag Garage. This was followed, a year later, by the purchase of the old MacBrayne garage in Ardrishaig, giving West Coast an excellent base in the area.The early s saw a further involvement in Oban when West Coast secured responsibility for the Oban to Glasgow service and by  it had acquired the former Alexanders depot in Oban enabling it to build further on its already signicant presence in Argyll.Since , the rate of change has quickened further. West Coast secured the Cowal and Bute area contracts and depots in  and when Bowmans, the long-established Mull services operator retired in , West Coast added this to its portfolio. Their Oban base allows vehicle and manpower deployments on Mullneeded. Of the major Argyll islands, only Islay remains independently served by the Mundell concern of Tarbert, whose lorries are also a familiar sight in the county."},{"url":null,"title":"minato-sushi-cheese-lady-boost-haddington-town-centre","story":"The Cheese Lady on Haddington High Street is moving into the former butcher premises of Colin D Peat on neighbouring Court Street.The move from High Street has opened the door for Minato Sushi to bring the Japanese delicacy to the town centre.The changing face of the town centre was welcomed by councillors Tom Trotter and John McMillan, with the new businesses set to open this summer.Jen Kerr, of Minato Sushi, stressed there was still plenty of work ahead at the business before the doors opened.The -year-old, of Port Seton, who will run the business with her boyfriend Tom Cuddy, described it as ldquoa real dream come true.She said: ldquoWe are really excited.

He was a morphine addict who destroyed his prospects as a doctor.ldquoHe used to have practices in Rotherfield, where he murdered Hubert, but he had to leave because he was so addicted to morphine.ldquoHe could not handle the practice anymore and moved to Bournemouth and became incapable of running his practice.Dr Bondeson, , is no stranger to writing about gruesome murders.Earlier this year, he told the story of a dozen unsolved murders in London, including that of prostitute Harriet Buswell, who was killed on Christmas Day.It was during the writing of that book, which was reissued this year, that he came across the story of Dr Lamson.Dr Bondeson said: ldquoBack in  or , I wrote a book called Victorian Murders about ious murders in Victorian times.ldquoDr Lamson was one of the cases and I was surprised how much new material could be found about him.ldquoThere had not been a modern study of him in the last  years and it seemed a good idea to remedy that and write a story of Dr Lamson using modern research, as well as files from the National Archives in Kew.Dr Lamson had been a military doctor before taking on the medical practice in Rotherfield, East Sussex.After he married, he gained two brothers-in-law: Hubert, who had tuberculosis, and Percy, who had scoliosis.In , during a family gathering, Hubert died suddenly, with his cause of death listed as pulmonary consumption and amyloid degeneration.Just two years later, Dr Lamson persuaded Percy to swallow a gelatine capsule, with forensic scientists later finding he had been poisoned with the uncommon vegetable toxin aconitine.Dr Lamson was later found guilty of murder and sentenced to death.Dr Bondeson said: ldquoDuring his criminous and wasted le, Dr Lamson had accomplished some good but also much wickedness short and evil had been his days, as he stood on the scaffold counting one or two more seconds, the longest-lasting in his le, waiting for the drop to open.ldquoThe police detectives, and even Lamsonrsquos barrister Montagu Williams, felt certain that Dr Lamson was a double murderer, having poisoned both his brothers-in-law for the sake of profit.ldquoComparing his

The vessel design is broadly based on our larger loch class vessels, which are double-ended.“Once the designs are approved, we will move to the next stage of the project, which will see the build of the engine to be used in feasibility studies.“The maritime industry has a key role in the global fight for climate change, and this project marks a step toward emissions-free marine transport.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

For some of the choir members this was the first time in  months that they had seen or spoken to each other - evenit was with a face mask and making sure they remained socially distanced!During this first practice the men were seated a good distance apart making sure everyone was safe. It did result in reducing the maximum numbers that could be accommodated in the room at one time so that the st and nd Tenors were only present for the first hour and the combined Bass section in the second hour.Everyone expressed how great it was to be able to sing along with the piano again, being ably played by our accompanist, Leah Greer and once more listening to detailed instructions from our Musical Director, Rea Sheils. “This past  months has been a dficult time for everyone and the choir is no exception,” outlined a choir spokesman.“But there is no doubt there were smiles under those masks from those who attended.”And the choir sends out a special invite!“If you enjoy singing and would like to come along, we meet every Monday night in the Bowling Club.

There was a strong local representation too with young people from schools right across Armagh involved in proceedings. Organised by the Church Leaders Group , the Church of Ireland and Roman Catholic Archbishops of Armagh, the Presbyterian Moderator, the President of the Methodist Church and President of the Irish Council of Churches all had a hand in the service. A heavy police cordon was in effect in Armagh and around St Patricks Cathedral from the early hours of the morning. Media from across Ireland had descended on the city for the service too, which was televised across the UK on the BBC and across Ireland on RTE. Before the service began, the Assistant Organist, the Revd Canon Dr Peter Thompson, played as guests arrived. The Cathedral bells rang as dignitaries arrived, including the Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney and the leaders of the DUP, UUP, Alliance and SDLP. The Queen, who was unable to attend, was represented by the Earl of Caledon. The opening hymn of the service O Christ the same through all our storys pages - played to the melody of Londonderry Air - was followed by a reading of scripture by the recently appointed Dean of Armagh, the Very Revd Shane Forster.  He read  Corinthians :-: Soanyone is in Christ, there is a new creation: everything old has passed away see, everything has become new! All this is from God who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting the message of reconciliation to us. The Dean also welcomed everyone to the service. We gather here today on this ancient hill of Armagh, where St Patrick established a faith community and church over fteen hundred years ago, to reflect on the signicance of this centenary year and the long road we have travelled which also stretches out before us, he said. In this the ecclesiastical capital of this island, a centuries old place of learning and outreach, we meet together at this time, people from erse backgrounds and traditions, with dferent beliefs and aspirations, to pray for the healing of past hurts and to seek God’s guidance and hope for the future.  Our past has shaped us and scarred us, it has ided us, and yet it has also on occasion brought us together. As we lament our failures, sorrows and pain, and recognise our wounded yet living history, may we with a united voice commit ourselves to work together for the common good, in mutual respect and with shared hope for a light filled, prosperous and peaceful future. His following prayer spoke of how we as a people had wounded each other and our communities in the past. We are sorry and ashamed and asked for your forgiveness, so that together we may move forward in faith, grow together in love, and faithfully serve you all our days. Soloist Helena Hendron, accompanied by the gentlemen of the Cathedral Choir, sang The Deers Cry, before a reading from Isiah :- by Rebecca Morris. A song of hope, Were the Future of Tomorrow, was sung by a childrens choir drawn from the local area. That was followed by a reading from St Matthew :- by Oisiacuten Walsh. The hopes, dreams and aspirations of the next generation were then given to the congregation by Lucy Addis from the Royal School, Armagh, Sean McCourt-Kelly from St Patrick’s High School, Keady, and Andrea Andrews, a pupil of La Cheacuteile Secondary School in Tyrrelstown in Dublin. Prayers were read, with the opening prayer read in Irish by Linda Ervine and Seacutean Cull. Intercessions were offered by Professor Mary Hannon-Fletcher and Robert Barfoot, both of whom were injured in the conflict. Reflections were then given by the Church Leaders, with the exception of the Methodist Leader, who was giving the sermon later. ‘In Christ Alone’, a hymn written by Stuart Townend and Keith Getty, who has links to the Armagh area, was then sung by the congregation. Rev’d Dr Sahr Yambasu, President of the Methodist Church in Ireland, then gave his sermon, followed by the Act of Commitment, led by Rosa McCloskey and James Chamberlain, a pupil of Markethill High School. The most symbolic act of the service saw Billy Wilson, a pupil of City of Armagh High School, carry a lantern, representing a light of hope, through the Cathedral where it was received in the santuary by the Church Leaders. Billy was accompanied by Libby Harrison from Saints and Scholars Primary School, Erika Stancuite of Mount St Catherines Primary School and Alfie Cummings who attends Armstrong Primary School. Blessings sung by the Cathedral Choir and given by the Church Leaders, then took place, before the final hymn, ‘Be Thou My Vision’."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4173607.jpg--.jpg?1634813844000\n","title":"student emma wins uk design title","story":" A BALLYMENA Graphic Design student has been announced as the winner of the prestigious ACA UK  Ireland Award.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueJustin McCamphill, Northern Officiall with teaching union NASUWT.Mark BainTwitterEmailOctober   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailEducation Minister Michelle McIlveen has been urged to advise schools on the steps they need to take when schools cannot be staffed due to Covid.The Northern Ireland Teachers’ Councilsaid some schools are having to send pupils home as there are no teachers available to teach them.The NITC has called on the Department of Education and the Public Health Agency to publish any evidence that supports their position that schools remain safe.Justin McCamphill, secretary of the NITC and NASUWT national official for Northern Ireland, said there was growing concern that the levels of Covid cases plus better pay and conditions outside Northern Ireland are combining to cause staff shortages.“NITC is alarmed that the levels of Covid in schools have contributed signicantly to schools being unable to source enough substitute teachers,” he said.“This is not the only contributing factor, many newly qualied teachers have sought work outside of Northern Ireland where there is better pay and conditions of employment.“The NITC is particularly concerned with the situation in our special schools. Just yesterday the Education Authority sent an email to all substitute teachers appealing for teachers to make themselves available for work in special schools.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseJustin McCamphill, Northern Officiall with teaching union NASUWT.

There is ample evidence, we believe, that the current substitute teacher shortage is in large part the result of an up surge in the numbers of teachers being absent on foot of Covid- infections.“INTO can report with confidence that schools across the north are experiencing severe dficulties in locating and employing temporary teachers.”A spokesperson for the Department of Education noted that Covid- has created “an unusually high demand for substitute teachers” this year. “It is inevitable that there will continue to be cases of Covid- in schools - this reflects transmission in the wider community,” they said.Schools have a range of mitigations available to reduce the risk of transmission in the school environment and the PHA continue to provide advice to schools which require specialist public health advice on the management of multiple cases and clusters.They added that “everyone has a role to play in ensuring that hygiene, social distancing and all other public health measures continue to be followed.”“The Department is aware of the dficulties that principals are experiencing in securing substitute teachers through NISTR [the online booking facility for all substitute teachers in Northern Ireland], often contacting many to find that they are unavailable to work.“NISTR is a user-maintained database and substitute teachers and schools engaging them need to update the system regularly and the EA, which manages NISTR, has reminded users of the importance of doing so.The department said that it has launched a range of new initiatives, “such as the Engage Programme and our summer schools programme, to provide additional support to those pupils whose education has been most disrupted by the pandemic”.They concluded: “These have provided extra employment opportunities for substitute teachers but have also reduced the number available to provide day to day cover in schools.”Related topicsDepartment of EducationDepartment of HealthMore On Department of EducationTeacher bids farewell after half a century at Clton Special School in BangorProject launched aimed at preventing boys from falling behind in the education systemUnion: Teachers have been left abandoned to deal with the pandemic on their ownReprieve for NI grammar school over £k debtStudent teachers trained in lesaving skills in bid to improve NI cardiac survival ratesMost ReadNI high street voucher: , given seven days to confirm identity to receive Spend Local cardWatch: Daniel O’Donnell’s new tropical music video ‘cheers up’ viewers worldwideNI centenary event: Past shaped scarred and ided but also brought us together, Armagh congregation toldFather who targeted home of man he wrongly believed to be responsible for the deaths of his daughters given suspended sentence‘I hope we have learned lessons’ says DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson following NI centenary church serviceTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-ef-edd-ab-bfbdadfe_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-ef-edd-ab-bfbdadfe_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayChurch leaders’ message of reconciliation at Northern Ireland centenary servicePlayQueen cancels Northern Ireland trip after being told by doctors to restPlayWatch: New trailer for Kenneth Branagh#s Belfast releasedLatest EducationProject launched aimed at preventing boys from falling behind in the education systemUnion: Teachers have been left abandoned to deal with the pandemic on their ownViewpointOpinionFormidable head teacher Diane is not for turningNI school’s two weeks to find £k or risk losing grammar statusNI schools urged to address shortage in digital workforceLatestHaulage industry facing Brexit and ageism issues… for a start£m holiday scheme may not go ahead, warns Gordon LyonsAlf McCrearyOpinionTime will tell how many of us will heed call for reflection and hopeGivan slammed by reverend for taking part in ‘unbiblical’ servicePiers Morgan announces he is quitting Le Stories show on ITV,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Kelvin Boyes PAAllan PrestonTwitterEmailOctober   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA retired Free Presbyterian minister has launched a stinging attack on the First Minister Paul Givan for attending Thursday’s cross-community centenary church service in Armagh.Rev Ivan Foster, a former minister at Kilskeery Free Presbyterian Church in Omagh, said that Mr Givan had taken part in an “unbiblical” event.Mr Givan, a Free Presbyterian himself, had attended Thursday’s cross-denominational service at St Patrick’s Church of Ireland Cathedral in Armagh despite public objections from his own church.The event — “held under the auspices of the combined apostate denominations here in Ulster”, according to Rev Foster — had already attracted controversy after the Irish President Michael D Higgins declined an invitation, as he felt it had become politicised.The Queen also pulled out at the last moment following medical advice that she should rest.The Free Presbyterian Church previously said it was “grieved” that the service, organised by the four main churches, was “deliberately planned to promote the unbiblical ethos of religious ecumenism”.Rev Foster has now questionedthe church will take any disciplinary measures against the First Minister and DUP leader. He said failure to act against “this blatant breach” would make a mockery of the church.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “May the Lord have mercy on His people in Ulster who have been given such poor spiritual and political leadership in these evil times,” he said.The DUP has been asked for a response. When contacted, Rev Foster said he would leave it to the Free Presbyterian Church to decidethere would be any internal sanctions against Mr Givan.He was asked why Paul Givan shouldn’t attend as First Minister when the Queen had felt it was appropriate before taking ill. “The Queen is not a Free Presbyterian,” he said. “The Queen is not someone who has sat up and said ‘I believe in the doctrines of the Free Presbyterian Church’.“She’s the head of the Church of England which is a dogsbody for every form of filthiness. That’s the truth, theologically speaking.”Rev Foster added that he “lamented” the appetite for protest from his church had dropped away in recent years since former First Minister and Free Presbyterian founder, former DUP leader Rev Ian Paisley, performed a “political somersault and entered into an alliance with Sinn Fein”.Those attending Thursday’s widely reported event also included Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney as well as the leaders of the DUP, UUP and SDLP.Free Presbyterian Moderator Rev John Armstrong recently said that “this upcoming event has been arranged to promote the purposes of unscriptural ecumenism when it ought to have been a service of celebration and thanksgiving for the Lord’s hand upon our country over the past  years”.Related topicsPaul GivanUlster Unionist PartySDLPBoris JohnsonSimon CoveneyMost ReadNI high street voucher: , given seven days to confirm identity to receive Spend Local cardWatch: Daniel O’Donnell’s new tropical music video ‘cheers up’ viewers worldwideNI centenary event: Past shaped scarred and ided but also brought us together, Armagh congregation toldFather who targeted home of man he wrongly believed to be responsible for the deaths of his daughters given suspended sentence‘I hope we have learned lessons’ says DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson following NI centenary church serviceTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-ef-edd-ab-bfbdadfe_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-ef-edd-ab-bfbdadfe_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayChurch leaders’ message of reconciliation at Northern Ireland centenary servicePlayQueen cancels Northern Ireland trip after being told by doctors to restPlayWatch: New trailer for Kenneth Branagh#s Belfast releasedLatest Northern IrelandHaulage industry facing Brexit and ageism issues… for a startAlf McCrearyOpinionTime will tell how many of us will heed call for reflection and hopeNI nightclubs reopening: Face masks ‘won’t be mandatory’Young student reveals spiking horror: ‘I ended up at RVH in agony... it’s scary, I could remember nothing’Pothole deep enough to fit a ft person standing up – officials say they are looking into itLatestHaulage industry facing Brexit and ageism issues… for a start£m holiday scheme may not go ahead, warns Gordon LyonsAlf McCrearyOpinionTime will tell how many of us will heed call for reflection and hopePiers Morgan announces he is quitting Le Stories show on ITVThe Queen’s busy October schedule before a night in hospital,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Colm O#ReillyAmy CochraneTwitterEmailOctober   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThere was a recruitment ‘drive’ with a dference at Stormont on Thursday as a convoy of haulage vehicles, potential drivers, instructors and business owners highlighted the crisis in their industry.Ahead of National Lorry Week, starting on Monday, they are calling on MLAs to help tackle the UK’s shortage of over , drivers.Earlier this week, an Office for National Statisticsreport underlined the issues facing the haulage industry, including an ageing workforce, a shortage of EU nationals, and mounting costs and red tape in the wake of Brexit. The ONS said there were nearly a third fewerlorry drivers working in the UK aged between  and  than in the year to June , with a , drop.Nearly a third of all hauliers in the UK were aged  or over in -, with just under % aged between  and . Age is not the only issue, with expensive training and tests also a barrier to younger lorry drivers.Economy Minister Gordon Lyons MLA spoke at Thursday’s event organised by the Road Haulage Association , .“All too often we take for granted what’s done throughout Northern Ireland in bringing all the goods in that we rely on here every single day,” he said.He said he is keen to see people view the industry as “one that has a future and that has good career prospects”. But he added: “That hasn’t always been the case. And I want to send a message today that this is a sector that’s open to everyone regardless of your gender or background because it’s a fantastic sector to work in.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “I understand the changes that need to take place as well, in relation to conditions in particular, but we are committed as an Executive to doing all that we can to support this sector.”A skills shortage report by the Freight Transport Association in  showed that although only around % of those taking the practical truck driving test are women, their pass rate is consistently higher than their male counterparts.Anne Murrayfrom Portadown started out working in accounts and admin for Manfreight. “I’ve been working in the industry the past couple of years but when I started working in the garage I wanted a bit more knowledge because when you’re asked things by drivers it’s kind of good to know what you’re talking about!” she said.Anne was helped by fleet manager and Manfreight instructor, Steven Heasley to complete her medical, theory, hazard perception and practical tests.The Co Armagh woman is now able to drive lorries to maintenance and service checks and said she “really enjoys it” – and “it’s easier than it looks”.But she added: “It’s quite expensive sothere were incentives to help pay for the test fees or training fees in order to get the industry back up and running, I think more people would give it a go.”Belfast City Council launched employment academies for the unemployed over five years ago, including a transport and logistics academy which offers job opportunities and training.   Chris Tubridy, who heads it, said there is extremely competitive demand for drivers but the expense of the licence itself is where the problem lies, costing on average over £, per test.“There are more than three jobs for every participant that’s on our course,” he said. “But to get through the course and gain your full licence is an expensive process for those without help.”Student Lydia Grfithadded that the process to become a driver can be rather y as well.“The induction was at the end of June for the course this year, then you have to wait five weeks for your provisional back. Then I unfortunately failed my theory, so I now have to wait another eight weeks on a resit,” she said.“If things like that were speeded up a bit by the Driver and Vehicle Agency , more drivers would be coming through the course a lot quicker and into employment. All it is realistically is a wee line on your license and it takes five weeks to do.”Michael Strain, CEO of Transport Training Services launched a ‘Women in Wheels’ apprenticeship programme last year.Mr Strain said that there is also a certain “barrier” with younger people and employers where some don’t accept drivers over the age of .“Realisticallyyou start driving earlier, and you already have a full driving license, there is no reason why you can’t learn to drive a lorry too,” he said.“Haulage and lorry driving is an ageing career, and we need to change that. The average age of a lorry driver in the UK, including Northern Ireland, is , with only % under the age of ,” he added.“We need the Department for the Economy to now push the value of these apprenticeship programmes and get young lorry drivers and mechanics back to work.”Related topicsGordon LyonsBelfast City CouncilDepartment for the EconomyMore On Gordon Lyons Premium£m holiday scheme may not go ahead, warns Gordon LyonsNI High Street Voucher: Over , people yet to apply for Spend Local CardGordon LyonsOpinionNI voucher scheme- No one should be made to feel guilty about this business boost PremiumMallon urges UK and Irish government intervention over DUP north-south boycottEconomy Minister sets aside another £m for high street vouchersMost ReadNI high street voucher: , given seven days to confirm identity to receive Spend Local cardWatch: Daniel O’Donnell’s new tropical music video ‘cheers up’ viewers worldwideNI centenary event: Past shaped scarred and ided but also brought us together, Armagh congregation toldFather who targeted home of man he wrongly believed to be responsible for the deaths of his daughters given suspended sentence‘I hope we have learned lessons’ says DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson following NI centenary church serviceTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-ef-edd-ab-bfbdadfe_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-ef-edd-ab-bfbdadfe_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayChurch leaders’ message of reconciliation at Northern Ireland centenary servicePlayQueen cancels Northern Ireland trip after being told by doctors to restPlayWatch: New trailer for Kenneth Branagh#s Belfast releasedLatest Northern IrelandAlf McCrearyOpinionTime will tell how many of us will heed call for reflection and hopeGivan slammed by reverend for taking part in ‘unbiblical’ serviceNI nightclubs reopening: Face masks ‘won’t be mandatory’Young student reveals spiking horror: ‘I ended up at RVH in agony... it’s scary, I could remember nothing’Pothole deep enough to fit a ft person standing up – officials say they are looking into itLatest£m holiday scheme may not go ahead, warns Gordon LyonsAlf McCrearyOpinionTime will tell how many of us will heed call for reflection and hopeGivan slammed by reverend for taking part in ‘unbiblical’ servicePiers Morgan announces he is quitting Le Stories show on ITVThe Queen’s busy October schedule before a night in hospital,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

One way or another, we’re obsessing about them again, and being distracted from really thinking about what a good society would look like.“But I am hopeful. Hopeful in a new generation who know that the big problems we’ve landed them with, especially climate change and economic inequality, can only be tackled together.“I think there are already signs that the next generation will see the things that we obsessed about as secondary and place their priorities where.”Read MoreAlf McCreary:OpinionSadly, the absence of the Queen and Michael D Higgins will be remembered long after centenary church service eventHere#s how the service unfolded: []jsdjs.src\"embed.scribblelive widgets embed.js\"ijsMost ReadNI high street voucher: , given seven days to confirm identity to receive Spend Local cardWatch: Daniel O’Donnell’s new tropical music video ‘cheers up’ viewers worldwideNI centenary event: Past shaped scarred and ided but also brought us together, Armagh congregation toldBuckingham Palace won’t send another member of Royal Family to centenary church serviceFather who targeted home of man he wrongly believed to be responsible for the deaths of his daughters given suspended sentenceTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-ef-edd-ab-bfbdadfe_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-ef-edd-ab-bfbdadfe_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayChurch leaders’ message of reconciliation at Northern Ireland centenary servicePlayQueen cancels Northern Ireland trip after being told by doctors to restPlayWatch: New trailer for Kenneth Branagh#s Belfast releasedLatest Northern IrelandHaulage industry facing Brexit and ageism issues… for a startAlf McCrearyOpinionTime will tell how many of us will heed call for reflection and hopeGivan slammed by reverend for taking part in ‘unbiblical’ serviceNI nightclubs reopening: Face masks ‘won’t be mandatory’Young student reveals spiking horror: ‘I ended up at RVH in agony... it’s scary, I could remember nothing’LatestHaulage industry facing Brexit and ageism issues… for a start£m holiday scheme may not go ahead, warns Gordon LyonsAlf McCrearyOpinionTime will tell how many of us will heed call for reflection and hopeGivan slammed by reverend for taking part in ‘unbiblical’ servicePiers Morgan announces he is quitting Le Stories show on ITV,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But the show must go on.Read More‘I hope we have learned lessons’ says DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson following NI centenary church serviceAlf McCreary:OpinionSadly, the absence of the Queen and Michael D Higgins will be remembered long after centenary church service eventThe Service of Reflection and Hope, which took place amid a signicant security presence in Armagh on Thursday, was organised by the Church Leaders Group to “mark the centenary of the partition of Ireland and the formation of Northern Ireland”.Intentions aside, the service sparked controversy last month after President Michael D Higgins turned down an invitation to attend the service because, it later emerged, he said it had become politicised and it would be inappropriate for him to attend as head of state.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up And politicians and prominent figures from across the ide did attend, with SDLP party leader Colum Eastwood the first to arrive after his party said it would send a representative.He was shortly followed by UUP leader Doug Beattie and Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride. Secretary of State Brandon Lewis, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and First Minister Paul Givan were also there after visiting the newly-minted Royal Hillsborough shortly after it received its letters patent in a first for Northern Ireland.Inside the church, there was a jovial atmosphere but by no means a full congregation and for Covid reasons, there were only  attendees, although the church can normally take .The Queen was still listed on the programme but instead of any member of the Royal Family, she was represented by Her Majesty#s Lord-Lieutenant for the County of Armagh, Lord Caledon.Both the UK and Ireland had representatives. Simon Coveney came from the south along with chief whip Jack Chambers and Boris Johnson came across the Irish Sea border. We won#t discuss who is in what customs union, that#s for another day.The service itself was contemplative and despite the low temperatures of the day, brought warmth with singing by both children and the gentleman of the Cathedral Choir, singing a range of hymns.In general, the service focused on the themes of children and reconciliation, where a choir of children sang We’re the Future of Tomorrow, adding a touch of colour to proceedings in their dferent school unorms from a number of local schools. Young people also spoke about their hopes and dreams for the future and led the Act of Commitment, carrying a lantern to the altar as a symbol of light and hope.It was hard not to be moved by what was said by the youngest people who took part in the service at the ecclesiastical centre of the island. Lucy Addis said her generation has only ever known peace. “We all breathe the same air, we all walk under the same trees,” she said. “Now more than ever, we need to come together - to ensure the planet is preserved for future generations.”Sean McCourt-Kelly , from Armagh, said he believes there’s so much more to be done. We need courageous leaders to offer young people like me hope for the future,” he said.Andrea Andrews said she’s worried about what’s to come - “it is my hope that those who are leaders will show us a clear path to a better future,” she said.The word “sorry” was also used plenty of times, including by the Very Reverend Dr Sahr Yambasu, the president of the Methodist Church in Ireland. “This service provides us with an opportunity to give thanks but also an opportunity to lament, to say sorry - to imagine what could be and choose the way forward,” he said.Emotional and profound remarks were made by all church leaders, including Archbishop Eamon Martin who, before he greeted schoolchildren to thank them for attending, said during the service he looks back with a “deep sense of loss” at , like many others in his community.It “polarised people and institutionalised dference” and had the effect of cutting off his home city of Derry from its natural hinterland, he said, before acknowledging faith leaders could have done more to unite the people of this island.It was one of the only remarks that nodded to the fact that nationalists, including Sinn Fein and politicians like the President, felt unable to attend on Thursday.Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh John McDowell said the nation is again “obsessing about borders”. “This pandemic and some political developments have exposed just how ided a society we have become,” he said.An opening prayer was led in Irish by Linda Ervine and Sean Coll on the topic of reconciliation and blessings for those who work in that area.Rosa McCloskey , deputy head girl at Lagan College, took part in the service. “We’re an integrated school, so we were asked to take part. I really enjoyed the service and I liked how central children were.“I was looking forward to meeting the Queen but there were obviously still loads of other people here, like the Prime Minister.”After the ecumenical service, Boris Johnson met several families in attendance and also greeted some schoolchildren who took part in the choir. Simon Coveney and Jack Chambers also spent plenty of time talking to the children who lined the path up to the cathedral to greet them.The church leaders all paired off to talk with politicians before they made their way for a very brief reception at Armagh’s Robinson Library for the  minutes before Boris Johnson ed to Westminster.There’s no doubt the Queen would have enjoyed the camaraderieshe had been able to attend the service but she was conspicuous in her absence.Fionnuala Jay-O’Boyle, the Lord Lieutenant of Belfast, said she thought the service was pulled off “beautully” despite the absence of the monarch.“What was very striking was the lack of artice. I think it was about a core message, it was about grace and about reconciliation and it was about a shared island for this next generation. I was deeply deeply moved today.“Of course, I have no doubt that her Majesty was watching from Windsor and I have no doubt that she will be back in Northern Ireland as soon as she possibly can.”The Church Leaders Group issued a statement on Wednesday morning following the announcement from Buckingham Palace and good wishes for her health were the first remarks made by the Dean of Armagh, the Very Reverend Shane Forster.There was no crowd outside St Patrick’s Cathedral but it’s possible there may have been more of a celebration around Armagh itselfshe had attended, with flag-waving and bouquet-handing. She is the Commander in Chief, after all.Ultimately, there was much debate and controversy around this event but in the end, it went off very quietly. In a centenary year dominated by Covid, perhaps that was appropriate.

No one wants ato the draconian measures that have been in place for so long.The Executive has identied a robust and dynamic communication strategy as key in achieving this. Time will tellit can stay on message.Most ReadNI high street voucher: , given seven days to confirm identity to receive Spend Local cardWatch: Daniel O’Donnell’s new tropical music video ‘cheers up’ viewers worldwideNI centenary event: Past shaped scarred and ided but also brought us together, Armagh congregation toldFather who targeted home of man he wrongly believed to be responsible for the deaths of his daughters given suspended sentence‘I hope we have learned lessons’ says DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson following NI centenary church serviceTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-ef-edd-ab-bfbdadfe_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-ef-edd-ab-bfbdadfe_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayChurch leaders’ message of reconciliation at Northern Ireland centenary servicePlayQueen cancels Northern Ireland trip after being told by doctors to restPlayWatch: New trailer for Kenneth Branagh#s Belfast releasedLatest Northern IrelandHaulage industry facing Brexit and ageism issues… for a startAlf McCrearyOpinionTime will tell how many of us will heed call for reflection and hopeGivan slammed by reverend for taking part in ‘unbiblical’ serviceNI nightclubs reopening: Face masks ‘won’t be mandatory’Young student reveals spiking horror: ‘I ended up at RVH in agony... it’s scary, I could remember nothing’LatestHaulage industry facing Brexit and ageism issues… for a start£m holiday scheme may not go ahead, warns Gordon LyonsAlf McCrearyOpinionTime will tell how many of us will heed call for reflection and hopeGivan slammed by reverend for taking part in ‘unbiblical’ servicePiers Morgan announces he is quitting Le Stories show on ITV,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It comes as part of the Northern Irelands Executives winter Covid contingency plans. The Executive said there was a need to keep as many sectors open to the fullest possible extent. First Minister, Paul Givan said doing that would depend on as many people as possible getting vaccinated.” googletag.cmd.push Just over % of people aged  and above in Northern Ireland had received one dose of the vaccine. Mr Givan said: Our vaccination rates are very good but there is still room for improvement.” Further Covid restrictions are due to be relaxed by the Executive onOctober . This will allow for nightclubs to reopen, restrictions on indoor dancing lted and the requirement to be seated in hospitality to drink and eat food will no longer be in place. Mr Givan said it was a fact of le that Covid remains an ongoing issue, and that the Executive needed to continue to find ways to manage the situation.     The First Minister says that the Executive will launch a new public information campaign before the end of October to build on the need for all of us to keep making safer choices.

We must maintain our focus and collective endeavour.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm.     When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Michelle Devine at The Cottage Coffee Shop with their awards Derry NewsDerry cafeacute takes home top prize for best scones in the country overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArrest made in drugs operation linked to INLA in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Thursday, st October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police in Derry appeal for anyone who believes they have had their drink spiked last weekend to contact themDerry NewsPolice appealing for anyone who believes they had their drink spiked while out in Derry city-centre last weekend to contact them overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City super fan - the late Hugh Curran.SoccerCandystripe legends to honour Derry City super fan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Proposals would see Claudy moved from the Foyle to East Derry constituencyCounty Derry PostFoyle to lose Eglinton and Claudy in proposed boundaries shake-up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMurdered County Derry man was victim of alleged assault last year overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsHotel Hero award for County Derry man overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Michelle Devine at The Cottage Coffee Shop with their awards Derry NewsDerry cafeacute takes home top prize for best scones in the country overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArrest made in drugs operation linked to INLA in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Thursday, st October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police in Derry appeal for anyone who believes they have had their drink spiked last weekend to contact themDerry NewsPolice appealing for anyone who believes they had their drink spiked while out in Derry city-centre last weekend to contact them overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City super fan - the late Hugh Curran.SoccerCandystripe legends to honour Derry City super fan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Proposals would see Claudy moved from the Foyle to East Derry constituencyCounty Derry PostFoyle to lose Eglinton and Claudy in proposed boundaries shake-up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMurdered County Derry man was victim of alleged assault last year overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsHotel Hero award for County Derry man overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Reporter: Michael McMullan Oct   addthis, JUNIOR FINALColeraine v Na Magha -Sunday– OwenbegRef: Niall Clford Sundays junior final is a repeat of the  final when Deaglan Foleys point in an inspired second-half display saw city side Na Magha earn a - to - draw. Colm McGoldrick and Niall Holly scored Eoghan Ruas goals in a game that was sandwiched between their drawn football and their replay win that ended the Emmets hopes of clinching five in a row. googletag.cmd.push After winning the Ulster junior in , the Coleraine club werent allowed to compete in the Ulster series until the following year when they won Ulster again in , so it will be Na Magha who will take on the Cavan champions when the provincial series begins at the end of November, Coleraine were on the wrong end of a thumping by Swatragh in this years qualying round, losing - to - with the Davitts also hitting  wides. Liam McGoldrick, currently working in London, was absent. So too are Aidan Boyle, Niall Holly, Ciaran and Barry McGoldrick, while Ruairi Mooney came on late in the game, one of only two subs.     Na Maghas qualier with Ballinasccreen was a total contrast, as they gave Screen the scare of their lives, despite missing top scorer from the league, Tim Rankin. Cathal McDaids side were - to - up at half-time, but had no answer to a resurgent Na Magha side in the third quarter.Michael Lynch and Tomaacutes Lally ran riot from deep, with Deaglan Foley beginning to find his range. It wasnt until the second water break that the momentum began to change. If Na Magha are to launch an assault on the Ulster title, a performance and silverware would be a great start on Sunday.

Reporter: Michael McMullan Oct   addthis, JUNIOR FINALColeraine v Na Magha -Sunday– OwenbegRef: Niall Clford Sundays junior final is a repeat of the  final when Deaglan Foleys point in an inspired second-half display saw city side Na Magha earn a - to - draw. Colm McGoldrick and Niall Holly scored Eoghan Ruas goals in a game that was sandwiched between their drawn football and their replay win that ended the Emmets hopes of clinching five in a row. googletag.cmd.push After winning the Ulster junior in , the Coleraine club werent allowed to compete in the Ulster series until the following year when they won Ulster again in , so it will be Na Magha who will take on the Cavan champions when the provincial series begins at the end of November, Coleraine were on the wrong end of a thumping by Swatragh in this years qualying round, losing - to - with the Davitts also hitting  wides. Liam McGoldrick, currently working in London, was absent. So too are Aidan Boyle, Niall Holly, Ciaran and Barry McGoldrick, while Ruairi Mooney came on late in the game, one of only two subs.     Na Maghas qualier with Ballinasccreen was a total contrast, as they gave Screen the scare of their lives, despite missing top scorer from the league, Tim Rankin. Cathal McDaids side were - to - up at half-time, but had no answer to a resurgent Na Magha side in the third quarter.Michael Lynch and Tomaacutes Lally ran riot from deep, with Deaglan Foley beginning to find his range. It wasnt until the second water break that the momentum began to change. If Na Magha are to launch an assault on the Ulster title, a performance and silverware would be a great start on Sunday.

The scheme is a recycling initiative which he had championed during his time as Environment Minister and has worked to progress in recent years. In response to an Assembly Question tabled by Mr Durkan, the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , Edwin Poots reaffirmed his commitment to introduce the scheme, following the department’s joint consultation with DAERA and the Welsh Government. googletag.cmd.push The Foyle MLA said: “I’m pleased that work is continuing to progress a depositscheme for Northern Ireland. “This is a scheme which began work on during my time as Environment Minister, having seen their benefits in other countries. “Unfortunately, at that time my attempts were met with some resistance, both politically and commercially. “In February , the Executive supported my calls for the introduction of a depositscheme and committed to the North’s participation in a proposed UK-wide rollout. I welcome that the consultation process has been completed and welcome Minister Poots commitment to delivering this scheme and move towards a circular economy.     “While awareness in recent years has improved where recycling is concerned, we are still not at the level we need to be. “A cash incentive under a Deposit Return Scheme, in my opinion, is the best way forward and will encourage an uptake in recycling. “Our throw-away culture is completely unsustainable and our planet is bearing the brunt of it. “In recent years, we have witnessed a growing realisation that action must be taken by governments, businesses and iniduals to address the damage being done to our environment. “I would like to see this scheme expanded to include cans and plastic bottles, building on the success of the carrier bag levy, to tackle the scourge of single use plastic on our communities. “I hope the Minister will revisit an all-island approach for this initiative but for now it is crucial that we push forward on implementing this environmentally transformative scheme without further delay. “ ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Michelle Devine at The Cottage Coffee Shop with their awards Derry NewsDerry cafeacute takes home top prize for best scones in the country overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArrest made in drugs operation linked to INLA in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices -

The two smaller events which instigated numerous social distancing protocols combined to create the largest gathering of tents at a music festival anywhere in Ireland in  and with that experience under their belts, the team behind the multi-award-winning event have decided that the best way to try and get back to normality is to press forward with one larger event for approximately , people. googletag.cmd.push Festival Director Ross Parkhill explained: “Despite the dficulties, the uncertainties and all the additional rules and regulations we had to impose, both events in  went off really well and people really worked incredibly well with us in order to ensure that was the case. “Running two events provided big challenges for us but happily, as always, our amazing team rose to the occasion twice and more people camped at a music festival at Stendhal than anywhere  on the Island of Ireland this year, something we can really be proud of.” Ross continued: “Going forward though, to continue with the model of two smaller events would not be practical for us and we are confident that people are a bit more confident themselves now about ing to large scale outdoor gigs, as witnessed at a number of events in Belfast throughout September.     “With that in mind, with the eradication of social distancing rules for outdoor spaces and with plenty of lessons learned from our events in , we are confident that we canto our usual event set up in  and safely welcome over , patrons to the farm once again.” Super Saver Early bird tickets for Stendhal  will be on sale on October thth at pm and will be available until January th, when the organisers are hoping to make their first batch of line-up announcements. “By moving the event forward by about  weeks we have to hit the ground running,” added Ross, “we also don’t have any major uncertainties aboutwe can run or not next year so expect us to have plenty of info regrading Stendhal  out early in the new year, when we will also be opening our annual artists submission process.” For tickets and more info regarding Stendhal Festival , visit www.stendhalfestival.

Destined operate centres in Derry and in Feeny, with the latter providing much needed services to more rural north Derry community. googletag.cmd.push Its aim is to build empowerment, address social isolation and exclusion and build lelong skills and self-confidence among its members. Fiona, Michael, Tamara, Peter, Owen, George, Kevin, Ryan and Gavin take a break from their cooking to speak to the County Derry Post last week. Through a iety of activities including karaoke, arts and crafts, cooking and gardening, the members have a busy week. Now, through funding provided by Rank Net Foundation under the Time to Shine project, the group are seeking to establish a new centre in north Derry to match their facility in the city. Some of the members spoke to the County Derry Post, and said more space was needed to complete their activities.     Kevin, Peter and Michael relaxing in the kitchen area of the centre in Feeny. “Its too small and we need more space to do our cooking and karaoke activities, and we havent much space for our computers upstairs,” said Tamara. “We could do with new computers too and maybe another sofa. Id love a nail bar to get some pampering done.” Kevin had his eye on a bigger TV. “We need the new centre because this one is too small. We need a bigger kitchen and a bigger TV,” he said. “If you have a bigger building you can space out more people and have better facilities for both children and adults.” Gavin is keen to show off the groups polytunnel outside the centre. George said everything about Destined was enjoyable, but that more space was the main priority. “I enjoy coming here, I like the people and the staff. Id be looking for more outside space as well. I love it here, but we need more room,” he said. A community survey was carried out earlier this month, with over  people taking part. Project Officer Grainne McNickle said the interest showed clearly an increased demand. “This has been an amazing response from the public,” she said. “The findings from this have strengthened the fact that there is an increasing demand for services in the rural areas to cater for everyone not just those with a Learning Disability. Cooking is just one of the activities the members enjoy at Destined. “Destined have been operating out of a small rented unit in Feeny for nearly ten years now and when the pandemic hit the building was deemed unsuitable for use. “A new centre would benefit Destined members, their family members, and will also be a great asset to people living in the surrounding area.” Alongside a consultation process, the group have worked closely with a steering committee of representatives from the Western Trust, local community groups and Rossmar Special School. The committee has completed a mapping exercise of where best to locate the new centre, and will begin the process of applying to potential funders when this is completed.

The proposal will be voted on by members of both branches in the beginning of November.Reporter: Matthew Leslie Oct Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, A proposal to merge both the Derry and Claudy Credit Unions will be voted on by members at the start of next month. In a letter sent to members of Derrys Credit Union, the branchs President, Sean Hegarty, outlined the proposed merger and his reasons as to why this would benefit both unions googletag.cmd.push Earlier this year, the Directors of the Derry Credit Union were approached by their Claudy counterparts requesting a “transfer of engagements” to merge the two unions where the latter would switch its business to Derry. The proposal to members, which will be made at Derry Credit Unions agm on November , will be to vote on rubber-stamping the merger. Claudys members will be asked to do likewise at their own agm  hours later – a majority of members is needed to pass the proposal through. In the letter to his members, Mr Hegarty, wrote: “The merger with Claudy Credit Union will create a larger, well-resourced Derry Credit Union that will serve our combined common bond and reinforce our position as the leading credit union in Northern Ireland and in this region.     “We are excited by the opportunities that this merger will bring to our combined membership. “In coming together, we will broaden and enhance the range of services that we can offer to all our members, including additional online facilities and a wider-range of loan products. “It is you, our members, who will make the ultimate decision regarding this merger. Please take this opportunity to cast your vote and have your say in the future development of the credit union movement in the wider BT and BT postcode areas. “We firmly believe we are stronger together.” Meanwhile, Alliance Party Councillors, Rachael Fergusonand Philip McKinneyhave sent good wishes to the members of Derry and Claudy Credit Unions. “The two credit unions are considering merging together”, the Councillors said in a joint-statement. “Both Boards of Directors have approved a merger and they are recommending it to their members. And Derry Credit Union has already done its due diligence checks. So it looks like this merger will take place.” Cllr Ferguson added: “Derry Credit Union, once claimed to be the largest community-based credit union in the world, is an amazing success story. “It was founded only  years ago by  local people, with combined savings of pound.p – and now has over , members and over pound million of members savings.” Cllr McKinney said: “The whole Credit Union movement is a brilliant self-help story. “It has a proven track record across the world –  million members in over  countries. We wish well the members of Derry and Claudy credit unions in their coming decision.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Michelle Devine at The Cottage Coffee Shop with their awards Derry NewsDerry cafeacute takes home top prize for best scones in the country overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArrest made in drugs operation linked to INLA in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Thursday, st October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police in Derry appeal for anyone who believes they have had their drink spiked last weekend to contact themDerry NewsPolice appealing for anyone who believes they had their drink spiked while out in Derry city-centre last weekend to contact them overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry City super fan - the late Hugh Curran.SoccerCandystripe legends to honour Derry City super fan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Proposals would see Claudy moved from the Foyle to East Derry constituencyCounty Derry PostFoyle to lose Eglinton and Claudy in proposed boundaries shake-up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMurdered County Derry man was victim of alleged assault last year overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsHotel Hero award for County Derry man overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The SDLP social justice spokesperson said timely payment of the Winter Fuel Allowance was crucial this year given rising energy costs and has called for additional support to help low-income households to heat their homes this winter. googletag.cmd.push It was announced earlier this week that gas bills would rise by  per cent with electricity going up by . Mr Durkan said: “The financial consequences borne out of the COVID pandemic are becoming clearer by the day. “Rising energy costs in conjunction with increasing financial precariousness caused by the end of furlough and the Universal Credit uplt, will force many low-income households to choose between heating or eating in the coming months. “It’s clear that a warm home during the winter period is not a luxury afforded to all and I acknowledge that support mechanisms such as the Winter Fuel Payment are in place for the older cohort.     “For those vulnerable people entitled to the Winter Fuel Payment, it will be of immense value this year in particular. “However, they cannot afford the same y delays which plagued the roll-out last year whereby some claimants weren’t receiving this vital payment until February or March. “I have written to the Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey urging her to liaise with the Department for Working Pensions who administer this scheme, to avoid a repeat of last year’s disaster. “She has given assurances that most Winter Fuel Payments will be paid automatically to qualying claimants during November and December, with all payments made by  January . “No-one should ever be left without this cold-weather crutch – this year it will provide a leline for many. “I have also appealed to Minister Hargey to explore a fuel support scheme for struggling households to mitigate against the rising costs of living compounded by the financial implications of the pandemic and cut to Universal Credit. “I understand a bid has been made and discussions have begun with the Utility Regulator and those within the sector to look into additional supports for families here.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Michelle Devine at The Cottage Coffee Shop with their awards Derry NewsDerry cafeacute takes home top prize for best scones in the country overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArrest made in drugs operation linked to INLA in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices -

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.         Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.         The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.         Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

The comments were made during a Government press conference on Tuesday October th, after the announcement of the countrysrevised reopening plan, where Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin confirmed all of the restrictions set to ease from Friday,  October and the restrictions that will remain in place. googletag.cmd.push The pandemic isnt over yet. Unfortunately, were going to have to get through at least another winter before we can safely say that its behind us, Varadkar said at the press conference. The situation took a turn for the worse about two or three weeks ago and since then, weve seen rising case numbers, rising hospitalisations and rising ICU numbers.So, were not where we hoped to be or expected to be for  October... were not past the peak of the Delta wave. Later in the press conference, he said the government would be meeting with unions and employer representatives to update the Work Safely Protocol.     Well have that done over the next couple of days and essentially what were saying is that a staggered and phasedto the office is possible, he explained. So, people going back to the office for a specic business purpose, like a meeting or a training, for example, or inductions - that is allowed. But certainly people who can work from home and want to continue to work from home, their employer should facilitate that. But bear in mind, there are also people whove been working from home with a laptop on a bed for  months now and they really want to get back to the office. Andthat can be facilitated,they can be in an office on their own or in an office where theyre socially distanced from other people, that should be facilitated too.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps.     Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Out  About at Carraig Bar Foam Party  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Michelle Devine at The Cottage Coffee Shop with their awards Derry NewsDerry cafeacute takes home top prize for best scones in the country overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArrest made in drugs operation linked to INLA in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices -

In our society, that there continues to be injustice and inequality in our healthcare system is something that should shock us out of any potential apathy that all is rosy and well.ldquoAs we emerge from the pandemic, this should awaken us to action in a collective effort to take stock of where our health service is and what can be done to bring it to where it needs to be.Mr McGrath said healthcare staff must also be a priority for everyone as, without them, the health system would simply collapse.ldquoWithin the Downe Hospital for instance, we have seen staff moved about and relocated to other hospitals within the South Eastern Trust. And while it is important that the jobs of staff are secure, itrsquos also important that they have a sense of consistency and the opportunity to advance in their careers, he said.ldquoThe sad reality is that many of our staff are now burnt out a result of their work over the past  months. We need to sort out how our healthcare heroes are paid a wage that reflects the work they do and that they have proper working conditions.Mr McGrath said taking a critical look at how the ongoing waiting list is funded is also critically important which he also described as a priority moving forward.ldquoThe simple matter is that people are having to wait too long to see a consultant and the waiting lists are getting ever longer. This cannot go on, he declared.ldquoComing from a rural constituency we need to address how rural healthcare services are delivered and methodologies such as the community pharmacy can be supported in a way that enables them to challenge our rural health care needs.ldquoWhere this concerns the Downe Hospital specically is that it is essential that we have the services that meet the needs of the community. What I hear from people on the ground is that the Downe is ready to play itrsquos role,it was only supported from central government to do so.Mr McGrath said he is also conscious that many people are fearful about the future of GP services and are concerned that they cannot see their doctor.ldquoOur GP services have never been busier and our doctors work all day, every day. But the system is broken and needs to be fixed. There are many issues that are so important and need investigated and enhanced such as mental health, youth mental health, perinatal care, cancer services and more.ldquoAs I take up my partyrsquos health spokesman role, I am fully aware of the responsibility it involves and will now be endeavouring to meet with all of those stakeholder groups who I know will be instrumental in being a part of this. Irsquoll be meeting with the public to hear their thoughts as well.Mr McGrath added: ldquoA post-Covid society offers us many opportunities, but we have to seize them and make them work. The publicrsquos health is my priority and I want to ensure it remains the priority of central government..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20thOctober2021_down.jpg","title":"Downpatrick seal Intermediate title  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK RGU ladies were crowned Senior A Intermediate champions after defeating a resilient Kilcoo side at St Malachyrsquos Park in Castlewellan last Saturday.Two quick-fire goals in the opening five minutes of the contest was enough to give Downpatrick a lead they wouldnrsquot relinquish, despite a second half surge from the Magpies in which they did everything but find that crucial second goal.The Hoops signalled their intention from the initial passage of play, winning the throw-in through the experienced Kiera Turley, before a mazy, uninterrupted run released Orla Quinn to kick over the first point of the match.Downpatrick solidied their victory through one crucial element of the game and that was winning the opposing kick-outs.This was first displayed immediately after they had registered their opening point, when Caoimhe Mulholland rose high above the rest to collect Kilcoo lsquokeeper Siobhan McEvoyrsquos punt upfield to double Downpatrickrsquos lead.McEvoy managed to successfully find a pass at the second time of asking and it wasnrsquot long before team-mate Nicole Johnston saw her effort sail over the crossbar to half the deficit.Johnston was a constant threat all day, with the Hoops backline consistently struggling to cope with her pace.The first signicant score of the tie came just a minute later when Downpatrickrsquos Mulholland found the back of the net in what was a confident and powerful finish.The green and white outfit didnrsquot lose focus and overturned possession from the kick-out. This time it was Eilis Murphy who found her effort crossing the line after evading any resistance the Kilcoo defence had to offer.However, it was not to be plain sailing for Downpatrick, as immediately the Magpies sought to get a foothold on the contest.Kilcoo responded through a Caitriona Kane free, which was a reoccurring theme throughout the match. And one minute later, Kane once again converted from a free as her side began to enter the tie.There was a notable battle between Downpatrickrsquos Turley and Kilcoorsquos Laura Morgan, as the two tussled in what was a case of who wanted control of the possession more.Some neat triangle passing allowed Hoops forward Aisling Flynn to notch her first point of the game, before Adair Trainor overturned possession to release Cara Tumelty, who added further to RGUrsquos tally.Kilcoo displayed their class through Kane after an array of eye-catching passes found its way to the boot of the number , resulting in an applauded point.The scoreline would have been much closer at this stage had it not been for the goalkeeping heroics of player-of-the-match Kirsty Carling, who saved magnicently to deny a certain Magpies goal.Yet again Downpatrick did not allow themselves to be discouraged by the opposition, as Tumelty responded promptly with another point to close the scoring before the first water-break.The Hoops picked up where they left off as Tumelty pointed from a free after the restart, although her next effort just went the wrong side of the posts.Mulholland was in fine form as she dribbled past two opposing Kilcoo players to allow Tumelty to score a trio of unanswered points for her Downpatrick side.With  minutes gone, Kilcoo began ramping up their attacks and were nearly rewarded when Ceallach McEvoy played a lovely weighted pass over the RGU backline to allow Johnston through on goal.Showing the Downpatrick defence a clean pair of heels, Johnston seemed certain to put the ball in the back of the net. But, it was that woman Carling again who pulled off a terric save from point-blank range to a keep daylight between the sides.Mulholland pointed from a free at the other end of the pitch before Kilcoorsquos Kane replied with the same to keep her team present in the contest.The halftime whistle sounded to leave the scores - to - in favour of Downpatrick.It was very much a game of two halves as the teams ed to the pitch after the interval with Kilcoo immediately winning the throw-in before setting off on the charge downfield.Kane kicked over a point from range before Johnston secured another for the black and white outfit.A couple of wides occurred for both sides within the next few minutes, although the weather did take a turn for the worse, with rainfall and windy conditions beginning to increase.Kilcoo continued their onslaught with a Morgan point from open play, as Downpatrickrsquos Flynn saw her effort drt narrowly off the mark. But theMagpies continued their pressure and were soon awarded with a free  metres from goal.Dearbhla McGreevyrsquos effort ped just under the crossbar and was now causing all sorts of bother for Downpatrickrsquos Carling.The Hoopsrsquo number one watched the shot all of the way but could only slap the ball into the path of the onrushing Ceallach McEvoy, who bundled it over the line in the last piece of action before the second water-break.A terric  minutes for the Magpies meant that there was just a single goal separating the sides in the last quarter with the score - to - in favour of the Hoops.There was now a tense atmosphere both from the players on the pitch and the surrounding supporters, who had turned out to watch the final.Downpatrick goalscorer Murphy kicked over a point to finally get her side off the mark in the second half, although this was promptly answered with a fine solo point from the ever-present Johnston.As the clock ticked down, the tie was still very much in the balance when Tumelty registered another point to add to her impressive personal tally.With one last throw of the dice, Kilcoo charged down the pitch but was met with a plethora of green and white shirts who forced Kane to shoot from distance and settle for the point.That signalled the last score of the game as the final whistle was blown to cue pandemonium from the Downpatrick outfit and their management team.After the match, Downpatrick joint senior ladiesrsquo manager J R Loudon reflected on his sidersquos performance and season as a whole.ldquoItrsquos unbelievable, we took these girls way back in February and this was their end goal, he said. ldquoTheyrsquore a great bunch and we have a  of around  to  players. The feeling in the club as a whole at the minute is fantastic.ldquoMost of these girls are of minor age as wersquove lost a lot of our more experienced players to other commitments, so what they have achieved is remarkable.The manager added: ldquoWe knew Kilcoo were going to play using a sweeper, so we wanted to force their lsquokeeper into a long kick out that we were confident we would win. That game was won on the training ground.Kilcoo: S McEvoy, L Devlin, C McEvoy, C McClean, C McEvoy, E McEvoy, M Rogan, L Morgan, D McGreevy, R Doherty, C Kane, S Fettes, E Doyle, K Laverty, N Johnston.Subs: B McAneney, C McCrickard, C OrsquoRourke, C McEvoy Ireland, N OrsquoReilly, S McAneney, K Greenan, K McEvoy.Downpatrick: K Carling, C McKervey, O Boyle, O Beattie, N Loudon, A Trainor, V Scullion, K Turley, P Smyth, O Quinn, C Mulholland, K Convie, E Murphy, A Flynn, C Tumelty.Subs: M Shannon, R Trainor, A Doran, S Sloan, K McLeigh, G Scullion, N Madine, A Murphy, E McIlmurry, M Kelly, S Rice, K Trainor, M Ross..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20thOctober2021_cd.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C October 24%2C 2001  ","story":"BISHOPSCOURT ndash The sale of Bishopscourt Motor Racing Circuit should be clinched later today.It has also been confirmed that the sprawling track, which was put on the market at the start of the month, will remain a race circuit.Yesterday afternoon the circuitrsquos current owners, David Beattie and John Gfin, were locked in crucial talks with potential owner, Jim OrsquoBrien from Newry, in a bid to finalise the deal.Although the going price for the circuit has not yet been confirmed it is believed the final bid may be in the region of half a million pounds.Last month the Northern Bank changed the locks on the gates of the major complex after months of intense speculation surround its future.

This is just one of a number of similar incidents against council staff which have taken place in the area over the past few months.It is believed the people responsible for the recent attacks are members of a teen gang that has been running havoc in the village since before the summer.The same gang has been blamed for the brutal killing of a cat, which was burnt alive in the village last month. Its burnt carcass was left on display with a beer can between its paws and a cigarette in its mouth.One local resident recently claimed that people in the village are living in fear of the gang that continues to vandalise and destroy property in the village.

Today, the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee is due to endorse a plannersrsquo recommendation to give permission for four new homes to be built on a quarter acre sloping site it owns at one of Killyleaghrsquos biggest housing developments.Council officials have earmarked a strip of open space land in front of homes at Grove Gardens at the Kerry estate located off the Downpatrick Road for the new homes.Ten letters and one petition objecting to the proposal were submitted to planners with the scheme part of the local authorityrsquos plan to sell off surplus land and buildings it owns across the district to generate cash.While the council does not build homes, residents opposed to its plan believe that the local authority is seeking planning approval which will signicantly increase the value of the land which it can then sell to the highest bidder.The plannersrsquo recommendation to grant outline permission for the land at Grove Gardens has angered residents and Rowallane councillor Billy Walker.It was confirmed earlier this year that none of the statutory agencies consulted about the proposal had objections, with the local authority pointing to the need for additional social housing in Killyleagh and a lack of available land to build new homes .In addition, the council contends that redeveloping the small portion of land at Grove Gardens would have ldquominimal impact on existing open space land and that the housing proposal will improve the estate physically and the attractiveness of Grove Gardens, ldquoproviding a quality and sustainable residential environment, better parking provision, a new vehicle turning area, additional footpaths and wider roadway.However, itrsquos a view not shared by residents or Cllr Walker who lives in nearby Grove Park.He said while arguments not to develop the land have failed, he is encouraging residents to object to any subsequent planning applications for full permission which will inevitably be forthcoming.ldquoThe case has been made by residents and myself that this piece of ground is simply not suitable for four homes, but planners disagree with us which is disappointing, he continued. ldquoWhile opposed to this proposal, I remain a passionate supporter of social housing and have worked alongside others to provide much-needed new accommodation and identy potential development sites.ldquoWhat we are talking about here is a proposal to make Newry, Mourne and Down Council a quick buck. This particular area of land is not suitable for social housing. I have no doubt thatan application to build private homes at this part of Killyleagh it would be refused.The Rowallane politician said while social housing provision is ldquoabsolutely critical given recent news that there are , people across the district looking for homes, the Grove Gardens site is inappropriate.He said that several years ago, along with Strangford MP Jim Shannon, the pair were able to persuade roads officials to widen the road in front of existing homes at Grove Gardens to ensure emergency vehicles could gain access.Cllr Walker said while the local authorityrsquos outline planning application will be rubber-stamped later today, there is still some way to go before builders can move on site. He added: ldquoExisting homes at Grove Gardens would overlook the planned four semi-detached properties and I believe there is an issue in relation to peoplersquos privacy. Clearly, the planners donrsquot agree with me.ldquoI remain perplexed that planners view a piece of sloping ground as suitable for new housing. It is not in my opinion and, along with residents, I do not support to this proposal. There are more appropriate sites in my opinion..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/portaferry(1).jpg","title":"Preservation order could help save trees  ","story":"A PRESERVATION order from the Department of Infrastructure may save trees earmarked for removal to build a new car and coach car park at the Exploris aquarium in Portaferry. A local campaign group mdash Portaferry Stop The Chop mdash applied for a tree preservation orderafter Ards and North Down Council rejected their alternative plans which would have reduced the number of planned parking spaces by nine, but saved most of the mature trees.The Department for Infrastructure confirmed this week that it is considering whether or not to make a TPO to protect trees, with a spokesman confirming that before deciding the matter, the Department must first consult with the local authority.ldquoFollowing formal consultation, the Department is now awaiting the views of council, the spokesman added.The matter will be discussed at the full council meeting next Wednesday with the organisation planning to invest pound, to clear the Portaferry site in order to create a new car and coach car park, new toilets, paths and lighting improvements in the Ropewalk area.The project aims to provide improved facilities for visitors to Exploris and the village and is viewed as a much-needed improvement in the wake of the planned poundm aquarium at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast. This proposal will mean that Exploris will no longer be the only aquarium in Northern Ireland.The new car-park, which has received funding from the Department for Infrastructure, should have been completed by November, but the council succeeded in getting an extension to the funding until January. However, Cathie McKimm from the campaign group, claimed that the council had wrongly given itself approval to remove the trees.ldquoThe council had not done environmental screening in its plans, which they are now doing and gave themselves unlawful permission to chop down the trees, she explained.ldquoWhen we wrote to the DfI, the planning headquarters wrote back to say that under the new legislation introduced in  when responsibility for planning transferred to councils, Ards and North Down was not allowed to give itself permission to chop down trees on land that it owned in a conversation area.She said that the council applied on September  to remove the trees which was followed up by the campaigners applying for the TPO.ldquoAll we know is that the trees are not saved yet, the original proposal is still on the table, said Ms McKimm.ldquoI have no confidence in this council to listen to what the community wants. Nearly , people signed a petition against this proposal and we reckon  per cent of those are from the Ards and North Down Council area.The group held a free concert, headlined by musician Colum Sands, at Portaferry Community Centre last Sunday in order to raise more public awareness of their concerns for the trees.Last year, the Co Down songwriterrsquos story-poem about the award-winning Invisible Tree of Rostrevor Oakwood, was given voice by neighbours and environmental campaigners aged from nine to  in the short film, Rhyme for Justice .Ards poet, Moyra Donaldson, wrote a poem for the  trees at Portaferry which was read out at the event, along with other poetry inspired by the local area.Lily Devlin, who started the campaign to save the tree, said that she and other campaigners in Portaferry have been ldquohumbled and inspired by the great support they have received in their campaign to save the trees, not just from local people and those from the Borough, but from all around the world.Speaking on behalf of the group she said: ldquoOver , people have now signed our petition mdash a testimony to the strength of opposition to the plans to destroy beautul trees in the heart of our historic town, for a car park, of all things.ldquoWersquove been trying as best we can to reason with the council over this absurd decision and get it to reconsider its plans but, to date, it has not taken its proposal to fell  trees for new parking off the table.A council spokeswoman confirmed that an updated report on the Portaferry Ropewalk Improvement Scheme will be brought to the full meeting next Wednesday and will include consideration of the Department for Infrastructurersquos proposals for a TPO in the area.She stressed that the council had not been aware of the need to get planning permission from the DfI for the removal of the trees until August.ldquoThis legislation had not been referenced by DfI Planning in any previous correspondence with the council about the proposed Scheme, she said. ldquoThe legislation requires the council to gain consent from DfI Planning for works carried out to any trees on land owned by the Council and within a conservation area.ldquoThis is anomalous with the Scheme of Delegation that DfI Planning has already approved for the council in relation to the decisions the Planning Committee can determine. However, having sought legal advice, the council has applied to DfI Planning for consent.The spokeswoman said that as per the councilrsquos standard procedures, the agenda for the meeting and a copy of the updated report will be available to the public on the councilrsquos website within  hours of them being made available to elected members..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Saintfield getting in bloom  ","story":"SAINTFIELD has again been recognised for its floral excellence after picking up third spot in the large village category at this yearrsquos Ulster in Bloom competition.Now in its rd year and sponsored by Translink, the transport companyrsquos Market Street base in Downpatrick came third in the bus station category.The annual awards celebrate the fantastic work of green-fingered gardening enthusiasts across the country, with the much-loved annual horticultural, environmental and community competition officially recognising the most beautul plant and floral displays across cities, towns and villages.Translink chairman, Michael Wardlow, said the company is proud of its long-standing role in Ulster in Bloom and it was great to see the competition grow each year, with  entries representing all local council areas as well as  bus and train stations entering this year.ldquoIt is heartening to see such fantastic demonstrations of community spirit in action, especially given the challenging times everyone has experienced, he continued.ldquoThese awards clearly highlight the pride so many have for their local areas.

In the absence of both John Donnan and James Simpson, Bradley Luney started in the second row and Jack Milligan came in at out half with Greg Hutley moving into midfield to cover the loss of Tagen Strydom.Shane Ball and Paddy Wright swapped positions as Adam Craig and his coaching team searched for the right formula in attack.Trinity were fresh off a demolition of UCD in the colours match and were able to choose from a full squad with Leinsterrsquos Liam Turner in midfield and highly regarded Ulster Academy prospect Harry Sheridan in the second row.Leinster senior squad regular Jack Dunne continued his rehab from injury with a place on the Trinity bench.Ballynahinch started badly with handling errors and a misfiring line-out inviting pressure.Despite some high quality scramble defence, they found themselves seven points down after a series of Trinity carries pinned them on their own line and quick hands and some good footwork took Max Faria over for a converted try.This was compounded by the loss of Milligan and prop Ben Cullen to injury.Another excellent defensive set allowed Ballynahinch time to dig in and they began to take the game to the students as the half wore on.A strong maul earned them a penalty on  minutes which Hutley knocked over from  metres to get his side on the board.Turner made a brilliant break just before half time but more superb scrambling kept the half time deficit at just four points.Ballynahinch had much the better of the opening exchanges of the second half and after going close to scoring a try, another Hutley penalty left the game delicately balanced.Turner then stamped his class on proceedings with a superb outside break on the Ballynahinch -metre line, opening up the defence for winger Marcus Kiely to score. Trinity then turned up the heat in the forwards and sealed the result with a close range try from a fine line-out move involving Dunne and Sheridan in the st minute.Thirteen points down with  minutes to go, Ballynahinch could have folded but they gamely stuck to their task and showed all their fighting spirit by attacking the Trinity line.They were rewarded with a try from Hutley on the gamersquos final play as he exploited the numerical advantage in the Trinity backline following a yellow card. He then calmly knocked over the conversion to salvage a point for his side.Despite opening with three defeats, Ballynahinch have shown improvement with each match and will be confident that they can soonto winning ways.They have a week off to regroup and rehab some injured players before the visit of table-topping Garryowen to Ballymacarn Park on October .Ballynahinch: B Cullen, T Stewart, K McCall, T Donnan, B Luney, Z McCall, O Loughead, C Irvine, C Gibson, J Milligan, A Cairns, G Hutley, R Wilson, P Wright, S Ball, J Hanlon, H Simpson, T Martin, D Souza, C McAuley, R Patterson..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"UUP selects Macauley to contest Assembly election  ","story":"THE Ulster Unionist Party has selected Jill Macauley to contest next yearrsquos South Down Assembly election.A former Newry, Mourne and Down councillor, Mrs Macauley has secured the backing of her party and received a ringing endorsement from leader Doug Beattie.Mrs Macauley mdash who is a member of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Council mdash said she is ldquodelighted to have secured her partyrsquos nomination to contest one of the five seats up for grabs.At the  Assembly election, Harold McKee was the UUP flag bearer and polled , votes, with the party confident that it can make a serious push for a seat when voters go to the polls next May.Based in Rathfriland, Mrs Macauley is one of the UUPrsquos most senior figures and having served as a councillor in two local authority areas, she now feels the time is right to ldquostep up and give the electorate of South Down a chance for change and a chance for positive and hardworking -pro-Union representation at Stormont.She described her work as a local representative as a ldquoprivilege, allowing her to meet and work with ldquosome wonderful people and great organisations within the constituency who do sterling work to support local communities and those most in need.Mrs Macauley revealed she has been working hard over recent months to grow the local UUP membership and said the optimism and resolve for a ldquomore confident and inclusive unionism has allowed her to continue working effectively with her party colleagues on a range of issues.She said these included the childrenrsquos funeral fund, transfer test, school unorm costs, disability and special educational needs improvement and period poverty.ldquoWe have a fantastic hardworking team of local councillors, working on the ground, always accessible and working for the greater good of local people, said the Assembly candidate.ldquoI want to thank my fellow councillors for the help and support they have given me thus far and encouraging me to step forward for election to the Assembly and the opportunity to lead our local team, as we strive to continue to be the strongest voice for Unionism right across South Down.Mrs Macauley said she hopes to prove that she is on their side and will be a strong voice for positive, confident Unionism.She added: ldquoFrom Katesbridge to Kilkeel and from Warrenpoint to St Johns Point, I have a bold, positive, ambitious vision for our people of South Down and am prepared to work with anyone to make that a reality.ldquoFor too long, we have been trapped in a perpetual cycle of fear and ision, resulting in every election becoming a constitutional show of strength rather than a mandate for socio-economic change. Change that we so desperately need.Mr Beattie said that when he became party leader he made two pledges, including bringing more women into the party and reaching out into rural communities to give a  to those from the community to speak on its behalf.ldquoWho better to do that than Jill Macauley, he continued. ldquoA woman who lives and breathes her community and I am delighted that she has agreed to take on the role of our South Down Assembly election candidate.ldquoAs a mum and businesswoman, Jill is tuned into the community and the needs of local businesses, the vital fishing and farming industries, economic tourism potential as well as the complex needs of young families.Mr Beattie said Mrs Macauley has a proven track record of working hard for the electorate and has no doubt she will offer an ldquoauthentic voice for the pro-Union voters of South Down. He added: ldquoThe Ulster Unionist Party is changing, and for the better.

Please try again later.Submitting...Emotional states, as any psychologist knows, grossly distort perceptions of reality.They are easy to manipulate via modern media and spin, whilst reason and rationality require scientic discipline and mental rigour.Woke issues are media-friendly precisely because they have emotional impact, and because the media are dominated by woke educated arts and humanities folk who lack real ‘scientic’ training.Further, most media folk are middle class, and woke issues don’t threaten their materially-comfortable lestyles.Thus banning speakers, political correctness, and emotional outrage don’t involve paying higher taxes to resource practical real solutions for example, providing better healthcare, welfare, or social services – things that really and inclusively help all races and creeds.One can still have a second home in France and feel emotionally good by being politically correct.Woke issues often do exist, like racial inequality, but their understanding of them and proposed solutions are infantile and downright dangerous - like, for example, where curbs on freedom of speech are concerned.They also ignore white inequalities, like working class deprivation in ‘post-industrial’ society, making working people feel bitter – hence Labour’s drubbing in Northern England.Yet the flight of the Left from reason has rational explanations, e.g. the collapse of the Soviet Bloc founded on Marx’s Enlightenment ideal of scientic socialism.The Left sought a quick alternative and found it in sloppy ‘touchy-feely’ politics, instant emotive issues, and symbolic gestures like toppling statues or political correctness.Marx would have scorned such empty, gesturing fools.Modern society is frequently unjust and re with real socio-economic and political problems, but the solutions lie in painstaking, tedious analysis and long-term planning, resources and delivery systems, not grand posturing.In such a world there is a serious need for a Left to challenge greedy self-interest - doing this is even fundamental to a liberal democratic society.Here, Ulster’s heritage could provide a template. Modern economics and Enlightenment thought actually has its roots in the Ulster moral philosopher Francis Hutcheson‘Father of the Scottish Enlightenment’ and man who taught Adam Smitheconomics .Both men were moral philosophers who would never advocate greedy self-interest.They saw the greatest virtue and happiness in dong good for ones community and fellow man .What Hutcheson taught Smith was that by removing articial constraints, from race to socio-economic disadvantage, over an inidual’s ability to develop their talents to the full enabled men to make a greater contribution to their community and fellow men.This Enlightened, moral dimension of market economicsis usually ignored.But it represents an ‘old’ Left critique of market economics, something which requires the rationality and reason of a disciplined mind - which modern woke-ism now eschews for emotive gestures.• James Dingley is a former international lecturer and NATO Instructor on terrorism and editor of: Combating Terrorism in Northern IrelandMore News Letter letters and opinion at this link——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The party’s previous stance was confusing with regard to north-south but it has made the right call in toughening its position. East-west connections have been trashed. A trade barrier so major has been put in the Irish Sea that the UK itself is trying to overhaul the protocol it agreed. London is rightly pointing out that this was agreed while its hand was tied by parliament. Let us hope that it maintains this tough stance.The other wider issue that deserves examination is legal costs in Northern Ireland. To a remarkable extent, government actions in the province are challenged in the courts, at great expense, often funded by legal aid.This Conservative government had said that it wanted to curb the ability of the courts to constrain elected governments, as well it should.So here are two issues on which the government could do what it says it wants to do.First, give whatever moral support it can to the DUP in the party’s attempt, via a north-south boycott, to respond to the damage to the  Belfast Agreement, a deal which the government is citing in its efforts to reform the protocol.Second, to pay particular attention to the wider matter of use of judicial review in NI, and its immense cost.LondonDUPBelfastNorthern IrelandIrish Sea  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularUnionists clash with Irish senators at Stormont over Brexit and NI protocolGAA breaks silence after seven days to explain how dissident republican parade linked to Lyra McKee was able to use club grounds‘Hurt and offence’ caused by former IRA man promoting business in town he bombedArmagh centenary service: dissidents denounce British ‘genocide’ and anti-abortionists slam churches themselvesSinn Fein blocks illumination of Belfast City Hall tonight to mark the Northern Ireland CentenaryMost PopularEastwood brands himself a republican as he hits back at church service criticsArmagh centenary service: ‘St Patrick had every reason to hate the Irish – but he didn’t’Stephen Nolan issues open invite to trangender lobbyists amid explosion of anger at his BBC investigationSinn Fein’s ‘bigotry’ slammed after party achieves black out at Belfast City Hall and Stormont while rest of UK lights up for NI CentenaryFather Ted creator Graham Linehan brands PSNI ‘homophobic’ over pursuit of Lurgan lesbian                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

These burrows were once part of a huge dune system that stretched all the way from the River Ogmore to the Gower peninsula and this area along with Kenfig is classed as a Site of Special Scientic Interest.With the dogs racing ahead enjoying their adventure and freedom, the narrow sandy paths adorned in places by the pretty Michaelmas-daisy led them through the burrows before turning southwards towards the coast.Reaching Kenfig Sands where the tide was on the ebb there were fantastic views south westwards towards Jersey Marine, Swansea Bay, Mumbles and Gower beyond as they settled down utilising washed up tree trunks as seating for morning refreshments in warm sunshine with a welcome breeze.Returning onto the coast path above the beach the group made their way eastwards to reach Sker Point with its fantastic long-distance views back across Kenfig Sands, spoiled only by the industrial smoke and buildings of Port Talbot Steelworks.Following the coastline soon the yellow painted Sker House came into view which signalled their lunch stop overlooking Sker Rocks which was the setting on April , , when the Samtampa a former Liberty ship was making its way up the Bristol Channel towards Newport in a south westerly gale. Developing an engine fault, the captain dropped anchor so repairs could begin, but the weather worsened to hurricane force winds, the ship slipped its anchor and was driven onto Sker Rocks. Mumbles leboat was launched to try to save the crew, but the Samtampa began to break up and all  of its crew drowned, along with the eight volunteer crew members of the Mumbles leboat which was later found upside down and smashed to pieces.     Continuing along the coast path with views across Rest Bay to Locks Common in Porthcawl and reaching the western perimeter of the Royal Porthcawl Golf Club, they ventured inland following a narrow path between fences, with a field of beautul Welsh Black cattle as the heat rose, before an open field brought them through a gate into Nottage.A short journey along the busy and fast-moving West Road brought them to a rough track opposite Parc Newydd Farm, which led them to overlook the impressive, imposing and dramatic Grade One listed Sker House, which was originally founded by the Cistercian monks of Neath as one of five farms or granges to support Neath Abbey. The house was remodelled by the Turberville family in the mid-th century after which it was tenanted and then sold to the Williams family in the late th century.This was when the romantic, heart rendering story of the lsquoMaid of Skerrsquo began involving Elizabeth Williams, an attractive young lady who loved to dance in the old Town Hall above the Prince of Wales Inn at Kenfig, where the music was supplied by a harpist.One evening the harpist was Thomas Evans and upon meeting they were smitten and fell in love.

We have had great success with online bridge during the pandemic, but now we have reopened for Face-to-Face bridge our numbers are too small to be viable.Please come and support this historic club. However, letrsquos be positive. We are exploring merging our Tuesday and Friday evening sessions with another club.And,all fails, we will resume online bridge. Penarth Bridge Club will live on!So, here is a recent hand played at a Face-to-Face session where careful judgment by both declarer and the defence were required to achieve the optimum result.The AuctionNorth had seven spades and just seven points, ideal for a pre-emptive opening of three spades. The aim of pre-emptive bids is to put a spanner in the wheel of the defence.However, the danger always is that, as here, your partner has a good hand and so has a dficult decision to make on whether to pass or bid on for game. After some thought, South could see at least six spade tricks, evenhis partner did not have the king of spades.There were also two certain heart tricks, and it ought to be possible to rustle up a trick in diamonds and one more from Northrsquos hand. So, South bid four spades.The playTrick  ndash East was on lead and did not fancy a diamond or a club. And the jack of hearts lead was fraught with danger. So, interestingly, East chose to lead the five of spades, reasoning that his king was safe for a trickNorth held the ace.     And evenSouth held three spades to the ace, North must surely have an entry somewhere to take the spade finesse. Anyway, declarer paused to consider the hand.Without the trump lead the contract would have been secure as he could have ruffed a losing club in dummy. But now things were dficult.North decided to play the ace of spades, hoping to drop a singleton king in Westrsquos hand. But no luck. Tricks  and  ndash Declarer then played a club to his ace, followed by a small club from hand, the trick being won by Eastrsquos king.East was now quite pleased he had decided to lead a trump at the first trick. Trick  - East won the next trick with the king of spades, preventing declarer from ruffing his losing club.Trick  ndash East then led his ace of diamonds, which was ruffed by declarer in hand. Trick  ndash Declarer drew Eastrsquos last trump with his queen, discarding a heart from dummy. But he could now see he still had a losing club and a losing heart, one down, having already lost two tricks.But could there be a squeeze on  Tricks , ,  and  ndash Declarer then rattled off his last four spades, forcing four discards from both East and West. East could see that dummy had to discard before West, so he jettisoned his remaining four diamonds, keeping the jack of clubs and two hearts.Declarer decided to discard one more heart and the rest of dummyrsquos diamonds. West had to hope his partner East held the jack of clubs, otherwise he was genuinely squeezed. So, he discarded the rest of his clubs, keeping his three hearts to the queen.Declarer then played a small heart to dummyrsquos ace. He followed this with the king of hearts. Bad luck, Eastrsquos jack dropped but not Westrsquos queen. Trick  - West then won the last trick with his queen of hearts, declarer only making nine tricks - six spades, two hearts, and one club, one down for a loss of  points.Four spades was a perfectly reasonable bid by South. But well done by the defence for the opening lead and care in their discards.What have we learnt . areful judgement is needed when responding to partnerrsquos opening pre-emptive bid, particularly when non vulnerable, since the pre-emptive bid is likely to be quite weak.. Sometimes it can quite be safe to lead a trump from three to king, as here.Penarth club resultsFriday  October: . Joy Seculer and Mike Downey. Peter Craig and Sean Macdougall.

NormandierCouncillor Neil Thomas, a former governor at Evenlode, said: ldquoOne problem was the transition from Bute Cottage to Evenlode, because Bute Cottage was using dferent reading and numeracy schemes from Evenlode. It was a source of irritation for the reception teachers that they had to basically reteach the children to fit into the new schemes.ldquoThis change should improve that situation, because yoursquore not going to get that conflict of schemes.ldquoTherersquos a lot of misinformation going around, and therersquos a lot on social media saying that the Bute Cottage site is going to be closed and developed, and the open area next to it is going to become a building site. None of which is referred to in this report and all of which has been denied.ldquoTheyrsquore alleging that there are plans to move Bute Cottage physically and rebuild it on the grounds of Evenlodemdashagain that is something expressly ruled out. But thatrsquos something being put out on social media, and Irsquom wonderingthatrsquos for political reasons to stir up anxiety and worry among the community. There are no such plans in place.As part of the public consultation, a cabinet report was published describing the merger plans in detail. According to Cllr Gordon Kemp, chair of the scrutiny committee, some of the concerns could be caused by people not reading that -page report in full.He said: ldquoI think part of the problem with the original cabinet report was the reference that they would remain in the same buildings was tucked away in the report. It wasnrsquot there right at the beginning, and perhaps some people donrsquot read as far as they should, unfortunately.However, the cabinet report, towards the end, discussed how the council would indeed consider relocating the nursery. It said: ldquoShould the proposals be approved, the council would prioritise relocating nursery provision at Evenlode Primary School onto a single site.The report added the council would first assess the feasibility of the relocation, and would then also consult the public before any changes.Cllr Lis Burnett, cabinet member for education and regeneration, denied there were any plans to relocate the nursery. But she added the council would ldquoprobably exploreit were possible.She said: ldquoThere are no plans to change the sites of either the nursery schools. There is a small section in the consultation document that says that there would be feasibility work undertaken to see whether or not there should be a move over to the Evenlode site. Itrsquos one of those things where yoursquore damnedyou do and damnedyou donrsquot.ldquoIf we hadnrsquot put anything in and somebody had said lsquowhat are you going to do about moving to one sitersquo, we would say wersquoll probably do some feasibility work on it to see whether or not itrsquos an option. Butwe put it in, then itrsquos a done deal. Itrsquos not a done deal.ldquoI really donrsquot know how you could build a separate nursery on the Evenlode site, but thatrsquos my personal view. Butthat feasibility work proved that it were possible, then you would have to go right the way back to another consultation. This is purely about amalgamating management and governance s within the schools.The consultation runs until November  and details of the plans can be found on the councilrsquos website. If approved, the mergers would take effect from September . The two nurseries are currently some of the last remaining standalone nurseries across the Vale. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Despite having a panic attack so severe she thought it was a heart attack and calling an ambulance she didnrsquot ask for help.By , at the age of , she hit ldquorock bottom ndash she was emotionally numb, she couldnrsquot be bothered to shower or get dressed.ldquoI didnrsquot really know what I wanted from le, so had no compass, said Ms Hall.ldquoI wasnrsquot taking enough time to look after myself and got caught up in the pressures of work to the extent that they became all consuming.     Ms Hall is in a better place mentally now and is a self-development coach and speaker. Two years after her breakdown, she set up her own business, ran the London Marathon to raise money for the charity Mind and she is a volunteer director for Mind Cymru.She also started writing as a cathartic exercise but, upon realising she could help others, decided to write a book: Making Sense of Me: Nothing Changes Until I Change - A Guide to a Resilient Le at Home and at Work.ldquoThe book is a combination of my personal story and insights from neuroscience to help people cope with, manage and bounce back from burnout, said Ms Hall.ldquoI still have my ups and downs, like anyone , but I feel like I am the one in charge of me. I still get tired and fed up, but the dference now is that I know when Irsquom reaching the tipping point between wellness and illness.ldquoI know when I need to stop and restore my energy levels. I have learnt that health and self-care come first. Without that nothing  happens anyway.Ms Hall now takes time to be mindful and enjoy time with her daughters. She values her loved ones more than ever before and ndash although shersquos still passionate about her work ndash knows ldquowhen it has to come second.OTHER NEWS:ldquoI donrsquot derive my sense of achievement and wellbeing from others anymore ndash I get that from me, said Ms Hall.ldquoI hope people who read my book know that it is okay not to be okay whoever you are and whatever your circumstances.ldquoDonrsquot let pride or fear of failure prevent you from taking action to help yourself. You need to understand who you are before you can change anything my book talks about awareness, acceptance, and action.ldquoIf you understand yourself ndash who you are and why you respond to le the way you do ndash then you can choose to change and respond dferentlyyou want to.ldquoI had the choice to stay where I was or get better: I chose to get better.ldquoThank you to anyone who reads the book.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
