Photograph:  Conor McKeownCharlie Bird and his supporters reached the summit of Croagh Patrick in Co Mayo\u0026nbspon Saturday afternoon\u0026nbspin an effort to raise funds for the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association and suicide charity Pieta.Tens of thousands of people took part in almost 200 Climb with Charlie fundraisers across the world, according to organisers.The charity campaign, led by the broadcaster Mr Bird (72) who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease last year, has already raised more than €1.5 million.Among those who took to the Reek on Saturday morning were Mr Bird’s wife, Claire, daughters, Orla and Neasa, and five grandchildren, as well as singer Daniel O’Donnell, Matt Molloy of the Chieftains, boxer Barry McGuigan and the Late Late Show host Ryan Tubridy.In a tweet on Saturday morning, President Michael D Higgins sent “every good wish and warmest support” to Mr Bird.He said: “Charlie’s strength and dignity over recent months has been a source of true inspiration to people across Ireland and beyond. I know that the public will be with him every step of the way.”Separate Climb with Charlie events were also planned across the world, in countries such as the United States, South Africa, Australia and Spain.Other climbs included a 17.5km hike up Mount Cooke in Western Australia, a 700m-high climb up Ben Gorm in Co Mayo, a 6km night-time trek from Glenmore to Barnavave peak (350m) in Co Louth, and a 494m-high hike up Cnoc Bulaba.The journey up Croagh Patrick began at 9.30am on Saturday from the mountain’s base in Westport, Co Mayo.Temperatures were expected to range between seven degrees in the east and about 10 degrees in the west “and as we climb of course it will be colder”.“I have no idea how many people are going to scale the Reek with me, but I feel it is going to be a day like no other,” he added.Mr Bird made a speech to his supporters and lit five candles in the church at the summit of the mountain one for his friend Vicky Phelan, one for people suffering a terminal illness, one for anyone in a dark place with their mental health, one for everyone involved in the fight against Covid and one for the people of Ukraine.The Climb with Charlie campaign is still accepting donations on www.climbwithcharlie.ie for the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association and Pieta.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"i have found peace says charlie bird amid outpouring of public support","story":"Charlie Bird: ‘I’m not as afraid now as I was when I first got my diagnosis because I have my family around me.’ Photograph: Aidan Crawley“I have found peace, I really have,” he said of coping with his condition. “I cried every day. I don’t cry now.”Mr Bird, a veteran journalist and broadcaster, made his diagnosis public last October saying he had been given a maximum of three years to live.Since then, he explained, a flood of letters and cards from members of the public, many of whom would have watched him on their television screens over the years, had helped him adjust to his new reality.On Friday he told Late Late Show presenter Ryan Tubridy of his plans to lead a group of climbers to Co Mayo’s Croagh Patrick in April to raise money for the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association and Pieta House charities, and to send a message of encouragement to anyone else coping with a terminal diagnosis.His mission, under the banner Climb With Charlie, has been backed by a host of well known figures – former president Mary McAleese, architect Dermot Bannon, and retired GAA commentator Mícheál Ó Muircheartaigh among them – who have vowed to join him or encourage others to undertake similar efforts elsewhere on the day.Mr Bird was due to be joined by cervical cancer campaigner Vicky Phelan whom he recently met with, but she was too ill to attend, instead sending a pre-recorded message to the show.“The support of the public around the country has lifted me like nothing else,” Mr Bird said, his voice clearly deteriorating as a consequence of his condition.He spoke of receiving letters “out the door, mass cards everything. It has been unbelievable. And in a way Ryan it has lifted me even spiritually if you understand”.Noting that people had been climbing Croagh Patrick for 1,500 years, he said it could mark the end of his own journey.“And in one sense – I mean this – I’m not as afraid now as I was when I first got my diagnosis because I have my family around me.”Mr Bird was joined by his wife Claire, daughters Orla and Neasa, and his dog Tiger who spent the initial part of his interview on his lap. One unforeseen advantage from almost four decades of broadcasting is that years of recordings of Mr Bird’s famous voice were available to a specialist company who have “banked” it and synthisised it in the event he eventually loses the ability to speak.Details of how to participate in April’s event are available at climbwithcharlie.ie and Mr Bird is hoping it will raise significant funding for motor neurone disease research.“We need to raise money … to try and save somebody’s life,” he said. “It may not save mine, it won’t, but we need to do research to try and save other people.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"hungarians head to polls in closest election since orb%C3%A1n came to power","story":"A woman in Budapest casts her vote during Hungary’s general election and national referendum on the child protection law. Photograph: Zoltan BaloghEPAPolls opened across Hungary early on Sunday as voters faced a choice: take a chance on a erse, Western-looking coalition of opposition parties, or grant nationalist prime minister Viktor Orbán a renewed mandate with a fourth consecutive term in office.The contest is expected to be the closest since Mr Orbán came to power in 2010, thanks to Hungary’s six main opposition parties putting aside ideological differences to form a united front against his right-wing Fidesz party.Recent polls suggest a tight race but give Fidesz a slight lead, making it likely that undecided voters will determine the winner in Sunday’s vote.Opposition parties and international observers have pointed out structural impediments to defeating Mr Orbán by electoral means, highlighting pervasive pro-government bias in the public media, domination of commercial news outlets by Orbán allies, and a heavily gerrymandered electoral map.However, despite what it calls an uneven playing field, the six-party opposition coalition, United For Hungary, has asked voters to support its efforts to introduce a new political culture in the country based on pluralistic governance and mended alliances with the European Union and Nato. The coalition’s candidate for prime minister, Peter Marki-Zay, has promised to bring an end to what he alleges is rampant government corruption, and to raise living standards by increasing funding to Hungary’s ailing healthcare and education systems.Mr Orbán – a fierce critic of immigration, LGBTQ rights and “EU bureaucrats” – has garnered the admiration of right-wing nationalists across Europe and North America. Fox News host Tucker Carlson broadcast from Budapest for a week last summer, where he extolled the premier’s hardline approach to immigration and the razor wire fence he erected along Hungary’s southern border.A proponent of what he calls “illiberal democracy”, Mr Orbán has taken many of Hungary’s democratic institutions under his control, and depicted himself as a defender of European Christendom against Muslim migrants, progressivism and the “LGBTQ lobby”.In his frequent battles with the EU, of which Hungary is a member, he has portrayed the 27-member bloc as an oppressive regime reminiscent of the Soviet occupiers that dominated Hungary for more than 40 years in the 20th century, and has bucked attempts to draw some of his policies into line with EU rules.Those policies, including what critics view as violations of the rights of LGBTQ people, misuse of EU funds and exerting undue control over Hungary’s media, have put him at odds with Brussels and resulted in billions of euros in EU funding being withheld from his government.Ukraine invasionWhile Mr Orbán had earlier campaigned on isive social and cultural issues, the tone of the campaign was dramatically shifted by Russia’s invasion of neighbouring Ukraine in February.While the opposition called for Hungary to support its embattled neighbour and act with its EU and Nato partners, Mr Orbán, a longtime ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin, has insisted that Hungary must remain neutral and maintain its close economic ties with Moscow, including continuing to import Russian gas and oil.At his final campaign rally on Friday, he told a crowd of supporters that supplying Ukraine with weapons – something that Hungary, alone among Ukraine’s EU neighbours, has refused to do – would make the country a military target, and that sanctioning Russian energy imports would cripple the economy.“This isn’t our war, we have to stay out of it,” he said.Opposition leader Mr Marki-Zay has accused Mr Orbán of taking Mr Putin’s side in the conflict, and said the leader’s approach to the war has “left him alone” in the European community.“This struggle is now bigger than us,” Mr Marki-Zay told supporters at a campaign event in Budapest on Saturday. “The war in Ukraine gave this struggle special meaning.” – Associated PressStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime

litvinenko no one believed putin monster sasha showed","story":"It must be tempting for Marina Litvinenko to slump into despair after western leaders failed to heed her endless warnings about the true nature of Vladimir Putin.Sixteen years after her husband Alexander was murdered by Russian assassins on British soil, the invasion of Ukraine was proof of how little presidents and prime ministers have learnt from the past.“The West became too relaxed,” she says. “They thought: ‘Putin is a b------, but we know how to work with him’. They were wrong.”Yet Marina remains remarkably upbeat as she chats about her past, present and future, showing the strength of character that has got her this far, and which she still believes will see her facing Putin in the International Criminal Court one day.Her biggest ambition in life is “to live longer than Putin, and one day see him tried for war crimes and for the murder of my husband”. The war in Ukraine might even have brought that day closer.For now, though, Marina has a rather more introspective mission at hand. She and her son Anatoly are about to begin work on a joint memoir about Alexander, about his murder, and about the international criminal investigation that has dominated their lives ever since.Anatoly was just 12 when his dissident father died, and Marina believes the process of writing a book together will not only help them to relive cherished memories of Alexander, but also confront unresolved, unspoken elements of their grief.“Anatoly was definitely traumatised by his father’s death,” she says of the boy who was taken to see Alexander as he lay dying in University College Hospital, “but he was very protective of what he was feeling inside. He didn’t cry, and it was only when he got older that he started to talk about it.“When we write this memoir together it will be interesting to hear maybe for the first time his feelings about what happened, from his perspective.”Anatoly, now 28, still lives with his mother in their small flat in West London. He has been working as a paralegal but has decided his future lies in IT and is about to embark on a course in computer coding.Marina and her son talk about Alexander – or Sasha, to use the Russian diminutive form – “a lot” and she has always tried to impress on him the fact that “yes, your father died, but in some way he is with us”.Keeping Alexander’s memory alive, of course, has been a highly public affair for Marina, but not one which came easily.“I’m a very private person,” she says, “and I’m always really surprised when people recognise me in the street, though they are always very polite and generous.“What I do in public, I am doing for my husband, but it doesn’t come naturally. When he was lying in that hospital bed I refused to do any interviews. Sasha said I should do them, and tell people what was happening, but I thought he was going to recover so I never thought I would need to.”Before his death at the age of 44, Litvinenko dictated a statement to be read after his passing, in which he said: “You may succeed in silencing one man, but the howl of protest from around the world will reverberate, Mr Putin, in your ears for the rest of your life. May God forgive you for what you have done, not only to me but to beloved Russia and its people.” Putin’s blood-curdling reaction to Alexander’s death was to say: “The people that have done this are not God, and Mr Litvinenko is, unfortunately, not Lazarus.”A public inquiry chaired by Sir Robert Owen concluded in 2016 that Litvinenko had been the victim of a Federal Security Service (FSB, formerly KGB) assassination “probably” approved by Putin.It named two Russian agents, Andrey Lugovoy and Dmitri Kovtun, as his killers they had slipped a lethal dose of the radioactive substance polonium 210 into a pot of tea drunk by Litvinenko when they held a meeting with him on Wednesday, November 1, 2006 at London’s Millennium Hotel.Litvinenko told Marina that as he sipped his tea, “in one second he realised something wasn’t right”.Twenty-two days later, he was dead and she believes that if he had finished the cup he might have died very quickly, meaning the cause of his death might never have been detected.Two days after the meeting, he was admitted to Barnet General Hospital, before being transferred to University College Hospital on November 17 when his condition worsened. Doctors diagnosed acute radiation syndrome, and on November 23, after losing consciousness, he suffered a cardiac arrest and died after attempts to resuscitate him failed.And so he became the key witness in the investigation into his own murder. The public inquiry was a personal triumph for Marina, who had spent an entire decade pushing for it, despite the obvious risks to her own safety from taking on Putin and his hitmen.I ask if she feels she has to spend her life looking over her shoulder, but she says she has never had bodyguards and refuses to allow security concerns to constrain her.“In 2006 I was given close communication with the police, which meant I could always contact someone 24 hours a day, and I still have that access, but I don’t really need it,” she says.“I do pay attention to what happens around me – if I see the same person cropping up too many times I might want to know why.”Later this year a four-part ITV series, starring David Tennant as Litvinenko, will dramatise the murder and Marina’s fight for justice, which she hopes will bring the story to a new audience too young to remember the scarcely believable events of November 2006.Anatoly acted as a consultant for the series, but contractual obligations elsewhere meant she could not be involved in the production. Did she meet Tennant? She blushes and smiles, which gives away the answer, even though the official version is that they have never met.Marina, who will soon celebrate her 60th birthday, retains the unmistakable poise of her former life as a ballroom dancer (she still teaches dance), and sits straight-backed on the edge of a sofa as she sips green tea at a hotel near her west London home.]She recalls her first meeting with Alexander, in 1993, when he was working for the FSB investigating organised crime – she was 31 and he was 30.“I had heard about him before I met him,” she says, “and I was really quite surprised when this very young man arrived, looking quite shy. He certainly wasn’t what you expect a KGB man to be!”She was meeting friends for drinks on her birthday (“I always joked afterwards that he was my birthday present,” she says) and Alexander accompanied a friend of hers who was nervous about her safety because of her involvement in a case he was investigating.“Sasha gave you so much confidence. He supported you, he protected you, you felt very confident around him, whether you were his wife, his friend or his child. I never thought I could feel so loved, so protected and so happy.“He was always very open-minded, open to anything new. I never thought I would find all of those qualities in one person.”She also, of course, remembers the last time they spoke, and tears prick her eyes as she recalls leaving his hospital bedside to go home to Anatoly for the night.“I told him: ‘Don’t worry, I’ll be back soon’,” she says. “He said: ‘I love you so much’, and he looked so sad. I tried to make a joke by saying ‘finally you tell me!’, but it was the last thing he said to me. Two hours later he was unconscious.”Campaigning for justice can be lonely work, and Marina does not rule out marrying again one day, saying the idea of having another relationship “isn’t a problem to me”, but that any suitor would have to realise that “Sasha will always be in my life, so it would have to be a strong personality to accept that because most people want to be the only one”.At the start of our interview, before bombarding her with questions about her husband, about Ukraine, about Putin, about Roman Abramovich and so much more, I ask her if there are any particular messages she wants to get across, and her answer comes as a surprise.“Firstly, I’m worried about Russophobia,” she says, without pausing for thought. “Of course I support sanctions against Russia, but now people don’t even want to play Russian music, they want to boycott Russian composers. It’s stupid. The past 100 years have not been good for Russia, but it is also the country that produced Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Tchaikovsky and Prokofiev.”She accepts that it might seem odd to some people that she is so passionate about defending the country that murdered her husband, but she believes that “there may be a chance for Russia to become a different country” in future.Could she ever see herself going back to a Putin-free Russia if a modern-day Gorbachev were to take over one day and bring about a new glasnost?“When I left Russia I didn’t think I had left forever,” she says, recalling the couple’s arrival in the UK as political refugees in 2000. “There were people who left during the Cold War that knew they were leaving for good, but for me I thought it was going to be temporary.“Now, though, I would be more happy to go to live in Ukraine. It’s a very similar culture I have friends there and there will be plenty of work to do in rebuilding the country once the war is over.”She praises British people for being so “welcoming and open” to taking in Ukrainian refugees, but warns that “they need to be serious about it. “It’s not just about being generous it’s about being capable of supporting people who are traumatised, who have just come from a war zone. People also need to be prepared to be in this for the long haul you can’t just reject someone after a couple of weeks.”She does not have space in the small flat she shares with her son to be able to house a refugee, but is acting as a liaison for others who want to open their homes. She admits the war took her by surprise – a few days before the invasion, Moscow-born Marina was in Ukraine visiting friends in the south-west of the country.“I didn’t think there was going to be an invasion at all,” she admits, “or certainly nothing beyond the Donbas region. There were so many reasons for Putin not to do it, especially the effect that sanctions would have, that I thought he would hold back.”She says the West has been guilty of a collective failure to see Putin for what he is – “someone who has turned Russia into a mafia state and then a terrorist state” – because successive leaders have convinced themselves they knew how to handle him.“During the Cold War it was simple, because the West didn’t really have any personal relationships with Russia,” she says. “But after glasnost the West started doing business with Russia, private companies got deeply involved, personal relationships formed and they wanted to give Putin the benefit of the doubt.”She recalled George W Bush’s meeting with Putin in June 2001, when the US president said he had “looked the man in the eye” and found him to be “straightforward and trustworthy… I was able to get a sense of his soul”.“No-one believed the president of Russia was a real monster,” she says, “but he is and my husband Sasha tried to show it before his death, and he tried to show it through his death.“Russia carried out an act of nuclear terrorism on British soil by murdering Sasha, and it should have been a watershed moment, but it wasn’t.“In 2010 the new government of the UK gave Russia another chance to build its relationship, and more money came in, big donors with Russian surnames gave money to the Conservative Party. It was a big mistake.”She fears the West will become “fatigued” with the situation in Ukraine, and that President Volodymyr Zelensky will accept a peace deal that would be too advantageous to Russia.“It might suit western leaders to push Zelensky into agreeing everything Putin wants so that they can move on, but the Ukrainian people would not accept that, so it won’t be over.”She even suggests that Zelensky’s position as president could be in doubt if he is too accommodating, despite his Churchillian popularity at present.It is Marina’s misfortune that she knows more about Russia’s use of poisons than almost anyone else in the UK, so what does she believe happened to Abramovich, who claims he was poisoned while acting as a go-between in peace talks?“I believe this is all part of a propaganda exercise to frame Ukraine,” she says. “The Russians have already tried to suggest that Ukraine has chemical weapons so that they can stage false flag operations if they want to, and I think Russia will tell its people that Ukraine has tried to poison Abramovich.She believes that ultimately, Putin’s miscalculation in invading Ukraine could have profound consequences for him. “Russia could break up it’s such a huge country that it’s a nightmare to govern, as history has shown.”As for the war, she is concerned that Putin could use battlefield nuclear weapons, but thinks he would not risk all-out nuclear war because “he doesn’t look like a kamikaze he likes his money and his yachts too much”.Even if Putin were to give the order to use tactical nuclear weapons, Marina still has enough faith in the country of her birth to believe his soldiers would refuse to carry out their orders.“My husband refused to carry out orders to kill people,” she says. “I still believe Russia has heroes.”More from NewsUkraine-Russia latest news: ‘Genocide’ has been uncovered in city outside Kyiv, mayor says\u0026#39New Srebrenica\u0026#39: Mass graves found around Kyiv as mayor describes atrocities as \u0026#39genocide\u0026#39Ramadan 2022: Fasting, prayer and how Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranFrench election 2022 poll tracker: Emmanuel Macron\u0026#39s lead dwindles as Marine Le Pen mounts comebackFrench presidential election 2022: When is it, how does it work and who are the candidates?Ukraine morning briefing: Five developments as Ukraine reclaims \u0026#39the whole Kyiv region\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"american dream disintegrating eyes","story":"Over the last decade the American presidency has passed from a man who arrived at his Inaugural shaking his fist in the air like a tinpot dictator to one who carelessly inserts dangerously impulsive remarks into crucial diplomatic speeches. What on earth is going on here?Of course, the United States, like all mass democracies, has had some pretty poor leaders over the centuries. Those figures who embodied the great moments in its history - Jefferson, Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt - are memorable because they are rare. But what is happening now seems like something more than a routine spell of mediocrity which will pass with the coming of a new generation.What is wrong with the presidency seems more closely connected to what is happening in the wider society: nothing less than a collapse of the political culture which affects the daily lives of ordinary people in ways that failures of the federal power structures rarely have.It is important to understand that throughout much of the country’s history, the complexion and competence of the government in Washington had relatively little bearing on the everyday quality of local American life. The quite explicit design of the Constitution guaranteeing states’ rights ensured this. It was the clear intention of the Founding Fathers to limit the central authority of Washington which was seen as a threat to the self-determination of citizens almost on a par with colonial rule. The explosive confrontations between federal and state authority over the abolition of slavery and, a century later, the enforcement of racial integration, were the most vivid examples of this but disputes over abortion and gun laws still revolve around that basic principle, built into the nation’s idea of itself, of state autonomy.Very rarely, in fact, has the quality and tenor of the presidency seemed so closely aligned with the state of the nation in ways which can be felt in the streets and the homes of real people. The demoralisation and paralysis in Washington plays out in everyday experience. There is endless news coverage of crime, racial violence and civil disorder on a scale that many Americans believed until quite recently was behind them, as well as the continued decline of what would once have been thriving industrial enterprise. But much more ubiquitous and bewildering is the sense that the idea of an American mission - the country’s original idea of itself - has disintegrated. The collapse of that self-belief, of the accepted understanding of what America was for, is stunning.But, you may ask, what is so different and dangerous about this? After all, identity crises of a similar kind have occurred in many countries - particularly former imperial powers which have had to come to terms with their role in a changed world order. There can be a temporary nervous breakdown and then a recovery which reframes a country’s goals. Why shouldn’t this formula which appeared to work in so many European countries apply in the United States with its famously enterprising and adaptable population? Because America is different. I would venture to say that it is much more different from any Old World society than most Europeans appreciate. In the sentimental twentieth century, there was understood to be an American Dream which animated the hopes and aspirations of those millions who arrived there in search of safety, freedom and economic opportunity. The real truth is that America itself was a dream: its national identity, and the patriotism which was a mandatory part of it, was a beautiful fiction created by a small group of people and sanctified by a handful of superb documents which enshrined the 18th century idea of liberty under the law.Most pertinently, this new entity was intended to bind all incomers from anywhere in the world into a cohesive society which was prepared to accommodate anyone who would sign up to the social contract that was on offer. (This is precisely how the Constitution is taught to American schoolchildren: as a contract between the government and the people.) This was an unprecedented political project. Not even the original French revolution which based itself on a similar Enlightenment foundation had done anything like this: attempted to invent an entirely new nation composed of disparate, displaced people which would somehow cohere into a proud unified sense of statehood and inidual belonging. And miraculously, for the longest time it worked. The patriotic rituals which most Europeans found faintly absurd, if not positively sinister, like the pledge of allegiance to the flag which began every school day, served their purpose. The children of immigrants, many of whom, like my grandparents, spoke only the language of the Old Country, went to school and learnt - like my father - to speak English. They became proud Americans who wanted more than anything to belong to this new thing that they felt a part of and were told that their commitment had helped to create.True, there was a constant tension between loyalty to the American national identity and the sense of one’s family roots. So there were communities of Italian-Americans and Polish-Americans and Irish-Americans (like Joe Biden) who never forgot where they came from even though anything that hinted at a lack of full-hearted commitment to America was a kind of blasphemy. But even that uneasy settlement is finished now. The contractual agreement that Americans were one people with one sense of purpose, has been smashed to pieces by wilful isiveness: identity politics which sees historic injustice as unforgivable and life choices as creating irreconcilable differences, have blown apart that fragile accord.The people who abandoned their inherited identities in order to take part in this extraordinary, brave project are now faced with the consequences of rootlessness. Without the resources that go with generations of life in a recognisable place they are lost. Maybe the great American experiment has finally failed.More from NewsUkraine-Russia latest news: ‘Genocide’ has been uncovered in city outside Kyiv, mayor says\u0026#39New Srebrenica\u0026#39: Mass graves found around Kyiv as mayor describes atrocities as \u0026#39genocide\u0026#39Ramadan 2022: Fasting, prayer and how Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranFrench election 2022 poll tracker: Emmanuel Macron\u0026#39s lead dwindles as Marine Le Pen mounts comebackFrench presidential election 2022: When is it, how does it work and who are the candidates?Ukraine morning briefing: Five developments as Ukraine reclaims \u0026#39the whole Kyiv region\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"conversion therapy law must not rushed","story":"If the child asserted they were trans could the parents, counsellor or therapist, find themselves hauled through the courts if they asked questions, or prompted reflection over the time?

Vagueness in law leaves ordinary people vulnerable in this environment. Unfortunately, despite the Government’s decision to work on these elements further, any bill banning conversion therapy for sexual orientation is bound to see poorly drafted amendments to insert gender identity tabled within weeks of introduction.

This is the question troubling Emmanuel Macron nine days before the French vote in the first round of the presidential election. In the last fortnight opinion polls have shown that Macron’s stock is falling and Le Pen’s rising.Such a scenario was inconceivable at the start of the year. The name on everyone’s lips then was Eric Zemmour, the right-wing polemicist, who announced his candidature with a promise to go after Islam and immigration. But Zemmour has peaked, his manifesto too narrow and too nasty, appealing in the main to right wing middle-class Catholics. Le Pen, on the other hand, is popular among the young and the working class, particularly blue-collar workers who in an earlier age would have voted for the left what we in Britain would call Red Wall voters. Economically, Le Pen has always leaned to the left, and in recent years she’s softened her stance on many social issues.In a debate last year with Macron’s Interior Minister, Gérald Darmanin, she was mocked for being ‘soft’ on Islam. Unlike Zemmour – and it would seem Darmanin – Le Pen has no grudge with Islam, only with Islamic extremists. And herein lies the problem for president Macron: how can he describe Le Pen’s National Rally party as extreme right when his own Interior Minister ridiculed her on live television for being soft on Islam? The fact is that Macron has at times during his presidency acted in such a heavy-handed and authoritarian way that great swathes of the public won’t fall for his alarmist rhetoric about the advance of the “far right”. This, after all, is a president whose police force inflicted scores of terrible injuries on demonstrators during the Yellow Vest protests of 201819, injuries that were condemned by the UN, the European Parliament and human rights organisations. This is a president who subjected his country to probably the most stringent lockdown measures of any western nation, and then sneered that his objective in introducing a Covid Passport was to “piss off” the unvaccinated or those unwilling to have a third jab.During a television debate on Thursday evening Le Pen referenced the Covid Passport, expressing her disapproval of the draconian measure and portraying herself as the champion of the nation’s liberté. Le Pen looked confident as she fielded questions from journalists and members of the public. She believes the force is with her.Inflation, crime and energy prices are all on the rise in France, and so are the number of Covid cases. It was only a month ago that Macron told his people he had won his war on the virus and consequently masks and Covid Passports were no longer necessary. He dare not reimpose either before the election because he knows what his political adversaries would say: voila, yet more proof that this is a president who fails on all fronts.Instead Macron’s strategy in the final week of campaigning is negativity, to resort to the tried and trusted, to go on the attack against the “extreme right”. In the past it’s worked, but it is unlikely to work this time in the event of a second round head to head between Macron and Le Pen. Macron is loathed by millions on the left and they will not heed his call to lend him their vote to keep out Le Pen.Just as Britain’s Red Wall collapsed in 2019, in 2022 it could be the turn of France’s Republican Front to disintegrate and when the dust settles France could have its first female president.More from NewsUkraine-Russia latest news: ‘Genocide’ has been uncovered in city outside Kyiv, mayor says\u0026#39New Srebrenica\u0026#39: Mass graves found around Kyiv as mayor describes atrocities as \u0026#39genocide\u0026#39Ramadan 2022: Fasting, prayer and how Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranFrench election 2022 poll tracker: Emmanuel Macron\u0026#39s lead dwindles as Marine Le Pen mounts comebackFrench presidential election 2022: When is it, how does it work and who are the candidates?Ukraine morning briefing: Five developments as Ukraine reclaims \u0026#39the whole Kyiv region\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather temperatures plummet 6c britain braces wintry weather","story":"The UK is braced for further wintry weather over the weekend, with frost creeping in overnight and temperatures set to plummet as low as -6C in some areas.Forecasters said the peaks and troughs of spring will hit most of the country over the next week, with sunny spells and windy intervals expected in most regions.Gardeners have been warned to keep an eye on their blooms as sub-zero temperatures expected on Saturday night could disrupt flowering.Simon Partridge, the Met Office meteorologist, said lows of -6C were likely in northern regions on Saturday night, before a slightly milder turn on Sunday.Tonight will be cold, with widespread frost across the UK.

A small group of men trooped solemnly across a leafy cemetery in central Moscow. The priest in flowing black robes was Archimandrite (Abbot) Tikhon Shevkunov of the Sretensky Monastery. Obligingly, he held a black umbrella over his honoured guest, President Vladimir Putin.Much of the graveyard was filled with victims of the Soviet secret police, the Cheka, but it was not they he had come to see. The president was there to pay his respects to a philosopher called Ivan Ilyin, whose body had on his orders been dug up in Switzerland four years before and flown 1,400 miles to be reinterred in Moscow. He laid a bouquet of red roses before the black granite headstone and stood with Tikhon a short time, regarding the grave. Then he left.This week, across Russia, devastated families also gathered to honour the dead. They were burying young men killed fighting for Moscow in Ukraine. At one funeral witnessed by The Moscow Times, the priest spoke of the deceased, a lad in his 20s: “He fought against evil, Satanic spirits: Ukrainian Nazis, created by American multinational corporations.”The young man in the coffin was separated by 80 years from the remains of Ilyin in that Moscow cemetery, but according to the Kremlin’s increasingly strident ideological creed, the dead shared one important feature: they were part of the same God-given mission to gather up the scattered lands of mother Russia and rebuild its Christian empire.Putin doesn’t strike most of us as the pious type. He wears a £10,500 coat, reportedly owns a £500 million superyacht and is known the world over for vaguely homoerotic, topless photoshoots. He is brutal to the point of being labelled a madman or a psychopath. He spent the first 16 years of his career fulfilling a childhood ambition to work for the KGB, the secret police of a regime that persecuted Christians and preached atheism. And he is, in the words of various Western leaders and scholars, a “war criminal”.Yet somehow, this billionaire Soviet gangster has become a leader beloved by the Russian Orthodox Church, held up as an ideal by a messianic, neo-fascist movement called Eurasianism and presented by his propaganda machine as the man who will establish the Third Rome of Christendom in Russia.Western analysis, trapped in its own worldview, has tended to focus on arguments about Nato, the EU, resources or spheres of influence in the search for Putin’s rationale. But this misses that the war in Ukraine is a conflict with an overwhelmingly religious and cultural dimension, in which the Ukrainian government is cast as a malignant tool of Satanic and degenerate Western forces. The Russian takeover of this land was to be the start of a great revival of the ancient Russian civilisation, welcomed by its virtuous Slavic inhabitants, and signal a precipitous decline for the decadent, doomed West.Somehow, while most of the West wasn’t paying attention, Russia’s nostalgia for Soviet greatness merged into a longing for the imperial father-king, the tsar, and Putin duly transformed himself from a ruthless but boring state functionary into a modern approximation of the old autocrat: an infallible messenger of God in Aviators. But how did this happen, how did it help to justify a bloody invasion of Ukraine and what will happen now that the venture has stalled and Russia is teetering on the cusp of bankruptcy?Growing up poor in a dingy Leningrad tower block, Putin spent his youth chasing rats around the stairwell and dreaming of a future as a KGB strongman. He joined the secret police straight out of university, but it was not exactly a 007 existence. His first posting was in Dresden, a relative backwater in Soviet East Germany.Accounts differ as to what exactly he was doing there – grooming agents to smuggle Western technology, fostering the growth of anti-Western terrorists or more humdrum work. Whatever Putin was up to, it gave him a front row seat on the collapse of the Soviet Union. After witnessing the crumpling of East Germany’s Soviet government, he returned to St Petersburg (then Leningrad) to see the Soviet motherland succumb to the same disease.When and how he left the KGB has never been entirely clear, but Putin quickly made himself indispensable to a wide array of politicians and officials. He moved from a job working for Anatoly Sobchak, the St Petersburg deputy mayor seen at the time as a pro-democracy liberal, to a role at the Kremlin, where he won President Boris Yeltsin’s favour through mastery of his brief and zealous loyalty.But when Yeltsin passed on the reins in 2000, he handed over a country that had just been through a calamitous economic depression, during which its economy halved in size, inflation took off, the ruble was devalued and the state went bankrupt. This was to be the experience that many Russians now associate with their brief period of “democracy”.Still, Putin quickly disappointed his authoritarian fans by adopting a firmly pro-Western stance, in particular supporting the US invasion of Afghanistan after 911. Russia’s economy, buoyed by a rising oil price, recovered, and US president George W Bush declared that he had peered into Putin’s “soul” and seen a good man.Even back then, Father Tikhon was no ordinary, run-of-the-mill Orthodox priest. Rumoured to be the man who brought Putin to Christianity and hears his confessions, he was also a rising star of a new generation of conservative imperialists in the Church, who openly advocate a return to Russia’s monarchist days. “He’s a very conservative cleric with an imperial mindset,” says Lukin.One way of forgetting is to reach back beyond the Soviet era to a much older period of history. In that vein, in 2008 Father Tikhon released a documentary on the collapse of the Byzantine Empire, called The Lesson of Byzantium. The film purports to be a straightforward history of the empire, although in interviews Tikhon admitted that it is also “propaganda” aimed at giving Russians a place in history and a spiritual mission.The 70-minute film argues that Byzantium collapsed primarily because it failed to stay true to the Orthodox faith and abandoned a highly centralised model of imperial control that stamped out nationalist separatism. Instead it succumbed to the oligarchy, Italian finance and corrupting Western notions about the primacy of the inidual over the collective.Still, the empire did pass on an invaluable treasure to the Russian people: their Orthodox Christianity. “It was upon this treasure our forebears founded not banks… or pawnshops,” Tikhon preaches. “They founded Rus, the spiritual successor of Byzantium.” The “forebear” to whom he refers is, in fact, Prince Volodymyr (or Vladimir) of Kiev, a Viking ruler of a region encompassing much of modern Ukraine, who was baptised by Byzantine priests in the 10th century. Ukraine, in this reading, is simply relabelled as ancient Russia.Despite its obscure subject, Tikhon’s film was a runaway success, reportedly sparking more than 500 articles, many hours of radio and TV coverage as well as conferences and speeches. Fans of the film declared that Moscow must rediscover an ancient tsarist tradition of seeing itself as the Third Rome of Christendom.By 2013, the year before his invasion of Crimea, Putin himself took part in a state-produced follow-up film called The Second Christianisation of Rus, which positioned Russia’s post-Soviet surge of interest in Christianity as a second iteration of Volodymyr’s original conversion to Eastern Orthodoxy. The next year, in the midst of Russia’s annexation of Crimea, state TV aired a reading of an essay by Fyodor Dostoevsky chastising Slavic tribes who were ungrateful to mother Russia. In addition to being a brilliant novelist, Dostoevsky was also a committed monarchist who believed that Russia would one day reconquer the Byzantine capital Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul).In truth, according to Peter Eltsov, a professor of security studies at the US National Defence University, this obsession with Byzantium was hardly an ancient tradition: “It’s a 19th century invention.” The idea of Russia’s spiritual Byzantine roots took off in this period as an explicit bulwark against the break-up of empire, just as the notion of national identity was taking hold in Europe. As the anti-Western, monarchist philosopher Konstantin Leontiev argued: “Whether we like this Byzantine foundation or not, whether it is good or bad, it is the only secure anchor not only of Russian but of all-Slavic preservation.”In both Putin’s 2021 essay and 2022 presidential address on the invasion of Ukraine, there are clear echoes of the same strategy, appealing to an ancient religious bond between the peoples of Russia and Ukraine as a justification for war: “Ukraine is not just a neighbouring country for us. It is an inalienable part of our own history, culture and spiritual space,” Putin wrote in 2021. “Since time immemorial, the people living in the south west of what has historically been Russian land have called themselves Russians and Orthodox Christians.”The Eastern Orthodox Church, in other words, is a way to stitch the Russian Empire together.The heritage of Byzantium Rus was not the only idea to emerge in the dying days of the tsarist era with the aim of countering the appeal of the Western nation-state. Alongside a soup of conservative, religious and exceptionalist ideas of Russia, a new breed of Russian fascism was being developed. And that is where we return to our disinterred friend, Ivan Ilyin.Ilyin was a conservative philosopher exiled from communist Russia for his opposition to the Bolsheviks. He washed up in Berlin just as the new ideology of fascism was taking off in Italy and Germany. Ilyin saw in Mussolini and Hitler models for the reinvention of a new Russian tsarism, in which a strong leader could abolish the iniduality of his people and bind them into one spiritual, collective whole, free of corruption and impurities.Putin is clearly no philosopher, but of all the intellectuals in Russian history, it is Ilyin whom he quotes the most. According to the Yale historian Timothy Snyder, just as troops were being readied to invade Crimea in 2014, the Kremlin arranged for all of Russia’s senior officials and regional governors to be sent a copy of Ilyin’s Our Tasks, in which the philosopher predicts the emergence of a “national dictator” who will be “the living organ of Russia”.Today, the task of popularising this sort of messianic fascism falls to a movement called Eurasianism, propounded by a zealous supporter of Putin named Aleksandr Dugin, who appears with regularity on Russian TV screens. Russia must rediscover itself as a Eurasian civilisation, according to Dugin, which means that it must impose upon the continent a new political model that is collectivist, religious and autocratic. For this task, he maintains, conquest of the old Russian Empire is essential.Like Ilyin, Dugin casts this battle in apocalyptic and moral terms. He claims that it falls to Russia to save the world from Western degeneracy and nihilism, evidenced by phenomena like gay marriage and the transgender debate. In this, Dugin is at one with the Russian Orthodox Church.On March 6, 10 days after the invasion had begun, Patriarch Kirill gave a sermon calling the war “a metaphysical struggle”. It was essential for Russia to intervene, he said, to combat the “so-called values” offered by the West, in which “you have to have a Gay Pride parade” to be a member of the club.Putin, in his presidential address on the eve of the war, likewise blamed the West for trying “to destroy our traditional values” and replace them with “attitudes that are directly leading to degradation and degeneration, because they are contrary to human nature”.But the hostility to Gay Pride is not just ideological. The opposition to anything seen to undermine the family, like feminism or homosexuality, is mixed up with a more worldly anxiety that Professor Eltsov believes is driving the war: demographic change.Like much of Europe, Russia is undergoing a significant demographic shift. Its Muslim population is having more babies than its Christian population and, by some projections, Russia could become a majority-Muslim country in the foreseeable future. By taking over Ukraine, using largely ethnic minority, non-Christian conscripts as cannon fodder, Eltsov says “the idea was to get a bunch – 40 million people – who are Slavs and Europeans”.In his 2008 film on Byzantium, Tikhon had explicitly linked the failure to have children and the rise of abortion to the empire’s spiritual decline and “demographic problem”. The obvious result, he noted, while showing footage of a modern Istanbul student smoking a cigarette, was that the city succumbed to Sulton Mehmed, a homosexual 21-year-old, who, in his telling, demanded the 14-year-old son of its governor as a lover immediately after his conquest.Aside from demography, the Church’s anxiety has been exacerbated further in recent years by a direct threat to its authority: a schism.In 2018, the chief patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Bartholomew I of Constantinople, decided to recognise a new, independent Ukrainian Orthodox Church. At a stroke, Ukrainian Christians were taken out from under Russian religious authority, changing an arrangement that had existed for centuries. Patriarch Kirill immediately cut all ties with Constantinople – the very seat of Byzantine Christianity from which Russia supposedly derives its entire spiritual heritage.In a letter written to fellow Orthodox churches in mid-March this year, Kirill blamed the West for the war and emphasised that “the peoples of Russia and Ukraine, who came from one Kievan baptismal font, are united by common faith, common saints and prayers, and share common historical fate”. Kirill and his fellow clerics believed that the Ukrainian government had deliberately engineered the schism, and began to push for measures to undo this calamity with increasing urgency.The Church was not the only authority feeling threatened by developments outside Russia. Putin himself moved further and further away from the liberal values he had talked about in the 1990s in response to a series of challenges. At first, he cracked down on Russia’s oligarch-owned media to avoid criticism of his mistakes, like his poor handling of the 2001 sinking of the Kursk submarine, in which 118 crewmen died, and the security services’ mismanagement of a 2002 terrorist siege in a Moscow theatre, which resulted in 170 people dying.After that, the Arab Spring and the colour revolutions spreading across Eastern Europe unsettled the aspiring dictator. Faced with the need to legitimise his rule and consolidate power, he turned to the Church and the useful hodgepodge of imperialist, autocratic ideas floating around Russian military and intellectual circles. It wasn’t long before his regime was televising footage of priests sprinkling holy water over missiles bound for Syria.Unfortunately, he appears to have spent too much time drinking his own Kool-Aid. He convinced himself that the story told about the ancient, spiritual union of the Russian and Ukrainian peoples was true. If Russia were bold enough to regather the land, the lost Russians of Kiev would soon come flocking back to the bosom of the motherland.Still, there is not yet a general sense in Russia that the war and its consequences threaten Putin’s grip on the country. Sergey Utkin, a scholar of international relations at the Russian Academy of Sciences, is one of the few Russian academics brave enough openly to state his opposition to the war. But he does not believe speaking out will change anything. Hostility to the West is too deeply embedded to dissipate and ordinary Russians will simply blame Nato for the impact of sanctions, he believes. “What’s happening is catastrophic for Russia. It’s not opposition to what’s happening, but the nature of what’s happening that will reveal it was a terrible idea,” he says.Nor are Western ideas likely to make inroads. Utkin used to call himself a liberal, but he has found “realist” models of international relations, like Samuel Huntingdon’s Clash of Civilisations, better predict the course of events. Similarly, Lukin says he is disillusioned by Western hypocrisy over Iraq and its mismanagement of Covid: “I used to be a pro-western guy but now I am very disappointed with the West… I’m thinking more and more about the China model as most suitable.”Over in the US, however, Eltsov, a native Russian who grew up in Leningrad, sees the war as a pivotal turning point not just for Putin, but for Russia as we know it. His 2019 book, The Long Telegram 2.0, argues that for all of the weird and wonderful dogmas promoted by the Kremlin, from Byzantium Rus to Eurasian fascism, at the base of it all is “absolute cynicism”. There is no truly unified Russian identity that could be held together by these ideas if the region weren’t ruled by a brutal autocrat, he argues, and sooner or later – sooner, given the impact of sanctions – he thinks Russia is likely to break up.The prospect is surely stomach-churning, I suggest, given that Moscow controls the world’s second-biggest arsenal of nukes in the world. But Eltsov points out that a similar problem was resolved after the break-up of the Soviet Union. “It’s solvable,” he says, “but it’s frightening.” The future, he believes, lies not with Putin’s new Holy Russian Empire, but with the fragmentation of Eurasia. “Russia is over,” he says. “It’s the beginning of the end.”More from NewsUkraine-Russia latest news: ‘Genocide’ has been uncovered in city outside Kyiv, mayor says\u0026#39New Srebrenica\u0026#39: Mass graves found around Kyiv as mayor describes atrocities as \u0026#39genocide\u0026#39Ramadan 2022: Fasting, prayer and how Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranFrench election 2022 poll tracker: Emmanuel Macron\u0026#39s lead dwindles as Marine Le Pen mounts comebackFrench presidential election 2022: When is it, how does it work and who are the candidates?Ukraine morning briefing: Five developments as Ukraine reclaims \u0026#39the whole Kyiv region\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"would pass bbcs class test","story":"Here’s a question: what did your father (or, in some cases, your mother) do for a living when you were 14? Your answer could determine your chances of getting a job at the BBC, which has announced that by 2027, it wants a quarter of its staff to be from a working-class background – defined by the Social Mobility Commission as “the main parental earner” having a “low socio-economic or working-class occupation”.Besides the substance of the BBC\u0027s pledge, its real problem is one of definition. It is much easier to categorise a person’s race, sex or disability than it is their class. Would you call Sir Keir Starmer working-class? His father was a toolmaker, so by the BBC’s standards he would count. But he went to a grammar school, was classmates with future Tory peer Andrew Cooper, and was a QC and Director of Public Prosecutions before becoming an MP and Labour leader. I wouldn’t have made it to the BBC thanks to my father’s City job, but plenty of his colleagues, especially those who worked on what was still then an open outcry trading floor at the Stock Exchange, were East End and Essex boys from working-class roots.Class is our national obsession, with thousands of microsignifiers.  Names, accents, vocabulary, education, address, clothing, political affiliation… all these and more help us pigeonhole others, often without even being consciously aware that we are doing so. Do you shower before or after work? Do you have your dinner in the middle or at the end of the day? Do you say “lavatory‘toilet” or “loo”, “serviette” or “napkin”, “settee” or “sofa”?But the sands of these definitions are not immutable. Although the tripartite (upper, middle and lower class) ision of the famous 1966 Frost Report sketch is still conversational shorthand, it feels too simplistic now. A 2013 BBC survey identified no less than seven social classes: the elite, established middle class, technical middle class, new affluent workers, traditional working class, emergent service workers and precarious proletariat.Two generations ago, private education was something which solid middle-class families could afford: now they have been largely priced out. Signet rings have expanded from posh to middle- and working-class, too tattoos have gone the other way. Good luck finding a Conservative voter in a multi-million-pound Islington townhouse, but you will come across few fiercer Tories than in working-class Kent and Essex. For every class signifier, there is not just an exception, but an equal and opposite. The true sign of class, of course, is to treat everyone you meet just the same.When I was 14, my father was unemployed, so I guess we were part of the non-working class.He left school without qualifications and became an engineer, one of the Stakhanovite shock troops of BT (in work at 10am, home by 4pm). After privatisation, he got a company car, which was a mixed blessing. The vehicle had Cable and Wireless blazoned across both sides, making us look like a mobile billboard.Mum came from a family of bohemians who had refused to work on principle (she also left school early, to tour the Caribbean and Australia). She married my father, I think, because he looked exotically ordinary. They scrimped and saved until they could afford a nice house in West Kent, and I was the great hope for class mobility.Dad got the boot shortly after I joined the local grammar, and mum took several jobs to keep the mortgage going. My weekends were spent delivering leaflets and newspapers.My father had what I guess would be diagnosed nowadays as a nervous breakdown. He got another job within a couple of years but never recovered his self-confidence. Poverty is humiliating. The school organised a two-day activity celebrating the EU (this was John Major’s Britain). They demanded we all contribute ten quid and I didn’t want to ask my parents for it. So, when a teacher demanded payment, I told her I thought the EU was rubbish and I was withholding our money in protest. From little acorns, Brexit grew.We were not working-class, we were lower-middle-class, which the BBC wouldn’t begin to understand: people who are doing OK but are within one sacking or sickness of losing it all.As laughable as it may sound coming from a Daily  journalist living in north London, I still consider myself to be working class. I’m not any more, obviously, but it’s all about your roots, innit?I was brought up in a two-up, two-down in the North East. Dad was a fireman, my step-dad worked in a factory and my mother (or Mam as we say up our way) was a waitress. I went to a comprehensive school and was the first in my family to go to university.So technically, I’ve got all the badges needed to qualify for the BBC’s new recruitment policy.My children wouldn’t get a look-in though. They will have to fight it out with all the other middle-class kids in the ever shrinking pool of graduate schemes for non-quota jobs.Even in 2022, class remains the one characteristic that too often defines a person’s life chances in this country. Social mobility is stalling and the cost-of-living crisis is only going to make things worse.White working-class children persistently underachieve at school and the albatross of tuition fees means even fewer aspire to university. But what they lack in opportunity they often make up for in spark, determination and drive.Schemes like this are not only a good idea, they are vital if we are to tackle one of the most lingering inequalities left in modern Britain.So bravo BBC for lowering the ladder a little and recognising that true ersity is about more than just protected characteristics.Aged 14 I was smacked in the face by a girl in the PE changing room. She had called me posh. My retort: “How can I be posh if I have to go to school with people like you?” Mean, yes, but she had just set fire to another girl’s hair.Class, I learnt, is in the eye of the beholder.Whenever I asked Mum (the Leonard in my name) what class we were, she would say “professional working class”.At weekends my dad would don oily overalls and fix whatever was ailing the family car. The neighbours in our leafy Stockport suburb assumed he was a mechanic. Had that been the whole truth, then I would have met the BBC’s definition of working class.Dad (the Fox) was the son of a lorry driver, he left school in north London without any qualifications to become an apprentice toolmaker on the Caledonian Road.Yet he dreamt of something bigger. Night school, followed by the University of Manchester as a mature student, and he eventually became a chartered engineer.Mum’s cursus honorum reads: council house, grammar school, mature graduate, Civil Service and then teaching.I’m middle class today because grants meant my working-class parents could become graduates.But no one ever expects to find Boudicca Fox-Leonard with a distinct northern twang.Yes, I went to state school, but my home life was culturally rich, if not always financially. There were books and conversation, but no TV (or licence). It was an eccentric upbringing that defied class categorisation. And that, I’ve learnt, frustrates the type of people who work for the BBC.Let’s indulge the BBC’s tick-box exercise just this once. At 14 I was splitting my time between learning and caring for my single mother, a political refugee suffering the consequences of having been a journalist in a dictatorial country. I was on free school meals out of necessity. I lived in one of the poorest council wards in London – and still do. I knew boys who were stabbed to death.Our household income, excluding benefits, was approximately zero. Yes, I am working class.But telling this story is not how I got my job in the media. I got that by starting a political blog aged 16 which went viral, graduating twice before 22 and breaking stories as a freelancer. It is a testament to social mobility and equality of opportunity in this country that I was able to do all these things without the patronising discrimination of a quota scheme.Some ersity programmes are designed in good faith, but all ultimately negate a person’s innate abilities and leave a cloud marked “positive discrimination” over the heads of every professional from a working class background. Is that not the opposite of equality?If the problem is that BBC recruiters cannot be trusted not to judge on the basis of accent or skin colour, then the answer is to introduce more meritocracy, not less. Nameless CVs would be a good start.More from NewsUkraine-Russia latest news: ‘Genocide’ has been uncovered in city outside Kyiv, mayor says\u0026#39New Srebrenica\u0026#39: Mass graves found around Kyiv as mayor describes atrocities as \u0026#39genocide\u0026#39Ramadan 2022: Fasting, prayer and how Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranFrench election 2022 poll tracker: Emmanuel Macron\u0026#39s lead dwindles as Marine Le Pen mounts comebackFrench presidential election 2022: When is it, how does it work and who are the candidates?Ukraine morning briefing: Five developments as Ukraine reclaims \u0026#39the whole Kyiv region\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"4 holes 150 discount council","story":" holes in the £ discount off council tax - seeyoull fall through cracksMillions of households in bands A to D will get a one-off £ discount on their council tax from April under Rishi Sunaks plan to ease the impact of soaring energy billsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video martin-lewis-how-council-tax-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:XoqZAH,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Brits are being clobbered by the biggest rise in household energy bills in living memory with a % hike to the energy price cap from April . Households on default tarfs who pay by direct debit will see an eye-watering £ annual rise to their bills, from £, to £,. There will be an even bigger jump for prepayment customers of £, from £, to £,. The Chancellor unveiled a package of help for families, including a £ council tax rebate in April and a £ energy bill discount in the autumn, which will be clawed back in instalments over  years from .But the measures were slammed at the time for being too stingy. MPs have raised alarm that people could miss out on council tax rebate or see payments delayed due to loopholes in the system.In a letter to Cabinet Minister Michael Gove this week, Levelling Up Committee chairman Clive Betts said: The Government needs to get a grip on the operation of the council tax rebate and give clear guidance to councils so that this rebate is delivered to households reliably and effectively.If the Chancellor is minded to bring forward additional support to households through the council tax system later in the year then it is even more crucial that every effort is made to create a process that works now. How does it work  People living in homes in council tax bands A to D in England will be eligible for the £ payment. It must be your sole or main home to qualy, so second homes and empty properties are not eligible.  Local authorities will deliver the rebate, with eligibility determined on your situation on April  .You can check which council tax band your home is in on the government website. Councils have also been given a £ million discretionary fund to use in areas of high deprivation or for people outside the eligibility criteria. . People need to be signed up to direct debit Payments will be made automatically to people who pay their council tax by direct debit, meaning local authorities already have their bank details. Councils have been told to contact people who do not pay their bills this way to make sure they donapost miss out.

The Levelling Up Committee has been pressing ministers for estimates of how many households are in this category. Figures sourced by the Local Democracy Reporting Service last month found that , households in County Durham and Northumberland did not pay council tax by direct debit. The overall figure is expected to be much higher.

The Government introduced tough tarfs on Russian products on March , hitting them with “an additional tarf increase of  percentage points, over and above any existing tarf rate under the terms of the move”. But legally they can still be brought to these shores. UK companies have also bought , tonnes of “rebar” from Putin’s closest ally and neighbour, Belarus. However, it is unclear which firms are buying the Russian and Belarusian products - and potentially helping prop up the Moscow and Minsk regimes by pumping cash into their economies.

Mr Kinnock, whose South Wales constituency includes Britainaposs biggest steelworks, Port Talbot, said: “The Government must immediately call on British companies to boycott Russian and Belorussian steel. “British companies should always seek to buy British steel as a matter of course, to support local communities and to help meet environmental targets. “But choosing to buy specically from Russia and Belarus is a gt to Vladimir Putin at a time when we should be seeking to freeze the country out of the world economy.“Worse still, it is an insult to the thousands of brave Ukrainians who have lost their lives in Putin’s barbaric war.” Community steelworkers’ union general secretary Roy Rickhuss said: “The scenes from Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mariupol and across Ukraine remain horrying, and we need to ask ourselves how does the UK respond as a country  “Sanctions are an important tool in the resistance of Russian aggression, and the UK steel industry is more than prepared to manufacture steel domestically.  “Not only should we not be importing steel from Russia or Belarus, this further demonstrates the case that we should maintain our ability to manufacture all grades of steel in the UK.” A Government spokeswoman said: “The UK has taken swt action, including an unprecedented package of diplomatic and economic sanctions, to punish Putin for his barbaric actions in Ukraine.  “This includes introducing a % additional duty on top of existing tarf measures for ious goods from Russia and Belarus, including steel. “This will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, and ensure it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect.” The Mirror has been campaigning to Save Our Steel since the industry was rocked by plant closures and thousands of job losses in .

Image: AFP via Getty ImagesByAletha AduPolitical Correspondent:,  Apr Updated:,  Apr |comments Labour has suggested the UK should follow EU countries and ration oil and gas supplies to avoid a showdown with Vladimir Putin.Last week the despot Russian leader told unfriendly countries they must pay for gas in roubles or it will cut supplies. It was not clear whether he planned to slash existing contracts that set the price in euros or dollars, but nations fear he may start to ration energy supplies.Germany and Austria moved a step closer to gas rationing on Wednesday, after activating an emergency plan.Shadow Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds hinted the UK should follow suit, before making a a complete U-turn.  He first told the BBCaposs Sunday Morning show: We should be making those plans and the Government should be preparing, not necessarily in public, for that situation, and insisted the Government should stop shopping from one authoritarian regime to the next for fossil fuels. “But let’s be clear, we’re looking at the images coming out of Ukraine right now, I don’t think we should be talking about going back to business as usual where we just buy large quantities of fossil fuels, he said. Transport Secretary Grant shapps claimed rationing energy supplies is not the route the Government wants to go down on. He told Sunday Morning: I think the summit in Europe, the Germans in particular are very exposed to Russian energy.Mr Shapps added: [The UK is] not as open to shocks directly from Russia as a result of the fact that we donapost get as much oil and gas from them as other countries.Itaposs not the route that we want to go down.  Mr Reynolds, the Shadow Business Secretary, has since rowed back on his comments. Speaking to Times Radio, he said rationing oil and gas would be a disaster for households and businesses. The fact that you’re even asking the question is an indictment of Conservative energy policy over the past decade and the fact that we still haven’t had a plan from the government even though they said it was a priority and an emergency.” The UK has pledged to ban Russian oil imports by the end of this year as Putinaposs invasion of Ukraine has shown no signs of slowing down. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the transition would give the market, businesses and supply chains more than enough time to replace Russian imports - which make up % of UK demand. The Government did not make plans to reduce the UKaposs reliance on Russianaposs gas, claiming Russia only provides around % of the countryaposs gas supplies.Russia supplies around % of Germanyaposs gas.

On Thursday all of us spent the day desperately reading gas and electric meters, photographing them from seven angles and spent two hours trying to send the numbers to a crashed website, while we screamed and family members muttered “take six deep breaths and try again” because the next day the price was going up by two million per cent. Thanks to this sense of fun from companies such as EDF and E.On, from now on we can play this jolly game every year. It can become like searching for Easter eggs, and we’ll all laugh about the time Grandma didn’t quite get her reading in on time, bless her, so she spent the next month living in the sideboard clutching guinea pigs inside her nightie to keep warm.  In a few years, it will be a festival, like Halloween. Each March  one person will dress up as the EDF man and ­children will scream “aaaaagh don’t take our heating away”. People will run from house to house looking into cupboards with a torch, then we’ll all eat raw pizzas that we cannot afford to cook to celebrate ­Meter-reading Day. This has happened becausewe don’t have an exact reading from the moment the price goes up, the energy companies can charge us for everything at a higher rate. They’ve been given a licence to do whatever they fancy. Next week it will be announced: “Due to rocketing fuel prices, energy companies can marry one person from every household” and it will be considered a great honour to hand your sister over to Scottish Power.  The Government gives advice on how to “shop around” for cheaper tarfs, as it’s our responsibility to see which of the big six suppliers are slightly less impossibly expensive than the others. It’s like the police saying: “There have been a lot of robberies in this area lately, so we’ve decided to crack down. We’ve set up an app, so you can contact all the muggers in the area and arrange which one you would like to hold you at knepoint and run off with your bank card.” Because it’s all down to you. This is why you’ll find Government websites that give advice such as: “Save money on boiling water by filling a pan, and taking it to your local crematorium to pop it on the furnace during a funeral, so you enjoy a well-earned brew.”  The only people who aren’t told by the Government how to reduce energy costs are the energy companies who set the costs. I suppose there’s no point in ordering them about as they’re completely helpless. Since  they’ve paid £billion to their shareholders, but there’s nothing they can do to stop that. Their prices and profits just keep shooting up until eventually they’ll own the universe, and creatures from other galaxies will wonder why they have a bill for £ from British Gas. So all we can do is huddle around a candle with a raw fish finger to celebrate.

MPs will arrange a date for a Westminster showdown on outlawing “Stone Age” devices that can wound and kill cats and dogs. TV presenter and campaigner Chris Packham backed calls for snares to be made illegal. He told the Mirror: “These Stone Age contraptions really have no place in today’s Britain. Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter “They are cruel and barbaric, trapping something like . million animals every year and, in the process, causing horrendous suffering to wildle and domestic animals too.  “There is no justiable reason for snares to still be used in our towns and countryside – it’s high time we end this practice.” Opponents say snares - designed to catch foxes and other predators - also harm badgers, rabbits, lambs and even domestic pets which stray into the countryside. A petition urging the Government to “prohibit the sale, use and manufacture of free-running snares” has attracted more than , signatures. The demand warns that “people setting free-running snares cannot ensure animal welfare as required” and that snares “cause unnecessary suffering to mammals, are indiscriminate and should be banned”. Downton Abbey actor and wildle activist Peter Egan said it was “bewildering to think that there are people who would oppose a ban on snares”.  He added: “They are such cruel and unpleasant contraptions. “For a country that claims to protect wildle, it is bizarre that they’re still in use at all – they cause the most tremendous and unnecessary suffering.” Green MP Caroline Lucas said: “It’s shameful that in  we’re still catching, injuring and killing animals in the most inhumane and indiscriminate way. “Parliament supported calls for a ban on snares as long as six years ago, and yet we’ve seen no concrete action.  “The Government must urgently bring an end to this horric practice by outlawing the sale, possession and use of snares immediately.” Paying tribute to the National Anti-Snaring Campaign and Hunt Investigation Team’s work on fighting for a ban, Animal Aid director Iain Green said: “We’re delighted that more than , people have signed our government petition to ban snares. “Clearly, the public want to see an end to these hideously-cruel, archaic, torture devices that trap, maim and kill millions of animals, and we will now take the campaign to ban snares to Parliament. “No animal deserves to be trapped by a wire noose and we are sure that, judging by the strength of public opinion on this matter, we will get a ban on snares.” Responding to the petition, the Government said it “recognises that some people consider snares to be an inhumane and unnecessary means of trapping wild animals and will launch a call for evidence on the use of snares”.

And the money wasted on inadequate masks, gowns, goggles and gloves desperately needed by the struggling NHS would have paid for , new nurses. The junk, some of which is being burned, was bought through a government High Priority Lane for PPE buying set up by Boris Johnson at the start of the pandemic.It let Tory MPs and top civil servants recommend companies to supply PPE.  Michael Gove, shamed ex-Health Secretary Matt Hancock and former minister Esther McVey were the biggest names among  Tories who brought contracts in – but they are not accused of any wrongdoing. The true depth of the scandal emerged after Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner and Public Accounts Committee MP Dan Carden put a written question to DHSC minister Edward Argar.His Commons reply confirmed that £.bn of £.bn worth of PPE “which cannot be used” or “was not suitable for use in the health and social care sector” had been bought through the VIP lane. The lane was ruled unlawful by High Court judge Mrs Justice O’Farrell in January. Mr Carden said all suppliers of PPE ­products not fit for purpose should be made tothe money. He said. “Those responsible must be held to account and steps taken to recover losses.”  Ms Rayner added: “Unusable masks, gowns, goggles and gloves our frontline key workers desperately needed are now literally going up in flames, along with billions of taxpayers’ cash spent on it. “The next Labour government will establish an Office for Value for Money that would ensure taxpayers’ cash is treated with respect.” The DHSC claims around £m of PPE was not fit for use and a further £.bn was unsuitable for NHS staff. That means it could only be used in settings such as schools..  A spokesman said: “We have delivered over . billion items of PPE to frontline staff to keep them safe. “Of the PPE we procured, % is fit for use.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Labour PartyNHSEsther McVeyMichael GoveBoris JohnsonCivil servantsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A new survey shows we are bottom of the European league when it comes to delivering the financial benefits of going plug-in. Danish motorists get the best deal with savings of more than £, within  months of choosing electric over petrol.

That showed Danes would spend £, on an EV plus travel costs compared to £, for a petrol driven car, a saving of more than %. A litre of unleaded in Denmark costs £..

Germans are £ worse off by going plug-in though the percentage dference is higher than the UK’s at .%. James Andrews of money said: “Denmark leads the way. You could buy and run two electric cars for a year for the same cost as a petrol VW Golf. “But in Britain chargepoint rollout is slow and EVs are also still more expensive than their petrol equivalents .” Denmark also offers EV drivers free parking up to £ a year and payment of road tax in installments.

Mr Andrews added: “Access to rapid chargers is still harder than finding a petrol station. You need to make sure you have public points available nearby before you commit to a purchase.” A Government grant for EVs has been cut from £, to £, and the £ toward the installation of a home charger was also scrapped.

The north east of England has seen the most dramatic rise in child poverty in the past five years, the charity says. Speaking on Sky Newsapos Sophy Ridge on Sunday show, Mr Shapps said: I don’t want to sort of get us lost in numbers here, but poverty is ided into both absolute and relative , and sometimes the way it’s presented can be somewhat misleading to say the least.“I do not mean to in any way, shape or form underplay it because you don’t have to be an expert – you just look at the cost of living, as you mentioned, the increase in inflation… it’s very substantial. And that’s why the Chancellor’s already come forward with £ billion.” Imran Hussain, Director of Policy, Action for Children has said: Poverty destroys le chances. You cannot level up the country with millions of children in poverty so it’s vital the Government brings forward a credible plan to reduce poverty. Mr Sunakaposs £bn in cuts to National Insurance and fuel duty will mostly benefit people in work. Even with a p cut in income tax from , seven out of eight workers will still be paying more tax overall by , the analysis from the Resolution Foundation think-tank found. Natalie from Hampshire, a single mum to two children told the Mirror she is worried about rising living costs and struggles to sleep at night. “As a single mum, money is tight. I don’t have a partner or anyone  to help and so the responsibility is completely on me. It can feel overwhelming and scary.” Some months are very hard and, to be honest, I don’t know how I will manage with £ less each month. The other day I turned on the kettle and could see my smart meter clocking the energy used so turned it off. Mr Shapps later admitted the Government might need to bolster support to help struggling families battle the cost-of-living crisis, as he said, “I don’t rule out the fact that we may need to do more.” Shadow Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: “I feel angry at the scale of the crisis people in this country are facing and the lack of response from Government in the spring statement - and promises on announcements in the future just wonapost cut it. We have set out that windfall tax that would give households a huge amount of help, relative to what the Government are doing - up to £ for households who are most affected by energy prices.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyNational Insurance Company Ltd.Single mumpovertyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Citizens Advice believes around five million people would be unable to pay their energy bills from April, even accounting for the support the Government has already announced. With energy prices set to increase again in October, this number is expected to triple as  million are forecast to be unable to pay energy bills. In addition to the  per cent increase to Ofgem’s price cap hit bills, the Resolution Foundation think tank said the number of English households in fuel stress – those spending at least  per cent of their total budgets on energy bills – will double overnight from . to five million. The foundation’s senior economist Jonathan Marshall said: “Today’s energy price cap rise will see the number of households experiencing fuel stress double to five million. Another increase in energy bills this autumn hastens the need for more immediate support, as well as a clear, long-term strategy for improving home insulation.

Sam Barton, , has had Botox, veneers, fillers in his cheeks, lips, jaw and chin amid speculation he wanted to look like reality TV star Joey Essex.But he says he has now given up the treatments and his old party lestyle following the pandemic and is instead focusing on his business - which specialises in cosmetic work, reports Birmingham Live.Barton has also stepped away from social media and says some of his surgery was pointless in his quest for fame. I used to spend £, on a bottle of Champagne, he said. I was just interested in being pictured on a night out enjoying a lavish lestyle so I could post the pics on Instagram and other social media.I wanted fame and I said some stupid things in the past just to get in the papers. I had surgery on my face and other parts of my body, which cost me thousands of pounds .

I have changed.When I was younger and partying every night, I wasnapost truly happy. I was constantly concerned about what I looked like. I was scrutinised on social media and it wasnapost having a good impact on my mental health. Donapost get me wrong. I still enjoy the occasional blow out - it is part of my personality. But the party lestyle doesnapost define who I am anymore. I was silly. I took advice on how I should behave with the media and told to say things which would get myself headlines. I wanted fame. I wanted to become a star but it was just so shallow.  I was never truly happy like I am now. I feel I am achieving great things through hard work. I often work six or seven days-a-week but it is paying off. I have just bought a house with the money I have made through my business. I am self-sufficient. Sam has used his experience of plastic surgery to set up his Sutton-based business, AMC Aesthetics. He said: It was due to open as we went into the first lockdown, which was a huge blow. I spent the lockdown giving online training and working really hard. The business has gone from strength-to-strength and we have had a turnover over £, since it opened. We are forecasting a turnover of £, next year. Although I will not spend any more money on surgery transforming my body, I still have a keen interest in cosmetic work and I like to pass on my knowledge in the field to other people. We are very responsible and will generally only treat people over . They need to be sure they want cosmetic treatment. I think young people can be influenced very easily by celebrities who have treatment. Everything we do is very responsible.

I enjoy my holidays in places like Dubai and Tenere and want to spend more time travelling.The wannabe celebrity lestyle is so shallow. You will be happier going out and getting a fulfilling job or setting up your own business rather than chasing fame.

Now,  years on from an outrageous con-trick that made headlines around the world, -year-old Darwin does a spot of shopping at a store called WILCON.The former teacher and prison officer may be hoping to cash in on his crime again as his story is turned into a major ITV drama about to hit our screens – and he is writing a tell-all book about his story.We caught up with the Canoe Man in the C Pacic heat of the Philippines – a far cry from chilly Seaton Carew in County Durham where he faked his demise.The crook refused to answer questions as he hopped into a £, SUV and sped away from the Wilcon store car park in Antipolo,  miles from capital Manila. Later his Mercy, Darwinaposs -year-old second we, told us: “The book’s about his le, but it’s not yet finished. You have to wait.” It will follow her husband’s autobiography The Canoe Man: Panama and Back, which he wrote while serving three-and-a-half years in jail before his  release. Mercy is angry the four-part ITV drama The Thief, His We and the Canoe, starring Eddie Marsan as Darwin, has been made without her husband’s permission.  In real le, Darwin and Anne carried out the fraud in . He was seen paddling out from Seaton Carew beach near Hartlepool. Then Anne reported him missing while he hid in a tent down the coast. He then moved to a bedsit next door to the family home, making a door behind a wardrobe into Anne’s bedroom and growing a bushy beard as a disguise for trips into town. The couple’s grieving two sons were never aware of what had really happened. Four years later the couple headed to Panama to start a new le with their ill-gotten gains.  But they were caught after he came home to get papers from police needed for a change in Panama’s immigration laws – and gave them his real name, saying he had amnesia. At first it was hailed a miracle that the missing canoeist had somehow survived. But his lies unravelled when the Mirror ran a story under the headline “Canoe’s this in Panama ” in December , with a snap of the pair in an estate agent’s office. Both he and Anne got just over six years for obtaining cash by deception. It emerged they had staged his disappearance as part of a pension, mortgage and insurance scam to avoid bankruptcy. They were ordered to repay £,.The couple had £, of assets – £, had been repaid by . Anne orced him after  years of marriage. Now almost , miles away from the scene of his crime, le appears far rosier for Darwin, who still receives a state pension. A friend said: “John and Mercy are really happy together. He feels like he’s been given a second chance at le and he’s grabbing it with both hands.” One associate of Mercy’s said: “I have always believed John to be a rich guy.

Naturally, this can prove expensive as it uses gas over a wide area for several hours a day. The alternative is to heat only the room youaposre using or need to heat with an electric appliance that works independently. Electric heating units take their power from wall sockets rather than one central system, but this isnapost necessarily cheaper upfront.  While market chaos has made it near impossible to estimate accurate electricity and gas prices, tradespeople estimate the former is more expensive, The Express reports.Data reported by checkatrade from the last time prices were stable - in December  - show gas heating costs approximately .p per kWh.Electric heating is almost four times more expensive at p per kWh. But using electricity creates savings where, such as in installation. Gas central heating systems require the hand of a specially trained tradesperson and cost up to £, on average. Electric central heating systems cost markedly less, averaging out at £,.  Heaters not hardwired to the mains usually require a single plug socket, with no electrician necessary. But there are other factors to consider when considering whether to use electric heating. One such consideration is efficiency, as gas wonapost convert to heat at a : rate. Most research shows that, at peak efficiency, gas boilers are roughly  percent effective. Electric heaters generate one unit of heat per hour of operation. In the long run, electricity can give people more bang for their buck.

The great-grandad woke up to find his window had been forced open and the £, he had painstakingly saved to spare his family the burden of his funeral costs was gone.The burglars had also taken the ­retired painter and decorator’s CCTV camera to cover their tracks. Heartbroken John told the Sunday People : “I just don’t want to be in this house any more. I don’t feel safe and this makes me angry. “I struggle to sleep at night worrying they will come back. I should not have to feel like that living in my own home. I will not be keeping money in the house any more. But I will never have that type of money again. “It took me a really long time to save and I felt at ease knowing I had that money there because it really would have helped my family when I am gone. “My family now have to help with everything.”  His granddaughter Chloe-Ann Preedy, , added: “He is very upset. This is an old, frail man and he’s been hugely affected by this. It has really hit him hard. “What they have done is absolutely disgusting. They are the lowest of the low. He is particularly upset as he hoped to save the money for his funeral and to help the family. “He is just old-fashioned like that. He is very selfless and is the most ­generous man.” John lives mostly in his living room ­because of his health conditions and his daughter, Jeanette Preedy, visits him up to five times a day in Milton Keynes, Bucks. After waking up and realising he had been robbed, the partially-sighted pensioner called the police, then Jeanette.  Chloe-Ann went on: “My mum hasn’t slept well since, being worried about him. All my mum and dad want to do is help my grandad. “Police think there was more than one person because the window – which grandad usually leaves slightly open to help with his breathing – was open completely and the back door was open. “When he went to sleep, everything was locked – so someone must have climbed in through the ­window and opened the back door for the other one or two. “They’ve then sneaked past my grandad, taken the money and left through the front door. On the way out, they snatched the CCTV camera and threw it on the ground outside. Police found it but the footage ­obviously isn’t there.” John, who is also hard of hearing, had been keeping the money in his wallet at home because he struggles to use the bank.  Chloe-Ann, who works as a carer, said: “He helps his neighbours a lot, so he likes to have cash at hand. “He gave a family nearby money when they were struggling to provide for their son. This is just how my granddad likes to be. He has the kindest soul and will go out of his way for everyone.” She added of John’s ordeal: “He is usually so strong but he is so upset now. “He actually doesn’t want to live there any more. He’s been there for at least  years and it’s been his haven – but he doesn’t feel safe now. “It is not a nice time at the moment. We as a ­family are not sleeping properly.” Thames Valley Police confirmed that officers ­had attended John’s address on March .They said the burglary was believed to have taken place some time between ­midnight and .am. A force spokesman ­added: “Investigations are ongoing.” John’s family have since started a crowdfunding appeal in a bid to ­replace his stolen cash.You can donate to the appeal here. Chloe-Ann said: “We are very ­grateful to those who have helped out so far. We’d love to be able to show grandad that people do care. “We appreciate all of your support and we would like to say a big thank-you to everyone who has shared our posts and donated.” Anyone with information should call  and ask for Thames Valley Police.

Stockport in Greater Manchester is currently enduring a surge of anti-social behaviour, with police issuing a warning to parents. Kids as young as nine have been up to no good in Merseyway Shopping Centre, haranguing workers and shoppers, Manchester Evening News reported. On one occasion a group of  boys and girls became embroiled in a large brawl before racing into shops and making a mess. According to shop workers things came to a head on March , when children rode their bikes around shops and launched items at each other.Have you been the victim of anti-social behaviour  Email webnews@mirrorThe incident prompted Stockport police to post a message on its Facebook page saying young people were aposrunning riotapos. Salim Patel has been working at Bhaji newsagents, just outside the entrance of Merseyway, for  years. He said that anti-social behaviour has always been an issue, but it has definitely increased in recent months. When we entered the shop and asked him about the police statement, he simply shook his head and said theyaposre causing so much trouble. They come in and ask for a vape but as soon as I ask for some ID they just start shouting abuse, Mr Patel added. A group of six will all come in at the same time with some just stealing stock, I tell them to stop what theyaposre doing but they just donapost listen. Iaposm in here on my own and need to be behind the kiosk, it can be very intimidating when thereaposs a big group.  I call for security straight away but by then itaposs already too late. You canapost say anything to themthey just donapost care. Sometimes itaposs absolutely terrible to work here. Iaposve been here  years but itaposs got so much worse recently, at the weekends there is so much trouble. I can see them stealing things but I just canapost do anything when thereaposs a big group. Sometimes kids are even coming in with their parents and stealing still, itaposs like theyaposre being encouraged too, but nobody listens. A senior sales assistant from HMV said that all the surrounding businesses were suffering, with groups running riot over recent weeks.Speak to any retailer here and theyaposll tell you the same thing, he said. You might get two or three groups all combining with crowds of at least  or so forming and looking for trouble. Last week we had someone, who could have only been nine or , ride their bike into the shop and make as much mess as they could. At the weekend there were lots of fights, all between themselves. Itaposs been a big problem recently. It can happen any day of the week too, not just weekends or school holidays when you might expect more kids around. At least two or three times a week thereaposs trouble kicking off with really young looking kids recently. Theyaposre just looking to get a rise out of someone. Itaposs like theyaposre wanting police or security to be called so they can have fun running away from it.  Itaposs been a bit better this week since the police did that post and hopefully more is done to keep on top of it. We canapost really do anything either, theyaposre just young kids. And they know that we can only really ask them to politely leave but nothing more. It seems like theyaposre doing this just because theyaposre bored, theyaposve got nothing better to do. The story was very much the same in the Ann Summers store opposite. Itaposs getting ridiculous now, one member of staff said. You can hear them coming and we have to go and stand at the store to stop them coming in. On Saturday a young kid rode in on his bike, itaposs crazy. People are always having to call security on their radio to help. If you argue with them they start throwing drinks around, itaposs become a massive problem now. Weaposve got a business to try and run but this going on just makes it a lot harder than it needs to be. You always see the same faces too. £Hopefully the police do genuinely deliver what theyaposre promising from that post, we need it.  There was a clear and large security presence around the shopping centre on a Thursday afternoon. One young man was stopped by security before trying to cycle through the Merseyway centre, with an argument starting when they were asked to leave their bike outside. One man shopping with his we, who wished not to be named, said: We used to come here every weekend for shopping or going to cafes. Itaposs okay around the market but can be terrible down here. Thereaposs always big groups around on bikes and these scooters. Police definitely need to be doing more about it. GMP Stockport have placed a lot of emphasis on parents to make sure their kids arenapost visiting the area after school and getting involved in trouble. The full statement from GMP Stockport said: Parents and s - Do you know where your kids are  Recently there has been a large increase in children aged nine to  coming to Stockport Town Centre and doing what I can only describe as running riot. I have charged my team to tackle this as it simply isnapost fair on people who are trying to go about their daily business, be that shopping, socialising, travelling, working or any other reasons. Please can I ask you all as parents, carers and s to speak to your children and make sure they are not coming to the town, after school and causing issues with their friends.

He met so-called Canadian nurse “Esther Anderson” on a dating site and they enjoyed daily chats for  months. But the picture he was sent of “Esther” is a fake. And her cries for help and wild tales of being jailed for smuggling gold were total claptrap. Each time Esther asked for help, intelligent John transferred money from his account – even believing he would become the owner of two .kg gold bars worth £.million. John, , took out loans to give Esther £,., plus a further £, borrowed from his father. He was sent receipts for the gold. But it was entirely fictional.  John – who has an IQ of over  and a masters degree in engineering and robotics – fell for the crooks’ story after meeting Esther on dating website match. As the romance intensied over text messages and FaceTime, Esther told John she would move to Lincoln to be with him. She then asked him for £ a month for food and claimed she was desperate. John obliged and even went hungry himself to afford the gts. He tells the Sunday Mirror: “I always help people around me. I felt bad and I sent the money. “She said ‘Thank you my love and I can’t wait to come and meet you’ and things like that. “How would anyone feel when he hears affectionate words ” He was sucked in by pictures showing a smiling “Esther”.  The con took a twist when Esther said she was a volunteer and was heading to Africa to help build a children’s hospital. She would also visit her mother in Ghana before flying to see John in the UK. Just days later Esther claimed to have been jailed in Ghana for concealing the gold bars in a case. She asked John to pay a court fee to free her from jail. Then he received letters and documentation asking him to pay for the gold to be released. Esther saidhe paid officials she would give him the gold, or sell it and pay him back. But the amount demanded kept increasing. And John kept paying out to ensure the gold was released and he could get his money back. “I was expecting to get the money back when the gold was sold,” he says. “It turns out everything was a scam.” John took out four loans to release the gold and transfer it into his name. He says: “I only sent large sums of money to solicitors and police.  “I was dealing with supposedly official people. “They sent police badges and passports and everything. Esther never asked me for large amounts of money, just daily amounts for food.” He was sent a certicate from Straw P. Beachland Gold Mines Limited, which read: “This is to certy that John Rousakis, next of king [correct] Esther Anderson, is the holder of two bars of gold weighing .kg each.” A receipt in February  acknowledged £, had been paid. Another, in August that year, was for £,. With the sum borrowed by John’s father, the family ended up in £, debt. They saw nothing inand, in February , Esther disappeared. John says: “They kept it going for a year. We were talking daily. At one point I had handed over the money for the gold. They made a bank account for me. Everything was so well planned.” John came to the UK from Greece in  – three years after suffering catastrophic injuries in a car accident. He says the scam has wrecked his mental health, admitting: “I’m used to being used.” John has been awarded £, after Barclays admitted partial liability. The bank did not pay the full amount because it said the initial outgoing sums were small and did not raise concerns. It was only when a large amount was sent that Barclays admitted it had failed in its duty of care to warn John he could be victim of a scam. The money was sent to a non-UK account, making it impossible to access by Barclays. A bank spokesperson said: “This is a tragic case of a romance scam and we have every sympathy for our customer.  “The complaint has been thoroughly investigated, following which our customer chose to refer the case to the Financial Ombudsman Service and we await the conclusion of their review. “A scammer will use a iety of scenarios to target your emotions and get you to part with your money, often using a family emergency or an overseas crisis as a reason. “We encourage customers to always be vigilant and ensure they’ve taken the right steps to determine the person they are speaking to is who they say they are.” Chloe Roche, fraud team leader at CEL Solicitors, which handled John’s case, said: “The first international payment was unusual for the account. “ Barclays admitted they should have intervened. Don’t be ashamed. It happens to a lot of people. These scammers are sophisticated. They take advantage of people’s vulnerabilities and of their kindness.” Diana Fawcett, chief executive of the independent charity Victim Support, said: “Victims of romance fraud often blame themselves, but it is important to understand that this is an incredibly sophisticated crime, and that almost anyone can be targeted. “Victims may feel they have not only lost money, but also a loving partner or relationship they thought they had.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BarclaysBanksHospitalsLoveMental healthCrimeCar crashesRomance\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He said: The day started with a thorough tour of the site, taking a look behind the till and into the kitchen at all of the state of the art fryers, ious storage chillers and freezers, plus numerous hand washing and cleaning stations throughout. Cleanliness really stood out as one of the most important practises in the kitchen, across the day I lost track of how many times I washed my hands which is obviously so important when handling food of any kind but especially chicken. The site was incredibly impressive, the whole kitchen was modern and thoroughly clean - the true sign of a well run kitchen.  The sheer amount of appliances in use really did take me by surprise also, countless fryers, cookers, defrosters and ovens, the list goes on. I suppose as you order fast food you tend not to think of all the inidual parts necessary to craft the end result. Not only this but the sheer speed and precision of the experienced staff when using all of this equipment was very impressive. As Sam rolled up his sleeves and got his hands dirty, he described breading the chicken as an artform. He said: The first step was to get the chicken breaded, an entire artform unto itself.Once Iaposd been given a very useful demonstration it was my turn, and I have to say I was very excited. The flower was so unbelievably soft, it felt like it was working absolute wonders for my skin and great fun to work with. To make sure each fillet is up to standard you must totally cover each, then fold over a hefty amount of the flower on top in one fluid motion before repeating the process for a total of  times. They are then dipped in water and breaded once more, again repeating the previous steps  times. After getting a real hands on experience with the breading process it was time to get cooking with the help of the shiny, new fryers.With all of the fillets ready on the grills, it was frying time which was every bit as satisfying as youaposd expect it to be. Dunking them into the oil was an easy process once I got my head around the mechanics of the fryer, though it did take me a couple tries mind you. After a few short minutes they were done, with a perfect golden coating and a smell that made me instantly hungry, I was now very eager to try the fruits of my labour. All that was left to do was get my fillet burger bunned-up, a portion of chips ready on the side and a drink to wash it all down. Before I knew it, my lunch was on a tray and ready to eat, tasting all the more satisfying after both seeing and helping with the creation process.  As his day came to a close, Sam claimed he left the branch with even more respect for KFC workers than before he arrived. He said: I left my visit with much more respect for all the hard work that goes on behind the scenes at KFC and all fast food chains. Itaposs easy to assume that fast food is easy to make given the name but I can assure you that your lunch time treat really does take a lot of effort from a skilled team. Definitely some food for thought to take away when your next in thought for food.

Danny McCubbin, , bought the house in Mussomeli, Sicily, where a aposCase  Euroapos campaign was launched to encourage foreigners to the area. The Aussie, who had been living in the UK for  years, decided the opportunity to own an overseas home at a cut down price was too good to turn down and urged others to do the same. However, the condition was that buyers had to renovate the house within three years of purchase to have complete ownership. And with labour shortages in Italy’s construction industry made the request tricky to fulfil as the chef – who has worked for Jamie Oliver’s Fteen Foundation – couldn’t find anyone to help him renovate his dream home within the time frame. He was forced to sell the property back to an estate agency after just a few months, receiving his payment back, as it was extremely dficult to find builders.Speaking to iNews, he said: “It was very dficult to find a builder and over time the house deteriorated.“By the time I did find a building company, it was double the cost to renovate it. I decided it was not worth it for me anymore.” Danny said he was disappointed, having enjoyed the quiet le in Mussomeli, a town of just , people.  However, it did not deter him as he managed to turn his hand to buying another cheap house for £,which required less work. In addition, he was able to find two construction workers to do a week of work for him, with the smaller fixes setting him back £, . This has now allowed him to settle into the home and he has now opened a community kitchen to make and deliver free meals to vulnerable families.He added: I moved here at the end of December , because I wanted to live in Italy when Brexit happened.“I’ve always wanted to live in Sicily, my parents loved the countryside. So I asked myself what was missing in Mussomeli and I came up with the idea of The Good Kitchen.”  And the labour shortage has promoted Mussomeli’s deputy to try and reduce the pressure on homeowners who are in desperate need of builders to help renovate their houses. And mayor Toti Nigrelli has since promised to alleviate the labour shortage for others hoping to purchase a cheap house at a reduced rate.  He said: “Local enterprises, which are busy with renovations until , are forced to turn down new contracts, but soon there will be an influx of new builders from abroad to help out.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Housing\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Households are facing eye-watering rises on energy bills from today as the maximum amount firms can charge people on default tarfs is rising by an average of £. Many Brits who pay for energy by regular direct debit payments may be thinking about ending this to give them more control over their outgoings by switching to quarterly bills. They may also have been concerned by news that some energy firms are hiking direct debit payments.But in aMoneySavingExpert video, Lewis said: I know that many people are thinking of ditching direct debits at the moment, because they want to control what theyaposre going to pay by having a bill that comes in and then paying it on the back end rather than dealing with estimates of usage. I gave evidence the other day to Parliament saying I do believe some energy companies are articially inflating direct debits, by far more than the % increase in the price cap to aid their cash flow and that needs to be cracked down on. The price cap, set by regulator Ofgem, limits how much the average home will pay for a iable rate energy deal when using direct debits. This cap rose today by % on average, or £ a year. Lewis added: Butyouaposre thinking of ditching your direct debit, I do need to make you aware of something. While you may gain control, it will cost you more. Someone paying by monthly direct debit for average energy use would have a price cap of £, a year from today.  If you were to ditch direct debits and swap to quarterly bills, that cap goes up to £, a year. So that means youaposre paying over % more for the same usage than you do by direct debit, because there is a discount allowed for direct debit, Lewis said. I canapost tell you what to do, butyou can cope with the direct debit, it is cheaper to do so.

Pampered Putin cronies in Surrey’s St George’s Estate – an exclusive gated enclave where a third of residents are Russian – are unable to pay for private jet flights, holidays or even taxis now their credit cards are frozen. Many have been forced to ask staff to fork out for cabs after finding Uber executive accounts linked to their cards had been closed.A personal assistant to several oligarchs on the estate told us yesterday: “I have had to endure hearing them in tears because they can’t get on board a private jet or book a holiday or even get an Uber any more. But it’s hard to have any sympathy. It doesn’t matter to thempeople are dying in Ukraine.” The whistleblower said one super-rich Russian we collapsed in tears after bespoke electrical fittings ordered for her £ million St George’s estate mansion were blocked.

Oligarchs in the heavily guarded -acre enclave near Weybridge, Surrey, include oil tycoon and close Putin pal Oleg Deripaska, , a mining and energy company boss. Properties on the estate sell for more than £ million. The whistleblower, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, told us: “These people care nothing for the suffering in Ukraine.  “They care only about themselves and how the sanctions are starting to affect their champagne lestyle. “Just before the war one of the wealthy Russian families I know in Surrey paid £, to fly a live crab and some black caviar from Moscow on a private jet for a party. “But that’s all changing now and it’s good to see them having to adjust to their new place in the world.“I laugh at their bleating. I get five calls a day from Russian billionaires asking me to help them with blocked credit card problems. “They askthey can use my address when they apply for new cards to avoid the sanctions. I just put the phone down. I can’t talk to these people any more – they should understand what is happening and what their leader is doing.”Foreign Secretary Liz Truss plans to sanction even more oligarchs.

It used to be a thriving high street but now itaposs changing from retail to leisure and itaposs become a ghost town. Itaposs only going one way. It needs a miracle to save it. The shops shutting down affects all of us here because less people are wanting to come to the village which impacts us all. There are problems with anti-social behaviour. The powers that be are trying dferent things to bring people here but it has a tendency to be late evening such as restaurants but by this time weaposve closed shop.  Itaposs just not good. Thereaposs talks of hotels but whataposs here for peoplethey do come  Itaposs a catch . The area has been re for anti-social behaviour, and now locals say the issue has got so bad that some are even afraid to visit in the evening for fear of being targeted. David Boyle, who has lived in the area all his le, said: My mother-in-law wonapost come out past pm because of the amount of anti-social behaviour, she doesnapost feel safe. Anti-social behaviour is bad, shop signs are ripped off and groups plough through doing wheelies on their bikes not caring who they hit. Thereaposs not much choice in the shops.

He added: I saw it go up and down over the years but it just got worse. Now itaposs just charity shops, betting shops and restaurants, itaposs all just made the village worse.

Everyone used to stop and chat and have a laugh because everyone knew everyone, but now no one bothers stopping in the street, thereaposs no one here. A spokesperson for Knowsley Council said: We dispute the version of Huyton Village presented here. We are doing all that we can to ensure our town centres are thriving.That’s why we developed our ten year plan for Huyton Village Centre which will transform the area in terms of the retail and leisure offer, facilities and public spaces. The development of Huyton Village Centre remains a key priority for the Council.Despite the pandemic, over the last two years eight new restaurants have opened in Huyton village driving a thriving nighttime economy. We acknowledge there have been some isolated incidents of anti-social behaviour but are working with our partners to identy and prosecute those responsible sending a clear message that behaviour of that kind will not be tolerated. Such transformation can’t happen overnight, but we have made signicant progress in attracting new businesses, creating more jobs and these plans will continue to progress.

Angela Boote, , aposlied repeatedlyapos as she desperately tried to cover up her crimes and avoid being brought to justice. But the net closed on the brazen criminal, who was described as a trusted and well-liked employee and had worked for her company since , the Liverpool Echo reports.She has been jailed for three years and four months after stealing a total of £, through her role at Liverpool insurance brokers Grfiths and Armour. Over the course of a number of years the mum redirected cash intended for clients to bank accounts linked to herself and her family members.  Liverpool Crown Court heard earlier this week how Boote spent the cash to fund a “lavish lestyle” of expensive holidays, clothes and jewellery. Photos on her social media accounts, which are no longer public, show herself, her husband and their daughters in far flung destinations like Aruba in the Caribbean during the three year period she was stealing money.Sarah Grfin, prosecuting, also detailed to the court how Boote took extensive steps to cover her tracks - and continued to try to con her colleagues when they started to uncover her deceit. Suspicions were first raised in September  when Boote was away on holiday. A client complained to the company that a £ refund that they were due to receive had not entered their account.  Boote’s manager began to investigate the complaint, finding the bank details on the payment did not match those provided by the client. She contacted HSBC, the bank through which the transfer was conducted, to find out who the account belonged to and copied Boote into the email. At this point, Boote ed from leave and contacted HSBC numerous times herself, saying the issue had been resolved. At every turn, she tried to cut her manager out of the exchange, not copying her in to the emails. At one point, she even replied to HSBC and tried to make it look like her manager was copied in - but with her email address spelled incorrectly. Boote’s manager continued to question what had happened to the money and Boote finally admitted that she had sent into her daughter’s account. Yet even then Boote continued to lie, using the explanation that she must have incorrectly entered her daughter’s details because they were written down on a piece of paper next to her and she had planned to send her money from her personal account. At this stage, Boote’s manager reported the issue as a major error and an investigation of Boote’s accounts began. Eventually,  fraudulent payments were discovered and Boote was sacked shortly after. Recorder David Knton QC said Boote’s criminality was characterised from the start by complex attempts to cover up her dishonesty, with  paper trails created to hide her tracks. The court heard Boote had paid back around £, from inheritance received from an aunt and was being pursued for more cash through civil courts. Lionel Greig, defending, said Boote knew she had let herself and her family down and deeply regretted her actions. She will serve  months of her sentence in prison before being eligible for release under licence.

Maryrose McCready, , from County Derry in Northern Ireland, initially believed she was suffering with the common ailment, which presents as bloating and constipation.Thinking she was reacting badly to food, she made drastic changes to her diet, which helped for a while - but her symptoms reared up again and persisted until they led to a rectal prolapse. She was later rushed to Altnagelvin Hospital in an ambulance after experiencing excruciating pain.Doctors referred her on for a colonoscopy, which revealed a tumour in her bowel, MyDerry reports. Maryrose told MyDerry: I just had a feeling whenever the rectal prolapse happened that there was just something that wasnapost right. I had the prolapse in May  and was then referred for a colonoscopy in the August of the same year. And in between that time my symptoms were getting worse, I had rectal bleeding, constipation, bloating and noises coming from my tummy. It was a massive shock for me when they told me that I had cancer. I was only -year-old and bowel cancer isnapost usually something somebody gets when theyaposre so young. Itaposs usually older people that are diagnosed with it.  This was something that was never discussed or never mentioned when I had gone to get checked by the local doctors and I had just thought that this was normal. Of course, I knew something wasnapost right whenever I had rectal prolapse but I still would never have guessed that it was cancer. She underwent surgery to remove a tumour from her bowel, meaning surgeons had to reattach her bowel after the procedure. Maryrose said she was completely floored by the entire situation which was a total blur at the time. I just wanted to get better, she said.I couldnapost even begin to comprehend how any of this was actually happening. Looking back now I definitely suppressed a lot of the mental side of being ill to the backburner. I just didnapost know how to react to the situation. I considered myself quite lucky because I didnapost have to get a stoma bag at the time or I didnapost have to have chemotherapy. This was the sort of way that I was thinking even know the situation was a godsend for me. I was mentally all over the place. I just wanted to get back to my normal le as quickly as possible.

However, two years later, the Derry woman defied the odds and fell pregnant with her firstborn Cian in  and then Lochlain a year and a half later. I was delighted when I had my two wee boys, Maryrose said. It was such a positive time in my le and I was really looking forward to seeing what the future held for us all. But there was some concern because at the start of my second pregnancy I started to get issues again with the bowel.Bloating, irritation and discomfort of the stomach all ed for the mum-of-two, prompting concern that Maryroseaposs problems were ing. She added: This went on until  when the pain became unbearable one night and I had to the AE department. There was nothing passing, no stool or air. They had to perform emergency surgery due to a blockage in my bowel. And even after that surgery I still didnapost feel right at all. My body was trying to tell me something. My bowel was enlarged in areas and felt completely twisted. Thataposs when I went back in March , just before the first lockdown, and thataposs when I had the CT scan.  Doctors investigating Maryroseaposs second blockage in less than a year, discovered two growths within the bowel - something which was described to her as a aposle and death situationapos. She said: I was told before the surgery started that I would need a stoma bag this time around but it would most likely be temporary. My large colon was also removed because it was so badly damaged that it couldnapost be saved. This left me with only my rectum and Iaposll need another operation in the future. Post ileostomy surgery, Maryrose admitted that she was in a dark place and hated having the stoma bag in. I was really conflicted at the time, she said. I really didnapost want this bag on my body but I knew that it saved my le. Thataposs what they told me. They told me thatthey didnapost perform the surgery there and then that I would I die and when youaposre left with a decision like that youaposre going to do whatever it takes to save your le. But afterwards I didnapost have a good opinion of myself. I hated my body because of the stoma bag and I did everything possible to try and cover it up as best I could. Bleeding from the bottom and or blood in faeces A persistent and unexplained change in bowel habits Unexplained weight loss Extreme tiredness for no obvious reason A pain or lump in the tummySource: Dr Hashim We had just entered lockdown so I wasnapost seeing anybody at the time anyway and that was hard in itself because I didnapost have the people I usually could rely on. Thataposs why I decided to create the page because I needed somewhere where I could talk to people who were going through the same thing but I decided that I wasnapost going to show my face because I was too embarrassed. That when a local wax melt company, Brona at Urban Ivy Aromas asked methey could name their torso candle which was created with a stoma bag after me. They wanted to tell my story and I thought aposno chance, thataposs never going to happenapos. But I went away and I had a conversation with my sister and she told me that I shouldnapost be feeling the way that I was and that I had nothing to be embarrassed about. She said that my story could help empower so many people and the more I thought about it the more I decided that it was something that I should consider and thataposs why I decided to reveal myself. She added: I sort of found my calling in a way and ever since all I have been trying to do is help educate and create awareness about stoma bags and bowel cancer. Nobody should have to sit in silence in the way that I did for that year and feel horrible about themselves. People who are getting this procedure can be at ease knowing that this isnapost a death sentence and le can be as normal as you want it to be. Yes, there are some adjustments but the way the bags are designed now and the supplies that come along with the bags are amazing. People should feel confident with their stoma and not be afraid to show it.If you would like to follow Maryrose on her journey, you can do so by following her Instagram page @big_c_stomaandme HERE.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsPregnancyBowel cancerCancer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The resident said that he reported what had happened to them and that, while two contractors came to take pictures, nothing had happened six hours later. Yesterday afternoon , the residents said the stench was filling the block of flats and that they were unable to go into their kitchens as they described them as a health hazard, reports BristolLive.Resident Martin Hewer said he had also turned his electricity off as a precaution because water is pouring through the ceiling of his tenth floor flat.Iaposm absolutely fuming, Iaposm furious - itaposs a scandal, he said. I went for a walk this morning and just as I got back at around am, there was a great big bang from the kitchen and I walked in to find it like this. I talked to my neighbour who was out, and told him to come back, and his kitchen was the same. I donapost know how many flats are affected like this, but Iaposm on the tenth floor so it could be a lot of them.The council had contractors in doing something with the drains, and God knows whataposs gone wrong. I went and found them and told them, and two of them came up, had a look, took some pictures and then went off again. I havenapost seen them since. Mr Hewer, who is retired, also said heaposs waiting to hear back from the council, adding that he is worried for his health.I couldnapost believe what I saw when I walked into the kitchen. There was all this dirt everywhere, itaposs like a sticky black tar-like substance and it stinks. Obviously the kitchen is unuseable and Iaposm worried about what this substance is anditaposs safe to clear up - it needs professional cleaners because now my kitchen is contaminated with this black stuff.  It needs proper disinfecting - this is a health and safety issue, he added. Bristol City Council was contacted for comment. Bristol Live met another resident who said her flat had not been affected, although she said her sink hole was blocked with a plug.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter hereDr Stankovic also revealed that these symptoms can also appear in those fully-vaccinated. Speaking to the Times Now News Portal, Dr Stankovic said: “Pain is often associated with ringing in the ears. Surprisingly, these symptoms, although more rarely, can also appear in patients who have been vaccinated with a full course. She also advised those with hearing loss, ringing in your ears and dizziness to not dismiss these symptoms and still take a test. Brits can no longer have testing kits for free after the scheme was stopped, with those looking to test having to buy from local pharmacies or online. Covid infection levels have hit a record high across the UK as free Covid- testing for millions in England comes to an end.Some . million people in the UK are estimated to have had Covid- in the week ending March , up from . million in the previous week, the Office for National Statistics said.The ONS data shows one in  people in England are estimated to have had Covid during that week, up from one in  the week before, and in Wales the figure is one in  people, up from one in .Both are record highs and it comes after experts warned that at such levels anyone in the population who can catch Covid is likely to get it.

The UK Health Security Agency monitors outbreaks of the nasty sickness bug, which bring highly unpleasant symptoms. Norovirus is highly contagious and causes vomiting and diarrhoea, but normally does not last much more than a couple of days. An expert has warned hand sanitiser is not enough to stop its spread. Lesley Larkin, Surveillance Lead, Gastrointestinal Infections and Food Safety, UK Health Security Agency said: As pandemic restrictions were lted and now people have begun to mix more, norovirus outbreaks have started to increase.  Symptoms include sudden onset of nausea, projectile vomiting and diarrhoea but can also include a high temperature, abdominal pain and aching limbs. Stay at homeyou are experiencing norovirus symptoms and do notto work or send children to school or nursery until  hours after symptoms have cleared. If you catch this bug, it is important to drink water to avoid dehydration and do not to visit elderly relatives, especially in care homes or hospital while unwell.Hand washing is key to help stop the spread of this bug, but unlike for Covid- alcohol hand sanitisers do not kill off norovirus, so soap and warm water is best.” Often norovirus outbreaks affect care homes and schools the most, with inhabitants of both spreading the virus to their families, once within the home it can spread into the wider community.The six main symptoms Vomiting Watery diarrhoea Feeling sick Aching arms and legs A high temperature A headache How to reduce the spread of norovirus:Stay at homeyou are experiencing norovirus symptoms, the UK Health Security Agency say. Do notto work or send children to school until  hours after symptoms have cleared. Also avoid visiting elderly or poorly relatives, particularlythey are in hospital or a care home. Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and warm water. Alcohol hand gels don’t kill norovirus. When an infected person vomits, the droplets contaminate the surrounding surfaces. A bleach-based household cleaner or a combination of bleach and hot water should be used to disinfect potentially contaminated household surfaces and commonly used objects such as toilets, taps, telephones, door handles and kitchen surfaces. If you are ill, avoid cooking and helping prepare meals for others until  hours after symptoms have stopped, as norovirus can be spread through food contaminated by the virus when food is handled by symptomatic people infected iniduals.

The Princess and her father have been featured in evidence given to a judge overseeing a High Court financial dispute between an elderly Turkish woman and a former banker this week. The dispute is between Nebahat Isbilen, who is in her s, and has sued Selman Turk, a Turkish businessman based in London.She is reportedly suing him over £million that she says is missing, Mail Online reports.A judge overseeing the dispute has been told that the Duke of York was allegedly paid £, for assistance he provided in relation to Mrs Isbilenaposs passport.  According to records of an alleged phone call between the dukeaposs former private secretary Amanda Thirsk and Mrs Isbilenaposs private bank, the money was sent to Andrewaposs private bank account as a wedding gt for Beatrice and her now husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi. Mrs Thirsk said Itaposs a gt for the wedding, a wedding gt, it was reported. Court documents reportedly show that Andrewaposs ex-we the Duchess of York was sent payments totalling £,, while his younger daughter Eugenie received £,, including a £, aposbirthday gtapos. The Duke of York is not accused of any wrongdoing and is not a central figure in the case. It is understood neither Beatrice nor Eugenie had any knowledge of their parents’ dealings with Mr Turk, thereported. Mrs Isbilen is the we of a Turkish MP jailed in their homeland on apospolitically motivatedapos charges. She had needed help moving assets out of Turkey after her husband became a political prisoner, High Court judge David Halpern was told. Mr Turk, a former banker, agreed to help. Mrs Isbilen alleges he breached fiduciary obligations he owed to her and advanced claims in deceit but Mr Turk is fighting the case, which is ongoing and has been heard in London. Mrs Isbilen said police had seized her previous passport and Mr Turk had obtained a new passport for her through connections with Turkish authorities.Mr Turk told me that he received help from the Duke of York to show or send the picture of my old passport to Turkey and that this service would normally be worth £ million, but it would cost lesswe made the payment by way of a gt, she said. I did not understand the nature of the services received then and have also dficulty of explaining it now. I have seen an e-mail from Mr Turk... explaining that this transfer was a wedding gt to Princess Beatrice owing to the close connection between our families. This email is entirely . A document outlining Mrs Isbilenaposs case said the Duke had subsequently ed the £,. Judge Halpern said, in a ruling, that a lawyer representing Mrs Isbilen told him in an affidavit that information had emerged to show evidence given by Mr Turk was misleading. He said solicitor Jonathan Tickner told him evidence showed money was used for purposes unconnected with Mrs Isbilen,substantial sums were paid to Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and to Sarah, Duchess of York. Judge Halpern said barrister Dan McCourt Fritz, who is leading Mrs Isbilenaposs legal team, told him the total sums which his client claims were misappropriated amount to million . Mr Turk has provided explanations for approximately two thirds of these sums, most of which have been allegedly spent on professional or other fees or lost in bad investments, the judge added in his ruling. No explanation at all has been given for the remaining one third.  A statement of claim drawn up by Mrs Isbilenaposs lawyers said: In or around November , Mr Turk told Mrs Isbilen that she needed to make a purported aposgtapos of £, to HRH Duke of York by way of payment for assistance that he told her HRH Duke of York had provided in relation to Mrs Isbilenaposs Turkish passport. The representation that Mrs Isbilen needed to make a gt to HRH Duke of York in connection with her passportwas , and Mr Turk made it dishonestly, knowing it to be  and intending Mrs Isbilen to rely on it. The lawyers added: Mrs Isbilen authorised a transfer of £,... on  November . They went on: Mrs Isbilen has now received £, from HRH Duke of York. Mr Tickner, head of fraud and commercial disputes at law firm Peters  Peters, told the PA news agency in a statement on Friday that Mrs Isbilen had trusted Mr Turk to help her through extremely dficult circumstances. He added: The court documents and decisions given in her case to date speak for themselves.

The Duke of York, who settled a sex abuse case with Virginia Giuffre earlier this year, was named in a separate court case this week.Andrew has been featured in evidence given to a judge overseeing a High Court financial dispute between an elderly Turkish woman and a former banker.It has now been reported that the -year-old is in line to chaperone to Queen to Epsom races in June. A source told the Sun: “He was meant to stay invisible during the Platinum Jubilee so there is no way he will be at events like Trooping the Colour.  “But the Queen needs a chaperone on all occasions at the moment due to her mobility issues and Andrew has earmarked the Derby as the one he will accompany her at. “He just doesn’t seem to understand the public outcry.” Prince Andrewaposs role in the royal family has come into question following the end of the civil suit brought by Ms Giuffre earlier this year. He made no admission of guilt but settle the case for an undisclosed sum, understood to be £m. The settlement came in the months after he ed his military titles and royal patronages to the Queen. Amid such acrimony Andrew accompanied his mother to a memorial service for Prince Philip at Westminster Abbey this week. Prince Charles and nephew Prince William are said to have made their displeasure about the role Andrew played clear to the Queen.They did not want Andrew to be the one to accompany Her Majesty into the service on Tuesday, and reportedly spoke to her more than once to raise their concerns. The Queen went ahead and her so-called favourite son was the one seen across the world helping her along the aisle at Westminster Abbey, as the service was broadcast live on the BBC.The two heirs to the throne were said to have been “shocked” and dismayed” as Andrew emerged front and centre.  A source close to the Palace told the Mirror: [Andrew] was straight out the blocks in front of the cameras when the Duke of Edinburgh died, which was seen within the family as being completely inappropriate. “Now this situation has unfolded, a fair few hold the view that he is manipulating his position for his own gains. Vanity Fairaposs Royal Editor Katie Nicholl said the Queen deliberately chose to have Andrew play such a prominent role on the day and shows the public she still aposmakes the decisionsapos. Katie Nicholl said: This was the Queenaposs way of showing two things one, that the buck stops with her, and she makes the decisions, and secondly that she believes heaposs innocent. She made the point very, very clearly.  But Charles and William were very aware of the perspective, of the optics of this. Unfortunately, this picture [of Prince Andrew escorting the Queen] has overtaken what should have been a memorial to a great man. Andrew has spent a considerable amount of time with the ailing -year-old monarch, who has suffered from a series of health problems in recent months as well as recovering from Covid.The Duke of York, who lives on the Windsor estate, has also been ever present at his mother’s Windsor Castle home after the death of her beloved husband Prince Philip, who died last April aged .

Buckingham Palace will calculate an elderly monarchaposs above criticism on the day of her dear, dead husbandaposs memorial service. But choosing to be escorted to and from Westminster Abbey by a man who paid a reported £-million to settle a sordid sex case to avoid court was deeply distasteful. It wasnapost a sweet old maaposam who wanted to travel from Windsor Castle in state limousine with a scoundrel shunned since paying off a woman who alleged when a teenager she was force to sleep with a dad of two old enough to be her own father.  This was an elderly monarch exploiting sympathy at a personal yet very public event to walk back into polite society a reviled man forced to give up even honorary membership of a posh golf club over the scandals spewing from a close friendship with a convicted paedophile and his jailed fixer. What Virginia Giuffre makes of it one can only imagine but much of the watching world, particularly women victims of abuse, will have been revolted. The removal of his military titles and royal patronages, including the use of a His Royal Highness title, look a ersion.  The Duke of York, her favourite son, remains promoted despite stomach-churning behaviour that shouldaposve seen tainted Andrew seated out of sight at the back behind a pillar. Perhaps age and frailty are distorting her judgement because this was a colossal mistake by a declining monarch. She put her son and family before decency, trying to sell a leper to the country at a service commemorating her husband. Knee-bending courtiers will struggle from now on to argue sheaposs principled and does what is right in the service of the country.  She held on to Andrewaposs arm but it was her parading him. He continues to deny the claim but embracing the humiliated sex case settler damaged her own reputation. After the disastrous royal colonial relic tour of the Caribbean, the head of the creaking institution also undermined a family business suddenly feeling very out of date.

Wheelie bins were laid side-by-side in a busy Birmingham street in a bid to stop other drivers pulling in.But that didnapost stop one driver, with a people carrier seen double parked next to the bins, narrowing the lanes for approaching traffic. A shocked passer-by who saw the scene in Oldfield Road, Balsall Heath, told Birmingham Live : I was walking back to my car from a funeral and I saw it on the way.The bins were flat and did not have waste in them. The white people carrier parked there next to the bins.It was double parked next to the bins. The car was sticking out into the road. The bin was placed so the lids did not open. It was ridiculous. It was taking up two spaces. There were no dropped kerbs. It was not anyoneaposs driveway. The wheelie bins were the latest in a long line of obstacles used by householders to desperately claim blink-and-youaposll-miss them on-road spaces.In March, fuming residents resorted to using rock-filled trollies to reserve parking spaces.Two trollies were seen placed facing each other outside homes in Sparkbrook, weighted down with slabs of concrete. Rocks had also been wedged behind the wheels to secure them in place.  And one driver was left stunned after finding a wheelie bin aposselfishlyapos chained to the ground to save a car parking space. Chad Miah was trying to find a parking space near his friendaposs house when he came across a wheelie bin blocking an empty parking space, when he went to move it Chad was astonished to find the bin was chained to the ground. Chadaposs friend was getting married and the only parking spot nearby had a wheelie bin anchored into the tarmac blocking anyone form using it, Birmingham Live reports.Chad tried to wrench the obstacle free of its moorings near his friendaposs property in Handsworth, Birmingham, but found it was secured with a chain and a padlock to an anchor deep in the road.Furious Chad told reporters: My mate lives opposite and he was getting married on that day. I went to move the bin, but realised the person who did this had drilled it to the ground with a bolt and hook. The bin was attached to a metal chain and had a padlock on it. They must have gone through some effort to do it, just to save a parking space. I was yanking it, but it wasnapost moving. Iaposve seen it all now. Residents have gone to extraordinary s over the years to reserve much-coveted parking spaces in front of their homes. Some have placed cones, sofas as well as council bins to make sure they have somewhere to park.

And for lots of families, their shopping habits are the first thing to change - with cutting down on big brands and opting for supermarkets own branded ranges a good way to save money.A reporter for the Manchester Evening News shopped around Tescoaposs budget brands and Aldi Price Matches to see where savings can be made against the household brands.They were also left impressed by Tesco merging their cheaper ranges with the rest of their products, after scrapping its old aposEveryday Valueapos brand. With some of the products the reporter knew what they were getting as some food items were already a regular feature of their Tesco big shop - like the chicken goujons, cheese pizza and tortilla wraps.  In their everyday shop they refused to pay £. for a pack of branded wraps, when they decided they could get own-branded wraps for nearly half-price at p. During their shop, they said it was like they had stepped into a time machine and arrived back in the s, because of the foods they were getting as well as the prices. Some of the products they shopped were new, but aposrefreshinglyapos cheap with chicken kievs, £. for two, and potato croquettes, just p for g, two stand out products.  On top of prices like the s, the MEN reporter was left thrilled at the prospect of some aposblast from the pastapos puddings like Angel Delight, especially at only p a pack. On top of that, there was a number of other treats they loved from Tescoaposs Ms Mollyaposs range from flapjack traybake and ice cream roll, to milk lollies and trle. Whilst not quite the branded Mr Kipling given the price dference it was a no brainer for the reporter. The tray of flapjack was just p for g, less than half the price of Tescoaposs £ pack of flapjack bites . After the reporter got past the sweet treats, they found plenty to make substantial from the budget range. Aided by the Aldi Price Matches, on some meat and fruit and frozen veg, such as the g bag of broccoli and caullower florets for p and the g bag of Groweraposs Harvest garden peas for just p, they said the meals were aposcheap as chipsapos.  They were also left pleasantly surprised by the quality of fish and chips theyaposd made, and the cut-rate price they made it for. With the .kg of Hearty Food Co straight cut for p, Growers Harvest British mushy peas G for p and the Hearty Food Co four breaded fish fillets G for £., the meal worked out at around p a head. The Willow Farm whole chicken, at £., was enough for a Sunday dinner, and they still had some meat leftover to stick in a curry afterwards. However, despite the price, not all of the products went down well. Instead of the classic Heinz beans, they opted for p Stockwell  Co baked beans which were less popular and they were unable to persuade anyone to eat the chicken paste butty they bought. Although, not all of the bargains went down badly, the Stockwell  Co teabags, at just p for , less than half what youaposd pay for Tetley or a similar brand were said to have made a pretty decent brew.

The start of April feels more like January and wintry conditions, swept in by icy north Atlantic air, are set to continue this week.Long-range forecasters predict more freezing weather will strike mid-month, raising the chance of the UK’s first white Easter in five years.Today, bookmakers slashed the odds on this being the coldest April on record. But while many of us have shivered indoors, working outwe can afford to put on the heating again, others have made the most the ­bracing conditions outside.  Skiers and snowboarders hit the slopes at Lecht Ski Centre in the Scottish Highlands as hardy jet skiers and sea swimmers braved the waves in the North East. And dog walkers wrapped up warm to take their pets for a stroll in Richmond Park, West London. Coral spokesman John Hill said: “The prospect of snowfall during the Easter weekend is now strong.” Last month, temperatures hit C in some areas. It was the the ­sunniest March in the UK since .  Since then, temperatures have fallen. Tomorrow should be nearer the April average but a second Arctic blast, and possible snow, is expected later this week. Met Office forecaster Sarah Kent said: “It’s not that unusual to see snow around Easter time. It’s more of a shock because of the unusually high temperatures we were enjoying.”Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Met OfficeSnowSkiingSnowboardingWeatherSunday People\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But for some reason, we still keep trying, even when the odds are stacked against us and we know that anyone listening to the forced conversation and bad jokes will be curling in on themselves with secondhand embarrassment.And to prove that point, one Tesco employee on TikTok has shared some of the most common things customers say to her when they put their shopping on the conveyor belt - and all of them make her cringe.The worst part  I know Iaposve definitely said each one at least once, and I bet you have too. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Holly Dixon posted a video in which she listed some of the things she hears at least  times each sht while working on the tills at Tesco, including the cringeworthy joke people always make whenever an item doesnapost want to scan.In the clip, posted to her @hollydixon account, she explained the first thing she hears every day is customers telling her they only came in for one thing, despite having what seems like the whole shop in their trolley.Next up was the classic joke: Oh, itaposs not scanning  It must be free! To which an unimpressed Holly simply wrote in text on the video: Absolutely not.  Finally, the employee said she isnapost fond of customers who say she looks bored and state theyaposre going to give her something to do by choosing her till for their shopping. She said: I was happy chilling and counting down the minutes until I finish. In the comments, some people shared their own experiences with working in supermarkets as they quoted other popular phrases that customers use whenever theyaposre at work. One person said: I get askedIaposm worried about losing my jobthey use the self-service till. While another added: Or they ask for a lottery ticket and then go aposthe winning one would be goodapos when you ask what one they want. And others admitted theyaposve definitely used these common sayings at least once, with one user posting: I hold my hand up that Iaposm probably one of these people that say these things. While Holly might poke fun at the customers she sees while working in Tesco, she defended her job in the comments when someone suggested it was time for a job change, as she said: I love my job.Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TescoViral\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Hannah, , had been with her friend Cheslin Marsh in a secluded part of Stellenbosch, South Africa when their car was stopped by a pack of wolves gang who held them up at knepoint in May . The pair were taken hostage and driven around by the thugs for hours, before they nearly beat Cheslin to death and dumped his body. The gang then proceeded to repeatedly gang-rape Hannah, stabbed her in the neck and dropped a ft rock on her head. The abhorrent killers, Nashville Julius, , Geraldo Parsons, , Eben Van Niekerk, , and Vernon Witbooi, showed no remorse as they were sentenced to jail for le in .  Now a new documentary five years on has shed light on the events that took place before Hannahaposs tragic death and how her family struggled to come to terms with her ordeal. Hannahaposs mother, Anna, drowned just a year after the studentaposs death as she took her daily swim - her battered body spotted in shallow waters in Cape Town, The Sun reports.Hannahaposs father Willem said the impact of his daughteraposs death on the family was “beyond devastating” and said his we “walked into the ocean and didnapost ”.He added: I believe our family died with Hannah. Annaaposs death was ruled as a fatal accident, and while Willem claimed he did not believe his we intended to kill herself he added that she lacked the physical or mental strength to deal with the horrying slaughter of her daughter.The night of terror began for Hannah and Cheslin, on May , , when the pair were heading home from a night out. Hannah had offered Cheslin a lt home but while the pair were parked up, CCTV captured the moment the four strong gang encircled the vehicle. Armed with a screwdriver and flick kne they forced Cheslin into the backseat and then the boot while Hannah was cramped between the two front seats. Talking during the new documentary, Cheslin said: I kept telling her, basically, to stay calm the whole time...everything is going to be okay.The gang were again caught on CCTV as they drove to a nearby petrol station to withdraw money from a cash machine with Cheslinaposs card, but were given the wrong pin. During a police interview, Witbooi describes how terried Hannah didnapost talk at all and just looked out in front of her. The callous killers even offered her a glimmer of hope, claiming they wanted to take them both home - but the student would never see her loved ones again. After driving them to a remote area, Cheslin was beaten with bricks and left for dead, but miraculously survived the attack.  He said: They were taking me into the bushes...and then they told me I should lay my head on a piece of brick and thataposs when I realised these people are gonna take my le away. And as I was laying on the brick, I closed my eyes and prayed and asked the Lord for forgiveness for whatever I did in this le. Because I definitely knew Iaposm gonna go to another one and I didnapost want to go. Traumatised Cheslin awoke from the brutal attack partially deaf and not knowing whether Hannah was dead or alive.  In fact Hannah had been driven to a farm road, where the gang claimed they had planned to leave her alive until she began to struggle and was stabbed in the neck. During the trial, Parsons said they believed they had killed Cheslin and admitted being the first one to rape Hannah.According to Times Live, he told the trial: She didn’t want to climb out of the boot. She was holding on to the car. She started panicking.“Eben came up and stabbed her.  But family friends of Hannahaposs claimed she would have tried to comply with her killersapos requests and even empathise with them in a bid to survive. After killing Hannah, the men continued their terrying crime spree, chasing a woman walking to work in nearby Kraaontein before stealing her bag and phone. The group were then arrested following a high-speed police chase after Hannahaposs car was spotted by undercover cops. Her cruel killers were sentenced to a combined  years behind bars with three out of four facing le sentences following the trial at Cape Town high court.  Her heartbroken father Willem admitted during the trial that it had taken him a while to attend the court hearing because he didnapost want to hear what had happened to his beloved daughter - who was described as a aposdaddyaposs girlapos. Willem and Anna went on to create the Hannah Cornelius Foundation to help children in their local area get into education and escape violence within their community. Friend Toni, who went on to become director for the foundation told the Sun Online: Hannah was never a typical child, teenager or adult. She was always unusually compassionate and empathic and deeply moved by the people she encountered, their stories and their struggles. The way in which she saw the world and wrestled with her place and purpose therein was paradoxically both mature and innocent.  Hannah could be naively carefree and even careless at times. A dreamer. An idealist. Distracted and curious. But not many people saw her struggles and her personal suffering, which she carried bravely and faced fearlessly. Hannah loved completely. Firstly her parents and brother, but also friends and often even strangers. She suspended judgement and sought to know and understand. Itaposs easy to idealise the dead. Especially the young, beautul and tragically taken. But Hannah really was everything people say she was. And more.

Intelligence analysts Dragonfly correctly predicted Russia would invade Ukraine and now they claim Putin could be oustedthe West ramps up sanctions that trigger a financial crisis. It comes as Ukraine says its forces have seized back all areas around the capital of Kyiv with Russian troops pulling back as war drags on and another of Putinaposs top Russian colonels is killed.As Western sanctions target Russian business, Putin finds himself under pressure to keep his key advisers on side amid uncertainty over what happens when he can no longer guarantee their financial security. In a Dragonfly briefing, intelligence analysts said it’s likely to highly likely that President Putin will not be in the position he is within the next two years, reports The Sun.Putinaposs fate reportedly lies in the hands of six of his closest allies - Sergei Naryshkin, head of the foreign intelligence service, defence minister Sergei Shoigu, former head of the FSB internal security service Alexander Bortnikov, head of Russia’s Security Council Nikolai Patrushev, head of state-owned Rostec Sergei Chemezov and oligarch Igor Sechin.Dragonfly suggests rather than a military coup, what we would be more likely to see a group of squat men in ill-fitting suits walking into the Kremlin. President Putin then being explained as either ill or having to step down for other reasons – family reasons and so on. Speculation has been re over Putinaposs health and state of mind with some experts suggesting he may be taking steroids as a treatment for cancer - which can trigger nasty side effects, including rapid mood swings, behavioural changes, confusion and altered cognitive patterns In recent public appearances, Putin - known in Russia for his strong man image - has looked bloated and noticeably weakened when compared to earlier images. The decline in his physical state has led outsiders to wonderheaposs battling a serious illness as others claim his decisions relating to the Ukraine war may be caused by psychological instability.  It comes as horrying details emerge of mass killings and Ukrainian men being slaughtered in the street, in the previously Russian occupied areas around Kyiv.Ukrainian forces have been greeted with scenes of dead bodies littering the streets. At least  people were found dead in the village of Bucha, after Russian forces left the settlement. Photos show the widespread destruction and horric actions of the Russian armies as video footage shows Ukrainian troops having to slalom their trucks down the streets to avoid all the dead bodies.

A video posted online showed the tail of a Mi-N helicopter being snapped off over the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine  Wallace had previously vowed to send more “lethal aid” to Ukraine after Russia invaded in February. Kelin told Kremlin News agency TASS: “All arms supplies are destabilizing, particularly those mentioned by [UK Defense Secretary Ben] Wallace. “They exacerbate the situation, making it even bloodier. Apparently, those are new, high-precision weapons. “Naturally, our armed forces will view them as a legitimate targetthose supplies get through the Ukrainian border.” President Zelensky said his troops had taken back at least  towns, including Irpin and the Hostomel air base on the outskirts of the capital.It also regained control of the heavily contaminated Chernobyl nuclear site. He said that while Ukrainian forces had regained  towns in the Kyiv region, the battle raging in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region and Kharkiv remained “extremely dficult”. Zelensky said: “The occupiers are withdrawing forces in the north of our country. The withdrawal is slow but noticeable. “Somewhere they are expelled with battles. Somewhere they leave positions on their own.” The MoD said Russian forces were withdrawing from the area around Kyiv, as Ukrainian forces advanced. The MoD’s intelligence assessment said: “Ukrainian forces continue to advance against withdrawing Russian forces in the vicinity of Kyiv.  “Along the north western axis, Ukrainian forces’ attempts to advance from Irpin towards Bucha and Hostomel are ongoing. “Russian forces are reported to have withdrawn from Hostomel airport, which has been subject to fighting since the first day of the conflict. “Along the eastern axis, Ukraine has re-taken several villages.” Zelensky said more than , people had escaped the besieged Mariupol – which has faced weeks of ferocious Russian shelling – through a humanitarian corridor in a convoy of buses and cars. At least , have been killed in the city and the estimated , who remain face shortages of food, water and electricity. Defence sources last night said that Nato is planning to send tanks to Ukraine.  Polish T-s could start arriving in days. Zelenskyy has been calling on Nato to send tanks and aircraft to help force the Russians out of his country. Putin’s negotiators this week said that Russian forces would ease back from attacks on Kyiv and northern Ukraine although shelling has continued and there is a fear that they are simply regrouping. Colonel Richard Kemp, a former British Infantry commander, said: “It’s not clear whether the Russians were ever intending to fight through Kiev street by street. “It is more likely Putin hoped Zelensky would capitulate as soon as Russia invaded and Kiev was threatened. “Encircling Kiev may also have been intended to fix Ukrainian forces in the city, preventing reinforcements being sent south and east to defend against Russian offensive action there. “It looks like they now wish to withdraw forces from the Kiev area to complete operations in Donbas. “That does not mean they won’t continue to attack Kiev and the surrounding area with artillery and air.” The UK has insisted it will not put troops on the ground in Ukraine but, along with NATO allies, it will supply defensive support to President Zelensky’s troops. The UK provided , anti-tank weapons.

The Ukrainian has shot down two Russian jets and a helicopter in the week since she left university to join the war effort. Sources say the woman has become an expert at firing the Igla surface-to-air missile launcher – which ironically is Russian-made. Her identity is being kept secret amid fears Russian agents will try to assassinate her. At least  Russian aircraft are believed to have been destroyed in the war so far. Defence sources have said that one of the aircraft destroyed is believed to have been an SU-, combat aircraft. A source said: “The Ukrainians have had a lot of success with surface-to-air missiles.The young student who has shot down three aircraft is one of the reasons why Russia does not control the air.”Meanwhile Russia yesterday vowed to target high-precision defensive weapons being sent to Ukraine from Britain, claiming they only worsened bloodshed.Andrey Kelin, Putin’s UK ambassador, issued the warning after reports that a Russian helicopter had been shot down by a portable high-velocity anti-air missile called Starstreak, supplied by the UK.An online video showed the tail being shot off an Mi-N helicopter over Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region.

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors. Just watch out for frosts.Top three jobs this month:"},{"url":null,"title":"mozart to jazz trio ecossaise delight ardrishaig","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowMid Argyll Arts Associationwas delighted to welcome Trio Ecossaise as guest performers at Ardrishaig Public Hall for the fourth concert of the season.The impact of Covid has meant that many planned concerts had to be cancelled or dates changed so it was wonderful to have Trio Ecossaise perform on March .The concert opened with the Kegelstatt Trio by Mozart. Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

What we are hoping to do is turn some of what nature dealt us into a positive.#We would like to hear from woodland owners who think they may have a suitable ash that we could use to promote the hardwood sector.#Scottish Forestry’s forest industries advisor Ros Wardman added: #As part of the project all the stages from finding the tree, to processing, milling, drying, selecting makers, and creating the furniture, will be fully documented. It’s a great way to showcase Scottish workmanship at its finest.#A strong element of the show will be to educate the public about ash dieback and other tree diseases affecting the hardwood sector.#If we can find a grand tree, it would be a fitting and productive end to a tree that was brought down prematurely by the storms, or about to felled because of the disease.#Woodland owners who think they may have a large ash or ash strands affected by the storms should contact the Scottish Furniture Makers Association on info@scottishfurnituremakers.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"news from the districts june 18 2021 2 2 2 2 2 4 4 2 2 2 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Fyne Ales has struck gold in a prestigious industry awards scheme.One of the Cairndow-based brewery#s best-selling products, Hurricane Jack, won gold at this year’s national SIBAIndependent Beer Awards.The fruity blonde ale advanced to the national finals after topping the Scottish cask heats in , seeing off stf competition to be named the UK’s best cask bitter up to . per cent.Hurricane Jack is brewed using US Amarillo and Cascade hops.

virtual meeting of East Lothian Council has been told that  applications have been received since a new homework policy was introduced last September by the local authority.During the height of lockdown, it was estimated that  council staff worked from home.A report to councillors said that of the  who had asked for a permanent change, just over  had been approved to date.And it revealed that work was already being carried out at one council base to revise office space, with staff who no longer required a desk asked to “de-personalise” their spaces.The Penston House office rationalisation project has looked at changing the council offices at its Macmerry site.And councillors were told that staff had been involved in the changes through a series of ‘town hall’ meetings, with similar plans for council offices at Randall House, also in Macmerry, and the council’s Haddington headquarters, John Muir House.A council spokesperson said: “The rationalisation project is following the identication of how best to use existing office space and to create appropriate workplaces.“For many, this is simply the requirement for ‘hot desking’ areas, whereas for others there may be a need to retain an identied space for either iniduals or teams.“The next stage is that those who will no longer require a set desk or office will be asked to ‘de-personalise’ their existing workplace and remove personal belongings, and also identy required files for central storage.“This process will then be repeated in Randall House and John Muir House.”Councillors were asked to approve changes to the homework contracts which would allow employees to spend  per cent of their working time at home to qualy, instead of the  per cent previously required as part of the contract.And they were asked to back changes to the worksmart policy, which hybrid working offered on a non-contractual basis to some staff.A report into the revisions said that they reflected the need for “flexible working practices”.Concerns were raised over whether a need to reduce the council’s assets was being put before the needs of staff.Councillor Fiona O’Donnell asked: “Is the experience of staff informing the assets review rather than the review informing the staff and are the needs of staff being met ”However, Tom Reid, the council’s head of infrastructure, said: “The assets management review is being fully informed by staff.“We are on a journey, this is a dferent council to what it was two years ago and it will be very dferent in two years time.”"},{"url":null,"title":"join-12-hour-tennisathon-longniddry-tennis-club-opens-new-clubhouse","story":"The event is open to those of all ages and abilities, and features a range of tennis

Carrots have a fascinating - and somewhat controversial - history.To mark the annual event, here are nine fascinating facts you probably didnt know about carrots.... Carrots werent originally orangeThe carrots sold in supermarkets these days are almost exclusively orange, but the earliest documented plants produced purple, yellow or white ieties.Theres some dispute about whether Dutch horticulturalists bred orange carrots in the th century to honour of William of Orange , but whatever the reason, the new colour became dominant. You could say, back then, orange was the new purple.... They originate in AsiaNow popular all over the world, the carrot as we know it today was first grown in Afghanistan in the th century. The first reference to the veggie being grown in the UK on field scale was in Somerset in the s.. Theres a huge range of carrot ietiesToday, there are actually hundreds of types of carrots ying in colour and size. And theyve got some rather unusual names, such as Solar Yellow, Red Elephant, Purple Dragon, Five-Star Baby and Little Fingers.. Baby carrots arefakeThe bags of smooth, peeled, unormly shaped baby carrots you see in supermarkets are usually cut from full-size carrots for the convenience of shoppers.However, genuine baby carrots - harvested before they reach maturity - do exist. You can identy a true babyits got its skin on, and a defined shoulder section at the top.. Carrots are mostly waterWhile theyre brilliantly bright in colour, carrots are actually made up of % water, which is why old, dried out carrots lose their crunch.. They might help you see in the darkThe old adage about carrots helping you see in the dark is said to have come about during the World War II, when the UKs Ministry of Food wanted the public to believe the success of night-time air raids was down to pilots munching lots of the veggies, which are rich in a nutrient called beta-carotene.However, its not quite as simple as that. Beta-carotene has been shown to help improve night vision, but only in people who have a vitamin A deficiency, which is unlikely nowadays in developed countries.. Cooking carrots makes them healthierBeta-carotene is used by the body to make vitamin A, an important nutrient in terms of vision, skin health and the immune system. While some nutrientscan be lost through cooking, a study found that cooked carrots, rather than raw ones, actually led to higher absorption of beta-carotene.. Eat too many and you might turn yellowConsuming large quantities of carrots wont turn you orange, as you might expect. It could, however, results in carotenemia, when an excess of beta-carotene gives the skin a yellow-ish tinge.. Theres an annual carrot festivalThe city of Holtville in Calornia, where carrots are a major agricultural crop, has declared itself the Carrot Capital of the World. In February, residents celebrated the th anniversary of the citys annual Carrot Festival, which included a carnival and parade."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-snp-faults-least-dont-oligarchs-around-holyrood-cash-access","story":"Cash for questions, cash for access, cash for honours – even for the son of a Russian oligarch – cash for influence. Then we have the institutionalised cultural corruption of the corporate lobbying, directorships, revolving doors and political donations .It has been alleged that the way the UK Government handled bids for supplying personal protective equipmentand other Covid- response contracts was biased in favour of those with political access. Some  contracts have been identied as possibly corrupt, some  per cent of contracts awarded between the beginning of the pandemic and November . How did this happen  Well, safeguards to prevent corruption were suspended. The cost to the taxpayer  This has been estimated at £. billion. That’s a lot of ferries.I am sure this will be met with charges of \"special pleading\", that independence supporters would let the SNP off with anything at all, that it is \"whataboutery\". However, as the saying goes, \"in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king\" and we should judge governments by their actions in the round, and not just focus on a single one, or only those where they have come up short. In this regard it is interesting that little is heard about free university tuition, no prescription charges, the baby box, free nursery care, the Scottish Child Payment , lowest student loan debt in the UK, water still being publicly owned, to identy only a small sample.Perhaps though its most signicant achievement is no Russian oligarchs around Holyrood, or indeed cash for questions or for access, or awarding contracts worth millions to the pals of government ministers. One might expect Holyrood, and the Scottish Government, to \"learn\" from Westminster, but there are some lessons it has missed, and that is to our benefit.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.* BOB McDougall may be right, he may be wrong, but one thing is for sure: given that everything in le is relative – fat-thin, tall-short, empty-full and so on – this SNP Government is as close to perfection as possible compared to the Johnson Government. Whether the criteria is ability or attitude, humanitarian, level of achievement, or anything , compared to the current Conservative Government in London this SNP Government is very good indeed.George Archibald, West Linton.PARTY IS JUST A MEANS TO AN ENDBOB McDougall seems to think that were Scotland to achieve independence, it would become a one-party state, permanently ruled by the SNP. Unionists often peddle this myth in an attempt to sway voters.As the only party supporting independence, the SNP is a necessary means to that end. When we achieve independence, the other parties will accept that reality and make their own cases to the electorate.The only reason the SNP would be in government would be because both its record in government and its electoral manesto appealed to a sufficient number of the electorate. That’s how democracy works.John McCallum, Glasgow.INDYREF THE BIGGEST THREAT TO SCOTLANDNEVER known to shy away from problems, unless it is to do with the ferries crisis, Nicola Sturgeon continues to promote her  independence referendum with vigour. She claims the \"biggest threat\" is not seizing the chance for independence and is now claiming there is \" massive potential\" in independence.The key word here is \"potential\", which can suggest success but equally can end in failure. On its own it does not signal which of these outcomes is more likely. When you leave this aside and just consider the position of Scotland today in a war-torn, energy-strapped, climate-crisis world the chances of success drop off exponentially, especially given the Scottish Governments current poor track record in health, education, industry, transport, the economy and even its own climate change targets.In light of all of this the biggest threat to Scotlands potential is actually Indyref itself.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow.REFLECTIONS ON SILLINESSON being told by Aberdeenshire Council to remove pro-separatist signage from his garden, erected without planning consent, Alex Salmond responded by asking \"how much money [has been] wasted on this bureaucratic silliness\". Many of us ask the same question about the SNP administration under his and his successors leadership.Martin Redfern, Melrose.WHY JOHNSON MUST RESIGNFORMER Prime Minister David Cameron’s notorious description of his Old Etonian Bullingdon Club alumni Boris Johnson as a \"greased piglet\"’ is surely an apt characterisation of the man now occupying  Downing Street.Mr Johnson behaves like an entitled Arthur Daley – minus car coat and cigar – and now looks set to evade culpability, and the conventional resignation required of any MP, and especially a government minister, found guilty of misleadingParliament.Partygate is his Achilles heel and should signal his fall from what little grace he can muster, and from elected office ample broadcast evidence exists of him, inside Parliament and beyond, insisting on multiple occasions that, “all guidance was followed completely”and even, at times, bizarrely, that there were no parties.The threat of Tory MPs submitting sufficient letters to the  Committee during the Russian invasion of Ukraine has receded, gting the \"greased piglet\" a convenient get out of jail free card. But now he is insulting the nation’s intelligence, passing the buck and insisting he personally broke no Covid rules, splitting hairs with the anaemic excuse that he had been \"repeatedly assured” by others unidentied that there had been full compliance at all times.But there is a huge, gaping hole in the PM’s slippery, oleaginous alibi he was there, in the room, attending at least three of the said parties, or \"gatherings\" as he prefers to describe them. There is photographic evidence of a party in his No  flat – his home, not his office – and further corroboration of his birthday party in the Cabinet Room no question, no doubt, bang to rights.Prime Minister or no Prime Minister , war in Ukraine or no war in Ukraine, he must, for once, take responsibility and resign, and,not, immediately revoke every single fine and criminal record handed out to thousands of ordinary citizens for their breaches of Covid laws.Mike Wilson, Longniddry.RAIL PROPOSALS WILL COST TOO MUCHI WAS interested in the proposals detailed in your article on the Railfuture Scotland list of new railway stations across the Scottish network .As someone who has recently retired after nearly  years working in the railway industry I recognised many of the locations mentioned. During part of my Railtrack and Network Rail employment many of these were investigated and the cost of providing an attractive level of service at an affordable price to the taxpayer could not be justied. Whilst climate change and other world energy influences have changed the UK and Scottish governments strategies on public transport, any network enhancement must be affordable.The Edinburgh South Suburban Line passenger service would require changes to the signalling on the line to reduce headways, and, more importantly, capacity in the Haymarket to Portobello rail corridor would have to be created.This capacity issue was also a factor in the proposed Carlisle to Glasgow local service via the West Coast Main Line not being progressed. The provision of new stations at Beattock, Abington, Symington and Law would have had an adverse impact on cross-border passenger and freight services. This particular route is seeing increased freight and logistics use, which makes the introduction of any local service very challenging.The introduction of one new station on an existing railway will add a minute of three minutes to existing end-to-end journey times. This also has to be factored into existing services at strategic centres such as Edinburgh Waverley and Glasgow Central.These are an ambitious set of proposals but the cost to the taxpayer will be high and it may be that light railor electric and hydrogen buses offer a better solution.Kevin A McCarthy, Glasgow.STRIKING THE WRONG NOTEIAIN Macwhirter is wrong when he writes that Cardf Philharmonic Orchestra removed Tchaikovsky compositions from its programme because he was Russian . The orchestra will, in fact play three concerts later this year with music by Rachmaninov, Prokofiev and Rimsky-Korsakov, all of whom were Russian.Orchestra members were uneasy about playing Marche Slav opus , and Overture  opus  with their Russian nationalism and triumphalism as well as Symphony No, which is nicknamed \"Little Russian\". The Overture  with its cannon fire and the former Russian national anthem was considered particularly inappropriate. Considering that one orchestral members partner is from Ukraine and still has family members trapped there, the orchestras management agreed to delete these items from the programme for now.Hugh Brennan, Kilbirnie."},{"url":null,"title":"world-heritage-status-bid-landmark-scottish-football-sites-steps","story":"With just six months to go before the th anniversary of the first ever international match staged in Glasgow, and which coincides with the World Cup in Qatar, campaigners calling for Scotland to be recognised as the birthplace of football are pulling out all the stops in their bid for UNESCO status.They have recently launched Hampdens Square Mile Alliance to help push for historic sites which have been linked to the formation of the modern game to be given their rightful place.Footballs Square Mile has been hailed by campaigners as the cradle of modern football, where some early players, known as the ‘Scotch Professors’, founded the modern passing and running game of football.Read more: Hampden site: Kick off for historic grounds Unesco world heritage bidIncluded in the square mile are the birthplaces of Queens Park, Celtic and Third Lanark, the site of Rangers first game, and the final resting place of several Scotch Professors.And now campaigners are hoping to spread the word even further as a series of walking tours will be launched next weekend and follows on from a the successful tours held last year.  The Three Hampdens Walking Tour kicks off on Sunday, April  with tours running through until September.

Gov. Macquarie has been credited with helping to shape modern Australia, however, he also ordered the massacre of indigenous people who resisted settlers who had taken their land.His grave, near Salen on the Isle of Mull, is maintained by the National Trust of Australia and inscribed “The Father of Australia”.As well as Australian-themed plants and areas designed to provide peaceful spots for reflection, the revived garden will also pay homage to the Hooker family of Victorian plant hunters who had links with Lochbuie, and the Beatons of Mull, the family of doctors who from the th century onwards provided medical care to the Lords of the Isles and a string of monarchs.The first Beaton doctor is said to have saved the le of a chief of Lochbuie who was suffering from a serious throat abscess, by brewing a vile tasting herbal potion. The mixture was given to people to taste before being given to the chief, who laughed so much at their expressions of disgust, that he strained his throat and inadvertently cleared the troublesome abscess.The same medic is said to have used the treatment to save another girl’s le after she swallowed at a tadpole which, legend has it, grew into a frog.From the th to th century there were more than  physicians linked to the family, with their skills in high demand from kings and clan leaders.The revival of the garden is being supported by the CalMac Community Fund, which provides grant funds to non-profit groups in areas across the ferry network.The latest rounds of the Fund, delivered in partnership with Foundation Scotland, has provided grants for west coast community groups spanning sport, mental health, social isolation and environment.The revival of the walled garden within Aros Park, just outside Tobermory, comes decades after the grand Tudor Gothic style house which it once served was destroyed as part of an Army explosives training exercise.The house was originally planned as a winter residence for Lt-Col Hugh Maclean of Coll, the last laird of Coll, but was never fully completed because he ran out of money.It was eventually bought by wealthy shipping heir Bryce Allan, one of five brothers involved in the family-run Allan Line, which traded between Scotland and Canada and became the inspiration for s television drama, The Onedin Line.One brother, Sir Hugh Allan of Ravenscrag, developed commercial interests in Canada which propelled him to a fortune of around £ million by the time of his death in .However, Bryce Allan’s descendants struggled to maintain the grand property on Mull, and it was sold in  and stripped it of its fixtures and fittings.With walls too thick for easy demolition, the house was destroyed in  by the Army.The Aros estate was taken over by the Forestry Commission in , however, the walled garden was not originally included and instead left to grow wild. It was recently taken over by the Mull and Iona Community Trust.Lauren Fraser, of the group carrying out the restoration, says the finished walled garden will provide a space for gatherings and peaceful contemplation.“It’s a big challenge, and at the moment you need a bit of imagination,” she adds. “In its current state, the garden is more akin to wilderness than a cultivated space.“It has been abandoned for decades and as a result, what was once a productive and impressive space is now all but impassable, overgrown with bracken and invasive rhododendron ponticum and dominated by self-seeded trees, roots and fallen timber, making it an unappealing and unsafe space.”The revamped garden is intended to provide benefits for mental and physical health, with opportunities for locals and visitors to volunteer and join workshops, and with parts of the garden designed particularly for quiet meditation and sensory benefit.An open area of lawn will also provide space for community performances.The initial phase of the project will involve repairing the unusual lime mortar stone wall, creating paths and preparing the ground for planting. Clearance work has already revealed original box hedging, still growing despite decades of neglect.Since its launch in  the CalMac Community Fund has supported  groups delivering a range of projects.Gordon McKillop, CalMac’s Corporate Social Responsibility Manager: “The CalMac Community Fund was created to make a dference for our communities and customers, and we are continuing to see its impact and value.“We are excited to see the benefits from the projects we have supported this year including opportunities for young people living with additional support needs to engage in swimming on Islay, a soup group in Tarbert Loch Fyne for over -year-olds, the Oban Toy Cupboard is a toy lending library for people suffering the effects of poverty and Harris Voluntary Services’ Musical Memories engages people on the island living with dementia.“We are delighted with the Community Fund’s reach and look forward to supporting even more important causes in the future.”"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13638701.jpg?type=article-full","title":"covid-scotland-genomic-sequencing-future-infection-control","story":"“I’ve never had a view like this before,” said Derek Brown, the department’s principal clinical scientist and lead for bacterial pathogens at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, home to Scotland’s biggest genomic sequencing operation for clinical work.The Victorian hospital is famed as the place where Joseph Lister pioneered antiseptic surgery in the s, so it seems fitting that its scientists today should be on the vanguard of infection control technology of the future.The GRI team has been sequencing “bugs” - viruses, bacteria and other microbes - since , but investment has been fast-tracked as a result of the pandemic and the lab now has access to £, machines which can unpick  samples in less than  hours compared to the  samples and  hours of older models.: Covid modellers set out five possible future scenarios for the virus in Scotland “We were going in this direction - we had bid for one of those machines before Covid - but Covid changed the landscape dramatically and accelerated things,” said Dr Alistair Leonard, a senior infection control doctor.“The potential of sequencing to manage public health became clear. Any organism can be analysed.”Just as genomic sequencing has enabled scientists to track the emergence and spread of distinct Covid iants, it is expected to become a routine tool to pinpoint mutations in everything from legionella to Clostridium dficile and guide treatment and outbreak responses.Recently, Brown - an expert in Salmonella - used the technique to identy that two cases of the bacterial infection in Scotland were part of a UK-wide cluster affecting around  people.The outbreak, which sickened some young children and infants, was ultimately traced to a Lithuanian supplier of dead mice: pet owners were falling ill after feeding the infected rodents to snakes and other reptiles.Sequencing labs across Europe reported matching results and imports into the UK were banned.As well as rapid and highly accurate monitoring, information new strains and potentially worrying mutations can now be shared and compared internationally in real-time.“In the past samples would have to be packaged up and mailed around the world,” said Brown.“Obviously that was much slower, but potentially dangerous too - these are harmful pathogens.”Derek Brown with one of the GRI labs £, genomic sequencing machines To date, over , versions of Salmonella have been logged on the worldwide database.One particular Salmonella strain, known as XDR, has mutations which make it highly drug resistant. It is becoming more common but does respond to a lesser used antibiotic, azithromycin.Slowing or preventing the rise of antibiotic resistance is expected to be one of the most important uses of genomic sequencing for public health.Failing to do so would send humanity back to the \"dystopian pre-antibiotic days\", notes Leonard, when a quarter of patients died from post-operative infections.So far thousands of genes associated with antimicrobial resistance have been identied, with more added to the database all the time.: From Joseph Lister to X-rays - how Glasgow Royal Infirmary changed medicineLeonard believes the next five to  years will see a growth in \"personalised medicine\" to combat infections, driven by increased reliance on genomic sequencing.\"Well see a tailoring of drugs to particular strains - so an infected patient would be given the most appropriate antibiotic based on rapid sequencing of their bacterial isolates,\" he said.Sequencing is also important to understanding outbreaks and transmission, both in the community and in hospitals.Back in , Dr Diane Lindsay - GRIs legionella expert - worked with colleagues at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh to investigate a fatal outbreak of legionnaires disease in the capital linked to cooling towers.Sequencing revealed a \"really surprising\" ersity in the genetic make-up of the bacteria causing infections, including unexpected mutations associated with increased virulence.Dr Diane Lindsay, an expert in legionella More recently Lindsay has been monitoring an increase in Scottish cases of legionella longbeachae - so-called because it was first isolated from a patient in Long Beach, Calornia.\"Its a bit of a mystery,\" said Lindsay.\"Were seeing gardeners becoming infected - isolated cases rather than outbreaks. Probably from handling compost.\"To understand just how mammoth a task infection control can be it is worth noting that the average person has  times as many organisms living on and inside them as they do human cells.Staphylococci are the most common of all infectious organisms. Around  per cent of the population carry Staphylococcus aureus in their nose, and another % will pick it up intermittently.: Is Italys revolutionary mental health model finally coming to Scotland Around  to , samples are isolated from patients every year in Scotland. Mostly it is harmless, but around  samples a year are sent to GRI for sequencingthere is suspected cross-transmission.\"Its a sliding scale from harmless to an infection that will kill someone within  hours, depending on the strain or the patients condition,\" said Dr Andrew Robb, GRIs staphylococci specialist.\"Usually its not particularly virulent but its a good indicator for infection control because it is passed on through touch, and on surfaces.\"Dr Andrew Robb One of the advantages of DNA mutations - or RNA mutations in the case of viruses - is that they tend to occur at a fairly predictable rate, depending on the organism, which helps infection scientists to gauge whether a bug is spreading in a particular environment - such as a hospital ward.Dr Aleks Marek, a consultant microbiologist and senior infection control doctor at GRI, said: \"Covid is known not to mutate that quickly, so just because two people have got exactly the same strain and they happen to be in the same place, it doesnt necessarily mean theyve given it to each other.\"In the case of Staph aureus, weve been doing whole genome sequencing for a very long time so we have an idea of how long it takes for mutations to develop.\"That gives us an idea thatan isolate is this close to another there probably has been a transmission event, whereas this close probably doesnt mean theres been a transmission.\"Whole genome sequencing can also tell us whether the bacteria causing infection has a resistance determinant, and whether thats arising inidually in the community multiple times or whether theres some sort of spread going on.\"Soa particular resistant organism did look very similar in all the samples then we might start to think is there some spread , or the oppositeyouve got lots of bugs that look quite dferent genetically but happen share this one resistance gene.\"That helps to guide our response.\"Were really at the start of the journey with using whole genome sequencing, but more and more organisms are starting to come online. I think over the next while well start to use it much more.\""},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

People are also being advised to take a test prior to visiting someone who is vulnerable.If you develop symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test.On vaccination, the First Minister said: “The advice to everyone, of course, remains as important as ever – please do take the opportunity to get vaccinated as soon as you are able and make sure you get all doses of vaccine that you are eligible for. This remains the most important thing any of us can do to protect ourselves and others.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We did not expect the extremely positive and proactive response we received from the jobcentre. The team was very helpful,# said Jordan.The support Elite got from the jobcentre was invaluable in streamlining and accelerating its recruitment process which would take up to five weeks.#Now, the jobcentre advertises our vacancies via a sector-based work academy.#Candidates attend a two-week course at Weston College, Yeovil, to gain their Scaffolding Operative Training Scheme and Health  Safety Certications, as well as to prepare for an interview. Now when we interview candidates, they already have a scaffold labourer trainee card and the basic knowledge and understanding of the scaffolding industry. What’s more, all this support via the jobcentre comes without the additional fees of private agencies.#Out of seven candidates, six were offered jobs and five have remained with Elite which has  qualied operatives.#The process was seamless and effective, providing quality candidates who were keen to learn.#Working with the jobcentre is a no brainer! As well as alleviating the burden of interviews that don’t progress into jobs, the savings in cost and time to get candidates suitably qualied are a bonus. It takes the pressure off our own resources and provides top quality candidates in the process.#‘Delighted’: Simon, Employer Adviser, Yeovil JobCentreOnce approached by Elite Scaffolding, also based in Yeovil, he set up a meeting with one of its office managers and worked out a bespoke recruitment package.As part of the programme, he contacted the local Weston College and together they “built” the course content.At the end of the two-week course, six candidates were offered a place on the apprenticeship scheme at a starting salary of £,.#Elite had exhausted all other channels to recruit and were delighted with the outcome#, he said.Moreover Elite referred other local employers to the jobcentre and Simon is running another sector-based work academy with a local roofing company.#The jobcentre has an incredible pool of talent.

Everything went through really quickly.#Continued the  year-old: “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel welcome and supported me. I spent six months on the placement and I got paid, too. It’s a proper job which was exactly what I needed. Day to day, I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since.“After six months, there was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD. Once I’d finished with the placement I got started on a qualication – CIPD level three in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year.

It is believed that the specic type of tree used to make the paper - Flora Plio – has been in short supply in recent months. Paper production expert, Poppy Cox, explained why this specic type of tree was used for the production of ballot papers. “It has a special waxy quality that prevents the mark you make on your ballot paper being rubbed out,” said Mrs Cox. “That obviously adds an added level of security to the elections and stops people claiming that their ballot has been changed.” Alternatives are now being sought and the two week delay in the vote will hopefully allow for the ballot to be printed on a dferent type of paper. “It is possible that we could see a special kind of foolscap being useda secure alternative can’t be found,” Mrs Cox added. An official statement on the matter is due to be made at midday today ."},{"url":null,"title":"taoiseach we must do better to create a fairer education system in northern irelands schools","story":"Taoiseach Micheal Martin  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueTaoiseach Micheal Martin Ciaran O#NeillApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Taoiseach has said he regrets more has not been done to tackle “educational disadvantage” in Northern Ireland.Micheál Martin said it was an issue that could be “transformative”, but admitted the Irish and British governments and the Northern Ireland Executive have failed to adequately address the problem.He described the creation of a fairer education system as Northern Ireland’s “greatest challenge”.His comments, which were made during a discussion in Derry on Friday evening, have been backed by an academic who specialises in poverty-related issues.Dr Ciara Fitzpatrick, an Ulster University lecturer, yesterday said it was “crucial” that after the Stormont elections on May , all parties agree “radical measures” to tackle poverty and educational disadvantage.“The future of our children depends on it,” she said.A number of reports have been carried out in recent years into educational disadvantage in Northern Ireland.Read MoreBrexit continues to ‘bedevil’ politics in Northern Ireland, Martin saysDaily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The latest of these, which was published last June and called ‘A Fair Start’, said the Department of Education needed to spend more than £m on measures to tackle educational underachievement over the next five years.The report again highlighted there are “particular issues” facing boys in working-class Protestant areas in terms of educational achievement, but said it is “not a problem which affects only one community”.The authors of the report said the most “signicant dferences” in terms of success at GCSE level was between those who received free school meals and those who did not, “irrespective of religion, gender or ethnicity.”Speaking during an event in Derry’s Playhouse Theatre organised by the John and Pat Hume Foundation, the Taoiseach said it was a “passion” of his that every child should “get a chance to fulfil their potential” by finishing school.“My biggest concern since the Good Friday Agreement is educational disadvantage. To me, that is the greatest challenge,” he said. “There is work that needs to be done in the North, cross-community.We need to encourage those communities whose pattern of school completion is poor, encourage them to work in a really targeted way to get the kids to finish school.“It doesn’t have to be the standard curriculum, it could be apprenticeships, it could be training, but that there are levels of achievement that can be certied and a sense of completion and progression. That is the most important thing to bring those who feel marginalised in from the periphery.“It is one of my regrets that both governments and the Executive haven’t tackled that issue in a Marshall Plan way, because it would be transformativewe did.”The Marshall Plan was a huge US-backed financial project which helped rebuild parts of Europe following World War II.Dr Ciara Fitzpatrick said the failure to tackle educational disadvantage has a “strong correlation” to the “continued failure” to tackle poverty issues.“It is absolutely inexcusable that one in four children in our classrooms are living in poverty,” she said. “This figure is likely to rocket, due to the cost of living crisis.Thousands of families are expected to fall into a spiral of destitution. This means that they will be unable to afford food, heat, electricity and products to maintain basic hygiene.These essentials ensure a bare minimum standard of living and dignity. How can children participate in educationthey are cold, hungry and don’t have the equipment they need “Last week I heard of a young boy who didn’t attend school because his family could not afford to buy him suitable shoes. This is where we are at, and it’s only going to get worse.”The Ulster University lecturer criticised the response of Stormont in tackling poverty-related issues.“In leaving the Executive just as the cost of living crisis really began to bite, the DUP chose to inflict great suffering on those with the lowest incomes. It’s hugely frustrating that £m which was allocated from HM Treasury to deal with the unfolding crisis is held hostage, due to the lack of an Executive.“I feel like there has never been a time where we need decisive leadership more than now. Without brave and bold policy-making the repercussions will be extensive.We will see educational standards for those in areas of deprivation decline even further. Mental and physical health problems will be even more common, and our social care systems will be beyond breaking point.”Professor Tony Gallagher, a professor of education at Queen’s University, said the link between social disadvantage and educational outcomes has been a “persistent problem” in Northern Ireland and affects young people from all communities.“All political parties in the North have committed to an action plan to address this — but the focus is largely on the early years and its benefits will emerge in the longer term,” said Professor Gallagher.“The Taoiseach’s focus on greater flexibility and creativity in supporting young people to gain meaningful employment is important and much more could be done in this area.“Every young person deserves to complete their time in education with the skills, attributes and qualications which will allow them to live a fulfilled le as a citizen.At the moment, this is not the experience of far too many young people in Northern Ireland.”Most ReadCouncillor praises INLA killers of MP and Thatcher aide Airey NeaveFormer RTÉ and BBC football pundit arrested after being found passed out in car with children in the backBelfast-made missile downs Russian chopper in UkraineSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worseIlluminating Belmont property is full of mass appealTop VideosPlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayThe moment a Belfast made Starstreak missile shoots down a Russian helicopter PlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenLatest EducationJon TongeOpinionUniversities fail to make the grade on tackling outdated traditionsViewpointOpinionIntegrated schools failure shames NINI schools facing drop in psychological support servicesNorthern Ireland schools are ‘too afraid’ to promote Covid jabs‘A good day for fairness and equality’ as Bill to end religious discrimination in recruitment of teachers is passedLatestUkrainian refugees to be offered employment help at famous Dublin cafeSchoolgirl to sit exams after having brain tumour the size of an orange removedFirst fuel ship allowed into Hodeida as part of Yemen truceSean Dyche hopes to use Man City defeat as preparation for relegation fightJulian TaylorOpinionInjury situations have given Celtic early boost, but Rangers will still give it their all,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The window remains in place today.Neither Mr Craig nor his sisters ever married, and they are understood to have remained living together at the family home until his death in June , aged in his mid s.A report in the Ballymena Observer newspaper on October , , outlined details of Mr Craig’s will.According to the report, he left a block of five shops at Church Street in Ballymena and other property and land in the town to his two sisters, along with the house in Belfast.He also left £, for the upkeep of the window at Fisherwick Church.The will stated that the remainder of Mr Craig’s estate was to be donated to the Presbyterian Church in Ireland to set up a fund called the “The Frank McCaughey Craig and Sarah Remington Charles Trust” in honour of his parents.Mr Craig requested that the fund be used to augment the “salary and stipend of clergymen who are not paid the minimum of £ a year”.However, he stressed that this was not to include “assistants or retired ministers”.The newspaper report added: “An official at Church House, Belfast, said that they had known for some time that a substantial bequest was likely. Final details were not yet available, but it was estimated that, after several bequests and other questions had been settled, the sum would be around £,.”Tragically, according to the newspaper report, Hester Craig died a few days after her brother. It is believed she was around  years-old.As a result of her death, all of the family’s assets were inherited by Sophie Craig.However, Ms Craig did not live for much longer after the deaths of her siblings. She died in February , at the age of .Deaths notices which appeared in the following day’s Newsletter and Belfast  newspapers provided very little information about Ms Craig or her family.The notices simply stated she had died at her residence at Windsor Avenue and that the house and funeral were “private”.The details of her will were subsequently published in the Belfast Gazette a couple of months later in May .The notice states the will was originally written on May ,  before alterations were made on January , , and February , , just three days before Ms Craig passed away.In her will, the Belfast woman asked that £, be bequeathed to Fisherwick Presbyterian Church for the upkeep of the window in memory of her parents, as well as for the “interior decoration” of the church.The will stated that the rest of her estate was to be donated to the Presbyterian Church in Ireland to be added to the fund set up a few years earlier as a result of her brother’s bequest.When contacted by the Sunday Independent last week, the Presbyterian Church in Ireland was unable to say how much was added to the fund following Ms Craig’s death.A spokesperson for the church was also unable to provide the current value of the fund.However, the church’s latest publicly available accounts show that the Craig trust fund was valued at £,, on December , . That year the Presbyterian Church received a idend of £, from the fund.The continued growth of the fund in recent years is evident from the church’s  accounts which show that on December , , it was valued at £,,. The church received a idend of £, from the Craig fund in .The money generated by the fund continues to be used by the Presbyterian Church to supplement the salaries of its ministers.A spokesperson for Fisherwick Presbyterian Church said they were aware of a fund having been set up to provide for the upkeep of the prominent stained-glass window in the church.However, he added that very little was known about the origins of the fund.Most ReadCouncillor praises INLA killers of MP and Thatcher aide Airey NeaveFormer RTÉ and BBC football pundit arrested after being found passed out in car with children in the backBelfast-made missile downs Russian chopper in UkraineSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worseIlluminating Belmont property is full of mass appealTop VideosPlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayThe moment a Belfast made Starstreak missile shoots down a Russian helicopter PlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenLatest Northern IrelandTaoiseach: We must do better to create a fairer education system in Northern Ireland’s schoolsOisin McConvilleOpinionDerry have the potential to bring a new dimension to the All-Ireland ChampionshipFake nun banned from Clonard Monastery after eccentric behaviourMurder victim Roy Reynolds filmed partying with suspect accused of killing him just hours laterGareth McAuleyOpinionIt was vital that Ian Baraclough fine-tuned his Northern Ireland squad ahead of the Nations LeagueLatestTaoiseach: We must do better to create a fairer education system in Northern Ireland’s schoolsUkrainian refugees to be offered employment help at famous Dublin cafeSchoolgirl to sit exams after having brain tumour the size of an orange removedFirst fuel ship allowed into Hodeida as part of Yemen truceSean Dyche hopes to use Man City defeat as preparation for relegation fight,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The SDLP#s MP for the area, Claire Hanna, who romped home in the last general election with some , votes, around , more than the nearest candidate — expressed her shock at the turn of events. The constituency is also larger than East and West Belfast and is the most erse of all NI#s electoral areas, ing MLAs from five dferent parties: SDLP, DUP, Alliance, Sinn Fein and Greens. There is a term for this move by Sinn Fein we are all too familiar with: gerrymandering.What is most curious about this move is that, back in , proposed changes to electoral boundaries here that would seemingly have favoured the DUP were branded “gerrymandering to placate” Northern Ireland#s largest unionist party by Sinn Fein. This criticism was not voiced by one Sinn Fein representative or party spokesperson at the time, but at least half a dozen, in what was essentially a media blitz in a bid to put a spanner in the proposals.What is even more curious is that press statements on Sinn Fein#s website referring to said gerrymandering have vanished. If you simply google “Sinn Fein on gerrymandering” and click on any of the ious links which previously directed to statements from Conor Murphy, Colm Gildernew, Francie Molloy and others on the Sinn Fein website, you are greeted with the following  error message, reading: “We#re sorry, but the page you requested could not be found on our servers. We may have recently moved, renamed, or deleted certain pages.”It seems, much like the party#s previous stance on Russia, they are simply trying to avoid accusations of double standards and prone to extreme stance-switching when it suits them.Read MoreSinn Fein defend proposals to redraw Belfast’s electoral boundariesAn April Fool’s wish listDaily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Ah, April Fool#s Day. Given the state of world at the minute — war in Europe, the cost of living crisis on the tail end of a pandemic that hasn#t gone away - I was hoping we would give it a rest this year, lest we cause more unneeded distress. One humorous political wish list, however, was posted on Twitter by human rights organisation Participation and the Practice of Rights , reading: “‘Stick your hostile environment’ — Givan tells UK Home Office. ‘Mackies will be % social’ — Hargey takes action on housing rights. ‘Our policies are the problem, not you’ — Swann promises counsellors in every GP practice.” We can but dream.NI#s most unambiguous partyAn interesting press statement was released by the TUV on Friday, which declared that the party#s designation on the ballot paper for May#s poll will read: ‘TUV — No Sea Border’.Explaining the move, TUV leader Jim Allister said: “Having led where others have followed we wish every voter to see the issue identied without ambiguity on the ballot paper. There will be no doubt as to what a vote for TUV means.”Now, the TUV have been accused of being many things, but ‘ambiguous’ is definitely not one of them. Anyone with even a slight grasp of Northern Ireland politics could probably predict the party’s stance on any given issue before Jim Allister’s party has voiced its opinion.

Credit :Sinn FeinGarrett HarganTwitterEmailMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA victims’ campaigner has questioned the use of the Europa Hotel as the setting for Sinn Fein’s election launch, saying it’s a venue the Provisional IRA “systematically bombed”.On Tuesday, Michelle O’Neill gave a speech at the Great Victoria Street hotel, which was bombed  times during the Troubles.She outlined Sinn Fein’s priorities ahead of the upcoming election including the cost of living crisis and “fiercely defending” the Good Friday Agreement.“The facts are that the balance of power at Stormont has shted irreversibly and political unionism must come to terms with the fact the world is moving on fast,” Ms O’Neill said.“So, while the DUP and the TUV are trying to take us backwards, our message is clear, we are only moving forward.”Commenting on the choice of venue, Kenny Donaldson, spokesman for Innocent Victims United said: Sinn Fein clearly don#t do irony, to bleat on about upholding democracy at the very venue which the Provisional IRA systematically attacked again and again, making it the most bombed hotel in Europe is brazen to say the least.However, due to the intensity of the Provisional IRA#s bombing campaign — and that of other terrorists, few hotel venues across Northern Ireland have come away unscathed by the Troubles.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up TUV South Belfast candidate Andrew Girvin said Sinn Fein’s campaign launch at the Europa was a “grotesque spectacle” given the setting.“Here we had the political wing of the terrorist organisation which repeatedly bombed the hotel in which they met daring to ponticate about democracy and respecting the will of the people.“There is nothing undemocratic about refusing to operate the Belfast Agreement structures which could foist a Sinn Fein First Minister upon Northern Ireland.“The choice of venue for this republican jamboree underscores the fact that no unionist should ever agree to take up the position of deputy to a Sinn Fein First Minister.“Yet just weeks out from the election both the DUP and UUP are dodging this vital question.Will they act as bridesmaid to Michelle O#Neill  Why is there reluctance to be open and honest with the public on this point ”The DUP#s Gordon Lyons said Sinn Fein#s election launch demonstrates their priority lies on holding a border poll rather than on helping families or rebuilding Northern Ireland’s economy.The party#s director of elections said: Sinn Fein#s rally was a show of strength for a border poll.“Whilst the DUP has a five-point plan to build a better future for Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein wants to win the election to implement their plan for a border poll.“There is a clear choice on offer to people whether they want a future focused on fixing our health system, tackling the cost of living crisis and replacing the protocol, or one fixated on a isive border poll.“When Michelle O#Neill talks about making history, we know it isn#t record levels of investment into our hospitals she is referring to. Now is not the time for ision and uncertainty.That is why this election is so important.Sinn Fein has been contacted for comment.Speaking at an election launch, Ms O’Neill said that Sinn Fein will defend but not renegotiate the Good Friday Agreement.The former Deputy First Minister said those who hanker for the past need to realise that there is no going back, only forward.Sinn Fein#s Stormont leader also described the DUP#s collapse of the Executive as political vandalism, although her own party also brought Stormont down in the same Assembly mandate.She said: When the Assembly, Executive and North South Ministerial Council were restored in January  it was with a shared commitment to deliver the public services, societal reforms and future that our people need and deserve.It was ambitious to form a five-party coalition Executive, but it was achieved, getting us back to genuine power-sharing, and thankfully so, because while everyone knew there would be challenges ahead, no one could have predicted that in only a matter of weeks that our Executive would be dealing with a global pandemic that would have such devastating impacts on every part of society, community and people#s lives and livelihoods.It is to the credit of all ministers from across the five parties that they responded and have worked with a unity of purpose, and unity of leadership for the past two years.This is what the public want to see more of — co-operation and delivery.Ms O#Neill added: Sinn Fein will be defending, not renegotiating the Good Friday Agreement now, or in the time ahead.Ms O#Neill said the May  election was the most important in a generation.Related topicsSinn FéinMichelle O#NeillIRACost of LivingTraditional Unionist VoiceGordon LyonsThe Executive OfficeMore On Sinn Féin PremiumGail WalkerOpinionThere’s an easy way for BBC NI to defend its broadcasters against toxic sectarian slurs PremiumPoles apart: politicians and experts split over election posters’ value PremiumSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worseDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson claims Sinn Fein ‘solely focused’ on border pollAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From gerrymandering and an April Fools’ wish list to Northern Ireland’s most unambiguous partyMost ReadCouncillor praises INLA killers of MP and Thatcher aide Airey NeaveFormer RTÉ and BBC football pundit arrested after being found passed out in car with children in the backBelfast-made missile downs Russian chopper in UkraineSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worseIlluminating Belmont property is full of mass appealTop VideosPlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayThe moment a Belfast made Starstreak missile shoots down a Russian helicopter PlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election Poles apart: politicians and experts split over election posters’ valueAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From gerrymandering and an April Fools’ wish list to Northern Ireland’s most unambiguous partyNorthern Ireland is the ‘begging bowl corner’ of the UK, Doug Beattie claimsSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatSam McBrideOpinionUlster Unionist Party’s all things to all people manesto involves ambition as well as populismLatestMan shot dead in DublinTaoiseach: We must do better to create a fairer education system in Northern Ireland’s schoolsUkrainian refugees to be offered employment help at famous Dublin cafeRathcoole residents left shaken exactly one year on from harrowing double murder-suicideSchoolgirl to sit exams after having brain tumour the size of an orange removed,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Brian Lawless PAMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe UUP manesto has enough meat to show that the party is starting to think seriously about being a major player in the Executive once more, and enough bare bones to reveal that the process is incomplete.At , words, this document is serious in its scope and suffused with the liberal unionist tone of new leader Doug Beattie.But it is what this manesto does not say which reveals most: hard choices or unpopular proposals are either absent or presented in oblique terms — and that jars with Mr Beattie’s straight-talking style.Health is the first and the iest section — unsurprisingly, given that polling has shown Robin Swann to be Stormont’s most popular minister.The manesto indicates support for radical measures, saying that the pandemic has shown that both patients and medics are willing “to travel longer distancesit means receiving care and support in a more timely manner. It is essential that the opportunities currently before us are not lost”.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreNo united Ireland for generations to come, UUP leader insistsAndrew Madden:OpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudgeThat seems to hint at support for implementing the decades of reports which say Northern Ireland has too many small hospitals, some of which need to be closed or downgraded to centralise expertise in centres of excellence.But the UUP is not explicit about this.There are other hints of centralising services — “a regionally consistent approach to cancer services across Northern Ireland” with “regional pathways and rapid diagnostic clinics”.The party also proposes greater evening and weekend use of theatres, but hints at the cost by saying it will mean “properly incentivising the move towards a genuine seven day a week health service”.Signicantly, the party says it would ban the use of contract agency workers — but only “once the immediate HSC pressures subside” .Health trusts are sharply criticised, with the UUP saying that for too long “sub-optimal trust performances [have been] tolerated”, something which suggests frustration at what Mr Swann has seen within the system.His solution is a new operationally independent HSC chief executive accountable to a board with political, professional and civic society membership, similar to the Policing Board.On the NI Protocol, the UUP says that “unionists cannot accept an internal border within the United Kingdom. There can be no border in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain”.That simple commitment seems to prevent the UUP signing up to any revised protocol involving an Irish Sea border.Its tone is dferent to the DUP, talking about wanting to “maintain good relations with the EU”, but the content is similar to that of the ERG — pushing mutual enforcement, with a new north-south body to oversee this. A requirement to label GB goods coming into NI “for UK sale only” would only avoid a new Irish Sea borderit was enforced for all UK products.The party would ban gay conversion therapy, establish a gambling regulator, allocate overdue investment to football stadia, and examine letting private garages do MoT tests.The party opposes a Troubles amnesty and robustly says paramilitaries “need to be put out of business permanently” by focussing on their leaderships and criminal assets. It wants to curb legal aid, due to “the culture of lawfare which has been allowed to develop within our legal system and which has proved extremely lucrative for a number of firms”.The manesto is laden with more spending — new train stops, new busses, new roads, more rates relief for some businesses, spending on city deals,  more police officers, and looking at giving everyone in primary school a free meal.How this would be paid for is unclear. There is no talk of increasing rates. Water charges are ruled out. And giving Stormont more tax powers is also rejected. Changing the status of NI Waterand the Housing Executive to allow them to borrow is about as far as funding proposals go.This is a detailed document, yet many of the proposals are all things to all people – it is pro-business, but also pro-worker pro-grammar schools, but looking to review how academic selection operates, pro-EU, but anti-protocol.None of those things are necessarily contradictory, but in not being clearer about some of the most controversial or unpopular areas, the party is putting off having to take those decisions until after they’ve got the votes.Related topicsUlster Unionist PartyDoug BeattieThe Executive OfficeRobin SwannNI ProtocolMore On Ulster Unionist Party PremiumCouncil concern for future of famous Derry store Austins amid fears it could collapseAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudge PremiumJust £k spent as multi-million pound Northern Ireland football stadiums scheme lies idleCarrickfergus murder probe: Woman’s horror at reservoir body find PremiumSam McBrideOpinionDUP gains ground, but overall support drops for ided unionismMost ReadCouncillor praises INLA killers of MP and Thatcher aide Airey NeaveFormer RTÉ and BBC football pundit arrested after being found passed out in car with children in the backBelfast-made missile downs Russian chopper in UkraineSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worseIlluminating Belmont property is full of mass appealTop VideosPlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayThe moment a Belfast made Starstreak missile shoots down a Russian helicopter PlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election Poles apart: politicians and experts split over election posters’ valueAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From gerrymandering and an April Fools’ wish list to Northern Ireland’s most unambiguous partyNorthern Ireland is the ‘begging bowl corner’ of the UK, Doug Beattie claimsSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudgeLatestMan shot dead in DublinTaoiseach: We must do better to create a fairer education system in Northern Ireland’s schoolsUkrainian refugees to be offered employment help at famous Dublin cafeRathcoole residents left shaken exactly one year on from harrowing double murder-suicideSchoolgirl to sit exams after having brain tumour the size of an orange removed,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Irsquod just broken up with my first girlfriend and I think it was me subconsciously expressing stuff about that.Confirming the sci-fi influence, Tim mdash who recently became a dad for the first time mdash said Girl From Mars mostly revolves around the verse and chorus.ldquoI wrote them as a slow little strummy thing and then when we worked on it as a band we rocked it out quite a lot. My little brother Pat was always my first port of call of seeinga song was good and then Irsquod bring it to [bandmates] Mark [Hamilton] and Rick [McMurray].ldquoI used to love going and knocking on his bedroom door and playing him ideas and I remember that he flipped out about the song and loved it. He had the idea for the quiet verse after the guitar solo and it was great.Tim said as soon as the band started playing it they got a really good reaction from their friends.ldquoI used to play stuff before Irsquod even fully written the lyrics wersquod play stuff at shows and Irsquod mumble my way through it. I donrsquot think I wrote the second verse until we actually recorded it two years later.ldquoI wasnrsquot too worried about lyrics back then, maybe because I listened to Nirvana so much and could never really understand them. Our manager and the record label were sure it was going to be a hit, so we put it aside until wersquod be able to promote it. We put it out as a single two weeks after leaving school and it just blew up.Meanwhile, as part of the Church Street investment plan in Downpatrick, around pound, has been earmarked for a shop front improvement scheme with the emphasis on painting and repairing existing facades.Elsewhere, it is proposed to spend pound, on what is being described as a ldquoconcept design of Church Street with the work due to be carried out by a consultant, with pound, earmarked for improving shop fronts in Bridge Street.Fteen thousand pounds has been earmarked for De Courcey Place in English Street to replace a number of heritage-style lamps and signposts, alongside the provision of new litter bins and planting out existing granite water troughs.Just over pound, is to be spent on other planting and landscaping schemes in the Church Street area, while there are also proposals for a new bus stop and power washing the area outside the former telephone exchange, with new safety railings installed outside  Church Street.There are also plans to invest pound, on new interpretation material highlighting the Tower Bell at Down Parish Church and the grave of United Irishman Thomas Russell in the church grounds.Last Christmas, new festive lighting was provided on the side of the Down Arts Centre and on trees in De Courcey Place.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has praised everyone involved with the work in Church Street, in particular, the talented artists responsible for the murals.ldquoCongratulations to everyone involved in the project designed to breath new le into this part of the town. Given the fact that it has missed out on major funding over many years, the pound, investment initiative is particularly welcome, he said.ldquoThe money will help property owners revitalise their respective businesses at a key part of the town where there are a number of family-owned businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynagross make it past Castlewellan  ","story":"BALLYNAGROSS progressed to the final of the Harry Clarke Cup after defeating Castlewellan Forest by way of penalty shoot-out at Ballyhornan on Friday night.Ballynagross arrived at the match looking for a fourth Harry Clarke final in a row, but Castlewellan Forest had momentum following a close win against Ardglass in the quarter-final.Ballynagross got off to the best start they could have hoped for after a great attack from their defence through the field found Philip Doran, who easily finished to put his side one up in the first seven minutes.Castlewellan stepped it up a gear when a throw-in close to the box found Aidan Dornan, who headed just wide.Castlewellan had an appeal for hand ball ruled out closely after in the Ballynagross box, with the referee having none of it.Ballynagross responded to the pressure from Castlewellan with a pass from Philip Doran to Shea McComiskey out on the right wing. McComiskey saw team-mate Joseph Burns in the mouth of the goal and looped the ball in, but Burnsrsquo effort goes just wide.Castlewellan had their first real chance on the th minute when their corner-kick met the head of Donagh Steele. However, the ball went just over the bar.Ballynagross got their second goal on the th minute after a throw-in from Ryan Tumelty to John Shields allowed the attacker to spray a pass to the right wing to find team-mate Doran. The lively lsquoGross forward found Joseph Burns and the chance was duly converted into a goal.With half-time nearing, it looked like Ballynagross would be going into the interval with a comfortable lead, but an error when clearing the ball from the defence enabled Castlewellanrsquos David Gilmore to close the lead to just a goal as the referee blew his whistle.Castlewellan came out in the second-half with an all out attack approach and it paid off through a corner kick in the st minute.This time Donagh Steele ensured the ball was going into the back of the net and the game was level. It was not to stay this way for long as the Castlewellan goalkeeper clearly took Ballynagrossrsquo Shea McComiskey down inside the box and a penalty was awarded.Connor Marron stepped up to take the penalty and finished well into the top left corner of the net.Castlewellan continued to push forward, but Ballynagross defence of Corey Davis, Connor Marron, Ryan Tumelty and Tom McNeill were holding strong.For the next  minutes it was pretty even, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan took a chance on the edge of the box but Cathail Arnold easily saved. Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick close to the Ballynagross net, but David Gilmorersquos effort was straight at the goalkeeper.Ballynagross had a chance from a corner but it was well cleared by Castlewellan.Forest striker Shane Mooney found himself booked for his comments to the referee in the rd minute.Castlewellan were very much seeking out a goal to level and it came in the th minute after a scrap for the ball in Ballynagrossrsquo box resulted in Shane Mooney scoring with the last kick of the game to send the tie to extra-time.There were a few chances during extra-time for Ballynagross, although neither team could find a break through to escape the need for penalties. Castlewellan swapped out Brian McVeigh in goal for Sean Dornan.Ballynagrossrsquo Connor Marron, who had already scored a penalty during the game, was first to step up and easily converted.Castlewellanrsquos Shane Mooney and Ballynagrossrsquo Declan Dowie followed and both scored.Forestrsquos new lsquokeeper Dornan came out of the net and rushed his penalty, sending the ball over the bar.John Mahoney made no mistake to give his lsquoGross side a further advantage before Ciaran Stratton kept Castlewellan in with a chance.Ballynagrossrsquo John Shields walked up to take his penalty but the lsquokeeper saved to bring it level again.Eoin Travers converted his penalty and now it was sudden death.Tom McNeill confidentially scored his penalty meaning all of the pressure fell on Castlewellanrsquos Ryan Morgan to keep the game going.However, his effort was saved resulting in Ballynagross progressing to the final.Ballynagross: C Arnold, T McNeill, R Tumelty, C Marron, C Davis, J Polley, J Shields, J Burns, L Shields, P Doran, S McComiskeySubs: D Craig, D Dowie, J Mahoney, K Taggart, A Beattie.Castlewellan Forest: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, J OrsquoNeill, N Travers, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, A Dornan, D Gilmore Subs: S Kinley, G Kidd, E Travers, R Morgan, J Murnin..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dismal end to league campaign  ","story":"DOWN senior footballersrsquo miserable campaign reached its conclusion as they lost out on home soil to Clare on Sunday.The Mourne side entered this fixture already relegated from Division  and were hoping to gain some,any, momentum ahead of their crucial upcoming Ulster campaign.The uphill task will include having to better Monaghan on May  and then the winner of Cavan and Antrim to make the concluding stage to feature in the All-Ireland series and avoid ato the second-tier championship.Down took to the field in Newry against a Clare side who had endured a mixed bag of results within their league fixtures having won their opening three before losing the next trio of matches.For Down, the loss concludes a point-starved run of fixtures having finished with just one draw and six losses.Clare fielded what appeared to be a physically stronger outfit than their counterparts at Paacuteirc Esler and Downrsquos efforts werenrsquot aided by their lack of discipline.Both Gerard Collins and Pat Havern picked up black cards towards the end of each half while team-mate Finn McElroy picked up a red card with  minutes played.By that stage, the Mourne side didnrsquot appear to be getting anything from the game but that will be little solace to Down boss James McCartan, who has endured a nightmare beginning to his second stint at the helm.Aaron Grfin scored the first goal of the match with nine minutes played, courtesy of a smart left-footed finish which bested Kilcoo-native Niall Kane at his near post.To their credit, Down showed some resilience and managed to notch the next four from five points available with Burren man Liam Kerr kicking over a well-taken score amongst these.However, Clare continued to attack the Down goal and found their second major of the match thanks to Cian OrsquoDearsquos effort.His lowly struck shot took the wind out of Downrsquos sails and the Mourne side entered the break six points adrt at -

ndash The Government is poised to unveil an astonishing pound million scheme to replace the Strangford ferry service with a road tunnel under the lough.The scheme has already been approved at ministerial level and it is believed that the pound million originally intended for the Downpatrick bypass road will be used as start-up capital, with phase top-up grants being sought from the European Community and the Ireland Fund as the scheme progresses.Plans for the mile-long road tunnel have been drawn up by senior consultants engaged by the government and it is believed that the entry points will be manned toll booth terminals in Strangford and Portaferry.The move to replace the ferry service with a tunnel received an extra impetus recently when it was revealed that the ferry service was running at a substantial loss and villagers in Strangford vetoed plans for a new jetty for the vessels.Sources within the government say that the tunnel plan, which has been gathering dust for a number of years, has now been reactivated and local roads bosses intend erting the money intended for Downpatrickrsquos ring road to the scheme before the end of the financial year.Publicly, however, officials are remaining tight-lipped about the project. ldquoThe tunnel plan was first put forward several years ago, but as far as I am aware there are no plans to revive it, said a press office spokesperson.Nevertheless, conservation organisations have been consulted about the possible environmental impact of a tunnel, and a study of its possible effects has been carried out by a university team under the guidance of Prof A Lilo.Prof Lilo told the Recorder: ldquoAs far as I can see, there would be little threat to the loughrsquos balanced ecosystem from a tunnel.There may, however, be an unsightly visual impact created by the large tunnel entrances needed in Strangford and Portaferry.CASTLEWELLAN ndash A new school is to be constructed on the site of the existing St Malachyrsquos High School in Castlewellan, it has been revealed this week.South Down MP Mr Eddie McGrady said he has been informed of the commitment of the Department of Education to a new school in the town.ldquoAn investment appraisal has recently been carried out by the Department of Education to consider how best to meet the long-term needs of the pupils at St Malachyrsquos and this has come out in favour of a new school on the existing site, he added.Mr McGrady said this week: ldquoI welcome this development as I have been making on-going representations on the matter to Lord Belstead and his predecessor as Education Minister, Dr Brian Mawhinney.ldquoThe school definitely requires additional accommodation and I am keen that is is provided on the existing site, he added.DOWNPATRICK ndash Teenagers, some as young as , are taking part in open-air drinking parties at secluded parts of Downpatrick it was revealed this week.The youth are paying adults to buy drink for them and then going to quiet parts of the town for their parties, a special meeting was told on Tuesday.The police have raided a number of these gatherings in recent months but the teenagers simply move to a dferent location and continue their drinking sprees.While the problem of underage drinking in Downpatrick has not risen in recent years it is nevertheless sufficiently worrying to prompt a group of local community representatives to get together to discuss ways of tackling the issue.Last week youth workers, headmasters, teachers, publicans and councillors met together under the auspices of the RUCrsquos Community Relations Branch and debated the causes and possible remedies of underage drinking.The end result of the discussion was that public awareness needs to be heightened, while teenagers, and their parents, should be appraised of the dangers of alcohol abuse in the young.Superintendent Ronnie Hawthorne, Downpatrick sub-isional commander explained that the problem is a

and we cannot stop underage drinkers ourselves, we need the help of the whole community, said Superintendent Hawthorne.ldquoThere are a lot associated problems with underage drinking and we will talk

environmental appearance, it has been revealed.A preliminary application has been made to the International Fund for a core project to help trigger a revival in the townrsquos fortunes.And by the end of the year, plans to designate the town as a conservation area will be completed.The investment in Killyleaghrsquos future was revealed when the chairman of Down District Council, Mr Sean Quinn, officially launched proposals for the regeneration of the town.A special exhibition in the townrsquos library also features a display on the proposed conservation area for Killyleagh.Mr Quinn referred to community-led initiatives in Seeconnell and Strangford, and stressed the importance of a community coming together to take full advantage of the funding which is available to help themselves.The South Down MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, told the launch gathering that he has been delighted to assist the committee towards its goals of reviving the town.Mr McGrady said Killyleagh had recognised that it was very much an era of self-help.He looked forward to the day when Killyleagh is selected as the site for the Strangford Lough Liaison Office and is designated as the Gateway to Strangford Lough, fulfilling its tourist potential.LEITRIM ndash An  month battle to have a Leitrim footpath declared a right of way has found its way to Westminster.The Parliamentary Commissioner for Complaints has been asked to investigate Banbridge Councilrsquos handling of the matter after more than  people signed a petition asking for the adoption of the footpath as a right-of-way.The footpath, which is marked on ordnance survey maps dating from , sketches from the town lands of Slievenisky and Backaderry, through Carrivmoragh mountain and descends towards Leitrim by Heronrsquos Road.Local people claim that the path is very old and was once used to reach a Mass Rock on the Backaderry Mountain and in later times, to give a short-cut to the new church in Leitrim.It is also believed the footpath is part of the old highway system that existed before the road system was introduced, and links into a system of lanes that go to Ballynahinch.The Council first became involved in the matter in August  when the petition was formally presented, and shortly afterwards the council voted overwhelmingly to adopt the pathway, subject to legal opinions.However, for the next  months no progress was made on the matter until the council appointed a countryside officer in August . He prepared a report on the footpath, which came before the council earlier this month when it was decided not to adopt itAfterwards a statement from some of the local people seeking the right-of-way said the footpath passes over land belonging to  dferent families and only one has an objection to the council adopting it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Good Morning Down co","story":"THE head of one of the districtrsquos leading charities is officially stepping down from her role next month.Linda Baker has been Good Morning Downrsquos co-ordinator for the past  years and has watched the organisation mdash which provides a telephone befriending service to elderly and vulnerable people across the district mdash increases its operation considerably.The charity provides a valuable leline service to many people across the district, with its hardworking volunteers in regular contact with those who feel vulnerable or at risk, making telephone calls to members at an agreed time each morning.Linda said the service was especially important during the height of the coronavirus pandemic with the deadly virus unfortunately curtailing get-togethers that were organised for clients.Working in partnership with the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership, the South Eastern Trust and the Housing Executive, the charity has also received invaluable support from the Allen Lane Foundation and and Halax Community Foundation.ldquoWhen I joined Good Morning Down there were four volunteers making calls to around  people. Since then, the organisation has grown and the level of support we provided has widened considerably, Linda revealed.ldquoWe now have a team of  volunteers who are in contact with  people across the district. Despite the global pandemic, we continued to deliver the service from our homes with the calls even more appreciated by clients who could not go out themselves.Linda said that during the pandemic, the volunteers made an additional  calls to people, such was the need of elderly and vulnerable people across the community.ldquoWe started off calling people for a little friendly chat but the service we provided started to evolve. While chatting with clients remains at the heart of what we do to support those who are isolated, we now find ourselves helping people with a range of complex needs.ldquoThe charityrsquos work has evolved and I suppose it will continue to in the future, but Good Morningrsquos Down core principle will always remain the same.Linda paid tribute to all the charityrsquos staff and those who have supported the organisation over many years.ldquoWe are like family and I will be sorry to leave, she said. ldquoI have spent a large part of my working le with Good Morning Down and have literally lived and breathed the organisation and have been assisted by great people.Linda said it was ldquotremendous to meet clients when the charity organised its get-togethers and while these were put on hold due to the pandemic, she hopes there may be an opportunity do something before the end of the year.ldquoThat of course will be guided by the public health situation at the time as we are mindful that our clients are elderly, with a number of them also vulnerable.Linda said the charityrsquos service has never been more important and while she is leaving the organisation, she knows it will continue to be a key part of peoplersquos lives.She added: ldquoI really enjoyed my time with Good Morning Down and worked alongside really great people. They were the friendly voice at the end of the telephone who helped make a dference to peoplersquos lives.ldquoFor many, their chat with our volunteers was the only interaction they would have with others during the day and we were always conscious of that. We worked to make a dference and you build a special relationship with clients which is why it was so wonderful to see them when we all did meet up.As Linda prepares to say her final goodbyes, Good Morning Down is looking for someone to replace her at the helm of the charity.Anyone keen to take on taking on her role or interested in getting involved in the work of Good Morning Down is asked to contact her on    or email lindabakergmd@yahoo..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"History project looks back at  Jewish family’s links to Shrigley  ","story":"THE remarkable contribution of Jewish families in saving Shrigley has been recalled in a unique history project.The story of how Jews, fleeing the Holocaust and Hitlers murderous purge in Europe, started arriving in the village just before the start of the Second World War and helped transform the fortunes of villagers after the Hungry Thirties is largely forgotten.But more than  years later, Shrigleys legacy is featuring in an on-line interactive map telling the stories of Jewish families who have left a lasting impact on Northern Ireland.Steven Jaffe has been researching the heritage of the Jewish community across Northern Ireland.ldquoThe goal of the Belfast Jewish Heritage project Shared History fund is to locate, preserve, document and make publicly available material relating to the Jewish community in Northern Ireland, said Mr Jaffe.ldquoIt shows  sites across Northern Ireland, including Shrigley, Saintfield and Downpatrick.

They also cause signicant damage to wildle and the environment.Mourne Heritage Trust staff helped with the response to last weekrsquos wildfires using strimmers to create fire breaks, also helping with a controlled back burn and using its argocat all-terrain vehicle and fogging unit to extinguish one branch of a fire that was threatening some field boundaries.In addition, one of the Trustrsquos teams, along with a firefighter, used this specialist equipment to extinguish the fire at Finlieve near Rostrevor.NI Water has also warned that wildfires can have impact on drinking water supplies.The organisation controls so-called water catchment areas in the Mournes which supply water to all of Northern Ireland. The organisation said while it is working hard to deal with the problem of wildfires, it wants to assure customers that tap water quality is unaffected and is of a very high quality.But NI Water has warned that wildfires within catchments not only pose a terrible risk to all le but can remove the primary layer of vegetation, leaving the burned bare soil exposed to erosion which then makes its way into the reservoirs, from where water is abstracted for treatment to provide drinking water.ldquoThe erosion caused by wildfire increases carbon and other polluting chemicals signicantly in untreated water, with sediment accumulating in streams, lakes and reservoirs, said NI Waterrsquos Rebecca Allen.ldquoThis makes raw water especially dficult and more expensive to treat at our facilities to the stringent standards required by the Drinking Water Regulations. A signicant amount of other work by our water supply colleagues also has to be undertaken at the treatment works to ensure excellent quality drinking water during these times.Rebecca added: ldquoExtra water samples have to be collected and analysed, streams from burned areas need isolated, and other remedial measures must be taken like blocking streams to protect reservoirs.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has praised firefighters, other arms of the emergency services and the Mourne Heritage Trust for their efforts to bring the blaze at the Bloody Bridge under control.He said firefighters in particular were overwhelmed by the support from the community.ldquoI witnessed the devastation of the wildfire first hand which impacted a site that is a protected habitat renowned around the world, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoThe emergency services, particularly local fire crews, should be commended for the professionalism they displayed when dealing with these incidents. However, malicious fires place a massive strain on very limited resources and as we approach the summer I would urge people to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the PSNI.Cllr Clarke said the damage caused by gorse fires has a lasting impact and that areas of outstanding natural beauty can take years to recover, calling for a co-ordinated response from the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, NI Water, health and public safety departments and the Department of Justice.He continued: ldquoWe need to see a collective response with a sharing of resources and there needs to be additional funding provided to build upon the best practice Mourne Heritage Trust has undertaken to reduce the impact of these fires in the High Mournes. Controlled burns and better land-management needs to be re-established.ldquoMeasures should include the establishment of fire breaks to reduce the fuel load and a cross-departmental strategic response to ensure that the scale of these fires should never happen again.Cllr Clarke said it is important that police proactively investigate what are environmental crimes and those responsible need to be assured that these types of crime will not be tolerated in society.South Down MLA Sinead Ennis has also praised firefighters for their efforts in battling huge fires in the Mournes which started at Hen Mountain and Spelga Dam.She added: ldquoTragically, these fires will have caused widespread damage to the environment and our wildle. This is yet another stark reminder that everyone must behave responsibly while visiting the Mournes in order to protect the environment and the safety of the local community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Reality TV star Matthew visits ex primary school  ","story":"FRESH from Dancing With The Stars Ireland, TV star Matthew MacNabb and his new girlfriend took the chance to visit his former primary school last week.Matthew and his professional dance partner, Laura Nolan, visited St Patrickrsquos Primary School, Legamaddy, after making it to the semi-final of the top RTE show.The visit to the school, which the Downpatrickrsquos manrsquos brother and sisters also attended, coincided with the school celebrating news of receiving a sizeable grant.It has been awarded pound, which will go towards creating a pollinator garden in the school grounds.Pupils were delighted to show Matthew and Laura around the school, particularly its new outdoor learning hub which allows to have an outdoor classroom for eco projects.The schoolrsquos Eco teacher, Mrs Bronagh Reid, said the school was delighted to welcome Matthew back.ldquoHe was very friendly to all the pupils, who found him very inspiring, said Mrs Reid. ldquoIt was good that he called with us on a day off and it was down to his mother Margaret, who sits on our board of governors.ldquoWe were all hoping that Matthew would make into the final but very impressed that he cog to the semi-final.The schoolrsquos cash injection is part of the Rural Community Pollinator Grants Scheme, which is financed by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsand managed by the civic-pride campaign, Live Here Love Here.It is designed to allow community groups and schools across rural Northern Ireland to benefit from funding between pound, to pound, to establish, enhance or develop a local community pollinator garden.A pollinator garden is a shared space with pollinating plants, habitats, wildflowers, flowers, shrubs and trees, and the grants support new initiatives aimed at protecting and providing for pollinators.Mrs Sarah McDowell, principal, said: ldquoWe plan to use the money to create an outdoor learning space which will enhance our school grounds and the local community.ldquoWe will build an outdoor classroom and plant fruit trees to attract more wildle to our school grounds.`We are delighted to receive the support of Live Here Love Here to help us create this space which will benefit the children in our school and will help to improve bioersity in the area.She added: ldquoWe look forward to starting to create this area after Christmas and have it ready for the spring term.The pilot scheme, which made pound. million available for  , aims to cover % of costs to community groups and schools wishing to embark on the community environmental project.Successful grant applicants were required to illustrate their plans to maximise pollinator-friendly land-management techniques to increase the bioersity value of an area by planting for pollinators, and to transform unused spaces into valued community spaces, adding habitats and greening-up formerly grey areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Students involved in All Island lights switch off climate event  ","story":"THE lights went out at Stormont at the weekend thanks to ecologically aware local high school studentsA group of pupils from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and Down High School, who are involved in the All-Island Schools  Climate Action programme, asked for the lights at Stormont to be switched off for one hour on Saturday evening.Local MLAs Harry Harvey and Colin McGrath helped ensure that the request was fast-tracked, with Mr Harveyrsquos we, Sharon, doing a lot of the work behind the scenes.Mr Harvey met with staff and pupils from the two schools in the grounds of Parliament Buildings to observe the dimming of the lights.Stormont joined in solidarity with the  countries from around the world that participated in the th anniversary of the global Earth Hour.

In the st century these circuits are flowing back in the opposite direction, pulling millions upon millions of tourist-driven pounds into Northern Ireland’s economic heart, boosting expenditure and creating jobs after the devastation of the Pandemic. The city’s sea faring tradition both naval and merchant over the centuries is not only one to be proud of but also to take hope from. Belfast rose up around its lough and the Lagan. The news about Titanic Belfast’s first outstanding decade, the cruise ships , the salvation of HMS Caroline remind us of the regenerative power of the city’s waterway to the world.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

But when it comes to casting their ballots, up to % of people who go have hitherto gone to the polls in NI elections have voted for political parties who are primarily identied by their stance on the constitutional question.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Even in recent elections the non-aligned centre ground, despite having surged , are doing well to get more than % of the votes.Do not be fooled by anyone who says that the protocol is only of importance to unionists, and that even many unionists do not care. Many of the people who make this point themselves care very much about the Irish Sea border — they want to keep it, either because they support staying in the EU , or because they see it as major step towards an economic united Ireland, and thus towards a more general all-Ireland.It is true that many of the more apolitical unionists are much more relaxed about the protocol than they should be, but that is typically because it is complex .It is also because such unionists heard that the protocol offered the best of both worlds .Thus unionists should have been, and should still be, trying to explain and reiterate to some of the more apathetic pro Union voters the ultimate impact of the NI Protocol. This would entail trying to revive some of the spirit of indignation that there was in the early months of , when many people across the Province were suddenly finding that they could not get deliveries from Great Britain that they had always been able to get before.The EU has been keen to agree to case-by-case exemptions to checks in part because it does not want the wider public to be troubled by the protocol. Needless to say, therefore, unionists badly need to see a large vote for parties that oppose the protocol.Doug Beattie’s approach to the Irish Sea border, of opposing it but calling for engagement in the pursuit of political solutions to the problems that it creates, has a high-wire quality. If the Alliance vote goes down, even slightly, on recent elections, and the Ulster Unionist Party vote increases, Mr Beattie will be able to say that his tactics have stemmed the decline of unionism by broadening its appeal.If Alliance continues upwards, and the UUP does not rise, he will be seen to have not only been weak on the protocol, but having failed to win over moderates in the process.l The second key thing to watch out for in the election is turnoutThere was a time in the s and early s when it seemed voters in the western world were losing interest in politics.Countries such as the UK and United States were increasingly wealthy and many bitter political disagreements of the s and s seemed to give way to a more bland, moderate politics. In Northern Ireland itself, this wider trend towards consensus seemed to be reflected in the  Belfast Agreement. But this sense of stable politics has evaporated, at home and abroad. There are now bitter ides on major issues of national and global importance, and much turbulence in voting patterns.The Brexit referendum of  had a higher turnoutthan most recent UK general elections have done.The Scottish independence plebiscite in  had an even higher turnout .The fiercely contested, and narrowly decided, US presidential election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden in November  had one of the highest turnouts of any presidential race in modern memory .In Northern Ireland, the turnout surged from % of voters in the  Stormont election to % a year later, in the more fraught atmosphere of the election after Sinn Fein collapsed the institutions.There is now keen interest in conflicts and politics at home and abroad. Before Russia invaded Ukraine, I feared people in the UK would not care much, seeing it as a distant problem. I was relieved to be proven wrong by the massive interest there was in such a serious global matter.A high turnout next month would show that the population in NI still think that Stormont and issues such as the protocol matter.l The final thing to watch is the vote shares of the two communitiesWill it be like the  general election, when the DUP and Sinn Fein dominated thingsor like  when they plunged to a combined % Will unionists get a combined vote share in the high s %, as in the  and  Stormont elections, or will they be down round %, as in  Westminster  Will nationalists combined get more than % of the vote, as they have done in some elections, or go back under that level It will be a bad day indeed for unionismthe combined vote is as low as %, as some polls have suggested, or even in the high s.ProtocolNorthern IrelandDoug BeattieBen LowryIrish Sea  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most Popular‘TUV - No Sea Border’ given approval for ballot papers‘SF wants to sleepwalk other parties into border poll plan’Lough Neagh is shrinking and could be gone by Ben Lowry: Three things to watch out for in the coming Stormont electionRamadan : What is Ramadan  Ramadan dates  - and how to wish someone a happy RamadanMost PopularAldi’s popular hanging egg chair is back in stock - here’s how to buy online, and how much it costsBest women’s walking trousers for hiking : hiking trousers reviewed, from Arc-Teryx, Jack Wolfskin, AcaiBest patio heaters UK : weatherproof electric heaters and coal firepits, from Made, Wayfair, ConranAldi’s sell-out pet sofa is back for  - how to buy, and the best alternative pet sofas UKBike helmets UK : Eight best cycling helmets for women                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-jQrDum sc-fvxzrP bUrEZo ivPtAx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Stormont Health Minister Robin Swann says that testing will continue to play a vital role in Northern Ireland’s response to COVID- over the coming months but that a “more targeted approach” will be introduced on a phased basis from April, with the focus on supporting and protecting those at highest risk of serious illness.Under the new policy, PCR testing in NI will cease for most people with symptoms from  April - however free lateral flow tests will continue to be available to the public to use should they develop Covid symptoms.Lateral flow tests will also continue to be available free of charge to support those living in, working in or visiting a higher risk setting, such as a care home, until the end of June, with a further review then.The policy covers testing and contact tracing and takes effect from  April. No changes will be introduced in Northern Ireland until that date. The policy will be kept under review during the period of transition up until the end of June.The full range of changes to take effect from  April in Northern Ireland are as follows-* PCR testing will no longer be recommended or available for most people with symptoms. It will still be available to support the small group for whom it is recommended for clinical reasons. The PCR home ordering service will remain available for the general public to support those for whom PCR is recommended.* Publicly accessible COVID- testing sites will close. Local Health and Social Care Trusts will continue to provide PCR testing to support clinical care.* Those with symptoms will be advised to use lateral flow devicesto test instead of booking a PCR. This will be kept under review and could remain in place up to the end of June depending on disease trajectory.* Routine asymptomatic testing - testing for those with no symptoms - will continue to be advised for those living, working and visiting health and social care settings including hospitals and care homes and other high risk settings in line with public health advice. This will be kept under review.* Asymptomatic LFD testing for the wider population will cease. Access to free LFDs for this purpose will cease.* Routine asymptomatic workplace testing will cease.* Routine asymptomatic testing in most educational settingswill cease at the Easter break.* Asymptomatic testing in special schools will continue after Easter and will be kept under review. It may continue until the end of June .* Routine population contact tracing will be phased out between mid-April and the end of June.Chief Medical Officer Professor Sir Michael McBride said: “We will continue throughout the transition phase to support and protect our most vulnerable. After these changes are introduced from  April, I would urge people to check on NI Directtesting remains recommended for them - for examplethey are eligible for new treatments. In the coming weeks, the Department will also be working to provide advice and support to those eligible for treatments. It is particularly important that those who are at higher risk of serious illness follow the guidance on getting tested.”The Chief Medical Officer added: “The tools at our disposal to protect people who are at higher risk from COVID- have advanced considerably since the early days of the pandemic. Alongside the vaccine and booster programme, new COVID- treatments continue to be used by patients in Northern Ireland and new treatments are in development.“As the amount of testing across society reduces, our behaviour and actions have an even more important role in preventing transmission and keeping others safe. I urge everyone to continue to follow the public health guidance including continuing to wear a face covering in enclosed settings like public transport and when visiting hospitals and care homes.”The changes do not take effect until  April, and current testing provision will continue until then.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister said yesterday that the dys at Stormont particularly towards the end of the last Assembly exposed the “unworkability of mandatory coaliton, the system foisted upon Northern Ireland as a result of the Belfast Agreement.”Mr Allister added: “A draft Budget was produced this year which was not even agreed by the Executive parties amazingly the Executive Office did not provide to the Department of Finance its priorities and needs which does not link to a Programme for Government - because none has been agreed and was proposed before there was a Capital Investment Strategy.“When it comes to Stormont being granted fiscal powers TUV stands opposed, believing it would be disastrous to let squandering Stormont anywhere near the taxpayers’ pocket.”Jeffrey DonaldsonSinn FeinDUPJim AllisterNorthern Ireland Executive  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most Popular‘TUV - No Sea Border’ given approval for ballot papers‘SF wants to sleepwalk other parties into border poll plan’Lough Neagh is shrinking and could be gone by Ben Lowry: Three things to watch out for in the coming Stormont electionRamadan : What is Ramadan  Ramadan dates  - and how to wish someone a happy RamadanMost PopularAldi’s popular hanging egg chair is back in stock - here’s how to buy online, and how much it costsBest women’s walking trousers for hiking : hiking trousers reviewed, from Arc-Teryx, Jack Wolfskin, AcaiBest patio heaters UK : weatherproof electric heaters and coal firepits, from Made, Wayfair, ConranAldi’s sell-out pet sofa is back for  - how to buy, and the best alternative pet sofas UKBike helmets UK : Eight best cycling helmets for women                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-jQrDum sc-fvxzrP bUrEZo ivPtAx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Continue with six weeks holiday in the summer at least! We get the shortest summer break in the world. State should provide free affordable childcare.”Trena Wise said: “Four weeks would be better and spread the rest throughout the year.” This was agreed with by Lisa Gerrard.Trudi Thomas said: “Five weeks and an extra week off at Christmas.”Iulia Condurache said: “These kids need this. Where is this obsession to work more is coming from  School is enough, work week is too much.

For when you look at the area today, it is dficult to think of a time when Barry Island was just that an island surrounded by water at hightide.For after  for all those dams, and bridges built across The Sound, slowly dragged Barry Island to the mainland. The water logged landscape has now been lost within a landscape of housing and other development.Barry Island until  was nothing more than a place lost in time with a rundown farmhouse, outbuildings and forgotten about sacred wells until things changed. Francis Crawshay purchased Barry Island in  a very eccentric man, who saw that his new home The Marine Hotel, was to accommodate friends visiting him on the Island.You may add that the image we examine today is of a dferent structure. The original Marine Hotel of Francis Crawshay building on the start of Friars Point, was eventually renamed Friars Point House, at which point the original name became redundant. However, as Barry Island became a focal point of day trippers, and visits for those building the dock, accommodation was required.Now, towards the end of the s, the Barry and District saw the construction of a number of Hotels, and  of which, after being opened never received the licences for the purpose they were built, such as the Sea View Hotel on Dock View Road, which became the Sea View Labour Club.One of these new purpose-built hotels one of which was on Barry Island, however opened in , and adopted the name The Marine Hotel, as it was no longer being used for the grand building Friars Point. The Marine Hotel on the corner of Plymouth Road and Friars Point, was infact a much larger building than you can find today alas some parts of it were demolished over the past few decades. However, what building still remains although it is now been converted into flats, is still impressive..removeBack in the day, in the late s you entered through a very impressive Portico entrance, with stone details picked out in Portland stone. The rest of the structure utilising locally sourced Red brick. The Marine Hotel was the place to stay on Barry Island, with an array of fine rooms to stay it, after a long summer evening eating icecream on the sands of the Bay, oryou had been visiting the Barry and District on business.Now when viewing the building facing onto Friars Road, the scroll work surrounding the lettering entrapping the words  MARINE HOTEL. This is an echo of times when we built in a much grander way. Most of the buildings of note were built to last in the late s, in such a way the Marine Hotel was constructed.One thing of final note is that one local resident told me story that The Marine Hotel was a haunt of Leguards and Coastguards from Barry Island. And then ironically inquests were held into deaths caused to drowning, and other reasons at the Marine Hotel also.Many thanks for joining us this week. More from our enigmatic Barry and District next week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Her hand-painted ‘Welcome to Banbridge’ mural in Newry Street celebrates the Brontë link to the area using typography inspired by the world’s most famous literary family.Artist Friz pays homage to the town’s most famous landmark and Europe’s first ever flyover, Downshire Bridge. The mural of Irish physicist Professor Ernest Walton at Bridge Street. Picture: Edward Byrne PhotographyHer mural in Downshire Place depicts an old woman who used to sell apples on the bridge and jingle the money in her pocket, giving it the affectionate local nickname Jingler’s Bridge. Inspired by the area’s linen history, Rob Hilken’s mural at Linenhall Street depicts damask linen with a Jacquard weaving pattern that was created by local linen mills. The chrysanthemum damask design used was created by William Liddell and incorporates the distinctive pattern found on Jacquard loom punch cards, which were used to create the complex damask designs that made the Banbridge area world-famous for its linen.Belfast-based artist and illustrator FGB’smural at Bridge Street celebrates the town’s association to Irish physicist Professor Ernest Walton who was educated at Banbridge Academy Preparatory School. Friz at Downshire Place. Picture: Edward Byrne PhotographyHe won the  Nobel Prize in Physics for his pioneering work on splitting the atom nucleus. Dublin-based Decoy’s mural at Scarva Street celebrates Banbridge as a strategic river crossing point, a communication route between Belfast and Dublin and a focus for agricultural industry, trade and commerce. An ancient king’s road connecting Ulster to the rest of the island once crossed the Bann at a forging place a short distance downstream at Ballykeel.In addition to the new street art, one of Banbridge’s most iconic landmarks - a B-listed monument dedicated to Captain Crozier which memorialises his contribution to polar exploration - has undergone signicant restoration work.Holly Pereira on Newry Street.

Do something instead‘Don’t worry!’ How often have we heard that and how often do we say it to others  I suspect it’s being said quite often at the present time, when there seems to be so much to be worried about, writes Rev. Ron Elsdon.By The NewsroomSunday, rd April , : am  \"       \"  There’s the state of the Health Service, the never-ending fallout from Brexit, the war in Ukraine, and the spiralling cost of living which is already inflicting so much hardship on so many. ‘Don’t worry!’ But the problem is that it’s far easier said than done. So when you come across it in the bible as well, you could be excused for writing it off as unrealistic. Please stay with me for a few moments, however, while I try to explain.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It points you to something rather more than that. I offer you two examples where it offers you responses that are practical – strategies,you like.Ron ElsdonFirstly, Paul directs people to pray instead, and to pepper their prayers with thanksgiving . The trouble is that we’re so good at finding things to complain about, often trivialities, that finding things to give thanks for doesn’t come easily, even to people who pray regularly, but why not switch course and actually do it, then keep on doing it  Then, says Paul, the protecting peace of God is there to be discovered, even in the midst of stressful situations. Secondly, Jesus talks about worry in the Sermon on the Mount . When it consumes us, he says, what we need is a new set of ambitions which point us beyond ourselves “Seek first God’s kingdom and God’s righteousness” is His command to His followers. As I write, I’m thinking about a local politician, one I shan’t be voting for. I know he spends Christmas Day at a place for the homeless, helping to serve up hot meals for that I admire him greatly. As I write, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the army of a tyrant from the east, many with nowhere to go in freezing weather. In neighbouring countries, churches and other organisations are swinging into action to help support these folk in their hour of desperate need. So, in their dferent ways, Jesus’ and Paul’s words in the bible are saying to us all, ‘Don’t worry! Do something instead.’Read: Covid travel requirement set to change"},{"url":null,"title":" pictures of historic day as royal black institution opens new headquarters ","story":"Roy Reynolds: Rathcoole murder victim suffered ‘barbaric injuries’, court told   Murder suspect arrested after PSNI stop car on dual-carriagewayNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My Businesscanonical_urlCANONICAL_URLhostnameCANONICAL_HOSTNAMElocationCANONICAL_URLreferrerEXTERNAL_REFERRERpage_view_id_PAGE_VIEW_ID_scroll_SCROLL_HEIGHTgeo__INJECT_GEO__cid_ga:CLIENT_ID,comScore:CLIENT_ID,compass_uid:CLIENT_IDversionsha-wJFtySqNnAxBmRbBZGkmXyZeJTYkxlpMdJsFNIrrGVlru-DcIEIZ\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-container\" i-amphtml-layout\"container\"Loading...NewsPeopleThe grand opening of the headquarters was officially declared open by Sovereign Grand Master Rev William Anderson.

With his ear for a good story and eye for detail, Jack, who founded the historical group in , takes readers on a mirthful trip down memory lane.       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

They gradually gained popularity with the audience and, being held on the Monday night before the annual May Fair Day, reflected the atmosphere of jollication that pervaded the town at this special time of year.An eye-catching image from Ballyclare.“The music was provided by ious groups of instrumentalists – fiddlers, accordionists, tin whistle players – and their sessions were interspersed with songs, recitations and stories by local inidual entertainers drawn from the lore and culture of the Six Mile Water region. Many of these songs and much of the material came from an oral tradition and few were available in written form.”Verses of material from local ‘balladeers’ Ernie Scott, Sandy Robinson, Jock Gilmour and Matt Meharg together with short biographical details of these and many others feature in the pages of the book.Jack continued: “Sadly the concerts came to an end when the security situation dictated that crowds gathering in halls became impossible. The Historical Society planned to celebrate the th anniversary of the founding of the society in  by reviving the Rhymes and Ructions concert in  but the outbreak of the Covid- pandemic put paid to their plans.”In his introduction to Rhyme and Ructions Jack, who is the author of a number of local history studies including ‘Stories of a Letime’, also reveals what inspired this latest publication.Author Jack McKinney with his latest publication.“What I am endeavouring to do here is to compile a collection of the ballads and anecdotes that proved so popular at the concerts. The tone and subjects of the ballads y considerably from the amusing to those of a more contemplative nature. As for their credibility I leave the readers to assess this for themselves.”Jack has pursued his interest in local history and its characters with zeal since retiring in  after a four-decade career as an assistant and principal teacher in east Antrim primary schools. The former Mossley Primary School pupil, taught at Abbots Cross, Ballyclare and Whitehead Primary Schools. And in the manner in which he inspired many pupils, Jack is keen to share his enthusiasm for knowledge with a whole new generation of readers.A founder member of the Ulster-Scots Language Society, Jack added: “The ballads are recorded in the style of language used in the originals – standard English or Ulster- Scots. The stories and other text may contain either or both. I have often followed the style of a mixture of Ulster -Scots and English as in the Scottish ‘Kaleyard’ novels, familiar to readers of Archibald McIlroy’s books, where the conversational dialogue of characters is in Ulster-Scots with the rest of the narrative in standard English.”The ‘Wreck of the Never Budge’, ‘Courting and Possible Consequences’ or ‘The May Fair and lots of Houzeldoo’ provide a hint of Ballyclare May Fairs past and possible inspiration for future balladeers and storytellers. As for those dogs on the front and back covers  Surely it’s worth the £. sale price to find out!
