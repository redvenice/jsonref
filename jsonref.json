Stock pictureAfter comparing the average length of 125 flight times operated by large airlines from 2009 and this year, the study found that 76 routes, 61 per cent, now took longer, the Times reported.It has led to criticism that schedules are being changed so airlines can avoid paying compensation to customers for delays. But this has been strongly denied by carriers.The study has also led to claims that airlines including British Airways, Easyjet and Ryanair are increasing flight times so they can \u0027pat themselves on the back for being on time\u0027, the Times claimed.Airlines last night blamed the slower flight times on congested skies, with air traffic controllers often keeping aircraft on the ground longer and leaving them in holding patterns before landing.British woman who survived for ten hours in the Adriatic DID...RAF Typhoons scramble to intercept a Russian plane flying...Share this articleSome routes to the Far East have increased in recent years to avoid flying over dangerous countries.It was also claimed that aircraft were flying more slowly to reduce fuel consumption, lowering the cost of fares.Rory Boland, editor of Which? travel magazine, which published the findings, said passengers were \u0027likely to feel that schedule padding is another case of airlines pulling the wool over their eyes\u0027.He added: \u0027Longer scheduled flight times are likely to mean passengers spend more time sitting around at the gate or on the plane itself, just so the airline can pat itself on the back for being \u0027on time\u0027… It could also reduce the instances when an airline has to pay you compensation for a flight delay.\u0027          Air Travel has gotten longer according to research by consumer group Which?.

Easyjet\u0027s flight from Gatwick to Berlin took an extra 19 minutes.Meanwhile, BA flights from Heathrow to New York, Bangkok and Singapore were extended by 20 minutes. The widest gap was a Virgin Atlantic flight from Heathrow to Newark Liberty airport, New Jersey, which on average takes 35 minutes longer than it used to.Under EU rules passenger can claim up to £540 (€600) for flights that have been delayed by more than three hours.However, airlines are exempt from making payments for circumstances outside their control, such as poor weather.

Hop stringing involves creating a framework of string for hops to climb and grow. The string is supported by a permanent structure of poles and wirework. Traditionally this would all be created by highly-skilled stilt walkers but as is typical with much farm work machines have now replaced the need for human manual labour          A lamp lighter pictured in 1912 on Lower Bridge Street in Warrington. To celebrate the birthday of King George III in 1807. Frederick Winsor, an engineer, lit a candle. Not just any candle, however. To gasping crowds, he instantly illuminated a line of gas lamps. Over the following decades, thousands of gas lamps went up across London. These were lit by teams of lamplighters across the capital. With the dawn electricity however, there was no need for lamplighters and the profession died out          A South Eastern Railway platform porter pictured in 1885 in London. Porters arose in the early days of railway companies and would handle passenger\u0027s luggage, assist on ticket barriers and in booking offices and carry out general cleaning duties on the platform. Many porters would work for free, but often customers would provide a tip for their service. During the 1970s the role went into decline as station attendants took on most of the responsibilities. Passengers now largely carry their own luggage on to trains          A group of pillow lace makers pictured in 1900. As with many professions involving fabric in the early 1900s, a lot of the design was created by hand. With the dawn of more modern machinery, however, it was no longer necessary to carry out every single step in this way          Printers at the Clitheroe Advertiser pictured in 1911. During this time words would have to be laid out on a page manually before the printing process could begin. Nowadays this is not necessary and the printing process can be carried out digitally          Workers at machinery in a cotton mill pictured in 1906. The industrial revolution led to the mechanised spinning and weaving of cotton fibre into fabric. By 1912 production had peaked in the United Kingdom with the country producing around eight billion yards of cloth. The industry was primarily based in Lancashire with around 2650 mills in the area employing 440,000 people. The outbreak of World War One led to a steep decline in the industry, however. Cotton could no longer be exported to foreign markets and those countries, such as Japan, set up their own factories. These countries were also able to produce it much more cheaply. In between the first and second world war 345,000 workers left the industry and 800 mills closed          A milkman with his cart pictured in 1923 in Norwood, London. During this time milk was delivered up to three times a day in churns. The milkman would fill customers\u0027 jugs by dipping a measure into one of the churns. Milk bottles would soon become the norm however, and later with the advent of refrigerators milk no longer needed to be delivered as frequently. It can now also be stored at and purchased from convenience storesThere has simply been no need for people to perform jobs that a machine could now do or where demand for that service has vanished.A 2017 Oxford study found that all the developed nations on earth will see job loss rates of up to 47 per cent within the next 25 years.This projected loss of jobs has been attributed to advancing technology where machines will continue to replace the jobs of humans.Mechanisation has always cost humans their jobs. The mechanical loom for instance put weavers out of business, but it’s also created jobs. Mechanics had to keep the machines going, machinists had to make parts for them, and workers had to attend to them, and so on.          An open air barbers pictured in 1900. During this time visiting a barbershop was considered an experience for the wealthy. Instead common folk would have their haircut outside on a stool. Nowadays it is more common to visit a indoor barbershop given changing attitudes          Workers from Brock\u0027s fireworks factory pictured in 1930 holding giant fireworks  in Cheam, London. Brocks was founded in Islington in 1698. It became world famous for presenting  \u0027Brock\u0027s Benefits\u0027 in Crystal Palace, but eventually had to stop following a fire. As with many professions the need for hand-crafted fireworks died out with the invention of more sophisticated machinery  Left: Hop picking in Paddock Wood, Kent. These hop pickers were photographed in 1962. The county was well-known for its hop farming. It has a strong and fertile soil perfect for the growth of hops. In the past, during the hop harvest, tens of thousands of Londoners would take a holiday from London and come down to the Kent countryside to pick the hops. Now machines have largely replaced the task of hop picking. Right: A lift operator pictured on the London Underground in 1910. Being a lift operator was not a simple job. The operator would have to regulate the elevator\u0027s speed and ensure it came to a parallel stop of the chosen floor. With the advent of user-operated elevators, however, their profession largely became obsolete. There are now very few lift operators remaining          Salt workers on a mine train pictured in 1927. Salt was originally mined manually from the ground but in the 19th century it became uneconomical to mine salt. Instead the salt was extracted using water as a solvent.  Hot water was instead pumped through the mines. This would dissolve the salt and create a brine that could be pumped out. Salt would then be extracted from this          A wheelwright at work pictured in 1890. This profession traditionally involved handcrafting or repairing wooden wheels. As time has gone on there has been less of a demand for wooden wheels and therefore less of a demand for wheelwrights          Fletchers pictured making arrows in 1948. The art of fletching traditionally involved adding three half-feathers to the back of an arrow or dart. These would be equally spaced around the circumference of the projectile. Originally this would be done by hand using glue or thread, but now with modern adhesives this is no longer necessary          The sight of children selling newspapers on the streets of London would have been common in the early 1900s. Changing attitudes have led to a decline in thisA lot of times those in one profession could pivot to another. At the beginning of the 20th century for instance, automobiles were putting blacksmiths out of business. Who needed horseshoes anymore? But they soon became mechanics.The middle class is apparently most at risk in the coming technological revolution as computers will be able to perform those tasks more efficiently and at a cheaper cost.According to The Economist, computers will be able to analyse and compare reams of data to make financial decisions or medical ones. There will be less of a chance of fraud or misdiagnosis, and the process will be more efficient. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/27/12/4F6F6B8300000578-6102291-image-m-23_1535370288305.jpg","title":"Princess Dianas USA sweatshirt goes sale","story":"A USA sweater worn by Princess Diana and gifted to a yacht stewardess just weeks before she died is going up for sale for $9,000 (£7,000)          Diana gave the sweater to Debbie Wood in August 1997 to say thank you for looking after her during a cruise around the Italian Riviera (pictured)Wood, who is originally from New Zealand, also accompanied Diana, Dodi and Princes William and Harry on a cruise of the French Riviera in late July 1997.On board, she claimed Diana and Dodi would enjoy caviar and Champagne and the princess loved swimming in the waters surrounding the yacht.Thomas Markle begs Meghan and Harry for a \u0027final chance\u0027 as...The caped Crown Princess!

The two have to scramble together just £90 a week for the property, a far cry from the £3.75million the property is currently on the market for.          Daisy and Tim were the main characters of the show and lived at the property on Carleton Road, Tufnell Park, LondonIn 2015, two of the buildings rooms were made available to tenants, with rent cost around £2,000 a month. The house’s current owner, costume designer Chris Winter, who worked on the 2016 movie Absolutely Fabulous, has now instructed estate agents Century 21 to sell her eight-bed home. Winter, who has owned the home since 1993, has previously said that Spaced fans would often turn up at the home - built in 1867 - to pay tribute to their favourite show.          The Grade II- listed home has five floors and s across 4,600 square feet and still has many of its period features She said in 2015: \u0027People come to visit from all over the world. If they don\u0027t run off when they see us, which they sometimes do, they often say that they were choosing a holiday destination and they picked London so that they could visit the Spaced house.\u0027I do think that\u0027s a bit extreme but people really love it. There\u0027s someone outside almost all the time, we get at least one visitor a day, and if we don\u0027t then they make up for it at the weekend.\u0027She added: \u0027You can spot a Spaced fan from a mile off.

He told reporters as he was reentering the White House after a CNBC interview that it need only be formally drawn up. A legal dispute was also raging on Monday over the United States\u0027 ability to replace the trilateral agreement with one that excluded Canada.President Trump said in his Oval Office announcement he would give Canada a chance to \u0027probably have a separate deal\u0027 although they could also join the new pact.\u0027One way or another we’ll have a deal with Canada. It’ll either be a tariff on cars or it’ll be a negotiated deal,\u0027 he said. \u0027Frankly, a tariff on cars is a much easier way to go.\u0027 It was not immediately clear what the newly-agreed upon deal actually said. Trump hinted that it included a security component, saying that Mexico is \u0027going to be helping us at the border,\u0027 but officials were unable to say Monday what the pact might say about illegal immigration.A fact sheet provided by the U.S. trade representative\u0027s office did not mention the dispute over illegal immigrants flooding the United States\u0027 southern border by way of Mexico as part of what was said, either.It mainly highlighted agreements in the agricultural sector such as labeling requirements for cheese, wine and spirits. A letter to Congress notifying lawmakers of the deal was to be submitted on Friday. In 90 days, after a mandatory waiting period, Trump said he\u0027d sign the new deal into law.Trump said that he would be \u0027terminating\u0027 the existing, three-party accord that he\u0027s hammered for years once the new one is in place.He also said he\u0027d be speaking with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau \u0027in a little while\u0027 to discuss next steps. \u0027We weaken the world\u0027s greatest republic when we hide behind...\u0027If they can target President Trump, they can target you,\u0027...Share this article    Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to the president as well as his son-in-law, lauded the agreement as a \u0027win-win transaction\u0027 that will hopefully pave the way for a \u0027lot more to come\u0027          ALL THE WAY UP: The Dow was up 259 points on Monday at closing bellOn a call with reporters, U.S. officials shared the broad contours of a deal, explaining that it would cover a period of 16 years. A formal review will take place every six years, with a provision to move to annual reviews if either party determines the deal needs reworking. A U.S. official described it as \u0027a rolling forward of the agreement timeframe with real opportunity for review that will keep both modernizing on track and keep disputes from festering.\u0027\u0027Ideally, Canada will be in, and we\u0027ll be able to notify that,\u0027 the senior official said. \u0027If Canada is not in, then we\u0027ll notify that we have an agreement with Mexico and that we\u0027re open to Canada joining it.\u0027 Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to the president as well as his son-in-law, lauded the agreement as a \u0027win-win transaction\u0027 that will hopefully pave the way for a \u0027lot more to come.\u0027\u0027The president obviously is fighting for America. He’s fighting for our workers, he’s fighting for our companies. And he’ll be tough but end of the day he’ll be fair and we present this deal ultimately with his leadership that he thought was a fair deal that would make our country better,\u0027 Kushner said. \u0027And so he was happy to do it.\u0027 Trump\u0027s long-awaited trade announcement, which the White House added to his schedule suddenly on Monday, was in disarray from the moment he appeared on camera, however. Not only was a formal accord still being hammered out, how exactly the deal would be married with existing U.S. trade law had not been laid out.In a horrifying moment, Trump struggled to get Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on the phone to congratulate him on achieving a deal.\u0027Hello?\u0027 the U.S. president said repeatedly on camera, before the outgoing leader, whose term ends at the beginning of December, joined the line. \u0027It\u0027s a big thing. A lot of people waiting. Hello?\u0027 Trump again said.          Trudeau and Trump have been at odds since the U.S. slapped countries, including Canada, with heavy steel and aluminum tariffs. The trade disagreement turned into a full-scale argument after a fight following this year\u0027s G7 summitTrudeau and Trump have been at odds since the U.S. slapped countries, including Canada, with heavy steel and aluminum tariffs. The trade disagreement turned into a full-scale argument after a fight following this year\u0027s G7 summit.Trump was enraged by a slap that Trudeau took at him after he\u0027d departed. He sent his senior economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, on television to accuse the Canadian PM of \u0027betrayal\u0027 and has having \u0027stabbed us in the back.\u0027\u0027We were very close to making a deal with Canada on NAFTA, bilaterally perhaps, and then we leave and Trudeau pulls this sophomoric, political stunt for domestic consumption,\u0027 Kudlow told CNN.Since then, Washington had been suggesting that it could go it alone in a deal with Mexico and come back to Canada later. And on Monday, Trump was poised to do exactly that.\u0027Canada will start negotiations shortly. I\u0027ll be calling the Prime Minister very soon. And we\u0027ll start negotiation, and if they\u0027d like to negotiate fairly, we\u0027ll do that,\u0027 he said. \u0027You know, they have tariffs of almost 300 percent on some of our dairy products, and we can\u0027t have that. We\u0027re not going to stand for that.\u0027Trump, who has said all along that he\u0027d prefer two bilateral deals with Mexico and Canada over the trilateral deal that\u0027s currently in place, indicated on Monday over Pena Nieto\u0027s pushing that he wants to move forward on a deal with or without Trudeau.\u0027We can have a separate deal or we can put it into this deal. I like to call this deal the United States-Mexico Trade Agreement. I think it\u0027s an elegant name. I think NAFTA has a lot of bad connotations for the United States because it was a rip-off,\u0027 he said. \u0027It was a deal that was a horrible deal for our country, and I think it\u0027s got a lot of bad connotations to a lot of people.\u0027Trump said that he and Pena Nieto would put their heads together to come up with a new trade agreement name.\u0027We will see whether or not we decide to put up Canada or just do a separate deal with Canada, if they want to make the deal. The simplest deal is more or less already made. It would be very easy to do and execute,\u0027 he said.Kudlow told reporters later that negotiations with Canada would \u0027restart\u0027 as a result of the agreement with Mexico and described the talk between Trump and Trudeau that took place in the afternoon as \u0027a good conversation.\u0027Canadian officials were due to arrive in Washington on Tuesday, Kudlow said. \u0027I hope they watch carefully, how these things can get done.\u0027    The president hinted that a trade deal was imminent in a tweet on Saturday morning          The president said he was getting rid of the name NAFTA because it has a \u0027bad connotation\u0027 and the United States was hurt for many years by the trilateral deal between the U.S., Canada and Mexico in his morning announcementTrump had hinted that a first draft of a pact was on the brink of emerging on Monday, saying in a morning tweet, \u0027A big deal looking good with Mexico!\u0027The White House said shortly after that Trump would be making  an 11 am statement on the topic of trade.The United States and Mexico were said to have reached partial agreement, with President Trump announcing Saturday that a \u0027big\u0027 deal could be going down soon. \u0027Our relationship with Mexico is getting closer by the hour,\u0027 he said. \u0027Some really good people within both the new and old government, and all working closely together....A big Trade Agreement with Mexico could be happening soon!\u0027Parties to the North American Free Trade Agreement have been negotiating for months to re-do the Clinton-era trade document.Earlier this year, the president imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum, which angered allies and raised pressure for a new deal, as talks continued with Canada.The Dow Jones Industrial average jumped 200 points on Monday in advance of Trump\u0027s announcement that negotiators had finally struck a deal with Mexico, and closed 259 points above where it had been at opening bell.\u0027Today is Mexico Day,\u0027 Kudlow announced on CNBC. \u0027The market loved it.\u0027He told reporters on the White House driveway after the interview that the \u0027expectation\u0027 is that Mexico will move forward with a bilateral agreement, even if Canada doesn\u0027t sign on.\u0027The indications are, we\u0027re going to sign this document with them, the end of the week, and they\u0027re fine with, it\u0027s going to go forward.\u0027 A firm agreement remained elusive as Monday came to a close. Kudlow admitted, \u0027It\u0027s an agreement in principle.\u0027 But insisted, \u0027That\u0027s pretty good.\u0027The apparent agreement included a provision requiring a greater share of auto manufacturing be done in high-wage factories – meant to insulate U.S. firms from cheaper Mexican labor, the Washington Post reported. Pressure was on negotiators to finish a deal before Mexico\u0027s new president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, is sworn in December 1.           Hello, hello are you there? Trump had difficulty getting Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on the line on Monday for their joint announcement          \u0027Today is Mexico Day,\u0027 White House economic council head Kudlow announced on CNBC. \u0027The market loved it\u0027          The Dow Jones Industrial average jumped 200 points on Monday in advance of Trump\u0027s announcement the S\u0026ampP was also upHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who is close to Trump, said Sunday that the expectation is that Canada will be in a hustle to move, too.\u0027I believe we\u0027re very close. And also, remember, we make policy in the world of politics. Remember what politics were going on. Mexico was having a presidential election. So it\u0027s very hard for them to make an agreement at the time,\u0027 he told \u0027Sunday Morning Futures\u0027 on Fox News.\u0027That election is over, but the new president is not sworn in. First thing this administration did was go down there,\u0027 he said. \u0027It only makes us stronger, and you\u0027re going into a new election next year in Canada, it\u0027s beneficial to them to have this all agreed upon this year.\u0027Lopez Obrador issued optimistic statements about Trump following his election in Mexico, indicating the potential for a thaw between the two nations, after angry clashes over immigration issues. Speaking fondly of the new Mexican president on Monday, Trump told Pena Nieto he he was \u0027impressed\u0027 at how the two presidents \u0027came together for your country.\u0027\u0027So it\u0027s an incredible deal. It\u0027s an incredible deal for both parties. Most importantly, it\u0027s an incredible deal for the workers and for the citizens of both countries. Our farmers are going to be so happy,\u0027 the U.S. president said.  Trump campaigned  on ripping-up NAFTA, and even as talks progressed, his administration clashed with both of its North American neighbors.  Negotiators appeared to lock down two provisions in recent days.One related to the percentage of a car that that must be made in North America to receive duty-free treatment. This would jump to 75 percent from the current 62.5 percent. Another would set a percentage of vehicles that must be manufactured in high-wage factories.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/27/15/1B62757800000514-6102739-image-a-34_1535381463914.jpg","title":"Sainsburys recalls contaminated smoked salmon Northern Ireland","story":"Meningitis-linked listeria has been found in Ewing Seafoods Organic Smoked Salmon and Original Recipe Smoked Salmon in Northern IrelandThe Belfast company supplies the salmon to stores across Northern Ireland, including Sainsbury\u0027s. A Food Standards Authority spokesman said: \u0027Listeria monocytogenes has been found in two batches of Organic Smoked Salmon. \u0027As a precautionary measure, Ewing Seafoods is recalling further batches of Organic Smoked Salmon and Original Recipe Smoked Salmon, as they may also be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes.\u0027 Symptoms caused by this organism can be similar to flu and include high temperature, muscle ache or pain, chills, feeling or being sick and diarrhoea. However, in rare cases, the infection can be more severe, causing serious complications, such as meningitis.Some people are more vulnerable to listeria infections, including those over 65 years of age, pregnant women and their unborn babies, babies less than one month old and people with weakened immune systems.           Sainsbury\u0027s has been hit by other product recalls recently such as, their Filled Breakfast Biscuits containing sesame and Tereoes sugar possibly containing metalCustomers have been told to look out for 100g and 200g packs and if they suspect that they have purchased a pack they should return it back to the store for a full refunds.The batch number is 11823 and no other Ewing Seafoods products are known to be affected as point of sale notices are to be displayed in stores that have been selling the salmon. This is one of many contamination incidents involving the supermarkets in the past few months.Last month Sainbury\u0027s recalled a batch of its Filled Breakfast Biscuits after they were thought to contain sesame which was not declared on the label.Their sugar supplier, Tereoes, recalled bags of granulated sugar too after the possible presence of metal in some of the packs. A Food Standards Agency spokesperson said: \u0027If there is a problem with a food product that means it should not be sold, then it might be \u0027withdrawn\u0027 (taken off the shelves) or \u0027recalled\u0027 (when customers are asked to return the product).\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Tropical fruit washed beaches SHETLAND ship used Del Monte","story":"    Zoe Henry found some pineapples washed up on a beach in Shetland (pictured).

This isn’t news, it’s froth and bubble, mere noise.Elsewhere the same old stories I’ve been writing about for donkey’s years have been coming round again on the hurdy-gurdy all summer. Labour riddled with anti-Semitism (more of which elsewhere). Check.Police abandon the streets. Check.

Perhaps the Home Secretary, the DPP or the Met Commissioner would care to explain why.

This year, I followed a bunch of dopey birds in pink tutus, complete with pink fairy wings and princess tiaras.They were bound for the bar, where no doubt they were planning to get tanked up on prosecco before boarding their budget flight to goodness-knows-where. Always-open bars airside were once a mark of civilisation. Now they’re turning into early-morning Wild West saloons full of revellers in fancy dress.So I can sympathise with airline chiefs who want to bring airport bar hours in line with those on the outside and introduce a two-drink limit.Most violence and unruly behaviour on planes is associated with earlier consumption of booze.The latest call to restrict opening hours comes just days after a drunken passenger dressed as Tinkerbell and a companion in a Bob the Builder outfit were removed from a Poland-bound flight by armed police at Stansted.Incidentally, the passenger in the Tinkerbell costume was a man.Bring on the Oompa Loompas!

The museum is about to stage a new exhibition, and, unusually, the curator’s name will be above the door – I Object: Ian Hislop’s Search for Dissent. “I was slightly surprised about that,” he says. “I thought the BM would be too grand to incorporate one’s name in it, but they were very keen and I was sufficiently vain not to mind.”The exhibition, the brainchild of former museum director Neil MacGregor and using his idea of giving an account of history through a collection of objects, looks at dissent, subversion and satire through the ages and across all continents. MacGregor recognised that for many the museum represented history as told by the victors he wanted to show that within the museum’s collection there were also objects that contained a counter-narrative, made by artists and ordinary citizens who had never accepted the political, religious or cultural status quo, which is where Hislop came in.Hislop is emphatic that the exhibition is about dissent rather than protest – acts of inidual naysaying rather than placard-waving crowds taking to the streets. “Dissent allows you to cover all the motivations – from really serious people who want to bring down the state to less serious people who want to have a good laugh at someone else’s expense to people who just want to feel better. There is something immensely cathartic about saying: ‘I don’t buy this. I think it’s rubbish.’”The objects he and co-curator Tom Hockenhull have gathered together are startlingly erse: coins and banknotes defaced to communicate political messages – currency, he suggests, was an early and effective form of social media clothes, rugs, even doors from Africa used as forms of anti-imperial protest an elaborate 16th-century salt cellar with hidden religious symbolism that allowed a Catholic family in England to circumvent draconian laws on practising their religion a teapot made in honour of the radical MP John Wilkes and encoding the number “45” in reference to a notorious issue of his magazine The North Briton (for which he was eventually forced into exile facing a charge of seditious libel) scurrilous cartoons from the end of the 18th century mocking George III and the Prince Regent a yellow umbrella used in the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong in 2014 a pink pussyhat worn on a women’s march against Trump in January 2017 – one of the museum’s most recently acquired objects a Banksy mocking the museum’s curatorial pretensions and many objects from across the millennia celebrating illicit sex in defiance of established social norms.Why did the museum approach him, rather than, say, Noam Chomsky? “I’ve no idea,” says Hislop. “He would have been a much better bet. Perhaps they were looking for a practitioner rather than a theorist.” Hislop made a radio series to accompany the exhibition – it is on Radio 4 from Tuesday – and talked to some of his fellow practitioners, notably Spitting Image creator Roger Law and TV satirist Armando Iannucci, about the art of satire.Law – a hero of Hislop’s and someone with whom he worked closely as a young scriptwriter on Spitting Image in the 1980s – comes across as a natural anarchist. Hislop – steely, pugnacious, driven, rich, settled with his novelist wife in a village in Kent, a practising Anglican, invariably sporting a neat blue suit, someone who has managed to edit a magazine for more than 30 years and star in a satirical TV show for almost as long – is the opposite, a satirist with a strong moral code who manages to mock the establishment while being part of it. He makes no apologies for that.“People imagine satire is very leftwing,” he says, “but its history is small-c conservative. The satirist is someone who tends to be offered a new solution to a problem and says: ‘I bet that doesn’t work’, and it’s a good bet because it usually doesn’t. People are always surprised. They think: ‘Who are the great satirists? I bet they were extremely revolutionary characters.’ And they’re Lord Byron, a member of the House of Lords, and Jonathan Swift, a senior C of E prelate. Defoe said the end of satire is reform, not revolution. That is a fairly solid tradition in this country, and one I’m part of.” There is much he wants to change, says Hislop, but he is not looking to overturn the whole system. “I am not necessarily keen on blood on the streets,” he says, “because it tends to lead to more blood on the streets.”He is optimistic about the state of satire, refusing to accept that there is nothing today that has the power of Spitting Image, or that Trump is beyond satirising. “The first person to say satire was finished was Juvenal in 100AD. He said: ‘The state is so mad now, there’s nothing left to say.’ I’ve always found that very encouraging. It’s never true. You just have to work harder.”A point Hislop makes in one of the radio programmes is that satire is complex and many sided. Satirists, he says, mock everything, including themselves. Their interest lies in human fallibility, not social perfectability. If they achieve reform, it is by changing the tone of the national conversation, not by beating politicians over the head with a banner. He is, though, making something of an exception to his usual apolitical, plague-on-all-their-houses style with Brexit, about which he is deeply anxious. “I’m trying to suggest that the reasons it was a bad idea haven’t gone away,” he says. “The pretence that it’s going to be the easiest deal we’ve ever done or that the sunlit uplands await or that any of these problems no longer exist is very, very annoying. On this particular issue the act of self-harm is very large.” Hislop admits he has found a cause, but points out that he still allows the odd cartoon in Private Eye mocking the tears of the “remoaners”, among whom he numbers himself. “You have to be aware,” he says, “that nearly all of us are ripe for satire.”Where does he stand on Boris Johnson and burqas – do free speech and religious mockery have limits? “It’s important to split it into a couple of issues,” he says. “One is, is Boris ghastly? Yes. Has he as usual turned anything he touches into toxic waste? Yes. Let’s leave that. Can we have a debate about whether women should wear the niqab or the burqa? Yes, we should. I’m not a fan and I do think it is a worldwide symbol of oppression. Just because it’s become, for a few extremely pious Muslim women in this country, a way of defining themselves, doesn’t change the fact that for the vast majority of Muslim women in the world it is straightforwardly oppressive, and it is not racist or Islamophobic to express that as an opinion. In this exhibition there is a fantastic painting called Release, done by a woman in the late 1970s, about getting rid of the veil and being free without it.“We spent a lot of time getting rid of the blasphemy laws and of the suggestion that you are not allowed to challenge religion in any way, shape or form,” he says. “I don’t think the debate should be closed down because people are scared of looking Islamophobic. You can hardly say you should be arrested for making a letterbox joke and then say, ‘Good old Charlie Hebdo.’ Those two positions are not reconcilable.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5474f08dc4cef4a9afb09e98db0a65d183ac0c14/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7d5439e8b335d0f627835e965cd7c3a0 1760w","title":"call to stop landowners making huge profits from speculation","story":"Thinktank identifies issue as the driving force behind the UK’s broken housing marketBritain should limit the windfall gains of landowners by freezing the value of plots newly designated for housing, according to a thinktank urging sweeping reforms to tackle a national shortage of affordable homes.Calling on the government to pursue land market reforms similar to the German model, the Institute for Public Policy Research said planning authorities should be given new powers to zone land for development and freeze its price.It said speculation by landowners awaiting planning decisions that can trigger vast increases in the value of a plot, had the effect of exacerbating wealth inequality and was a “driving force behind the broken housing market” in Britain.Luke Murphy, associate director at IPPR, said: “Conventional wisdom suggests that the UK has a problem with house prices, but the reality is that we have a problem with land.”The sweeping reforms would mean national and local government organisations would benefit from the extra value generated by planning decisions, which could be used for local infrastructure or affordable housing, rather than landowners accruing massive returns from the state approving changes in the use of land.Using the example of a hectare of agricultural land in Oxfordshire that would typically be worth about £25,000, the IPPR said it could skyrocket in value by more than 200 times on approval for residential development to be worth about £5.6m. While the landowner stands to benefit from approval, the increase drives up the cost of building homes.Murphy said: “Wealth inequality, a poorly functioning housing market, an economy focused on unproductive investment and macroeconomic instability are all negative consequences of our current speculative land market.”The idea of taxing land values or giving councils other powers to benefit from planning approval windfalls has gathered increasing favour in recent years. Adopting the German model for freezing the gains of landowners was put forward three years ago by the Policy Network thinktank headed by Peter Mandelson.While market intervention has often been associated with the left, increasingly radical ideas are also finding favour among Conservatives concerned that falling numbers of homeowners will subtract from their voter base.Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, used a newspaper column earlier this month to attack construction companies reducing the supply of new homes by “land-banking,” where firms sit on land without building anything to protect new housing supply flooding the market all at once, thereby maintaining higher prices."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c259117df61624bab8c62d32bd1e432e59f95c01/6_0_1908_1145/master/1908.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5953652fe864bb4194f0e460a1e4e3c8","title":"how has brexit vote affected uk economy august verdict","story":"Each month we look at key indicators to see what effect the Brexit process has on growth, prosperity and tradeFears over a no-deal Brexit sent the pound to the lowest level against the dollar and the euro this year, as Theresa May continued to struggle to gain support for her plan for Britain leaving the EU. Speculation against the pound has intensified over the course of the past month as markets have digested warnings from Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, and leading Brexit backers arguing the UK would be prepared to walk away from Brussels without a deal.The UK’s trade deficit – how much imports exceed exports – narrowed slightly, despite falling exports of car and aircraft amid weaker manufacturing output in Britain. The trade in goods deficit shrank to £11.4bn in June from £12.5bn in the previous month, beating economists’ forecasts for a deficit of about £12bn. The overall UK trade deficit for goods and services widened by £4.7bn to reach £8.6bn in the three months to June as fears mounted about the impact of Trump’s trade tariffs on Europe and the rest of the world.There were weaker readings for the British economy from closely watched surveys of business activity, pointing towards a surprise fall in output for the UK’s dominant services industry. The latest snapshot from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply purchasing managers’ index for the sector fell from 55.1 in June to 53.5 last month against expectations for a more modest decline to 54.7. Anything above 50 indicates expansion versus contraction. The PMI for the manufacturing sector also pointed towards slowing growth, while the construction industry continued a recovery after suffering amid heavy snowfall earlier this year.Britain recorded the biggest July budget surplus in 18 years, welcoming news for the chancellor, Philip Hammond, as he considers ways to pay for the promised increase in NHS funding. The ONS reported public sector net borrowing, excluding state-owned banks, went into surplus for July by £2bn, comfortably beating City analysts’ forecasts. The latest figures show government borrowing for the financial year so far is around £8.5bn below the same point last year, which could give Hammond more room for manoeuvre at the autumn budget."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e32a398b0dc71a3a23fad6e3e2dc33ecc0af3c49/32_31_4878_2927/master/4878.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cec4fd9440f65b13fd8f43a16ac7916","title":"toyota to invest 500m in uber for self driving car programme","story":"Firms expand relationship in bid to catch up with rivals over autonomous vehiclesThe Japanese carmaker Toyota is to invest $500m (£388m) in the ride-hailing company Uber as the two companies expand their partnership on the development of self-driving cars.It deepens an existing relationship in a bid to catch up with rivals in the race to design and produce autonomous vehicles for the mass market. The aim of the partnership is to use technology from both companies in purpose-built Toyota cars to be deployed across Uber’s ride-sharing network from 2021. Toyota’s investment values Uber at $72bn, despite mounting losses that totalled $4.5bn in 2017.Shigeki Tomoyama, the executive vice-president of Toyota, said: “This agreement and investment marks an important milestone in our transformation to a mobility company as we help provide a path for safe and secure expansion of mobility services like ride-sharing that includes Toyota vehicles and technologies.”The deal is a step towards the revival of Uber’s self-driving business after a fatal crash in Tempe, Arizona, in March, when a self-driving Uber SUV killed a pedestrian. Uber subsequently withdrew its autonomous cars from the road, laid off hundreds of test drivers and closed its self-driving testing hub in Arizona.Under the latest deal with Toyota, Uber will combine its autonomous driving system with Toyota’s  technology, which offers some automated safety features such as lane-keeping but does not enable a vehicle to entirely self-driven.  The firms said the ambition was to build the combined technology into Toyota’s Sienna minivans, to be used on Uber’s ride-hailing network from 2021.They will be playing catch-up with a range of rivals, including Waymo, the driverless car business of Alphabet, the owner of Google. Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive of Uber, said it was the first deal of its kind for the firm.“Our goal is to deploy the world’s safest self-driving cars on the Uber network and this agreement is another significant step towards making that a reality. Uber’s advanced technology and Toyota’s commitment to safety, and its renowned manufacturing prowess make this partnership a natural fit,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ac4a3280b276ba340db9112883fc8a46c72b0bc/0_54_2889_1733/master/2889.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7ef2d3e65a19c14508685e913fa5f84","title":"brexiteers eu wto rules","story":"One dubious perk of a job writing about politics is free books that no one else would choose to read. Often, ambitious MPs feel they ought to put their vision in print, regardless of whether or not they have one. These unsolicited manifestos are then dispatched to newspaper offices where they are mostly forgotten. Mostly, not entirely.I recently found myself browsing one such volume, Britannia Unchained, co-authored by five Conservative MPs in 2012 who immodestly described themselves as “rising stars” on the sleeve. One, Dominic Raab, has risen to be secretary of state for Brexit, which is reason enough to revisit his back catalogue.The premise of Britannia Unchained is that Britain, made torpid by a coddling state, faces decline unless it exchanges timorous risk-aversion for a spirit of buccaneering enterprise. This was not a new theme for Conservatism in 2012, but it has become a kind of mantra in the context of Brexit. Buccaneers, apparently, can’t sail while still anchored to Brussels. Freedom means nothing if it isn’t the freedom to sign trade deals, and EU membership (specifically, adherence to the common external tariff as part of a customs union) therefore amounts to intolerable bondage.You might imagine that this view was anticipated by Raab and friends four years before the referendum. But no. Nowhere, not once, do the authors so much as hint that EU membership is a problem or that ending it forms part of the solution. There is stuff about venture capital, maths training and welfare reform. On the cruelty of a customs union – not a word. So what? People change their minds. They adapt to circumstance. Who cares that very recently the self-styled intellectual vanguard of Toryism thought EU membership was wholly compatible with national renewal? Now they see things in their proper perspective. The greatest obstacle to prosperity was not a skills shortage or fiscal mismanagement. No, it was the common external tariff all along.And so we get to autumn 2018. The prime minister was due to set off today on a trip to sub-Saharan Africa with a trade delegation and a familiar pitch: “As we prepare to leave the European Union, now is the time for the UK to deepen and strengthen its global partnerships,” Theresa May said. This has become part of her shtick. She goes somewhere that isn’t Europe and declares that British commercial ambition soars beyond its continental neighbourhood.There is no system for replicating those agreements after Brexit. Fox has racked up thousands of air miles crossing the Atlantic and the Pacific, eliciting bland statements of goodwill from overseas counterparts. But the number of deals he has successfully negotiated is a fat zero.And that’s where reference to the World Trade Organization comes in: won’t that serve as a safety net? Perhaps, but only in the specific metaphorical sense of catching circus performers when they fall. It is humiliating to land in one, a sign of failure, but preferable to severe injury or death. If the ambition is to sustain cross-border trade at anything like its current level, or to provide an institutional framework in which the UK could replicate the clout it has as one of the EU’s biggest members, “WTO rules” are a fiction.The WTO has become a rhetorical device, disconnected from the organisation behind the initials. It serves a purpose once fulfilled by the Commonwealth: the big thing involving many countries that, slathered in ignorance and seasoned with glibness, can be served up as an alternative to the EU. There was a Commonwealth summit in London in April from which the most memorable news was May apologising for the Home Office’s cruel treatment of British citizens of Caribbean origin who had been unjustly threatened with deportation. No trade agreements were signed.When the Commonwealth is touted as an alternative to the single market there is, at least, a degree of honesty in the audible pining for empire. There is dismal pathos in Eurosceptic nostalgia for a time when “global” Britain was a territorial reality, not a branding exercise. There is no such excuse where the WTO is concerned. There are no misty-eyed historical or cultural associations, just a cynical ersion. No developed country trades purely on “WTO rules”. The idea that Britain should be the first to give it a go has gained currency in the Conservative party from sheer embarrassment. It is not a model for post-Brexit trade, it is a euphemism for failure to understand the true value of EU membership. It conveys a deep unwillingness to admit any kind of dependency on our European neighbours, even the mutually beneficial dependency of the single market – the largest, most sophisticated free-trade zone in the world, conceived and driven in large part as a British initiative, by Conservative governments.This is the sad island where a generation of Tories find themselves intellectually discredited and marooned. They wanted to unchain Britannia and they ended up uncoupled from their own history, unmoored from basic geography, and adrift from economic reality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c03c94c45b5a83558a11a50c6c57f8dd76ea8853/534_132_4401_2641/master/4401.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0efeb25df55be6bbfd5f5b3980594bfb","title":"macabre in childrens books roald dahl maurice sendak","story":"I was introduced to the horror genre early in life. In fact, if you grew up with readings of Where the Wild Things Are before bed, then so were you. The darkness of Maurice Sendak’s classic children’s book is simultaneously subtle and glaringly obvious. On the surface, there are the beautifully garish illustrations of “rumpusing” monsters. What lies beneath – as is often the case with horror – is that chilling childhood feeling of “what if?”. “What if I ran away from home and ended up marooned with giant parading beasts for parents? I’m four. I don’t know the rules. It could happen.” This isn’t to say that Where the Wild Things Are wasn’t (and still is) one of my all-time favourite books.I’m not a parent (although I have a small niece and nephew), so I say this mostly as someone who used to be a kid: children love the dark stuff. So the reintroduction of the “thieving, murderous” Reynard the fox (deemed too sinister for Disney) into the children’s canon is bound to infuriate cautious parents while both terrifying and thrilling their offspring. The medieval tale currently being revived in a project by the Bodleian library will – apparently – not go particularly easy on the whole “disturbing our children” thing. And, especially in an increasingly dark and terrifying world, why should it?Last year, my niece and nephew, five and two respectively, lost their grandma (my mum). I suppose the hope is always that a child’s introduction to the concept of death will be via a rigor mortis-afflicted hamster. But some are thrown in at the deep end. What’s vital is that their “Where is Meema?”-type questions aren’t brushed away. To put it bluntly: they can take it. That isn’t to say we should start organising parent-and-child viewings of Schindler’s List at local cinemas, but when we underestimate children’s ability to deal with dark concepts, they lose out. It’s probably worth mentioning here that my nephew – a big Taylor Swift fan – loves the part of the song Look What You Made Me Do where Swift announces that the “old Taylor” is “dead”. “SHE SAYS SHE’S DEAD,” he reiterates, with a combination of glee and existential dread.My nephew’s goth tendencies aside, the vital ingredient in introducing children to the macabre is humour. This is where old morality tales fall short. The Brothers Grimm, for example, produced a collection of fairytales that manage to be gruesome, preachy, antisemitic and (can you imagine?) not even particularly funny. This need for balance is where Roald Dahl – the king of “too dark for kids” – hits the absolute sweet spot. Sure, after I read The Witches, for a short time I suspected most of my friends’ mums were witches, and I was duly petrified of them. But the book was also packed with silliness. It was, along with Matilda and The Twits, easily the most gross, unsettling and deeply fun book I’d ever read. Because those concepts can coexist, and decent writing sets them off against each other like peanut butter and jam. There’s often a thin line between scary and funny, and children (above all people) know this to be true.Laid bare, Dahl’s themes (child neglect and abuse in Matilda, animal cruelty in The Twits) are distinctly adult. Yet Dahl is rightly considered one of the greatest children’s authors of all time. That is in part because there is no greater thrill, as a kid, than looking into the gaping maw of human depravity from the comfort of your bed.Plus, I always thought Enid Blyton’s books were too short on child murder to be fun.• Eleanor Margolis is a columnist for the New Statesman and Diva"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bca575ca5c92ca1b4345b3ba03c18391c0ae8fca/0_71_3474_2085/master/3474.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=377379e9eb1d78cf9b017d455681607b","title":"air pollution causes huge reduction in intelligence study reveals","story":"Impact of high levels of toxic air ‘is equivalent to having lost a year of education’Air pollution causes a “huge” reduction in intelligence, according to new research, indicating that the damage to society of toxic air is far deeper than the well-known impacts on physical health.Previous research has found that air pollution harms cognitive performance in students, but this is the first to examine people of all ages and the difference between men and women.The damage in intelligence was worst for those over 64 years old, with serious consequences, said Chen: “We usually make the most critical financial decisions in old age.” Rebecca Daniels, from the UK public health charity Medact, said: “This report’s findings are extremely worrying.”Air pollution causes seven million premature deaths a year but the harm to people’s mental abilities is less well known. A recent study found toxic air was linked to “extremely high mortality” in people with mental disorders and earlier work linked it to increased mental illness in children, while another analysis found those living near busy roads had an increased risk of dementia.The new work, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, analysed language and arithmetic tests conducted as part of the China Family Panel Studies on 20,000 people across the nation between 2010 and 2014. The scientists compared the test results with records of nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide pollution.They found the longer people were exposed to dirty air, the bigger the damage to intelligence, with language ability more harmed than mathematical ability and men more harmed than women. The researchers said this may result from differences in how male and female brains work.Derrick Ho, at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, said the impact of air pollution on cognition was important and his group had similar preliminary findings in their work. “It is because high air pollution can potentially be associated with oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration of humans,” he said.Chen said air pollution was most likely to be the cause of the loss of intelligence, rather than simply being a correlation. The study followed the same iniduals as air pollution varied from one year to the next, meaning that many other possible causal factors such as genetic differences are automatically accounted for.The scientists also accounted for the gradual decline in cognition seen as people age and ruled out people being more impatient or uncooperative during tests when pollution was high.Air pollution was seen to have a short-term impact on intelligence as well and Chen said this could have important consequences, for example for students who have to take crucial entrance exams on polluted days.“But there is no shortcut to solve this issue,” he said. “Governments really need to take concrete measures to reduce air pollution. That may benefit human capital, which is one of the most important driving forces of economic growth.” In China, air pollution is declining but remains three times above World Health Organisation (WHO) limits.According to the WHO, 20 of the world’s most polluted cities are in developing countries. China, home to several of those cities, has been engaged in a “war against pollution” for the past five years.The results would apply around the world, Chen added. The damage to intelligence was likely to be incremental, he said, with a 1mg rise in pollution over three years equivalent to losing more than a month of education. Small pollution particles are known to be especially damaging. “That is the same wherever you live. As human beings we have more in common than is different.”Aarash Saleh, a registrar in respiratory medicine in the UK and part of the Doctors Against Diesel campaign, said: “This study adds to the concerning bank of evidence showing that exposure to air pollution can worsen our cognitive function. Road traffic is the biggest contributor to air pollution in residential areas and the government needs to act urgently to remove heavily-polluting vehicles from our roads.”Daniels said: “The UK’s air is illegally polluted and is harming people’s health every day. Current policies are not up to the scale of the challenge: government must commit to bringing air pollution below legal limits as soon as possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e383977fe4db06371070d076a91ee5da5269ad58/0_135_6811_4087/master/6811.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d8c3da883dea8cb3be344d9ac167549","title":"too dirty to breathe can london clean up its toxic air","story":"Air pollution leaves many Londoners like Catherine Bazell housebound, and as the severe impacts on health become clearer the call for greater action is risingCatherine Bazell looks out from her first floor flat towards the familiar landmarks of central London as a steady stream of cars and vans trundle by on the road below.“Me and my mum and dad used to love taking bus trips for the day when I was a girl,” says the 73-year-old. “We would get a bus and just go off exploring different bits of the city.”Bazell pauses for a moment before adding: “I wish I could do that now with my granddaughter but there’s no way, the pollution is just too bad.”Bazell was born in London during the second world war and suffers from the debilitating lung condition bronchiectasis as well as asthma, leaving her all but housebound during the worst bouts of air pollution.Bazell is one of hundreds of thousands of people whose lives are blighted by the UK’s air pollution crisis. Officials say at least 40,000 people die prematurely in the UK – 9,000 in London – with many more suffering long-term health problems.A spate of recent reports have underlined the scale of the crisis asthma deaths are up hospital admissions spike when air pollution worsens children living in polluted areas are likely to grow up with smaller lungs and risk of lifelong health problems. And it is not just people’s lungs that are at risk – toxic air is increasingly linked to a range of deadly conditions including heart disease, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.“Almost every week we are seeing more evidence of the damage air pollution is doing to the nation’s health,” said Alison Cook, director of policy at the British Lung Foundation . “It’s simply unacceptable that people in towns and cities across the country – particularly the young, the elderly and those with existing lung conditions – are being given no choice but to breathe dangerously dirty air in 2018.”The government claims to be tackling the issue but many experts say it has repeatedly failed to take meaningful action. Ministers have refused calls for a new Clean Air Act and the government has been dragged through the courts over its record – and repeatedly been told by judges that its plans are so poor they are illegal.However, some cities are starting to face up to the challenge. In Manchester the mayor, Andy Burnham, has said air pollution is one of his priorities and earlier this year he unveiled a far-reaching programme to encourage cycling. A host of other cities – including Birmingham, Leeds, Derby, Nottingham and Southampton – are working on proposals for clean air zones following the government’s latest court defeat.But the most ambitious scheme is in London, where the mayor, Sadiq Khan, is planning an “ultra low emissions zone” (Ulez). The proposal will see the most polluting vehicles charged extra for entering the centre of the capital from April next year. In 2021 the zone will be extended to include all the roads within the North and South Circular, which officials predict will affect 100,000 cars, 35,000 vans and 3,000 lorries each day.The scheme has been broadly welcomed by environmental groups and clean air campaigners. However many say the restrictions should be tougher, since the limit on diesel vehicles will still allow some of the worst polluting cars and vans on the road. And many believe the scheme should cover a wider area and be brought in sooner.Caroline Russell, who sits on the London assembly for the Green party, said Khan’s plans were “thorough and comprehensive” but she urged him to go further, quicker and “be braver.”Russell, who chairs the environment committee on the assembly, says there is no reason the expanded zone should stop at the North and South circular, arguing it should stretch to include London’s outer boroughs up to the M25. And she said the new system should be based on a road pricing scheme, allowing vehicles to be charged differing amounts depending, not just on emissions, but also on which roads they are using at what time of day.“We have a real chance to do something that will transform this city – to leave behind our old-fashioned reliance on fossil fuel, private vehicle-based transport in favour of a modern forward-looking system based around efficient, accessible public transport, walking and cycling.” The expanded Ulez area will be enforced using number plate recognition cameras that will automatically charge cars that flout the emissions limits a daily rate – a similar system to the existing congestion charge zone. As well as monitoring NO2 pollution it will also include a “particulate matter standard”, after the  revealed every part of London exceeds World Health Organization air quality guidelines for PM2.5 – the most dangerous particulate.And the plans have even got the backing of many of the major motoring groups . The RAC said it “could not fault the mayor’s crusade to tackle air pollution”. Private hire firms Addison Lee and Uber both welcome the move.Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association, says his members would be happy to be included in Ulez as long as private hire firms such as Uber are only allowed to buy electric vehicles too.“All we want is a level playing field … we really don’t want to be driving round in these dirty vehicles, we just need a fair deal to get out of them.”Despite the widespread support for Khan’s plans, some residents are sceptical of the mayor’s commitment to cleaning up London’s air. They point to the Silvertown tunnel development – a new crossing under the Thames in east London – which was given the go-ahead this year.Local resident Darryl Chamberlain said Khan’s support for such a big road-building programme made a mockery of his claims to be serious about tackling pollution.Many want the mayor to go further, faster, but most argue that after the inaction of his predecessor, Boris Johnson, London is at last heading in the right direction.Back at her flat, Bazell says that if the pollution today was as visible as it was when she was a girl people would be up in arms.And she says that although she tries to live an active life, her world is increasingly shaped – and restricted – by the poisonous air she breathes.Looking out to the distant London landmarks, she says: “I rarely go into central London any more. There are a few buses or trains I can get to visit family if the pollution is not too bad, but it is not that easy.”Bazell says that a few weeks ago she had to miss her choir session at the local hospital because the pollution was so severe.She looks up with a smile. “It comes to something when the air is too dirty to sing!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/555c318ea5cca4a9ed55f363b91f7c21c7c7049d/0_207_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5a72bb1f17abda22d654dd406501efb","title":"mezze maniche summer pasta recipe rachel roddy","story":"Pasta with chunks of aubergine, red pepper and mozzarella – a rich summer dish that makes the definitive southern Italian supperOne of my preferred shapes of pasta is mezze maniche – literally half or short sleeves. I still have to concentrate when I say it though – med-zay man-e-kay – which, typed here, seems as much a name for a rapper as a dried pasta shape. Half the length of another favourite – tubular, ridged rigatoni – the short sleeves of mezze maniche, with their five-pence diameter, are just the thing for catching and hiding chunks: a cube of pancetta, a tip of asparagus, a bit of broccoli floret, a chunk of fried aubergine.It is chunks of aubergine, also courgette, red pepper and mozzarella, hiding for this week’s recipe: pasta di mezz’estate, or midsummer pasta. It could just as easily be called middle-of-the-summer-holidays, late August or early September pasta, given the summer we have all shared and the subsequent abundance of summer vegetables that looks set to roll on.I take an almost perverse pleasure in frying when the weather is hot, in the layers of heat and stream of sweat, a habit possibly begun when we fried an egg on the bonnet of Dad’s Rover 100 in 1989. Alternatively, you could roast the diced vegetables in the oven just be generous with the oil and salt. The parmesan acts much the same way as with tagliatelle and rich bolognese sauce, a sort of culinary glue, melting and melding everything together.The idea of there being pasta shapesauce rules or official combinations is mismatched with the anarchic joy of food, especially if it is used as a sort of one-upmanship. But there is tradition – pairings that work or have been repeated so often they have taken root: a tangle of spaghetti with clams, corkscrew twists of trofie for pesto, a tube of macaroni, rigatoni or mezze maniche for concealing pieces of aubergine and mozzarella. There is also what you like and have in the cupboard.Whatever pasta you use, pasta di mezz’estate with its glistening vegetables, tomato sheen, melting mozzarella, all united by parmesan and reeking of basil, is a gorgeous, generous dish for a crowd, especially on a warm day, when sunny flavours are called for – saladwatermelongranita and other icy jolts can come after.1 large aubergine1 red pepper2 courgettesOlive or vegetable oil, for frying2 large ripe tomatoes4 tbsp olive oil1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed100g parmesan, grated100g mozzarella, dicedRipped leaves from 1 big sprig of basil500g pasta: penne, mezze maniche, fusilliBring a large pan of water to a boil for the pasta.

We have just got to pick ourselves back up, keep working hard and we need to pick up points, especially after two losses.“We need to win and win in a good way because we played really well in the first half and if we keep playing like that, and take our chances, then we will win games.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbae3ab36840530c0850fa57d114ed59de22b1d7/0_132_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86456afc50b96fa3aaafac3230c33087","title":"wolves make a point against city red cards ham and more football weekly","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Jonathan Wilson and Tariq Panja to discuss Manchester City’s dropped points, a isive handball, interesting red card decisions, poorly-laid turf and hams on Ryanair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bf7435cfa8ece4fe679cc366f66d623e18f7a67/0_114_5300_3180/master/5300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6448e024211885ab57e9daaa2fea206","title":"all hail the vpl why its return is a feminist victory","story":"Fear of the dreaded visible panty line put huge pressure on 80s and 90s teens to wear thongs.

Granny knickers are in the ascendant, associated by the young not with the existential insideoutside crisis of Bridget Jones, but rather the sexy-in-themselves image of the Kardashian-Jenner sisters and their big Calvin Klein pants in an advertising campaign last January the regular brief has made a comeback.Sales of the G-string, meanwhile, have been down since 2016, Marks \u0026amp Spencer, pant-vendor to all right-thinking people, reporting only one in 10 sales being a thong. In record time, the thong has become a\u0026nbspniche, retro sign, which means the only point of wearing it is if people can see that you are. See the parade of thong swimwear on this year’s Love Island, where the mantra is very much: if you’ve got it, flaunt it. This is the very opposite of what the thong was supposed to be all\u0026nbspabout.A constant fixation of 80s and 90s girls’ literature (Bliss, Just 17) was the VPL (visible panty line). Over time, there evolved gradations within that, such as: which particular bit of the panty’s line could be seen? M\u0026ampS used to have gigantic stickers on its undies saying, “side-seam free”, the way you might promote eggs that weren’t battery\u0026nbspfarmed. The answer to this self-imposed VPL shame was a\u0026nbspthong\u0026nbsp– there was nothing to see because there wasn’t anything there. Which then led to all kinds of questions, such as: “Why wear underwear at\u0026nbspall?”The more modest or self-conscious teens (ie, all of them) hated thongs, while feeling under the most intense pressure to wear them. The evolution to the full pant is partly driven by tech\u0026nbsp– materials are now so flexible that you can’t see anything under anything else and the top-end has been comprehensively knocked off (Hanky Pankys, which the Wall Street Journal described, a\u0026nbspbit ickily, as “like lace butter” in 2004, now have a\u0026nbspperfectly serviceable Primark equivalent).

In a series of spectacular strokes, brazen and clinical in equal measure, Sobers knocked Nash for six on every ball – scoring the maximum amount of runs possible in a single over. With collar up and shirt slightly unbuttoned under his V-neck white tank top, Sobers hoisted the ball over cover and long off, into the stands or out of the stadium, as though he were swatting a fly. When he launched the sixth beyond the ground, the commentator yelled: “He’s done it. He’s done it. And my goodness, it’s gone way down to Swansea.”The crowd stood in an ovation. Sobers, who allowed himself a brief, broad grin after the fourth ball, ambled to the centre of the crease, tapped the pitch with his bat as though flattening a bump and then raised his bat to salute them with a smile that betrayed either extreme modesty or, more likely, that he couldn’t quite believe what he had done.If his achievement in that moment was little short of a miracle, then the fact it was caught on camera is no less so. The BBC had decided to stop filming, but the producer John Norman, decided to carry on because BBC Wales wanted more practice filming cricket. “Fifteen minutes after it was all over, the producer who had told us to stand down rang back and begged me not to spill the beans,” Norman said years later.Within five months I was born. It is not difficult to see why my parents would decide on Gary for a name. They, too, were from Barbados and he was the national hero. Garfield seemed like a mouthful, which was lucky for me because nine  years later a cartoon cat came to be that would have sunk me in the playground. The rationale behind giving me just one “r”, like the logic behind the “e” at the end of my surname, was buried with my mother.I have always attached considerable affection, though not much thought, to my name. I was a halfway decent wicketkeeper at school, but never felt the weight of my namesake as a lodestar to sporting excellence – which is just as well. I never followed his career. How could I? He played his last Test match for the West Indies while I was in infant school.But I treasured this unbreakable tie to my parents’ island home. It locates me, in a way that little else does if your parents are from Barbados and you were born and raised in a new town such as Stevenage. When I lived in New York, it gave me something to talk about with taxi drivers of a certain age from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Back in Britain, it can lubricate conversation with older, white gents in the shires. Mine is a name with a story from afar, that doesn’t have to be told, that is not often misspelt and that doesn’t start each conversation with extensive enunciation followed by a brief explanation.When I go to Barbados, it always comes as a bit of a surprise when I realise that I have some connection – albeit self-created and one-way – with a man who has a statue (outside the Kensington Oval cricket ground) and a roundabout bearing his name not far from the Sir Garfield Sobers Gymnasium, who also enjoys the honorary prefix “The Right Excellent”. He stands among a slave rebel, former prime ministers and trade union leaders as one of Barbados’s 10 national heroes.I think names should mean something. My son is called Osceola, after the Native American Seminole chief my daughter is called Zora, after the Harlem Renaissance writer Zora Neale Hurston. So, given that I had no say in what mine would mean, if anything at all, I’m glad it means this.This summer I met the man behind the meaning, at a lunch party organised by the former Barbadian high commissioner. Now 82, he has a mane of white hair and a gap in his teeth as prominent as mine that sits conspicuously in the middle of his smile. Slighter and less serious than he was in his sporting heyday, he is tall, lucid and quite regal – a man who can hold a room without feeling the need to dominate it. There were a few things I wanted to ask him, but I was in a room with Michael Holding and Gordon Greenidge – two titans of the West Indies cricket team that dominated the generation after Sobers – and they were talking about cricket. I know my limits. I sat in silence as they chatted about the lamentable state of the West Indies team and a young Afghani leg-spinner whose name I couldn’t catch.I am not one for titles and royal honorifics. But I was touched by the way, even as they chatted quite easily, Holding, 64 (who used to go by the nickname “Whispering Death” for the quiet way he approached the crease before bowling extremely fast), never failed to called Sobers “Sir Garry”.At as suitable a pause as there was ever going to be, as the afternoon edged towards me losing my chance and the conversation not even remotely coming around to namesakes, I blurted it out. “I’m Gary,” I said. “My parents named me after you.” I will not lie. It did not feel cool. When you are surrounded by accomplished people and your accomplishment is something you had no control over, you are clearly out of your depth. Sobers smiled affectionately – it didn’t look as if it was the first time he had heard this, and what’s a man supposed to say? – and then shared his retort to those who ask him why he spells his name with two “r”s when Garfield only has one. “When you shorten a name you add the ‘r’,” he said. “Gerald only has one ‘r but how many does Gerry have? Harold only has one ‘r’ but how many does Harry have?” he said, on a roll and with a laugh. When I asked him for a selfie I neglected to mention that I had just the one “r”.Truth is, the precise way in which one chooses to spell Gary matters less and less because almost nobody calls their kid Gary any more. The name reached its peak in 1964, when it was the 16th most popular in England and Wales. The decade before and after produced Mssrs Barlow, Oldman, Lineker, Kemp and my goodself. Today, we are awash with Noahs, Dexters, Jaydens, Mohameds and Masons. In 2013, with just 28 parents calling their kids Gary, it didn’t even make the top 1,000. Two years later, a couple called their son Gary just to keep the name from dying out. (I did not mention the former pop star Gary Glitter, whose high-profile convictions for child sexual abuse may have been a contributing factor. His real name was Paul. We don’t claim him.)Still, we had a good run. And, for me personally, it could have been worse. On the penultimate ball of the over, on the day Sobers entered the history books, he was caught by Roger Davis, who then fell backwards and dropped it over the boundary. A year before, Sobers would have been out. But they had just made an experimental rule change covering such an eventuality and so six it was. Now, four sixes in an over is nothing to sniff at. But it would have been no world record. Who knows what my name might have been had fate not come down on his side in that moment? Had my parents been more into football, they could reasonably have called me Pele or Eusébio. If Vanburn Holder, another Barbadian member of the West Indies team that year, had scored six sixes, I might have borne his name. But they settled on Gary and Gary settled on me. Having now met the man who made it possible, the story I don’t have to tell, but am happy to share, got a whole lot better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c19843823bce3cd907cde9d9a317316d690a9b58/102_218_2260_1356/master/2260.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=125a775d922c36b4b7b1b93c842e1c44","title":"how to be human the man who was raised by wolves","story":"Abandoned as a child, Marcos Rodríguez Pantoja survived alone in the wild for 15 years. But living with people proved to be even more difficult. The first time Marcos Rodríguez Pantoja ever heard voices on the radio, he panicked. “Fuck,” he remembers thinking, “those people have been inside there a long time!” It was 1966, and Rodríguez woke from a nap to the sound of voices. There was nobody else in the room, but the sounds of a conversation were coming from a small wooden box. Rodríguez got out of bed and crept towards the device. When he got closer, he couldn’t see a door, a hatch, or even a small crack in the box’s surface. Nothing. The people were trapped.Rodríguez had a plan. “Don’t worry, if you all move to one side, I’ll get you out of there,” he yelled at the radio. He ran towards the wall at the other end of the room, the device in his hand. There, breathless and red in the face, he held it high above his head and brought it down hard against the brick wall, in one violent swing. The wood splintered, the speaker popped out of its casing, and the voices fell silent. Rodríguez dropped the radio on to the floor.When he knelt down to search through the debris, the people weren’t there. He called for them, but they didn’t respond. He searched more frantically, but they still didn’t appear. “I’ve killed them!” Rodríguez bellowed, and ran to his bed, where he hid for the rest of the day.Rodríguez was in his early 20s. He did not have any learning disabilities. Indeed, there was nothing to suggest his intelligence was below average. But he was ignorant of the most basic technology because, between the ages of seven and 19, according to his own testimony, Rodríguez lived alone, far from civilisation, in the Sierra Morena, a deserted mountain range of jagged peaks that stretches across southern Spain.His story is that he was abandoned as a child of seven, in 1953, and left to fend for himself. Alone in the wild, as he tells it, he was raised by wolves, who protected and sheltered him. With no one to talk to, he lost the use of language, and began to bark, chirp, screech and howl.Twelve years later, police found him hiding in the mountains, wrapped in a deerskin and with long, matted hair. He tried to flee, but the officers caught him, tied his hands and brought him to the nearest village. Eventually a young priest brought him to the hospital ward of a convent in Madrid, where he stayed for a year and received a remedial education from the nuns.It is almost impossible to imagine what it would be like to emerge into adulthood without any of the socialisation that the rest of us unconsciously absorb, via a million imperceptible cues and incidents, as children and teenagers. When he left the convent hospital, adjusting to life among humans brought with it a series of shocks. When he first went to the cinema – to see a Western – he ran out of the theatre because he was terrified of the cowboys galloping toward the camera. The first time he ate in a restaurant, he was surprised he had to pay for his food. One day he went into a church, where an acquaintance had told him God lived. He approached the priest at the altar. “They tell me you’re God,” he said. “They tell me you know everything.”In the 50 years since he was found in the wilderness, Rodríguez has struggled to get a handle on society’s expectations. He lived in convents, abandoned buildings and hostels all over Spain. He worked odd jobs on construction sites, in bars, nightclubs and hotels he was robbed and exploited: people took advantage of his unworldliness. Some people did try to help him, but most found him awkward and uncommunicative, and he was largely shunned by society. “For most of my life,” Rodríguez told me, “I had a very bad time among humans”.Marcos Rodríguez still finds it hard to be human. He lives in Rante, a sleepy hamlet of 60 or so families in Galicia, in north-west Spain. He is retired, and spends his time walking in the countryside, at the bar – “where he likes to play the clown,” a waitress told me – or hunting wild boar with a friend. The rest of the time, he stays home, watching daytime TV for hours. Rodríguez moved here in the late 1990s, when he was taken in by a retired policeman, who brought him to Galicia and gave him a job doing farm work and a place to live. For the first time since he left the mountains, his life was quiet and peaceful. “The people keep an eye out for me here,” he told me. “They’re nice, better than those I met before.”I met Rodríguez in his cramped, cold living room. The walls were plastered with photographs, old magazine pages and calendars of naked women. “I’m too much of a human now,” he said. “Before, when I first started living among people, I didn’t even have a bed – I slept on piles of newspapers.” The small, ordinary house was given to him six years ago by one of his friends in the village. There were dirty plates in the kitchen sink, a half-made bed, wooden cupboards, a desk and a TV.Talking with Rodríguez is somewhat uncanny. Nothing about his appearance suggests an unusual past: he looks like a typical Spanish septuagenarian, thin, with salt-and-pepper hair and ruddy cheeks. A cigarette habitually protrudes from his thin lips. But within moments of meeting him, I could sense something different in his demeanour.He found it difficult to look me in the eye, and stared intensely at the ground whenever he spoke. He would make a joke, and laugh at himself, only to lose his confidence almost immediately and retreat behind a sheepish, diffident grin. He was friendly and talkative, but he seemed overly conscious of my reaction to everything he said: if I looked confused, he was visibly discouraged if I was enthusiastic, he was suddenly excited and energetic. He always seemed to be anticipating his interlocutor’s scorn.In his company, you cannot help realising that our daily interactions are eased by a stream of invisible signals – a kind of silent language we all understand, which you don’t even notice until it’s absent. “Marcos can first seem unknowable, and difficult to help,” Xosé Santos, one of his friends in the village, had told me. “But once he gets to know you, and you him, he is a very loyal person.”Rodríguez drew a lighter towards his cigarette and struck. “I’m still amazed by these things,” he chuckled, pointing at a large collection of lighters on a nearby shelf. “If you only knew the lengths I went to to make fire back then.” On the desk behind him is a pile of cuttings from Spanish newspapers, with headlines such as “The Wolfman of the Sierra Morena” and “Living Among Wolves” – mementoes of a bewildering new period in his life.In 2010, the Spanish director Gerardo Olivares released a film, Entrelobos (“Among Wolves”), based on Rodríguez’s life in the mountains. After reading his story in a book by Gabriel Janer Manila – a Spanish anthropologist who wrote a PhD thesis based on extensive interviews he conducted with Rodríguez in the 1970s – Olivares hired a private detective to track down Rodríguez. “I did not have much hope of finding him,” Olivares told me. “Manila told me he was dead.”The movie, which was a modest hit in Spain, was a heavily romanticised depiction of Rodríguez’s coexistence with nature, with the story told through the eyes of the “wolf child”. “Some details were missing, but I do like it,” Rodríguez told me. “I watch it all the time, especially when I’m sad or can’t get to sleep.” (Olivares went on to make a documentary about Rodríguez, called Marcos, el Lobo Solitario.)Suddenly, to his shock and dismay, Rodríguez became a celebrity: Spanish TV declared him the “son of wolves” the BBC dubbed him “the wolf man”. Spanish papers seemed to write about him every other month. At first he was pleased with the attention: after years of rejection and disbelief, his story was being told, and he was finally being accepted. But soon, people wanted more of him than he could give. Journalists were lined up outside his door, and the press wanted to find out everything about his life. Fans wrote him from Germany, America and all over Spain. He was the famous wolf man of the Sierra Morena.What Rodríguez remembers of his time living wild is that it was “glorious”. When he was found by the police and brought down from the mountains, an untroubled, simple adolescence among animals and birds was cruelly cut short. He had always found it hard to relate to humans, who were baffled by his ignorance and infuriated by his inability to communicate. But now the intensity of their belated fascination was almost as puzzling as their earlier contempt – Rodríguez could never understand what was expected of him.Rodríguez speaks in a high pitch, oscillating between seriousness and frivolity a sober tone can turn quickly into a raucous laugh. But he is quiet and solemn when he tries to explain how he suffered at the hands of humans after he returned to society: “I was constantly humiliated. Among people, I learned to hate and to be embarrassed.”No one believed his story they merely took him for an idiot or a drunkard. He wanted to be liked, to be normal, to have a wife and children. He wanted everything he seemed utterly incapable of having. But when Rodríguez thinks about what has hurt him most in life, what he returns to aren’t these everyday humiliations, but one earlier betrayal: when his father sold him into slavery.Rodríguez was born on 8 June 1946 in a squat, whitewashed house in the village of Añora in Andalusia. His parents, Melchor and Araceli, had two other boys. The rural economy had collapsed after the civil war, and life was harsh. “The family were poor, and they left for Madrid, in search of work,” Anastasia Sanchez, Rodríguez’s cousin, told me.In the capital, Melchor found work in a brick factory, but soon after the family arrived, his wife died. According to Sanchez, Melchor couldn’t cope on his own. He soon met another woman and sent one of his sons to live with his family in Barcelona, and left another with relatives in Madrid. (Juan, the only surviving brother, did not respond to requests for an interview).Melchor kept Marcos with him, and together the new family returned to the south, to Cardeña – about 50km east of his birthplace. Melchor took a job making charcoal. Rodríguez, at the age of four, took care of the family’s pigs. He would be sent to steal acorns from the landowner’s estate to feed them. “If I didn’t bring enough home, my stepmother wouldn’t give me any dinner,” he told me. She beat him often.Then, one day – Rodríguez thinks he was about six – a man arrived on a chestnut horse. The man spoke briefly with Melchor, and then took the child home with him. Rodríguez had never been in such a big house. In a sprawling kitchen, he was fed a thick, meaty stew. The man told him his father had sold him. From now on, the rich man said, the boy would work for him, tending his herd of 300 goats. “And that was it,” Rodríguez told me. “I never found out how much my Dad was paid.”Julian Pitt-Rivers, a British anthropologist who published a classic study of a traditional Andalusian community in the early 1950s, wrote that it was common in the rural south for children from impoverished families to be sent to the mountains to look after sheep and goats in exchange for money. “There were lots of young boys working and sleeping on the hillside back then,” Juan Madrid, a civil servant in Añora who has researched Rodríguez’s case, told me. “But that his father sold him – I’m not sure that was so common.”The next morning the man took him on horseback into the mountains, to a small cave deep in the Sierra Morena, a sparsely populated mountain range full of wolves and wild boars. There, Rodríguez was handed over to the care of an elderly shepherd. He slept outside, and at first was frightened by the animal noises. The taciturn old shepherd gave him goat’s milk to drink, and taught him how to trap hares and light fires.But one day not long after Rodríguez arrived, the old shepherd said he was going off to shoot a rabbit and never returned. Nobody came to replace him. The landlord appeared from time to time to check on the goats, but Rodríguez hid from him. He didn’t want to be taken back to his family home, where he had suffered years of beatings. “Even in my worst moments, I preferred the mountains to the thought of home.”In the following weeks, the young boy tried to suck milk from the goats. He tried to catch pheasants and fish for trout, but had little success. So, instead, he started following the lead of the animals. He watched how wild boars dug for tubers and how the birds picked berries from bushes. With the basic knowledge he had learned from the shepherd, he improvised traps for rabbits and noticed that when he gutted them in the river, their blood attracted the fish. When he got older – Rodríguez couldn’t remember how old – he also learned how to hunt and skin deer.He told me he was still a child, only six or seven, the first time he encountered wolves. He was looking for shelter from a storm when he stumbled across a den. Not knowing any better, he entered the cave and fell asleep with the pups. The she-wolf had been out hunting, and when she returned with food, she growled and snarled at the boy. He thought the wolf was going to attack him, he says, but she let him take a piece of the meat instead.Wolves are not the only animals he lived among: he says he made friends with foxes and snakes, and that his enemy was the wild boar. He says he spoke to them all in a mix of grunts, howls and half-remembered words: “I couldn’t tell you what language it was, but I did speak.”Rodríguez told me this with absolute confidence, as if nothing could have been truer. The fact that I might find it implausible didn’t seem to worry him it was the one moment when he showed absolutely no concern for my reaction. There was no blushing, no adolescent timidity or raucous, incoherent humour. Indeed, if there was one thing Rodríguez seemed to know for sure – no matter what other people thought – it was that he had lived a better and happier life in the wild. The complexity of his interactions with humans would later grate against the remembered simplicity of his dealings with the animals. “When a person talks, they might say one thing but mean another. Animals don’t do that,” Rodríguez told me.In early 1965, a park ranger reported to the police that he had seen a man with long hair, dressed in a deerskin, roaming the Sierra Morena. Three mounted officers were sent to search for him. Rodríguez says they found him eating fruit under the shade of a tree deep inside the Sierra. He remembers the men dismounted their horses and tried to talk to him, but Rodríguez didn’t know how to respond. He understood their questions, but he hadn’t spoken in 12 years, and no words came. He ran.The officers caught up with Rodríguez easily. They tied his hands to the saddle of one of their horses and dragged him off the mountain Rodríguez told me howled as he left the hillside.First, the officers took him to a nearby town, Fuencaliente, and brought him to a barbershop. “I was sitting in the chair, and I remember looking in the mirror and wondering who was staring back at me.” When the barber took out a razor and began to sharpen it, Rodríguez lunged at him. “I thought it was either him or me,” he recalled. The two officers had to restrain him.Then, Rodríguez remembers, he was taken to the local jail in Cardeña, about 20km away, while the officers searched for his father. But when they eventually tracked Melchor down, they did not charge him for selling his own son into slavery – they merely asked if he wanted the boy back.Instead of welcoming his son with open arms, his father was indifferent. (In fact, Rodríguez recalls, his father berated him for losing a jacket he had been given as a child.) When the police saw that Melchor had no interest in him, they simply left him in the main square of Cardeña. Two shepherds known locally as the “widowers” took him in, and put him to work tending their sheep. Just a few days after his capture, Rodríguez was back in the mountains, looking after animals again.In the spring of 1966, the shepherds Rodríguez was working for moved their flock near the village of Lopera, where there was good grazing. The son of the local doctor, a curate named Juan Luis Galvez, encountered Rodríguez, scared and still unable to speak. It was a year since he had been discovered in the mountains, but he had still hardly spent any time with humans.Galvez told Gabriel Janer Manila, the anthropologist, that he was at first utterly “unadapted to social norms”, seemingly immune to the cold, and walked with the hunched, bow-legged gait of a monkey. Galvez moved the young man into his family home in Lopera, where he taught him how to dress himself, how to eat correctly, and how to pronounce words. He even arranged football matches so Rodríguez could play with other local children. But Rodríguez resisted. “I would try to run back to the mountains whenever I could,” he told me. “I didn’t feel comfortable among humans.”When Janer visited the area a decade later to confirm the details of Rodríguez’s stories, he found “a powerful reluctance to talk about this period”, and particularly the circumstances of his abandonment and capture – a sign of shame about the misery and poverty that haunted the region in the years after the civil war. These socioeconomic conditions, Janer wrote, were essential to understanding the trauma of Rodríguez’s early life.Joaquin Pana, a priest in Lopera, told Janer that the young Rodríguez “had been treated very badly by people”, and seemed to be surprised by everything, whether it was a glass of wine, a cigarette, or a broom: “He had the mind of a very, very young child.” A local woman called Maria Antonia Cerillo Uceda remembered Rodríguez as “very scruffy and wild”, but also “clever and curious”.At the end of the summer of 1966, Galvez, the curate, sent Rodríguez to the Hospital de Convalecientes in Madrid, a convent infirmary on Meléndez Valdés Street in the north of the city. There, doctors cut the calluses from Rodríguez’s feet and placed a board on his back so that he would stand straight, and the nuns carried on his language lessons.Rodríguez was perfectly capable of understanding language the problem was simply that he hadn’t spoken for so long that he had lost the ability to pronounce words. “I talked before they captured me, and even in the mountains, I spoke to myself,” he told me. But he never seemed to catch up, even after many years in the world. “I always felt I never had knowledge of anything that mattered to people,” Rodríguez told me. “The only thing I knew was my life in the mountains, and nobody believed me.”‘You know, the first time I saw the sea, I was travelling to Mallorca on a ferry from Barcelona,” Rodríguez told me one evening over dinner. “I was so confused by the never-ending water that I went to one of the sailors and asked him why there was so much water surrounding the boat. The sailor turned to me and smiled he must have known I was different. ‘We tied the water to the boat,’ the man said to me, pointing to one of the ropes hanging off the gunwale.” Rodríguez cackled, shook his head, and took a swig of his wine. “Poor nuns,” he said, “they tried their best, but they didn’t prepare me much for the real world.”While Rodríguez stayed at the convent, he worked on construction sites in and around Madrid. The nuns had hoped this would prepare him for society, but it didn’t help much. “I never had any idea what I was supposed to do,” he told me. At the beginning of 1967, Rodríguez was sent to do military service in Córdoba. He didn’t last long. He fired his gun during a training drill and almost killed a member of his platoon. He was discharged, and returned to the hospital in Madrid. On his return, he met a fellow patient who convinced him to go to the island of Mallorca – which was then turning into a tourist destination for people from all over Europe. There would be lots of work, the man told Rodríguez, and he could finally have some independence.As soon as they arrived on the island, his travelling companion stole his suitcase and the little money the nuns had given him, and left him stranded in a hostel. The owners, who thought Rodríguez was pulling a scam, called the police. “Luckily the nuns had called ahead to warn the local constabulary of my arrival,” he told me. Instead of being arrested, he was put to work to pay off his debts.In the following years, he held jobs as an assistant chef, a barman, a bricklayer and a road-sweeper. Because he didn’t understand money very well, his bosses often underpaid him and took advantage of his naivety. “For a while, I was selling marijuana, without knowing. My boss told me it was stomach medicine. People would come to the bar and ask for ‘medicine’, and I’d give it to them.”Juan Font, who worked with Rodríguez on building sites on the island in the 1970s, remembers him as mischievous and funny, but easily exploited. “He was a good person and a hard worker, who we all respected,” he told me over the phone from Mallorca. “I remember he loved to sing he had a great voice. But it was hard to believe his stories of living in the mountains they just seemed so unreal.”It was in Mallorca, in 1975, that Rodríguez was introduced to Gabriel Janer Manila, the anthropologist who would go on to produce the most significant study of his life in the wild and its effect on his subsequent development. “Here was this fragile-looking, childish man who was telling me the most incredible tales,” Janer told me on the phone. “I admit, I struggled to believe him.” But the more Janer heard of Rodríguez’s story, the more credible it seemed. The pair met almost every day for six months. “I noticed that his story never varied, the facts never changed, no matter how many times I asked him to tell it, no matter how many times I asked him to clarify something,” Janer wrote in his PhD thesis.After subjecting Rodríguez to a series of intelligence tests, Janer determined that Rodríguez had no learning disabilities. Instead, he concluded, his emotional and social development had remained frozen at the moment in his childhood when he was abandoned. Rather than learning the rules of human interaction, Janer wrote, he idealised life among the animals. “Even now,” he concluded, “Marcos tries to apply to social life the rules he observed during his life in the mountains.”Of course, the question remains: did Rodríguez really communicate with the animals in the way he remembers it? Certainly, the idea has fired the imagination of fiction writers. But for scientists, the question of whether animals would ever allow a human to live among them, as one of their own, is still the subject of fierce debate.When a small child was discovered in a forest near Kampala in Uganda in 1991, the woman who found him described an emaciated boy, covered in hair and missing a big toe. When she tried to touch him, he screamed like a banshee. At first, the boy, who was given the name John Ssebunya, didn’t speak much, but with the care of his adoptive family, he regained parts of his speech and was able to tell people what had happened to him. Ssebunya claimed that monkeys had raised him – that they brought him food and containers of water made of giant leaves, and that he played hide-and-seek with their young.Douglas K Capland, a primatologist and psychologist who studied Ssebunya’s case, believed that the boy lived alongside monkeys, but not among them. The monkeys, Capland concluded, had foraged more food than they needed, and John had picked up what they left behind.José España, a biologist and specialist in wolf behaviour, who knows Rodríguez, believes his experience was probably comparable. “It’s very possible for humans and wolves to co-exist,” Ea told me. “But do I believe that every time he called the wolves they came to him, as he says? Well, that’s more debatable.” Certainly, the wolves would have come to Rodríguez when he had food. “Marcos is what I would call a periphery wolf – tolerated by the alpha, and by the rest of the pack because he posed no threat,” España said. “How he chose to interpret these interactions, however, is most likely a case of selective memory.”Janer says the young boy would have projected his social needs on to the animals and imagined relationships with them. “When Pantoja says the fox laughed at him, or that he had to tell off the snake, he gives us a version of the true reality, what he believes happened – or how, at least, he explained the reality to himself,” Janer told me. “Marcos’s mind was desperate for social acceptance,” he told me, “so instead of understanding the animals’ presence as incentivised by the food, he thought they were trying to make friends.”Rodríguez left Mallorca in the 80s and moved to the south of Spain, where he worked in a series of jobs – “anything that didn’t involve reading or writing,” he said. He was at his local bar almost every day, getting drunk and playing the fruit machine. “This was the time that Marcos’s life passed in a blur of alcohol and odd jobs,” Gerardo Olivares told me. Rodríguez finds it hard to recall much of those years – except the day he met the man he calls “my boss”.In 1998, a retired policeman from Galicia, Manuel Barandela, was visiting his son in the town of Fuengirola, near Malaga, when he spotted Rodríguez living in the basement of an abandoned building. They talked over lunch, and Rodríguez gave him Janer’s book to read. After struggling through his story with the help of a Catalan dictionary, Barandela decided to take him back to Rante, where he could offer him a home and give him work on his homestead.In Rante, Rodríguez found quiet and solitude for the first time since his capture. Barandela tried to teach him to read, so that he could at least use the phone and recognise the names of medicines, but it proved almost impossible. Barandela found it hard to talk to him, and began to worry it had been a mistake to take him in. “In the end, I came to see Marcos as a child,” he recalled in a Spanish interview in 2010, shortly before he died. “Understanding him this way made everything easier.”Of course, it is as a “child” that Rodríguez has now become an object of fascination. For centuries, writers and thinkers have been obsessed by the stories of “feral children” who grow up without human contact, supposedly untouched by civilisation – and therefore taken to represent human nature in its purest form, innocent of society’s conditioning. Victor of Aveyron, perhaps the most celebrated feral child of modern times, emerged from a forest in southern France in 1800, aged 12, after about seven years living in the wild. This was a moment of social and philosophical ferment, when ideas about the “state of nature” put forth by the likes of Locke and Rousseau were still being hotly debated. Victor, who was unable to speak, was hailed throughout the country as a potential window on to man’s soul, and intently studied by learned men keen to test their theories of language and education.It may be no accident that Rodríguez’s case was, for half a century, rather less celebrated: he emerged from the mountains into a country scared to investigate itself for fear of what it might find. There was little appetite for reopening debates about poverty and neglect, or the sale of children into labour, even in the 1970s. It was not until much later, 35 years after Franco had died, in a democracy mature enough to confront its past, that the details and significance of his story were finally embraced.The release of Entrelobos, and the sudden flood of interest in the circumstances of Rodríguez’s abandonment, brought back to life a forgotten Spain, cut off from the world, struggling to survive on scarce resources under a repressive dictatorship. Rodríguez told Olivares that he had given him back his dignity. The innocence and naivete that had made him an outcast his whole life were now the subject of intense interest.But this was yet another complication: it seemed as if people thought their attention could compensate for all his suffering. People wrote to him from all over the world: some wanted to understand him, some wanted his advice, and some said they wanted to take care of him. Schools asked him to visit to tell his story to their pupils. His phone filled up with messages from journalists wanting a more intimate account of his life. “There was a queue outside as long as the one at a benefits office,” Rodríguez said, slumped in the chair in his small living room.“People still come round all the time. Some of them think I’m rich and try to exploit me. I don’t have a penny!” Rodríguez told me. He remembered one occasion, a few years back, when a woman visited his house and declared her love for him. “She offered herself to me and said that we should go into business together. I suppose she thought I made loads of money from the film!”Rodríguez could not understand how his story could be met with complete indifference for decades, only to make him famous 40 years after Janer first wrote about it. “Especially when I hadn’t changed,” he said. To him, all this newly discovered adulation seemed just another hurtful, incomprehensible quirk of the human mind.From the window of Rodríguez’s house, I saw that the morning frost had lifted, and the sun bobbed above.

He has said about the no-deal situation that it will not be a walk in the park, but it wouldn’t be the end of the world.“What the government is doing is putting in place the preparation such that if we are in that situation, we can make a success of it, just as we can make a success of a good deal.”The prime minister voiced her own reservations about the Treasury forecasts, saying she believed the chancellor was talking about figures dating back to January, adding “They were a work in progress at that particular time.”She was a speaking a day after a cabinet split over the issue had appeared to open up when Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, said he was “chary” of economic forecasts on Brexit because previous warnings about the risks of quitting the EU have been proved wrong.May also distanced herself from comments recently made by David Lidington, the cabinet office minister, who had suggested that the exit talks could drag on beyond the October summit to the end of the year because there was so much that had not yet been resolved.The prime minister said “we are all working to the October deadline” because “from our point of view there is some legislation we have to get through parliament” in order to complete the UK’s exit for March 2019.Last week Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, said the talks could go on until November but May said the UK was working to the October deadline which “the EU originally spoke of”. She added: “What we are doing is just sitting down, getting on with the work.”The prime minister provided no further detail on how negotiations with European leaders had developed over the summer, talks that included a bilateral between May and France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, visits to Nordic and Baltic states by foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt and a round of negotiations between Raab and Barnier."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fe70af1246e7e8f6b02822aa1b0cb3d22f843f4/0_1075_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=649a1aa4c54989407d8f96111e4b1485","title":"the case against mars colonisation","story":"Plans are being made to colonise Mars. Zahaan Bharmal unpicks the arguments against the ideaEarlier this month, a group of 60 prominent scientists and engineers met behind closed doors at the University of Boulder Colorado. Their agenda: Mars colonisation.Organised by Elon Musk’s SpaceX and attended by members of Nasa’s Mars exploration programme, the goal of this inaugural “Mars workshop” was to begin formulating concrete plans for landing, building and sustaining a human colony on Mars within the next 40 to 100 years.This workshop signals the growing momentum and reality behind plans to actually send humans to Mars. But while SpaceX and partners ask whether we could live there, others still ask whether we should.We have known for some time that the journey to Mars for humans would be hard. It’s expensive. It\u0027s dangerous. It\u0027s boring. However, like so many advocates of Mars exploration, I\u0027ve always thought the sacrifice was worth it.But – to test this belief – I wanted to look at the case against Mars three reasons humans should leave the red planet alone.It is hard to forget the images six months ago of Elon Musk\u0027s midnight cherry Tesla floating through space. Launched atop the Falcon Heavy, SpaceX hoped to shoot the Tesla into orbit with Mars. A stunt, for sure – but also a marvellous demonstration of technical competence.But not everyone was happy. Unlike every previous craft sent to Mars, this car – and the mannequin called Starman sitting behind the wheel – had not been sterilised. And for this reason, some scientists described it as the “largest load of earthly bacteria to ever enter space”.As it happens, the Tesla overshot its orbit. At the time of writing, it is 88 million miles from Mars, drifting through the darkness of space with Bowie on an infinite loop. But the episode illustrates the first argument against human travel to Mars: contamination.If humans do eventually land on Mars, they would not arrive alone. They would carry with them their earthly microbes. Trillions of them.There is a real risk that some of these microbes could find their way onto the surface of Mars and, in doing so, confuse – perhaps irreversibly so – the search for Martian life. This is because we wouldn\u0027t be able to distinguish indigenous life from the microbes we\u0027d brought with us. Our presence on Mars could jeopardise one of our main reasons for being there – the search for life.Furthermore, there is no one way of knowing how our microbes may react with the vulnerable Martian ecosystem. In Cosmos, the late Carl Sagan wrote, “If there is life on Mars, I believe we should do nothing with Mars. Mars then belongs to the Martians, even if the Martians are only microbes … the preservation of that life must, I think, supersede any other possible use of Mars.”Of course, one easy way to minimise the risk of contamination is to send robots to Mars instead of humans – the second argument against a manned trip to Mars.Robots have several inherent advantages. They are much cheaper than humans because they don\u0027t require a vast support infrastructure to provide things like water, food and breathable air. They are immune to the risks of cosmic radiation and other dangers inherent to space travel. And they won\u0027t get bored.Over the last 40 years, the international space community has an extraordinary legacy of robotic missions to Mars.A few weeks ago, the European Space agency\u0027s Mars Express identified liquid water buried in the south polar region of Mars.The Curiosity Rover recently celebrated its sixth birthday with the discovery of organic molecules and methane variations in the atmosphere – both positive signals of life.And while most of its targets are chosen by humans, Curiosity also uses artificial intelligence to autonomously analyse images and choose targets for its laser detection system.With the rapid pace of progress in robotics and AI, it is likely that the effectiveness of these non-human explorers will only increase. Robots on Mars will be to able to carry out increasingly complex scientific research, accessing craters and canyons that humans might find too difficult to reach – and perhaps even drilling for Martian microbes.The most polarising issue in the Mars debate is arguably the tension between those dreaming of a second home and those prioritising the one we have now.Before his death, Stephen Hawking made the bleak prediction that humanity only had 100 years left on Earth.Faced with a growing list of threats – climate change, overpopulation, nuclear war – Hawking believed that we had reached the point of no return and had no choice as a species but to become multi-planetary – starting with the colonisation of Mars.Elon Musk has also said on numerous occasions that we need a “backup planet” should something apocalyptic – like an asteroid collision – destroy Earth.However, not everyone agrees. In the Pew survey mentioned earlier, a majority of US adults believed that Nasa’s number one priority should be fixing problems on Earth. The billions – if not trillions – of dollars needed to colonise Mars could, for example, be better spent investing in renewable forms of energy to address climate change or strengthening our planetary defences against asteroid collisions.And of course, if we have not figured out how to deal with problems of our own making here on Earth, there is no guarantee that the same fate would not befall Mars colonists.Furthermore, if something truly horrible were to happen on Earth, it’s not clear Mars would actually be an effective salvation. Giant underground bunkers on Earth, for example, could protect more people, more easily than a colony on Mars.And in the event of apocalyptic scenario, it is possible that the conditions on Earth – however horrific – may still be more hospitable than the Martian wasteland. Let\u0027s not forget that Mars has next to no atmosphere, only one third gravity and is exposed to surface radiation approximately 100 times greater than on Earth.The arguments above show that we are perhaps not ready to go to Mars – at least, not today.We need to first update our policies on planetary protection and apply them fairly to both public and private sector entities. We need to understand humans\u0027 unique role in exploration, beyond robots. And we can\u0027t lose sight of challenges on Earth, nor use the promise of Mars as an opportunity to deflect responsibility from Earth.But for me, the issue comes down to timing. The technology will not be ready to send a human to Mars for at least another 10, perhaps even 15 years. This is a good thing. We should use this time carefully to make sure that, by the time we can go to Mars, we really should."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/750f1e7850f95d99aa056f11dade1639ba98e82d/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34f40f976fad7016a1d925d76dede0ca","title":"fentanyl for sale to uk users through chinese websites","story":"Sellers of dangerous synthetic opioid and other hard drugs say they can ship to BritainDrug users can easily buy potentially lethal substances through Chinese eBay-style websites, the  can reveal.Websites based in China are selling the dangerous opioid fentanyl, which can be 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine, and drugs used for euthanasia programmes in the Netherlands and executions in US states such as Texas.Analysis passed to the  by a project funded by Innovate UK examined one of China’s largest e-commerce websites, Weiku. It hosts sellers that offer to ship synthetic opioid drugs to the UK.The project examined activity on Weiku for six months. It found that while searching for “fentanyl” on the website returned zero results, the website offered related searches such as “Fentanyl,” or “Fentanyl patches”. Some of those advertising under these search categories had their accounts deleted, while others still sold the substances.Those who analysed the website were able to find sellers willing to ship fentanyl and other substances. The drug appeared frequently on the website over the period analysed and, as well as fentanyl, Weiku also hosted people selling bromadol, which is estimated to be five times the strength of fentanyl. One seller of this drug on the website produced a US certificate for a dog examination in lieu of a business licence.Sellers on the site also advertised pentobarbital, a short-acting barbiturate that can cause death when used in high doses. It is used in euthanasia programmes in the Netherlands and executions in US states such as Texas. One seller promoted the product as “peaceful death”.When approached, one seller said: “Our fentanyl powder is very pure ... We can send to you safely in the UK. Delivery will be done through UPS or Fedex.” The seller offered 50g for $700 (£540).Weiku is based in the eastern city of Hangzhou . When approached by the , the company said that it regularly checked for sellers of illegal drugs such as fentanyl, and deleted those accounts.A representative admitted, however, that searches for fentanyl could return results. “It does happen that sellers and buyer create new ways to make deals on our site, but Weiku is not able to discover this right away.” The firm said it did weekly inspections. “As an information platform, Weiku needs to make sure all information is legal, but we are not accountable for the transactions,” it said.The findings come as the head of the National Crime Agency (NCA) told the  that vast majority of the synthetic opioids coming into the UK were from China. The NCA said that most synthetic drugs, including the synthetic cannabinoid spice, came into Britain from the east Asia.he said the drug was mainly sent through the post and was then sold on the dark web, a part of the internet only accessible through a particular browser. also found another Chinese website, DIYTrade – China Product Directory, where fentanyl and carfentanyl, which is 100 times more potent than fentanyl, were offered for sale. One seller, when contacted, said they offered 10g for $280 or 100g for $1,100. They said: “Yes, we can ship carfentanyl to London ... how many ... do u need?”DIYTrade did not respond to requests for a comment.Another Chinese website, Mfrbee, had dozens of listings under the search term “opioids”, although links to fentanyl appeared to be blocked. Other opioid analgesic drugs are sold with shipping options.The website also hosts vendors purporting to sell Xanax, a benzodiazepine, and pregabalin, a medication used to treat epilepsy and generalised anxiety disorder. Both are illegal without a prescription in the UK.The market for synthetic drugs in China is driven by demand abroad. The authorities control fentanyl, but they did not begin restricting its two most common ingredients until this year, more than a decade after the US.The law in China has got tighter in recent years, however, with more than 130 synthetic drugs – including at least 10 fentanyl analogues – added to the country’s list of controlled substances since 2015. Chinese regulators say they struggle with the speed at which chemists are able to produce new variations on fentanyl, circumventing the government ban on analogues.Additional reporting by Wang Xueying"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb9060e61c1881df4f977f3b1dda5846d08c9b8a/0_648_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6450aad7a7916c4be2bdedf867780454","title":"medical watchdog chief faces calls to step down over bawa garba case","story":"Anger at GMC over treatment of paediatrician struck off after death of six-year-old boyHospital doctors are calling for the head of Britain’s medical regulator to stand down over his handling of the case of a paediatrician who was struck off following the death of a six-year-old boy.Anger at the General Medical Council (GMC) has been building around the case of Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba, a junior doctor who this month won her bid to be reinstated to the medical register after she was earlier convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence over the death of Jack Adcock.The Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA) said that doctors\u0027 confidence in the GMC had collapsed and that the departure of the council’s chief executive, Charlie Massey, was the only way to draw a line under the affair.Members of the union believe that issues raised by the case, including levels of understaffing, failures of IT systems and staff working in inappropriate conditions, have been ignored.Bawa-Garba was held responsible for the death of the child, who suffered heart failure after going into septic shock while in her care at Leicester Royal infirmary in 2011.A tribunal ruled in June last year that she should remain on the medical register despite her conviction, but issued a one-year suspension.The regulator took the case to the high court to appeal against the sanction, saying it was not sufficient and Bawa-Garba was struck off in January before being reinstated on 13 August.The HCSA said it had raised several specific concerns around Massey\u0027s conduct, including what it described as his personal decision to seek to override the findings of its own tribunal service in the case.Dr John West, a member of the HCSA executive, said: “The level of distrust and anger that we are seeing among hospital doctors has prompted begrudging apologies and a review into the laws surrounding such cases.”“Yet at no point has the chief executive of the GMC taken personal responsibility for his actions. Indeed, we continue to await an acknowledgement that he was incorrect to seek to overturn the considered view of his own medical professional tribunal.“While there are wider cultural issues about the GMC\u0027s treatment of doctors facing complaints, the gross mishandling of this specific case, including the decision to launch a renewed personal attack on the integrity of Dr Bawa-Garba as part of the GMC\u0027s defence in the appeal court, appears to be the sole responsibility of Charlie Massey.“It now seems that the GMC will only be able to draw a line under this disastrous episode via the departure of its main architect.A spokesman for the GMC said: “We recognise the anger felt by many doctors about this case. As an independent regulator responsible for protecting patient safety, we are frequently called upon to make difficult decisions, and we do not take that responsibility lightly.“We have fully accepted the court of appeal\u0027s judgment in what was a complex and unusual case.”Bawa-Garba had been on her first shift back after 14 months away on maternity leave on 18 February 2011, when Jack, who had Down’s syndrome, was admitted to hospital with sickness and diarrhoea. After an initial examination, he was treated for acute gastroenteritis and dehydration but his condition continued to deteriorate.It subsequently emerged Jack had been suffering from pneumonia, and antibiotics were given. He went into septic shock, which led to organ failure and a heart attack, and he was pronounced dead at 9.20pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcb45e29e7b4e9c25a5a734c5b0023498e53f0dd/0_241_4246_2548/master/4246.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb1ef60807165ac57d6f5aedc8ab0dc8","title":"notes from an ungrateful athlete why race and sports matter in america","story":"Sports is one of the few areas in which Americans of all races can talk to each other. Right now, it may be the country’s best hope for meaningful dialogueAs the ’s series on race and sports starts today – and we mark two years since Colin Kaepernick first knelt during the national anthem – I am reminded that whenever an NBA player comes close to shattering one of my dusty old records, eager journalists contact me to ask how I feel. Here’s how I feel: At the time I set those records – most points scored, most blocked shots, most MVP awards, blah, blah, blah – I celebrated them because they confirmed that all my hard work and discipline since childhood was effective in me achieving my goal of becoming the best possible athlete.But that wasn’t my only goal. The even greater significance those records had to me then, and has to me even more now, is in providing a platform to keep the discussion of social inequalities – whether racial, gender-related, or economic – alive and vibrant so that we may come together as a nation and fix them. Historically, that has been the greatness of the American spirit: we don’t flinch at identifying our own faults and using our moral fortitude and ingenuity to become a better nation. In honoring that spirit, I pay tribute to two of my most important mentors, UCLA coach John Wooden and Muhammad Ali. It is Ali’s voice I often hear in my head: “When you saw me in the boxing ring fighting, it wasn’t just so I could beat my opponent. My fighting had a purpose. I had to be successful in order to get people to listen to the things I had to say.” All sports records will inevitably be broken, but the day after they are, the world won’t have changed. But every day you speak up about injustice, the next day the world may be just a little better for someone.Sports is the most popular form of entertainment, with Americans spending about $56bn on sports events last year, compared to about $11bn on movies. Seventy-two percent of 18- to 29-year-olds consider themselves sports fans, as do a majority of those older. This level of popularity has made sports more than just entertainment, it’s also part of our national identity, a source of inspiration for personal achievement, and a means to teach our children valuable lessons about teamwork and social ethics. For African Americans, sports has all those values – but it also has some extra implications. For people of color, professional sports has always been a mirror of America’s attitude toward race: as long as black players were restricted from taking the field, then the rest of black Americans would never truly be considered equal, meaning they would not be given equal educational or employment opportunities. Even after they were permitted to play, sports has been the public face of America, not what we sentimentally profess to believe when waving flags on the Fourth of July, but of our actual daily behavior. That is why whatever happens in sports regarding race, plays out on the national stage. Right now, sports may be the best hope for change regarding racial disparity because it has the best chance of informing white Americans of that disparity and motivating them to act.The problem is that this is not the message that those who profit from disparity want the public to hear. They attempt to silence voices of dissent in sports today just as they have throughout my lifetime and before. And that attempt is always disguised as an appeal to patriotism. They use the flag the way a magician uses a cape: to misdirect the audience from the manipulation. Poof! No racism here, folks.To white America, the history of US sports is a rising graph of remarkable achievements of physical and mental strength. To black America, it’s that, but is also a consistent timeline of trying to silence the voices of African Americans. In 1964, Ali’s refusal to submit to the draft during the Vietnam War on the grounds that “my conscience won’t let me go shoot my brother, or some darker people” caused him to be sentenced to five years in prison, fined $10,000, and banned from boxing years. He gave up millions of dollars and faced prison to speak his truth. In 1971, his conviction was overturned by the US Supreme Court in an 8–0 decision, but the damage had already been done.During the 1968 Olympics in Mexico, Tommie Smith and John Carlos stood on the podium and raised their gloved fists in the air during the national anthem. As a result, they were kicked off the team and sent back to the US where they were ostracized in the press and received death threats. But many black Americans felt pride that their own anger and frustration had been expressed out loud on an international stage. Carlos later said that it was not a black power salute, but a “human rights salute”. Smith said, “We were concerned about the lack of black assistant coaches. About how Muhammad Ali got stripped of his title. About the lack of access to good housing and our kids not being able to attend the top colleges.” That same year, Aretha Franklin sang the national anthem at the Democratic National Convention and her performance was widely criticized in the press as “disgraceful,” “objectional,” “nerve shattering”. Editorials routinely decried “soul music” and referred to her in an insulting way as a “soul sister”. Wrote one angry reader, “‘Soul’ has its place – where, I’m not sure – but certainly not in the performance of our country’s anthem.” Even her magnificent voice was too black for the national anthem and had to be silenced.In 2016, Colin Kaepernick’s passive protest against racial injustice, the simple act of kneeling during the national anthem, ignited a firestorm of support and condemnation. Other players from other sports joined his non-verbal protest. Kaepernick himself was punished, and his NFL career appears to be over after he was blackballed by teams.The story continues. This month several NFL players kneeled or raised their fists during the national anthem, which prompted a tweet from President Trump, “Numerous players, from different teams, wanted to show their ‘outrage’ at something that most of them are unable to define.” Trump – the pampered Great White Hope of One-Percenters, who has never known a day without wealth – tried to silence black men by telling the world that they didn’t understand their own outrage. The national shame in this timeline isn’t the insult to the national anthem but the insult to the nation’s ideals that 50 years after Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised their fists in Mexico City, not that much has changed. Despite the hundreds of studies and statistics and experts’ reports that confirm systemic racism is rampant in America – hindering education, employment, health, and life expectancy – we’re still trying to convince some people that the Earth is round.Over the years, I have participated in some of these protests. In 1967, when I was only 20, I was the youngest member of the Cleveland Summit, a gathering of black athletes tasked with determining the sincerity of Ali’s claim of being a conscientious objector. In 1968, a few months after the assassination of Dr Martin Luther King Jr, I had been invited to play on the Olympic men’s basketball team. I was torn because I knew that joining the team would signal that I supported the way people of color were being treated in America – which I didn’t. But not joining the team could look like I didn’t love America – which I did. Instead, I chose to teach kids in New York City how to play basketball and why they should stay in school. My decision not to play resulted in hate mail calling me, among other things, “an ungrateful nigger”. That word, “ungrateful,” is the key to understanding what angers those who are so incensed at players’ protests. They want black athletes to be grateful that they’ve been given a seat at the table and to therefore ignore their brothers and sisters who have little hope of achieving that kind of success.That success of some black athletes has a dark side for African Americans. Some see sports as a path for their children to escape the endless cycle of poverty. Parents pour all their energy into training and grooming their child to become a professional athlete, sometimes at the expense of their academic education. Yet, the odds of success are so slim that they are doing more damage to their child’s future. Even those who make it to the pros usually have a short career: the average in the NFL is 3.3 years, and in the NBA 4.8 years – and most don’t earn enough from those short careers to retire on. We can’t promote professional sports as a real hope any more than we can endorse the lottery as a career strategy. That’s why athletes are so motivated to speak out about the unequal opportunities that leave people desperate to cling to the hope of even a distant longshot.I love sports. I love to see an athlete perform a physical feat so amazing that I marvel at what we are capable of. I love to see teams work together, to act selflessly in pursuit of a greater goal than inidual glory. Sports energizes me and makes me hopeful about humanity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66838b83637753d4b554ea08ed63d4525453f4f8/0_145_3139_1883/master/3139.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85fc666fd644759ba920d53989eee8f2","title":"premiership rugby clubs join forces","story":"• Club say they need to cut costs to become sustainable•  investigation reveals losses of £28.5m in 2016-17Leading rugby clubs in England say they need to act together to reduce wage inflation and control costs as the  today reveals the most recent recorded losses of Premiership clubs total a combined £28.5m.• Exeter was the only Premiership club to clearly turn a profit in 2016-17.• Worcester, at £8m, showed the most significant losses and spent more on wages than their turnover.• Overall turnover for Premiership clubs went up £11.93m with wages increasing by £10.42m.“Clubs are no better off than when the Premiership started 20 years ago and that is a real shame,” said Leicester’s chief executive, Simon Cohen. “The percentage of extra revenue over the years that has gone to players has put clubs in a position where it has been difficult to invest in other areas of the game. You want to spend more on infrastructure and the matchday experience for fans but you are less able to do it because of the amount going on wages.”Another club chief executive said the Premiership’s losses would show an increase when all the 2017-18 accounts were published – “the clubs are losing just under £35m cumulatively” – and blamed a rise in the wage cap and a reduction in TV revenue. The Premiership was also without a sponsor in 2017-18 after Aviva pulled out, although Gallagher has stepped in for this season that starts on Friday.The salary cap for clubs is set at £7m, plus two marquee players and allowances, for the next three seasons. Premiership Rugby receives £28m a year, distributed between the clubs, with small variations according to success and number of internationals, from the Rugby Football Union.’s analysis, following the model of our exercise on Premier League football, shows that Worcester (a loss of £8m) and Harlequins (£4.6m) were the most in the red in the financial year 2016-17. Worcester, who had made a profit the previous year after shareholders wrote off loans of £20m, had a wage bill that exceeded turnover and their finance director, Kirsty Fisher, resigned last month. Harlequins had the second highest turnover but the club’s loan from its parent company grew to £37m.Accounts indicate Bristol reduced its accumulated losses by £1.2m in the year to £20.4m. The club is reliant on funding from their owner, Stephen Lansdown, and states it is “currently loss-making”.While the turnover for the clubs increased by a total of £11.9m, wages went up by £10.4m, allowing them little scope to help fans by subsidising ticket prices and forcing up borrowings to fund investment in facilities, ground improvements and new pitches. Gloucester took out a bank loan this year for a new playing surface that cost nearly £1m while Saracens are looking for a mix of debt and equity to pay for their planned £20m development of a stand at Allianz Park.The entire turnover of £189.1m for the 11 clubs in the accounts is equivalent to that of a middle-income Premier League club such as West Ham (£183m) or Southampton (£182m).The Premiership can be crudely split into three: the clubs with lower attendances, such as Sale and Newcastle those run on company lines, spending what they earn, which include Gloucester and Exeter and those indebted to wealthy backers, such as Bath, Bristol and Saracens. Each club has someone who will make good the losses each year – but all know that cannot continue indefinitely.While the figures appear bleak, for the first time since the game went professional the clubs are ready to put rivalry to one side to make the game sustainable.“Wage inflation has been hard to manage and we have been unable to keep up with the growth in our commercial revenues,” said the Northampton chief executive, Mark Darbon, whose club on Friday announced a pre-tax loss of £2.8m for 2017-18.Four years ago, the clubs voted for significant increases in the salary cap to help protect them against big-spending French clubs but they say the flattening out for the next three seasons gives them the chance to take control of costs. “We have to take it,” said the Gloucester chief executive, Stephen Vaughan. “A few years ago it was all about a win-at-all-costs mentality but the signs from the ownership group now are that sustainability is the priority and there is a sense of togetherness about the clubs. I am optimistic about the future because rugby is still touching the surface in terms of its commercial appeal. We have just been using new revenue to increase wages. In any other business an extra £1m would be invested, not got rid of as quickly as possible.”The Saracens chief executive, Mitesh Velani, believes the RFU should offer the clubs more assistance. “There is enough money in the professional game but there is something to be done in terms of the balance between the revenues generated at international level and the losses suffered at domestic level. You want supporters not just to pay very high sums of money to watch England play New Zealand at Twickenham but to follow clubs. There needs to be a more collaborative approach, such as the sharing of supporters’ data.”The RFU’s turnover in 2016‑17 was £184m and the RFU chief executive, Stephen Brown, said: “The professional game agreement has linked us closer together. The agreement is based on a share of the revenue from matchdays at Twickenham. It is fixed for the first four years and after 2020 it becomes variable based on our revenues: if they go up or down, the clubs come with us.“We have millions watching England on television or coming to Twickenham. We want them to be interested in rugby in England, not just the national side, and we are doing everything we can to encourage people to support their clubs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd48c4bad7fbe8e0422e4852ebd7d0ec2c77f69e/0_0_4978_2986/master/4978.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37acd85679c9b7fbb95920d22f17ca9e","title":"talking horses desert frost epsom racing tips","story":"It must be a slightly odd experience to hold an annual members’ badge at Epsom Downs racecourse. It is the centre of the racing universe on its two big afternoons of the year in early June, but on the other nine days on its calendar, there can be as few as 1,500 other paying punters rattling around in the stands and enclosures and Tuesday’s meeting, which pulled in 1,650 last year, is definitely one of those.Turnout is pretty thin today in terms of the horses as well, and after three non-runners in what was initially an eight-runner handicap at 4.55, there are currently just 47 horses due to go to post on a seven-race card, 10 of which are engaged in the opening nursery. There were also just five declarations for the feature handicap, which is worth more than £9,000 to the winner, which is disappointing even when you allow for Epsom’s well-earned reputation as a specialists’ track.There are two previous winners over course and distance in the field for the Terry Mills \u0026amp John Akehurst Handicap, including David O’Meara’s Highland Acclaim, who has taken this prize for the last two seasons. He has four wins in all at Epsom and is 2lb below his winning mark in this race last year, but faces a significant opponent in Saeed bin Suroor’s Desert Frost (3.15), who has the excellent Rossa Ryan claiming 3lb.Bin Suroor’s string is starting to show some signs of life after a difficult time of it this season, and Desert Frost was within half a length of a first win since taking a Doncaster maiden in May last year when he finished second behind Militia at Ayr last time out. The time was good, several horses behind him have run well since and today could well be the day when Desert Frost gets his nose in front once more.Dourado (4.20) also has a solid record at Epsom and should record his third success at the track later on the card, while Iconic Choice (3.00) and Give It Some Teddy (4.35) are the picks on the other afternoon card at Ripon. Sky Gypsy (4.20) should go well on the evening card at Chelmsford City, and Guerilla Tactics (6.10) is a solid favourite on a competitive jumps card at Stratford."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2dce8222f993b4f31ae9225b5296188308551a03/0_141_3388_2034/master/3388.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=492abf62b8075e0b9773fd6560364b94","title":"memory lane 40 years us open flushing meadows tennis","story":"2018 sees the 40th anniversary of the US Open’s move from the clay courts of the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills to the hard courts at the USTA National Tennis Center in Queens"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23a62675eb262dd9d888a05bc688911e1a62f768/360_433_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44becd11f457302a05069bd3920fa22a","title":"bengals durga puja a hindu festival in full flow in pictures","story":"For 10 days every autumn, 10 million worshippers take part in the West Bengal festival.

Or maybe he has an Adrian Chiles problem, alleviated by drinking. Anyway, he’s definitely not an alcoholic, he says in his exploration of “nice, regular drinking” in Drinkers Like Me – Adrian Chiles (BBC Two). He can’t be, because he doesn’t wake up in a shop doorway at 4am, or in bed with a stranger. He doesn’t get into fights or fall over. But here he is at 10.20am putting away a pint\u0026nbspin the pub with his friends. The excuse is it’s matchday and an early kick-off – there’s always an excuse. “There’s\u0026nbspdrinking and there’s drinking,” says his friend Kev. Getting through a few morning pints isn’t the same as the lads he knows who get stuck into the Sambuca. By\u0026nbsp11.30, they have had four lagers.The delusions and arbitrary rules we live by are exposed to the light. Chiles’s friend Sarah can’t be an alcoholic, she explains, because she’s “not a vommer”. Another man, Mark, drinks 80 to 100 units a week and has high blood pressure and cholesterol he’s on beta blockers. “We’re addicted to it without being alcoholics,” he says, which is the kind of mental gymnastics you can only perform when you have had a few.The guidelines say men and women should drink no more than 14 units a week – seven pints, or a bottle and a half of wine, says Chiles, incredulous. That’s an aperitif for him. After the match, he went to a party. Sitting in his loft apartment, he calculates that he drank more than 32 units. “Over a week, I can’t imagine I wouldn’t be in triple figures,” he says. Behind him is a shelving unit, neatly stacked with wine glasses.A scan of his liver shows he has mild to moderate fibrosis – scarring – of the liver and “significant liver fat”. “You can’t carry on like this,” his doctor tells him. Chiles is at risk of cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease and liver failure. “And death?” says Chiles. “And death,” the doctor confirms. We are all at risk of death, of course, it’s just that heavy drinkers are taking as much as 20 years off their lives. He can reverse the damage, but it involves drinking much less and having three to four consecutive alcohol-free days. This leaves Chiles as flat as leftover champagne.All the experts tell him to stop. “We know a third of the people coming into the unit with alcohol-related liver damage do not meet the criteria for alcoholism,” says David Nutt, the renowned neuropsychopharmacologist (“not easy to say after a unit or two”). Half of people who drink do it to deal with anxiety and depression, he says.Chiles has had both and takes medication for them. At\u0026nbspa session with a psychotherapist who specialises in addiction, John McKeown, he explores the mental health issues that could be related to his drinking. After his disastrous move to breakfast TV, a job he didn’t keep, he\u0026nbspwas diagnosed with anxiety. “You’re already alcohol-dependent,” says the therapist. Chiles nods sadly when McKeown starts to suggest alcohol changes the way he feels about himself. “If we don’t like ourselves, what do we do to be likable?” Or, as someone at the group Chiles goes to for people with alcohol issues puts it: “Does Adrian love Adrian?” “No, no, God no,” he says. Someone else tells him he is likable – and, open and self-aware, he is.The problem is, alcohol is part of our culture – it is “the only drug you have to apologise for not taking”, he\u0026nbsppoints out. At his parents’ house\u0026nbsp– they have a cocktail cabinet, where he is surprised to find a bottle of absinthe – Chiles recreates the teenage routine of going to the local pub to try to get served, which is one of the most evocative descriptions I have heard about the thrills and anxieties of underage drinking. It takes me back I can almost taste the Diamond White. He associates drinking with friendship and good times, as many of us do. The advice to drink responsibly is, he says, “the world’s most boring phrase”. So, it’s complicated.The comedian Frank Skinner, who comes over for an alcohol-free lunch – he gave up drinking 30 years ago – doesn’t necessarily advocate stopping altogether if Chiles doesn’t have to. “I have never replaced that white heat of joy that you get from alcohol,” he says. Two\u0026nbspmonths later, Chiles has managed to stick to a few non-drinking days a month and developed a taste for alcohol-free beer, but he’s still getting through 25 units a week. It’s a success of sorts, even if we do leave him in\u0026nbspthe pub having a pint."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dff6a4554ef4874c7d7825ba150b828dbaa7bb2/21_13_1779_1067/master/1779.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e55728ac82e6ee0616297dd9b5fefae","title":"myanmars military accused of genocide by damning un report","story":"Mission concludes army has carried out ‘gravest crimes’ against Rohingya in Rakhine and minorities elsewhereMyanmar’s military has been accused of genocide against the Rohingya in Rakhine state in a damning UN report that alleged the army was responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity against minorities across the country.The UN report said it found conclusive evidence that the actions of the country’s armed forces, known as the Tatmadaw, “undoubtedly amounted to the gravest crimes under international law” in Rakhine as well as in Kachin and Shan, states also riven by internal conflicts.The UN investigators were denied access to Myanmar by the government but interviewed 875 witnesses who had fled the country. They found that the military were “killing indiscriminately, gang-raping women, assaulting children and burning entire villages” in Rakhine, home to the Muslim Rohingya, and in Shan and Kachin. The Tatmadaw also carried out murders, imprisonments, enforced disappearances, torture, rapes and used sexual slavery and other forms of sexual violence, persecution and enslavement – all of which constitute crimes against humanity.In northern Rakhine, the mission also found evidence of mass extermination and deportation.“The fact-finding mission’s powerful report and clear recommendations demonstrate the obvious need for concrete steps to advance criminal justice for atrocious crimes, instead of more hollow condemnations and expressions of concern,” said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “This report should eliminate any doubt about the urgency of investigating those responsible for mass atrocities.”The mission, prompted by the UN security council visit in March, called for an investigation into the military’s actions in Rakhine. The campaign of violence against the Rohingya began a year ago. An estimated 25,000 people have been killed and 700,000 have fled over the border to Bangladesh.Following the report’s publication, the UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, tweeted that he would visit the country “to seek answers at the earliest opportunity”.Min Aung Hlaing has occupied the highest office of Myanmar’s military since 2011 and is described as the “most powerful man in the land”, with all military under his control. His hatred of the Rohingya is well-known and he spoke openly of solving “the long-standing Bengali problem” in Myanmar. He travelled to Rakhine before and during the military’s genocide of the Rohingya to oversee the violence and later said the tensions in Rakhine were “fuelled because the Bengalis demanded citizenship.Soe Win has been has been in the position of commander-in-chief (army) since 2011. He has been dogged by allegations of corruption, accused of accepting bribes from companies dealing in jade, timber, and gold. As commander in chief of the army he oversaw successive “clearance operations” in Rakhine state and numerous human rights violations at the hand of the military in Kachin state over the past seven years.As commander of Bureau of Special Operations-3 (BOS 3) Kyaw Zaw controlled all military operations in Rakhine state from 2015 until January 2018. It was under his watch that the military enforced a regime of systematic oppression and domination against the Rohingya which eventually built up to the violence and genocide in 2017.Maung Maung Soe was the commander of western regional military command, the unit who carried out the massacre in Maung Nu in Rakhine state in August 2017. The unit participated in other unlawful killings in at least several dozen other villages, raped and committed other sexual violence against women and girls, and burned villages across northern Rakhine state.As commander of the 33rd Light Infantry Division, it was under his command that troops carried out the massacre, torture, and rape and other sexual violence in Chut Pyin in August 2017 and he personally made threats against Rohingya leaders in the village.\u0026nbspThe 99th Light Infantry Division\u0026nbspunder Than Oo’s command carried out the massacre, torture, and rape and other sexual violence in Min Gyi on 30 August 2017. They burned other Rohingya villages in northern Maungdaw Township. In May 2018, he was quietly stripped of his command transferred to the “auxiliary forces”, which is believed to be a response to pressure from the UN to hold the military accountable for the actions in Rakhine. However, he has never been formally investigated or charged by the military.Laying out the legal argument for genocide to have taken place, the UN report said: “The crimes in Rakhine state, and the manner in which they were perpetrated, are similar in nature, gravity and scope to those that have allowed genocidal intent to be established in other contexts.”Iniduals singled out for investigation and prosecution for genocide and crimes against humanity included Min Aung Hlaing, the commander-in-chief of the Tatmadaw, who has openly stated his intention to solve “the long-standing Bengali problem”.“There is sufficient information to warrant the investigation and prosecution of senior officials in the Tatmadaw chain of command, so that a competent court can determine their liability for genocide in relation to the situation in Rakhine state,” the report said.Minutes after the report was released, Facebook removed 18 accounts and 52 pages associated with the Myanmar military, including that of Min Aung Hlaing. It comes in the wake of months of criticism of the company for failing to combat the spread of hate speech on Facebook in Myanmar. The Tatmadaw have often used their Facebook pages to spread disinformation and anti-Rohingya sentiment, such as photos of dismembered children posted to Min Aung Hlaing’s page, claiming they were killed by “Muslim terrorists”.“We want to prevent them from using our service to further inflame ethnic and religious tensions,” the company said. The pages and accounts that were removed had a total of almost 12 million followers.The UN mission called for Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, to be investigated by the international criminal court (ICC). Although the country is not a signatory to the Rome statute, and therefore not under the jurisdiction of the court, ICC prosecutors are deliberating whether they can investigate the violence in Rakhine.The UN report also prompted Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Fortify Rights and Save the Children to push for Myanmar to be investigated by the ICC.“The international community has the responsibility to act to ensure justice and accountability,” said Tirana Hassan, the director of crisis response at Amnesty International. “Failing to do so sends a dangerous message that Myanmar’s military will not only enjoy impunity but is free to commit such atrocities again.”Michael McGrath, the country director for Save the Children in Myanmar, added: “Children and their families have been murdered, sexually assaulted and forced to flee burning villages, and they have not yet seen the justice they deserve. Establishing the facts through the fact-finding mission was a critical first step to achieving justice however now there must be a move towards investigations for prosecution.”The UN report is very likely to anger Myanmar’s military and government, which have denied genocide has occurred in Rakhine and claimed that the Rohingya – whom they regularly refer to as “illegal Bengali immigrants” – instigated the violence by attacking security forces and then burning their own villages to the ground. Both the military and the civilian government, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, have stated that the actions of the armed forces were an appropriate response to “terrorists”.The Tatmadaw’s own investigation, widely considered a farce, cleared the armed forces of all wrongdoing and the head of Aung San Suu Kyi’s newly established inquiry into Rakhine has said there would be no “finger-pointing, blaming, to say ‘you’re accountable’”.The UN said that, with Myanmar’s repeated failure to admit genocide had taken place and with the legal impunity given to the military, it fell to the international community to hold those responsible to account.Mark Field, the UK’s minister of state for Asia and the Pacific, said “there cannot and must not be impunity for such acts”, but stopped short of calling for Myanmar to be referred to the ICC."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55920fad55ee1563daf50ab1c96603a349b256aa/0_439_6679_4010/master/6679.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf33a18bcaab169adb4faa7ab6d9ed2f","title":"china could scrap two child policy ending nearly 40 years of limits","story":"Draft of civil code being discussed this week contains no references to ‘family planning’ China is mulling scrapping its controversial birth restrictions, reversing nearly four decades of family planning policies as birth rates fall.Chinese couples are limited to two children at present, after rules were relaxed from the infamous one-child policy that was in force from 1979 to 2016. Now officials are poised to enact a wide-ranging civil code that would end a policy that has been enforced through fines but was also notorious for cases of forced abortions and sterilisation in the world’s most populous country.The Procuratorate Daily, a newspaper affiliated with the country’s prosecutor’s office, said the draft code omitted any reference to “family planning” – the current policy which limits couples to having no more than two children. The report did not indicate whether the new policy would raise the limit or allow an unlimited number of children.The draft civil code, which is being discussed by the standing committee of the National People’s Congress this week, is set to be completed by 2020. The draft code also includes “clear rules” to tackle the “intense problem of sexual harassment” reflected throughout society, state-run news agency Xinhua said on Tuesday, in an apparent nod to China’s growing #Metoo movement. Victims can demand perpetrators “assume civil liability” for committing sexual harassment through words or actions, or exploiting someone’s subordinate relationship, Xinhua reported.The Communist party began enforcing a one-child policy in 1979 to slow population growth. The limit was raised to two children in 2016 as the nation scrambled to rejuvenate its ageing population of 1.4 billion.Concerns are mounting that an ageing and shrinking workforce could slow China’s economy, while gender imbalances could lead to social problems.Another concern is Chinese officials could “intervene as aggressively in pro-natalist policies as it did in anti-natalist policies,” she added. “This could have very negative effects on the position of women in the labor market, in society, and in the family.”Childbirths have not increased as much as forecast since the two-child policy came into force, and there has been rising speculation the government will further ease restrictions.Leta Hong Fincher, author of Betraying Big Brother: The Feminist Awakening in China, said: “It’s quite clear that the Chinese government is increasingly alarmed at the low birth rate and the failure to produce the expected boost in births by easing the one-child policy.”The meetings of the standing committee of the National People’s Congress, a powerful body of lawmakers headed by Li Zhanshu, run until Friday.Other proposed changes include a one-month cooling-off period before a orce, during which either party can withdraw their application.News of the proposed changes lit up social media. “So they want us to have more babies and less orces?” wrote one user on Weibo, China’s equivalent of Twitter.“The created generation, us only children, let’s gather together and prepare to work in our twilight years,” another user wrote. “Having children is good, eases the government’s healthcare cost for the elderly.”Speculation about a change grew this month after a government-issued postage stamp for the Year of the Pig in 2019 showed a porcine family complete with three piglets.Couples have been in no rush to start larger families since the policy was loosened, with 17.9 million babies born in 2016 – just 1.3 million more than in the previous year, and half of what was expected, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.Births in 2017 even slipped to 17.2 million, well below the official forecast of more than 20 million.Two Chinese academics caused a social media storm earlier this month when they proposed that couples with one or no children should pay into a tax-like “maternity fund”.Hong Fincher said it remained to be seen how the Chinese government would implement any changes. She said incentives to have more children had not worked and the government might resort to other measures such as pressuring young women to get married and restricting abortions.“Whatever policy they implement,” she said, “they will continue to control women’s reproductive rights.”Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/351315acd897a25bcc075c7a7ef0aee79c2245f0/0_178_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b20abecf37a4d19de3e3b4a219e1b1ce","title":"iran cleric esmail azarinejad bringing joy of reading poor children","story":"Book lover Esmail Azarinejad is a far cry from the Iranian theocrats who rail against America“It was almost winter and Bear was getting sleepy,” the Iranian cleric reads aloud. He has taken off his clerical robe, put aside his white turban and is trying to entertain a group of children in one of Iran’s poorest villages.In between phrases, he troops back and forth to make sure everyone is listening. “Are you with me?” he asks. “What did Bear want to do?” The children, who are painting their school walls, reply: “Bear had a story to tell.”It’s all in a day’s work for Esmail Azarinejad, a father of two who is not your average cleric. Iranian theocrats are better known for delivering inflammatory remarks at Friday prayers or fulminating on television against a backdrop of “Death to America” chants.Azarinejad, 39, sees his mission somewhat differently. When he’s not teaching Islamic philosophy or Arabic literature at his city’s seminary, he travels to villages in the impoverished south-west of Iran, distributing books from the boot of his old Peugeot and reading passages from books such as Bear Has a Story to Tell by the American author Philip C Stead.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theIn his free time, he has started visiting the province’s poorest villages, reading books for kids, showing them films or helping them paint their schools.“Reading books and telling tales is an excuse for me,” he told the . “My aim is their intellectual development, so that they have a beautiful world and be able to develop skills. I have a slogan, which says: story, ball, colour. Story will make their minds and world beautiful, ball is playing sport and being healthy, and colour is about painting schools or their libraries.”Azarinejad’s car carries a range of books and films including the Persian translations of titles by the Canadian author and illustrator Peter H Reynolds and those written by the American author Megan McDonald, who is known for her Judy Moody series.“I try to prepare the space for their creativity rather than teach them what to do,” Azarinejad said. “I have no prejudice in choosing book titles, whether written by a foreign writer or by an Iranian, whether religious or not, any book that is fit for developing their mind and skills is good to me.”In his latest trip this week to villages in Dishmok district, Azarinejad showed a four-minute film by the Palme d’Or-winning Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami to 15 children. Early in his career, Kiarostami, who became Iran’s foremost film-maker before his death in 2016, worked at the institute for intellectual development of children and young adults in Tehran, making films about children.Azarinejad said showing Kiarostami’s Two Solutions for One Problem seemed essential in the village because he realised the adults there had been locked in a feud for some time.“Afterwards, I gave them five words to use and compose a story of their own: oak tree, dried-up river, grandma, goat and crocodile. They have oak trees in the area and also a river, and I wanted to draw their attention to the fact that one day their river might dry up,” he said.Iran has a rich tradition of storytelling and fairytales. Its oldest form of dramatic performance is called Naghali, which is on Unesco’s list of intangible cultural heritage in need of urgent safeguarding. According to Unesco, “the performer – the naqqāl – recounts stories in verse or prose accompanied by gestures and movements, and sometimes instrumental music and painted scrolls”.Azarinejad said the age of social media has hugely sidelined such ancient traditions that need to be revived, something he hopes to do by encouraging children to write down fairytales told to them by their grandparents, and then recite them to their friends.The Iranian cleric, who earns about 15m rials (£275) a month, insisted he works on a benevolent basis but encourages donations to support his activities. Provincial locals are raising money to buy him a new car.“I use my private car, use my own petrol, I take my own food while visiting these villages,” said the cleric, who documents his work on social media. “I have not pursued government help, nor they have given me any. This is happening in the sidelines of my life, not related to my job.”Azarinejad, who has two children aged seven and 12, said the tough times Iran is facing because of sanctions and a tense political situation have not taken hope away from him.“There’s a sense of hopeless, there are financial difficulties, but personally I haven’t lost my hope,” he said. “My hope is these kids, so long as I can encourage them to read books, I’ll remain hopeful. So long as I see kids with books in their hand, hope will be there.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

It’s not everyone’s thing ... you don’t wear wool unless you have to. But then I realised it is actually comfortable and warm. Now I am into it, I mean I might even consider wearing it to the school ball.The catwalk has been constructed in a packing shed with worn Persian carpets taped to the floor to keep the models’ toes warm. Daphne Randle, 79, is sitting in the front row on a winter’s night that drops to minus 3C, watching her woollen creations on the catwalk. Randle is an award-winning knitter, and wool royalty in the deep south of New Zealand.When Randle quit smoking more than two decades ago, she took up knitting to keep her hands busy and she took it up big time, and is now the most famous knitter for miles around.But for Randle, knitting isn’t a hobby, it’s a vocation. Like many other rural New Zealand women, she is determined to resuscitate the beleaguered wool industry, one stitch at a time.“When something is made with love it carries a sort of karma,” says Randle who grew up on a 400-hectare (1,000-acre) sheep station in South Otago and started knitting at the age of four.“People are starting to want something that is special. New Zealand has always called itself a wool country. And I think women on farms have always made their own clothes and knitted. Now they’re just turning it into businesses.”Randle is one of the 55 designers – amateur and professional – who have crafted knitted creations from scratch for the WoolOn fashion show efforts that are beginning to snag the interest of big-time designers.The show aims to raise the profile of wool in New Zealand and the world, and has become especially popular with farmer’s wives. Traditional skills that have long kept the homes fires burning are being used in new ways.“Wool doesn’t have a sexy reputation at the moment,” says Leonie Williamson, WoolOn’s co-chair.“If you can make it more fashionable, more glamorous, it will lose some of that stigma of being Grandma’s woolly jumper, lumpy and bumpy and all of that.”.Simon Swale, a senior lecturer at Otago Polytechnic’s school of design and one of the three judges at the event, is wrapped up in a leather and sheep shearling jacket. He says wool is on the brink of a resurgence in New Zealand and around the globe, as people look for quality, natural fibres and begin rejecting fast, disposable fashion.“Wool is one of the bedrocks of New Zealand culture, of the New Zealand economy, we owe a lot of our history to what wool has done for us,” says Swale. “It is part of our identity.”But the wool industry in New Zealand is in crisis. In July, agriculture minister Damien O’Connor hosted a summit in the capital Wellington to discuss record low returns and poor morale in the industry as the popularity and value of strong wool (from crossbred sheep) continues to spiral down.There are six sheep for every person in New Zealand, but this statistic belies a massive decline, from a peak of 22 sheep per person in 1982.The reasons for wool’s decline are complex, but the rise of the more lucrative dairy industry, land tenure in the high country (the traditional home of merino sheep) and farmers focusing on meat production have all contributed to the downturn.However WoolOn competitors and Federated Farmers insist strong wool is suitable for clothing and fashion too, especially when processed using modern techniques.O’Connor says the best chance for the industry is to promote wool as a warm, breathable and natural at a time when the rage for plastics and synthetic fibres is waning. The government is exploring how to connect the sector with European and Chinese fashion houses, something Australian rivals did years ago."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1d6f19f3b953e86f3bc767e275668e68bb66853/0_195_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9ed4fb2860420acea1e96227b30edb7","title":"vatican erases popes remarks about psychiatric help for gay children","story":"The pope had said ‘there is a lot that can be done through psychiatry’ if parents think their child is homosexualThe Vatican has rolled back on a recommendation by Pope Francis that parents seek psychiatric help for children who show homosexual tendencies.The pope made the comments to journalists as he was flying back to Rome from Ireland, but the Vatican later removed his phrase from its official account, saying he had not meant to suggest that homosexuality was a mental illness.The pope was asked by a journalist what he would say to parents who observe homosexual traits in their children.When it shows itself from childhood, there is a lot that can be done through psychiatry, to see how things are.

Photograph: iStockI’m running out of holidays. I still have two weeks to come in 2018, and in most jobs that would mean that I still have plenty of holidays left.I am on my 79th consecutive day off, counting all the weekends and bank holidays (I’d only be on day 56 if I didn’t count these, but it’s hard to round that up to three months and I want to be fair to the begrudgers).Now that we are all into wellbeing and mindfulness and cultivating our own self-worth rather than comparing ourselves with the Joneses, begrudgers are becoming an endangered species.Teachers have a duty to do what they can to help them survive, and our obscene summer holidays are a precious source of vital nutrition.I have yet to meet a classy begrudger on this topic, a well-informed and articulate one who knows that correcting the summer exams and writing school reports take up the best part of, if not more than, a week of our holidays.We don’t actually teach then, and of course all non-teaching time is time off. Similarly, even if teachers do courses over the summer and read and prepare school-related material, they are off work.No monetary gain and certainly no additional holidays in lieu. There surely isn’t any need anyway, because as everyone knows, teachers have such amazing holidays that an odd bit of work here and there will hardly do us any harm.And anyway, when I do go back to work, isn’t teaching little more than a part-time job, even though I am one of the lucky teachers to have a contract for full hours?The “fact” that a teacher supposedly works little more than 20 hours per week gets massive airtime.While it is true that an Irish secondary school teacher only teaches 21 hours and 20 minutes per week, there is more to that than most people think, and we certainly aren’t “off” the rest of the time. The teaching contract for Irish teachers focuses primarily (if not exclusively) on teaching time.This is unusual by international standards, because the teachers’ contract in many OECD countries includes recognition of the essential work that teachers do beyond the time actually spent delivering their classes. So what exactly is this essential work that teachers do while they are “off”?Teaching a subject that is allocated, say, four class periods of 40 minutes per week means teaching eight different class groups. Assuming that each of those groups has 25-30 pupils, that’s more than 200 pupils.This, of course, equals the number of copybooks a teacher would check per week if that were in fact physically possible.It certainly represents the number of inidual pieces of classwork, homework or tests to be corrected regularly, even if different subject areas or schools vary in their specific demands.We write school reports at least three times a year, too, one per pupil in fact. We could hardly expect the begrudgers to let us off with anything less, what with those record-breaking holidays we have.Are we doing enough to earn them anyway? After all, our school year isn’t even that long compared with other EU countries.Our critics cannot emphasise loudly or often enough how appalling it is that we are off for the whole month of June when most of our EU counterparts are still working.They are correct about teachers elsewhere teaching further into the summer, but I wonder why they do not give the complete picture.Average teaching time in secondary schools across the EU countries in the OECD comes in at 668 hours, while in Ireland we teach an average of 735. Would I be pushing my luck to point out that putting in more hours over a shorter school year actually makes the job harder? Most definitely. People just don’t want to know.Full-time teaching for 35 or 40 years makes for a demanding marathon of a career. Ours is a profession that almost everyone has an opinion on, regardless of whether they have ever taught a class.And here’s the rub: sitting on one side of the desk as one of 30 is something we have all done, but standing solo on the other is a different matter entirely. Not for nothing does it now take six years in Ireland to make that transition across the desk.For those who think that’s unnecessary, surely there’s a reality TV programme waiting to be made: Teach for a Week, anyone? Probably not. Teacher for a summer is the only gig the begrudgers are really after.The “secret teacher” is a practising secondary school teacher who will write an occasional series of anonymous columns.

Photograph: GreenpeaceAFPGetty Images Air pollution causes a “huge” reduction in intelligence, according to new research, indicating that the damage to society of toxic air is far deeper than the well-known impacts on physical health.The research was conducted in China but is relevant across the world, with 95 per cent of the global population breathing unsafe air. It found that high pollution levels led to significant drops in test scores in language and arithmetic, with the average impact equivalent to having lost a year of the person’s education.Previous research has found that air pollution harms cognitive performance in students, but this is the first to examine people of all ages and the difference between men and women.The damage in intelligence was worst for those over 64 years old, with serious consequences, said Mr Chen: “We usually make the most critical financial decisions in old age.” Rebecca Daniels, from the UK public health charity Medact, said: “This report’s findings are extremely worrying.”Air pollution causes seven million premature deaths a year but the harm to people’s mental abilities is less well known. A recent study found toxic air was linked to “extremely high mortality” in people with mental disorders and earlier work linked it to increased mental illness in children, while another analysis found those living near busy roads had an increased risk of dementia.The new work, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, analysed language and arithmetic tests conducted as part of the China Family Panel Studies on 20,000 people across the nation between 2010 and 2014. The scientists compared the test results with records of nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide pollution.They found the longer people were exposed to dirty air, the bigger the damage to intelligence, with language ability more harmed than mathematical ability and men more harmed than women. The researchers said this may result from differences in how male and female brains work.Derrick Ho, at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, said the impact of air pollution on cognition was important and his group had similar preliminary findings in their work. “It is because high air pollution can potentially be associated with oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration of humans,” he said.Mr Chen said air pollution was most likely to be the cause of the loss of intelligence, rather than simply being a correlation. The study followed the same iniduals as air pollution varied from one year to the next, meaning that many other possible causal factors such as genetic differences are automatically accounted for.The scientists also accounted for the gradual decline in cognition seen as people age and ruled out people being more impatient or uncooperative during tests when pollution was high.Air pollution was seen to have a short-term impact on intelligence as well and Mr Chen said this could have important consequences, for example for students who have to take crucial entrance exams on polluted days.“But there is no shortcut to solve this issue,” he said. “Governments really need to take concrete measures to reduce air pollution. That may benefit human capital, which is one of the most important driving forces of economic growth.” In China, air pollution is declining but remains three times above World Health Organisation (WHO) limits.According to the WHO, 20 of the world’s most polluted cities are in developing countries. China, home to several of those cities, has been engaged in a “war against pollution” for the past five years.The results would apply around the world, Mr Chen added. The damage to intelligence was likely to be incremental, he said, with a 1mg rise in pollution over three years equivalent to losing more than a month of education. Small pollution particles are known to be especially damaging. “That is the same wherever you live. As human beings we have more in common than is different.”Aarash Saleh, a registrar in respiratory medicine in the UK and part of the Doctors Against Diesel campaign, said: “This study adds to the concerning bank of evidence showing that exposure to air pollution can worsen our cognitive function. Road traffic is the biggest contributor to air pollution in residential areas and the government needs to act urgently to remove heavily-polluting vehicles from our roads.”Ms Daniels said: “The UK’s air is illegally polluted and is harming people’s health every day. Current policies are not up to the scale of the challenge: government must commit to bringing air pollution below legal limits as soon as possible.”– "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3609399.1535391321!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit progress on future relationship key to backstop says coveney","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSimon Coveney: expected to stress Ireland’s desire for the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK. Photograph: Julien Behal PhotographyProgress on the shape of the future relationship between the EU and the UK in the coming weeks is the key to securing agreement on a legally binding backstop, the Tánaiste Simon Coveney has said.Mr Coveney said that if the British government believed it was never going to have to use the backstop provision – because it would agree a close future trading relationship – then it was more likely to agree the backstop.The Minister for Foreign Affairs was speaking before departing for Berlin last night, where he will address an audience of German diplomats and business people today.The British government agreed on the principle of a backstop – guaranteeing no hard border in Ireland even if there is no agreement on a future relationship – last December but has since rejected a draft text from the EU that would have kept Northern Ireland inside the EU’s single market and customs union.The EU has also rejected a British approach that would have extended the single market and customs union advantages to the UK as a whole.Mr Coveney was keen to draw a distinction between the two strands of talks taking place in Brussels between the UK and the EU: the negotiations on the text of the Withdrawal Agreement, which must include a legally binding backstop, and the negotiations on the future relationship between Britain and the bloc, which are likely to continue for another two years, assuming the withdrawal treaty (which also includes a transition period) is agreed in the coming months.“The British government has made it clear they need as much clarity as possible on what the future relationship will look like before they can sign off on a withdrawal treaty,” Mr Coveney said at Trinity College yesterday, where he was attending an event at the Long Room hub.“I think that comes into real focus when you talk about the Irish backstop, because if we have a clear signal on what the future relationship is likely to look like, which means that the backstop is less likely to be used in the future, then of course it’s easier to agree it,” he added.“So the two are linked, but they are in some ways separate negotiations in terms of legal text.”Mr Coveney will address the annual conference of German ambassadors in Berlin today. As well as 200 German ambassadors from around the world, the audience will also contain 700 business people from all sectors of the economy.Mr Coveney is attending the meeting at the invitation of the German foreign minister Heiko Maas. He will also hold a bilateral meeting with Mr Maas, which is likely to focus on Brexit issues.The Tánaiste is also scheduled to brief German journalists on Ireland’s Brexit position and give an interview to Reuters Germany.Mr Coveney is expected to stress a growing theme in the Government’s communications on Brexit: Ireland’s desire for the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK.“This is profoundly in the economic, political and security interests of both sides,” he will say, although he will also stress that the new relationship “must respect the EU’s core principles and achievements, including the single market and customs union.“If those essential elements can be safeguarded, then I think there is indeed scope for a unique future partnership,” Mr Coveney will say.Mr Coveney will say that if the British government can “develop its position further”, then the EU should respond with concessions on its own.“I am sure our union can be imaginative in return,” he is expected to say.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

He wished all the candidates the best of luckMr Higgins confirmed in late June that he had decided to seek re-election for a second term as president of Ireland. The sitting president can nominate himself to contest in the election.Fine Gael has said it will actively canvass for the re-election of Mr Higgins and may use party resources to assist his campaign for a second term in Áras an Uachtaráin.Sinn Féin has said it will also include a candidate in the election.Those who have expressed an interest in standing as Independent candidates against Mr Higgins have two options to enter the contest: by gathering 20 signatures from TDs and Senators or by winning the backing of four county councils. As the Dáil does not return from its summer recess until September 18th, the focus for most aspiring candidates is on the councils.Councillors in Meath began hearing petitions from would-be candidates for the presidency on Monday. Businessman Gavin Duffy, Navan-based musician Jimmy Smith, journalist Gemma O’Doherty, founder of Pieta House suicide prevention charity Senator Joan Freeman, Roscommon farmer John Groarke, artist Kevin Sharkey, Marilyn Monroe impersonator Sarah Louise Mulligan, Patrick Feeney and Marie Goretti Moylan all addressed Monday’s petition meeting in Navan.Mr Smith spoke of the homelessness crisis and mental health issues and also said he would like to see two articles restored to the Constitution which would allow the removal of ministers for incompetence.Mr Smith, who said he had played for the thousands of people who supported the Stand4Truth demonstration in solidarity with survivors of sexual abuse during the pope’s visit to Dublin at the weekend, said Ireland was a “changing country”. He said he did not have any views on the pope or on religion but that “all religions should be tolerated”.Mr Duffy, who is from Co Meath, told councillors that, as president, he would be “among the people, not just talking to them, but more importantly listening to them and helping to channel their ideas and concerns through the platform of the presidency”. He said Ireland was changing dramatically.He proposed an “international youth corps” for young people in order to capture “missionary zeal”. They would spend three months serving their local community followed by three months overseas in the developing world.Ms Freeman began her address shortly after 11.30am and is addressing councillors on her passion for supporting mental health issues.She said she wanted to use “the highest office” in the land to focus attention, to generate dialogue, to highlight issues, and to “surely, doggedly and persistently” make the changes in this country we so needed.Kildare County Council was also set to hold a session on Monday to hear from potential candidates.The Fine Gael chairman of Westmeath County Council told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that the council would most likely back Mr Duffy as its nomination for the presidential election."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Captain of flight on which 51 died in March was \u0026lsquoupset and hurt\u0026rsquoAll content on family planning has been dropped in a draft civil code being deliberated by lawmakersUN calls for genocide charges against army leaders for attacks on Rohingya minorityReporters accused of illegally possessing official documentsMove against hate speech after UN report accuses miltary of genocide in treatment of RohingyaSecurity forces carried out \u0026lsquocrimes against humanity\u0026rsquo against Rohingya and other groupsNegotiations remain deadlocked as Mike Pompeo\u0026rsquos visit cancelledJulie Bishop announces move to backbench after Scott Morrison wins leadership battlePark Geun-hye was ousted from office last year and jailed on corruption chargesTurnbull blames \u0026lsquoinsurgency\u0026rsquo in Liberal Party \u0026lsquobacked by powerful voices in the media\u0026rsquoMore than 380,000 minors lack education and basic facilities in Bangladesh campsMalcolm Turnbull faces likely ousting on Friday after caving in too often to conservativesPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull accuses rival\u0026rsquos supporters of bullying MPs in bid to force him outUN atomic watchdog observed actions consistent with uranium enrichment, says reportChallenger Peter Dutton says he is working on renewed bid to unseat Malcolm TurnbullJulie Anne Genter the country\u0026rsquos second member of the government, after prime minister Jacinda Ardern, to give birth this yearBeijing Letter: Election of bishops a key to power struggle for China\u0026rsquos CatholicsEl Salvador is third diplomatic ally this year to switch from TaipeiNobel laureate target of flak over Rohingya exodus, but says generals all \u0026lsquorather sweet\u0026rsquoRelations have deteriorated sharply between neighbouring states in past three years"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3610014.1535442554!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no deal brexit wouldn t be end of the world says theresa may","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa Mays says government is putting in place measures to ensure it can ‘make a success of no deal’. Photograph: Matt DunhamAFPGetty Images UK prime minister Theresa May dismissed fears of a no-deal Brexit situation as she played down British Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond’s warnings of major economic consequences.Ms May repeated claims that no agreement with the EU “would not be a walk in the park” but “wouldn’t be the end of the world”.She added the British government is putting in place measures to ensure it can “make a success of no deal” and remains confident it can do similar with a “good deal” — which she maintained it was possible to agree.Ms May also said Mr Hammond was highlighting “work in progress” figures released in January when he published a letter just hours after the government started revealing its no-deal Brexit preparations.The chancellor was accused by Tory backbenchers of launching another “project fear” by referring to disputed provisional analysis which claimed GDP could fall and borrowing could be around £80 billion (€88bn) a year higher by 203334 if Britain resorted to World Trade Organisation terms.Mr Hammond said such an impact on GDP would have “large fiscal consequences”.He also said this analysis was undergoing a “process of refinement” ahead of a parliamentary vote on any deal.Ms May, asked about the timing and content of Mr Hammond’s intervention, said she had previously labelled the data as a work in progress.Speaking to reporters on her trade mission to Africa, she added: “Look at what the director of the World Trade Organisation has said.“He said about a no deal situation that it would not be a walk in the park but it wouldn’t be the end of the world.“What the government is doing is putting in place the preparations such that if we’re in that situation we can make a success of it, just as we will make a success of the good deal I believe we’re able to get and the good deal we’re working to get.”Ms May was also challenged on whether she would order her MPs to vote for no deal if her preferred approach — agreed following talks at Chequers — was not secured with the EU.She replied: “I’ve said right from the beginning that no deal is better than a bad deal.“I think it’s absolutely right that the government is putting the preparations in place for no deal because we don’t know what the outcome of this is going to be.“But alongside that what we’re doing is working for a good deal.“I believe what we’ve set out in the Chequers arrangement, set out in the white paper is a deal that benefits not just the United Kingdom but benefits the European Union as well.”Eurosceptic Tories have criticised the government’s proposals, which include a “common rulebook” with the EU on goods, amid fears it could restrict the UK’s ability to do trade deals.Ms May also said the UK was working to secure a deal by October and within a timetable which meant Brexit could occur in March 2019.On whether Tory MPs face a backlash from their local party associations for supporting a second EU referendum, Ms May added: “I believe that what matters to local associations is what the Conservative government is delivering for them - and what we’re delivering is what the people voted for.”Ms May also reiterated the UK government’s desire to end free movement is “non-negotiable”.Meanwhile French prime minister Edouard Philippe on Monday tasked his ministers to prepare contingency measures in case of a no-deal Brexit. France is keeping working on the basis that Britain will reach a deal with its European Union partners on its exit from the bloc but needs to be ready in case Britain left with no deal, Philippe’s office said in a statement. Measures will include facilitating the stay of British citizens currently living in France and ensuring smooth border controls, the statement said."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

It was a fairly low-key event, with a portable stage not much bigger than the park’s bandstand. The lineup was comprised of mainly tribute acts.Fast forward to 2018, and Bingley Music Live, as the event evolved into, is preparing for its biggest three-day festival yet, on the weekend of Friday 31 August. This time the roster is a little more impressive: Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds, Jake Bugg, Public Image Ltd, Shed Seven, former Spice Girl Melanie C… and all on a stage that wouldn’t be out of place at one of the summer’s big-name festivals.But, so what? Festivals are big business in the UK, and the summer calendar is stuffed with internationally-renowned acts zipping between fields across the country. Just down the road from Bradford, the Leeds Festival is twinned with its more venerable cousin Reading, and together they form the apex of the festival pyramid with old-stager Glastonbury (when it’s not having a fallow year, like this summer).But also on the calendar is Latitude, the Isle of Wight Festival, RiZE (formerly the V Festival), Wireless, Creamfields, BBC Music’s Big Weekend, Bestival… it seems that no matter where you are in the country, sling a 12in picture disc like a frisbee any time over the summer and you’re almost certain to hit a music superstar on the head.But what makes Bingley Music Live a slightly different beast is that just like the inaugural Music at Myrtle\u0026nbspevent in 1991, it is still run by the local authority. No longer free, of course, because you don’t get Noel Gallagher out of bed on the sort of money you can make up by adding a few quid on the council tax bills. But value for money certainly, compared to the big commercial festivals, and certainly pulling its weight in the ring with many of them.A spokesperson for Bradford Council said\u0026nbspthat when Music at Myrtle was set up in 1991, nobody really expected that it would become the major player it is now. She says:\u0026nbsp“When we held our first small free concert few could have envisaged that the festival would grow to attract such big names as Pet Shop Boys, Kaiser Chiefs, Manic Street Preachers, Chic and Nile Rogers, All Saints, Jess Glynne\u0026nbspand James who have all played over recent years.”The key, though, is that Bingley Music Live has grown organically. Bradford Council never set out to make a full-blown festival, it expanded a little bit year by year. She adds:\u0026nbsp“Although it has come a long way from its humble beginnings and it is unusual for a council to be involved in such a big festival we have grown it gradually and now it sees 15,000 people a day flock to the town for festival weekend.”\u0026nbspIn its early years, Music at Myrtle was split into themed days, with old rockers such as Bradford’s own Smokie on the bill, newer bands for the younger audience, and jazz. In 1998 Bradford Council partnered with local radio station Pulse to make the event a two-day festival, with Pulse using their clout and contacts book to bring in bigger names such as Liberty X, McFly, Rachel Stevens and another Bradford boy-done-good, Gareth Gates.That continued into the 2000s, until what was then billed as the Party in the Park hit its first major bump in the road. In February 2007, the event was summarily cancelled. Rising costs and declining audiences were blamed, and the Pulse’s station director, Tony Wilkinson, told the local paper,\u0026nbsp and\u0026nbspArgus, that support from the music industry for such small festivals was on the wane. He said that the record labels did not have “as many artists out on promotional tours to provide a top class running order”.Despite its small size, the festival has attracted larger, mainstream acts such as Maximo ParkWhat nobody envisaged in 2007, though, was that the music industry was in the throes of a massive shakeup. Downloading and streaming of music was in its infancy then, and music acts still made the majority of their money from physical album and single sales. However, a decade on, that situation is reversed nowadays it’s the touring of live shows and pounding the festival beat that earns pop and rock bands a crust.It would be nice to think that Bradford Council was playing something of a blinder back in 2007, but the chances are that it was pure serendipity. Either way, within a couple of months of the announcement that the Myrtle Park festival was dead, it rose from the ashes.The original plan was to scale back on the A-listers and give more of a platform to unknown, local bands. The rescue package had been put together wholly by Bradford Council, and they were obviously mindful of the budgetary restrictions of putting on a big festival but still wanting to provide residents with a music event of some description.Indeed, it was the residents of Bingley in particular who lobbied the council to save the festival in some form. This was at a time when the financial crisis was just bubbling over, and it’s fair to say that Bradford had been hit harder than most cities. Neighbouring Leeds had stolen a march on city centre development and by the mid-2000s had a thriving retail and leisure sector that put it in a stronger position to weather the credit crunch.aren’t too far removed from its neighbouring Leeds\u0026nbspBefore the financial collapse, Bradford had been on the up as well. Large swathes of the city centre had been demolished to make way for a brand new shopping centre built by Westfield. The majority of the work on taking down the tired, old buildings began in 2004, but by 2007 everything had stalled, leaving Bradford with an infamous hole in the ground that made it look as though it was ground zero of a meteor strike. It wasn’t until 2015 that the centre was completed and opened… and, to be fair, did help to kickstart a much-needed revitalisation of Bradford.So it was understandable in that atmosphere in 2007 that people wanted some form of entertainment, and Bingley Music Live was it. That year’s festival was indeed\u0026nbsppared down, but still attracted some recognisable names – Bruce Foxton’s post-Paul Weller “From The Jam” outfit, the Charlatans, the Bluetones. The following year brought the Happy Mondays, Echo and the Bunnymen, and local heroes Terrorvision.\u0026nbspBy the time the first headliners the Charlatans returned in 2012, the festival had added a third day on the Friday, and the festival was really on an upward curve.But can a local authority really justify the cost? There are partners of course, including Ticketline, Mercure Hotels and Carlsberg. But surely it doesn’t make any money?According to a Bradford Council reply to a freedom of information request last month asking for income and expenditure on Bingley Music Live over the past three years, in 2015 there was income of £946,000 against just over £1m in costs. In 2016 income was down at £822,000 against very similar costs, but last year, with costs standing at £1.15m, there was gross income of £1.3m… leaving a net surplus of £222,000.Having attended the event last year, those figure’s aren’t surprising. It was packed and money was flowing over the bars and food concessions. It’s also a very family-oriented event. And with ticket sales ensuring 15,000 come through the gates every day this year –\u0026nbspwhich the coup of booking Noel Gallagher has certainly helped with –\u0026nbspit looks likely that Bingley Music Live is on an upward trend.Being in the middle of one of the Bradford district’s big towns as well, rather than in splendid isolation on a field somewhere in Hampshire, there are extra benefits. My council spokesperson says: “The event is a big thing for Bingley’s businesses, with its many excellent pubs, bars, shops and places to eat all busy with people for the full weekend. The festival is also embraced by the local Bradford and Bingley Sports Club who provide camping for festivalgoers on their fields.”Ariana Grande and James Corden perform hit-filled version of TitanicWhy drag queen Vicky Vox is starring in Little Shop of HorrorsCamp Bestival forced to close early due to poor weather conditionsWhile Bingley Music Live might be unusual in being local authority-run, its model of being an “urban festival” is one that is becoming increasingly popular… and can pay idends for local economies.Journalist Claude Lynch, writing in CityMetric earlier this year, said that while the big, camp-out-all-weekend festivals were declining, smaller, urban festivals were thriving… and possibly because of a sense of community. He wrote: “Multiple studies into the dynamics and economics of festivals make similar arguments about how to drive ‘re-patronising’ – in other words, how to make festivalgoers want to come back next year. Evidence suggests that ‘social identification’ – having something in common with other festivalgoers – is often just as important as the quality of the music or the food. Festivals can capitalise on this boon of social identification by offering a self-contained event designed\u0026nbspwith both locals and tourists in mind. Locals are more likely to patronise events that emphasise community spirit while tourists are enthused by events that symbolise and epitomise the local culture.”From very humble beginnings 27 years ago, Bingley Music Live has survived and thrived, often against the odds, and when international superstar Noel Gallagher takes the stage in a couple of weeks’ time, it will be the culmination of the dogged determination that gets things done in this part of the world… and looks like providing the template for the future of live music.For more information go to bingleymusicliveMusic at MyrtleEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Despite its small size, the festival has attracted larger, mainstream acts such as Maximo Park"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/10/16/south-africa-school.jpg","title":"south africa corruption president ramaphosa mabuza zuma anc","story":"Created with Sketch.The ruling African National Congress pledges education and opportunity\u0026nbspfor black people\u0026nbsp– but embezzlement in the\u0026nbspdeputy president’s province has left schools so decrepit that children plunge to their death in toiletsClick to followThe IndependentSchool at Orange Farm, near Soweto: one of the ANC’s policies is to improve education for black South African childrenZiyanda\u0026nbspNkosi hated going to the bathroom at school.

Mommy!” she screamed, managing to hold on long enough for an older boy to run in and save her.Hundreds of parents, enraged that their warnings about the dilapidated school had been ignored for years, burst into protest a couple of days later, upending their quiet rural town for two weeks last August. They burned tires, blocked roads and demanded justice from the provincial government led by David Mabuza, a former maths teacher who had become one of the most powerful figures in the African National Congress (ANC) and was positioning himself to become South Africa’s deputy president.One of the party’s historic promises had been to provide a good education for black people, who had been deliberately denied the opportunity under apartheid. ANC leaders like Nelson Mandela often spoke about freeing black South Africans through school\u0026nbspand Mabuza, whose first big post in the province was education minister, got his political start by promising just that.But under the ANC the education system has been a\u0026nbspshambles, so gutted by corruption that even party officials are dismayed at how little students are learning, in schools so decrepit that children have plunged to their deaths in pit toilets.The rage in Ziyanda’s town grew so intense that protesters hurled stones at a local ANC leader, who narrowly escaped by whipping out his handgun and shooting randomly into the crowd, wounding two children and roiling the community all the more.Mabuza never came to the school or met with the parents –\u0026nbspand for good reason, local officials contend. The dangerous conditions were a clear reflection of his control over the province, where millions of dollars for education have disappeared into a vortex of suspicious spending, shoddy public construction and brazen corruption to fuel his political ambitions, according to government records and officials in his party.But the uprising and allegations against Mabuza did not crimp his political rise. To the contrary, only a few months later, as the ANC tried to quash national outrage over misrule by its leaders, Mabuza scored his biggest triumph by far. He was picked to become second-in-command of the entire ANC, launching him into an even more prominent post\u0026nbspas South Africa’s deputy president, second only to the nation’s leader.Mabuza may seem an odd choice, especially at a time when the ANC is desperate to purge its reputation for graft and restore its image as the rightful heir to Mandela’s legacy. After all, Mabuza’s rural province, Mpumalanga, is fairly small, has little economic clout and is widely regarded as one of the country’s most corrupt.But that is the vexing secret behind Mabuza’s spectacular climb, current and former ANC officials say: he siphoned off money from schools and other public services to buy loyalty and amass enormous power, making him impossible to ignore on the national stage and putting him in position to shape South Africa for years to come.Mabuza (second right) (AFPGetty)“He didn’t become what he is now because of his political capability,” says\u0026nbspFish Mahlalela, a senior ANC figure in the province and a national lawmaker.“No, no, it was out of money and\u0026nbspmanipulation,” he adds. “Nothing else.”Perhaps more than any other member of South Africa’s new government, Mabuza undercuts the promise of a “new dawn” in the country after the removal of President Jacob Zuma this year.Besieged by scandals that have hacked away at the ANC’s legitimacy and electoral prospects, the party installed a new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, in February. From the start, he pledged to root out corruption and finally deliver on the promise of a just South Africa for all of its citizens.But to seal his new post, Ramaphosa first had to secure the backing of Mabuza, 57, who built such a formidable political machine that he became kingmaker in the back-room negotiations to choose South Africa’s new president. After campaigning for a rival, Mabuza abruptly switched sides and joined forces with Ramaphosa, helping the two emerge from a pivotal party conference last December as the country’s undisputed leaders.Then, to the surprise of many in his province, Mabuza gave a speech just weeks after being sworn in as deputy president this year, lamenting the poor state of the schools and the “tragedies that take away the innocence of our children”. He spoke movingly of a kindergartner electrocuted at school. Of a toddler who drowned after falling into a broken pit latrine. And of a five-year-old boy whose body was discovered by his mother at the bottom of another dilapidated pit, his hand sticking out of a pool of faeces.Such deplorable conditions were all too common, he noted, symbolising the failure to provide black South Africans with a decent chance at life.“Where is our care?” Mabuza said in the speech. “What has gone wrong with our nation?”Yet under Mabuza’s leadership, millions of dollars for schools in his province have been misspent year after year, according to the national government. His province routinely spent less on poor students than required\u0026nbspand school construction projects have been riddled with inflated costs, government records show.Nearly a quarter of the primary schools in Mabuza’s province still have only dilapidated pit toilets, despite ample government funds to fix them. And during his tenure, his province was caught fabricating the passing rates on the annual national exam, enabling him to claim big leaps forward that never happened.The schools Mabuza did champion provided an easy way to funnel large amounts of money into politics, according to ANC officials, high-ranking defectors and anti-corruption groups. He pushed to build big boarding schools whose costs tripled\u0026nbspfor unexplained reasons\u0026nbspto $30m (£23m) each, alarming education experts. Some construction was so shoddy that roofs sprouted leaks soon after being finished, toilets barely worked, students lacked water, retaining walls collapsed and dormitories were missing doors, according to a provincial report.Over the years, Mabuza’s province also became known as one of South Africa’s most dangerous. Nearly 20 politicians, most from inside the ANC, were assassinated in the past two decades, some after exposing graft in public works projects.All the while\u0026nbspMabuza’s political career flourished. He attracted legions of new ANC members with government contracts, cash handouts and even KFC meals, according to current and former party officials.His sweeping recruitment drive turned his relatively insignificant province into the ANC’s second biggest voting bloc. Under the party’s delegate system, his territory became more influential than even Gauteng, the province that includes Johannesburg and Pretoria\u0026nbspwith a population three times the size and an economy nearly five times as big.Now, critics contend, Mabuza’s role as the country’s second most powerful politician casts doubt on the legitimacy of the new government and its assertions that the ANC is turning the page on corruption.Under the ANC, Mandela’s once-heralded liberation movement, tens of billions of dollars meant to lift poor black South Africans have been stolen by party leaders. Strong institutions like the tax agency have been hollowed out by party officials bent on shielding their illicit activities.But the nation’s poor schools are perhaps the ANC’s greatest betrayal of the dreams of black South Africans – some of whom have turned to burning down such institutions in protest.Mabuza, who declined to be interviewed, built his political career on the schools. Unlike other, more celebrated anti-apartheid leaders, he did not go into exile he was not imprisoned on the infamous Robben Island. Instead, he fought for the right of black South Africans to receive an equal education, a call he echoed in his recent speech.As many South Africans pin their hopes on Ramaphosa’s pledge for a fresh start, analysts say that much of the country is looking past an unpleasant truth: the new president owes his victory in part to corruption, and much of his administration’s future – as well as the country’s – rests in the hands of Mabuza.“If there is any powerful person whom Ramaphosa’s presidency actually relies on, it is Mabuza,” says\u0026nbspRalph Mathekga, the author of Ramaphosa’s Turn: Can Cyril Save South Africa?“We are being reluctant as a nation to face the reality of Mabuza,” he adds. “If Ramaphosa gets hit by a bus, Mabuza is going to be the president.”Scandal from the startThe numbers just didn’t add up, even at the beginning.After apartheid ended in 1994, Mabuza got his first big break: he became Mpumalanga’s education minister, a chance to shape the schools and generations of students attending them.He had the perfect resume. The son of farmers, Mabuza grew up here in the province, walking miles from his village to the only primary school in a nearby town. Though he often had no shoes, he always tucked in his shirt and buttoned it up to the neck, recalls\u0026nbspReginah Mhaule, a childhood peer.“He was never late,” says\u0026nbspMhaule, a longtime ally who recently became one of South Africa’s two deputy foreign ministers.A bright student, Mabuza ultimately took one of the few jobs available to black South Africans back then. He taught maths at the local high school and later became a founding leader of a teachers’ association.Poor schooling was a major spark in the anti-apartheid movement, most notably in Soweto in 1976, when thousands of students protested the introduction of Afrikaans as the language of instruction. In Mabuza’s province, teachers and students began organising against white minority rule in the early 1980s.The teachers were at the centre\u0026nbspof the movement, says\u0026nbspSandile Sukati, a teacher who recruited Mabuza into the main student organisation. Mabuza quickly stood out, he says, travelling far and wide to build ties among anti-apartheid groups.Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)“He was a leader in his own right,” Sukati says.But after apartheid ended, Mabuza quickly ran into trouble, leading to the province’s first big scandal of the democratic era.\u0026nbspIn 1997, three years into his tenure as education minister, the schools were performing poorly, especially on the national obsession: the annual matriculation exams that determine whether students graduate from high school. The passing rate in his province was 46 per cent that year, slightly below the national average.Mabuza was feeling the pressure, particularly as powerful ANC leaders returned from exile, often with military credentials that overshadowed his own, several current and former ANC officials say.Sukati, who worked under Mabuza at the education department, recalls Mabuza\u0026nbsptelling some of the teachers: “I am in a tight situation.”\u0026nbspThe next year brought a stunning improvement. The passing rate inexplicably jumped to 72 per cent – an incredible turnaround that catapulted Mpumalanga to second place\u0026nbspamong the nation’s nine provinces.“I was suspicious,” says\u0026nbspSukati, who is now a senior education official. “It couldn’t just happen like that.”A whistleblower exposed the cheating a few weeks later. The real passing rate, authorities announced, was under 53 per cent. Moreover, the doctoring had taken place inside Mabuza’s residence, where he met with a small circle of bureaucrats, some of whom were later fired.An investigation was never completed. Mabuza never admitted wrongdoing or suffered any significant consequences. Dropped as education minister, he was named head of housing instead.Ever since, Mabuza’s career has been remembered for that scandal, one that helped establish the kind of culture of impunity in his province that has tarnished the ANC across South Africa..“I think\u0026nbspthe man, he had to be charged, but unfortunately I don’t know what went wrong,” says\u0026nbspRonnie Malomane, an ANC official who was taught maths by Mabuza in the early 1980s. “They were just giving him position after position.”Nationally, Mabuza’s standing kept rising, propelled by his success at attracting new party members. In 2009, Zuma appointed him premier of all of Mpumalanga province.But Mabuza raised more red flags, stripping some of the decision-making power over government projects from local officials and concentrating it in his own office. He justified the move – called the “Rapid Implementation Unit” – as a way to act quickly. Others had a different explanation.“That’s how he managed to loot,” says\u0026nbspCollen Sedibe, a former ANC leader who grew up on the same street as Mabuza and worked under him in the provincial housing department.Treasury officials in the province say they are now investigating the irregular expenditures “incurred through the contracts arranged centrally by the Office of the Premier”.But parents, officials and educators had warned about the damage from corruption and neglect for years, pointing to the painfully overcrowded classrooms and decaying, apartheid-era schools.‘They wanted to kill me’It took four days of rage before the local ANC councillor showed up.The councillor, Justice Twelve Siboza, explained that he had been busy the week Ziyanda fell into the toilet, tending to another corner of his ward. Other activities had also drawn his attention: he is a gospel singer with his own radio show, so he crisscrosses the region to perform at weddings and funerals.By the time he got to Ziyanda’s school, hundreds of parents had closed off the unpaved roads, furious that their grievances had been met with near silence from the ANC’s leaders.Siboza made sure to bring a gun. Politics is dangerous in South Africa, sometimes lethal, he says.The ANC has a grip on the area around the school because most residents, aside from the lucky few working at the sugar cane plant, are poor and rely on the party for government jobs, contracts or monthly welfare grants.It is an area Mabuza knows well. He began his ascent inside the ANC as the head of this part of the province. It was once part of a homeland set aside for black people by the apartheid government. To this day, several ANC officials say, Mabuza has kept a hold on it through powerful proxies.Some see a deep cynicism behind the conditions in the schools. When black South Africans become educated and move into the middle class, their loyalty to the party tends to wane, recent elections have shown. So by perpetuating a culture of dependence, critics contend, the ANC ensures its dominance.But Mhaule, the childhood peer of Mabuza, rejects\u0026nbspany suggestion that the ANC had failed to prioritise education.Officials like Mhaule say the rising pass rate on the national high school exam provides clear evidence of progress. But the figures can be misleading. The number of students taking the exam has declined in the past two years. Weaker students who would drag down the rate are being held back, education experts say.About 600 protesters gathered at the school that cold Friday morning when Siboza, the local ANC councillor, arrived with a police escort. As he moved to talk to the parents, demonstrators showered him with rocks.“They wanted to kill me,” the councillor says.Siboza made a run for it, reaching for the hip holster under his brown overcoat. He took out his gun – firing three times and hitting two teenagers, a girl and a boy.Agreement Mashele, the school board chairman, was shocked. “This man is a church member,” he says.A few days later, the ANC councillor visited the children he had wounded.“The councillor said he was very sorry,” says\u0026nbspthe girl, Siphesihle Ngobeni, whose left leg was grazed by a bullet. The councillor pleaded with her not to press charges and gave her about $15, she says. She used the money to buy sanitary pads.The boy’s injury was more severe. His father, Petros Thobela, who had gone to the same primary school and did not have a job, accepted a similar apology and compensation of, according to the councillor, about $150.The boy’s mother, Nobuhle Ndlovu, who does odd jobs, deplores\u0026nbspthe state of education.“They promise,” she says, “and they just disappear.”Still, she would remain loyal to the governing party.“Yes, of course, I vote ANC,” she says. “It’s our freedom.”‘He always had money in his house’The protests spilled into September, but the country’s attention was fixed on another battle: the national push to replace Zuma as South Africa’s president.The all-important ANC party election was only a few months away, and officials in Mabuza’s province were bracing to see whether his years of hard work had paid off.In early October, the ANC released the delegate breakdown, with good news for Mabuza: his previously low-ranking province was now the ANC’s second most powerful.Mabuza owed his outsize influence to a single feat. In the past decade, ANC membership in his province had skyrocketed nearly 190 per cent, eclipsing the national increase of less than 60 per cent. No other province came close to matching Mpumalanga’s explosive growth.But Mabuza’s numbers were as cooked as his high school passing rates, current and former ANC officials contend.In South Africa, taxes are collected by the national government, which distributes the money to provinces. The provinces then use the money – with little oversight from above.Treasury officials in Mpumalanga say that “irregular expenditures” more than doubled in the previous two budget years, particularly in education, housing and health.Wages account for most of the education and health budgets. So money is usually siphoned off by politicians and business allies through contracts for services or construction, ANC officials say. When costs are suspiciously high, schools are poorly built or facilities are badly maintained, they say, it is often a warning that money is being skimmed, at the students’ expense.Thousands in Israel protest draft law that would ‘exclude’ ArabsGrenfell victims were subject to ‘social apartheid’, says Diane AbbottSouth Africa is the most unequal country in the world, says World BankMandela’s letters chart his heartbreaking struggle from behind barsAs premier, Mabuza promoted the construction of big boarding schools, or mega-schools, in farm areas to improve rural education. Since 2012, the province has completed five, with two more in the pipeline.For reasons that have not been explained, the price of each school has ballooned from $11m to around $30m.Asked whether Mabuza wanted the mega-schools to facilitate the theft of public funds, Mhaule, his former education minister, laughs\u0026nbspand says:\u0026nbsp“I don’t know.”But other officials say the mega-schools were overpriced projects to reward Mabuza’s allies and finance his ANC membership drive.Mabuza\u0026nbspwas sworn in as deputy president in February. “His passion,” reads his official biography, “still remains in education.”Minutes after the swearing-in, he faced questions about corruption and political killings in his province. “There’s nothing to set straight,” he told the national public broadcaster.“I’m here to serve South Africans,” he added. “Let’s give this government a chance.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/22/16/turtle-dove-branch.jpg  width= 1781  height= 1336  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/22/16/turtle-dove-branch.jpg","title":"birds zebra finches traffic noise ageing pollution lifespan","story":"Created with Sketch.High levels of artificial noise blamed for shortening lifes in the wildClick to followThe IndependentZebra finches are affected by traffic noise after they have flown the nestTraffic noise may make birds age more quickly than is natural, scientists have found.A study on zebra finches suggested those exposed to the sounds of road vehicles were less protected from damage linked with ageing. \u0026nbspPrevious research has\u0026nbspconcluded that urban birds have shorter lifes than their rural counterparts, and academics believe high levels of artificial noise may play a role.Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Germany and North Dakota State University investigated the effect of traffic noise on the length of the telomere –\u0026nbspcaps on the ends of chromosomes that protect genes from damage – of offspring zebra finches,\u0026nbspa species native to Australia.The study, published in Frontiers in Zoology, said that zebra finches exposed to traffic noise after they had left the nest had shorter telomeres at 120 days old even than those exposed to noise before they had left the nest and whose parents were exposed to traffic noise during courtship, egg-laying, and nesting.Finches exposed to noise after leaving the nest also had shorter telomeres than those that had not been exposed to traffic noise at all.Although birds may seem to be adapting to life in noisy cities, they may actually be ageing fasterDr Adriana Dorado-Correa, co-author of the study, said: “Our study suggests that urban noise alone, independent from the many other aspects of city life, such as light pollution or chemical pollution, is associated with increased telomere loss and may contribute to ageing in zebra finches.“Our study is a first step towards identifying the causal mechanisms that may account for differences in life observed between birds living in urban or rural environments.”Co-author Dr Sue Anne Zollinger said: “Cellular ageing as a result of urban stressors is something that may not have a very visible impact, but our study indicates that although birds may seem to be adapting to life in noisy cities, they may actually be ageing faster.“It may be important to consider developmental stages in birds when studying the effects of urbanisation, as the mechanisms by which these human-induced habitat changes impact iniduals may change throughout their lifetime.”Woodland birds en route to extinction as numbers eThe authors suggested that the time between 18 and 120 days after hatching is a critical period during which birds are more affected by noise. This period is when zebra finches begin learning songs, which may make them more sensitive to noise\u0026nbspBy contrast, birds may be less sensitive to noise\u0026nbspwhile still in the nest, and parent birds may be able to make behavioural changes to protect offspring from the negative effects of noise exposure, the researchers said.The traffic noise used in the study consisted of recordings of street traffic that mimicked typical urban noise patterns.Previous\u0026nbspresearch has found birds sing differently in response to industrial or traffic noise, which potentially affects their ability to attract mates and defend their territory.A 2016 study suggested traffic noise may endanger wild birds by making it harder for them to hear alarm calls.Enter your email addressFill out this

funding after no-deal BrexitBritain stands to lose around half a billion pounds of annual European science funding in the event of a no-deal Brexit, jeopardising research into cancer and other health treatments, new figures reveal.The UK receives €1.28bn (£1.15bn) every year from Horizon 2020, the EU’s funding programme for science and innovation.The nation would lose around 45 per cent of the cash, and its ability to influence key European projects, in a no-deal scenario, according to analysis by the Scientists for EU group.The government had previously attempted to reassure scientists by claiming they would still have access to EU funding under ‘third country’ rules, in the event of a no-deal Brexit.But following the publication this week of their plans for a no-deal Brexit, the government has updated advice to scientists to concede funding from the EU would be lost.\u0026nbsp“Third country participation does not extend to some Horizon 2020 calls”, the advice now reads.That line\u0026nbspupdated a report published at the beginning of August which said: “In a no-deal scenario, UK researchers and businesses would be able to apply to, and participate in all those Horizon 2020 calls open to third country participants from the date of exit.”Without full membership of Horizon 2020, the UK would lose access to money from the European Research Council (ERC), Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) and SME Instrument grants, which are not available to “third countries”.The revelation comes after leading scientists voiced concerns about a chaotic exit from the EU and declared their support for The Independent’s Final Say campaign, calling for a referendum on the final Brexit deal.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor

community.Professor Lisa Bortolotti, of the University of Birmingham, and whose mental health research s psychology, psychiatry and philosophy, said\u0026nbspthat without the\u0026nbspprogrammes, “projects like mine could not be pursued in the UK”.“Losing ERC funding is mad,” she added.Olivier Stephan, who coordinates grants at the Francis Crick Institute, said the ERC drives some of the country’s most important science, citing its work fighting cancer.While, he said, the institute was\u0026nbspworking on the basis ongoing grants are safe, there are fears for the future of British scientists and the country’s ability to attract foreign talent.On top of a hit to UK science, the SME Instrument programme provides £143 million to small, innovative UK businesses, funding around 17 per cent of their research and development.The government has said it will step in to replace any lost funding if necessary, but the effects of third country status go deeper than monetary value, according to some experts. \u0026nbsp“Throughout my career I have had many, many grants, but none as transformational as the ERC grants,” said Professor Carlos Frenk, a cosmologist at Durham University. “Access to these grants to a very large extent determines where the very best researchers in the world want to go.”“In short, it’s a mess,” said Dr Mike Galsworthy, programme director at Scientists for EU.Besides the “chilling effect” the possibility of a no-deal Brexit is having on grant applications and hiring in the sector, he noted people who received EU grants were having to register with the government “just in case”.“So it’s devastation if it does happen, and just lesser damage, red tape and waste if it doesn’t,” he said.According to Scientists for EU, third country status would also mean UK researchers in European projects could no longer take leading roles, as the EU will not be willing to put them in charge of the money.\u0026nbspThat\u0026nbspis why Dame Anne Glover, president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, says it is essential the government arrives at some kind of deal.“If that doesn’t happen, there is a danger of us being a sort of lame duck, just looking at what the opportunities are and trying to become partners in research consortia without driving anything,” she said.The Tories’ plan for a no-deal Brexit is not looking so sunny any more‘Not realistic’ for UK to trade on WTO rules straight after BrexitDespite assurances, Dame Anne said she felt “we are really no further forward” with understanding the status of science after Brexit.“In March next year if there is no deal, the EU is not going to scrabble around to help researchers in the UK,” she said.“There may be an accommodation reached for a period of time, but there will be a hiatus, and research does not work well with a hiatus.”Professor Frenk added, unlike some of the predicted effects of a no-deal Brexit, the loss of scientific funds would not change the country overnight.“The effects won’t be seen tomorrow, they won’t be seen next year – they will be seen gradually over the years as we see a general decline in the scientific excellence of the UK,” he said.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as

confidence that there will be a showdown at Labour’s conference in Liverpool.The ruling body of the grassroots pro-Corbyn group Momentum will meet on Saturday to decide whether to canvas opinion,

supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchLabour hopes to force Theresa May into another general election if her Brexit deal is rejected by parliament this winter, or if she fails to strike any agreement at all.However, the party has been edging closer to backing a referendum, with both John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, and Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, insisting it must remain an option.Significantly, polling has found strong support among Labour’s target voters with 59 per cent of non-supporters who “might” or “would seriously consider” getting behind the party favouring a fresh referendum.Mr Baldwin’s memo, seen by the BBC, stresses that the tone of the People’s Vote campaign will be crucial to its success in winning Labour backing.May’s scramble for African goodwill on first sub-Saharan visitBrexit secretary contradicts government forecasts on no-deal EU

direction of the Labour Party, the campaign should not be used to attack Jeremy Corbyn personally”.The Independent is joining forces with the People’s Vote to jointly stage a rally in London on 20 October, called The People’s Vote and The Independent March for the Future.More than 712,000 people have signed our Final Say petition to give the final decision on any Brexit deal to the British people, while around 215,000 are backing the very similar People’s Vote campaign.However, the push was strongly criticised today by Andy Burnham, Labour’s mayor of Greater Manchester, who argued it would “deepen that rift” in the country.“My frustration with those leaping to a second referendum is it further inflames this idea of an arrogant political class which isn’t listening, and isn’t dealing with the issues that gave rise to the referendum in the first place,” Mr Burnham told the Politico website.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are

Theresa May securing a Brexit deal that can pass the Commons as he threw his support behind The Independent’s campaign for a new EU referendum.Lord Heseltine, the former deputy prime minister in John Major’s administration, said in his view there has never been “such an unpredictable, calamitous set of events facing” the country.The Tory peer also poured\u0026nbspscorn on Boris Johnson’s niqab remarks, and said the former foreign secretary should apologise for his comments that could have a “ripple effect” and embolden the right wing.‘Not realistic’ for UK to trade on WTO rules straight after BrexitPhilip Hammond has become the Brexit bogeymanLabour not taking new Brexit deal vote off the table, McDonnell saysUK expats face losing access to pensions in event of no-deal BrexitHis remarks came as The Independent’s campaign for a Final Say referendum on any Brexit deal reached by the prime minister in Brussels, gathered pace, with more than 700,000 people having signed the petition.Last week the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU)\u0026nbspalso published its first tranche of 24 technical papers detailing the government’s preparations for a no-deal Brexit.Among the documents it was revealed that credit card users could face a new “Brexit tax”, drug companies were told to build six-week supplies of medicines and UK citizens living in Europe could also lose access to pension income through new red tape.\u0026nbsp“My position is quite clear,” said Lord Heseltine. “The Brexiteers have had two years in which to produce a position along the lines in which they believe and after two years they’ve produced absolutely nothing except a growing sense of panic.”He continued: “At the moment there is no evidence there will be a deal – if there is, is there a deal that is acceptable to the House of Commons? It’s a huge question.”Pressed on whether he believed the prime minister could get a deal through the chamber, he added: “I think it’s very unlikely she’ll get a deal through the House of Commons.”Lord Heseltine said that for months he has been saying there “had to be a second test of public opinion” either through a general election or a second EU referendum.“I think probably a referendum,” he said when asked which he would prefer. “It’s one or the other. Events will dictate which it is.”Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union While the prime minister has categorically ruled out a second referendum “under any circumstances”, Labour has left the option on the table should parliament reject Ms May’s agreement with the EU or if a no-deal Brexit is looming.On Friday, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor and one of Jeremy Corbyn’s closest allies,\u0026nbspsaid Labour would rule nothing out – echoing comments made by his frontbench colleague Sir Keir Starmer\u0026nbspthe previous day.Referring to Mr Johnson’s column in the Daily , in which the former foreign secretary said those wearing niqabs resembled “letterboxes” and “bank robbers”, Lord Heseltine\u0026nbspadded: “I think he should apologise.“My concern is the ripple effect. If people like him start using language that stimulates the worst elements of racism, it licences people to go further with impunity. ‘If Boris can say it, I can say it’. It becomes the sort of slogan of the racist element of the right wing.”He suggested there could only be two explanations for the contentious column that attracted widespread criticism. “One is that it’s a mistake and if it’s a mistake he could say so. The other is that he calculates it would advance his street cred with the right wing of the Tory party. And I think it’s possible he’s right with that judgement.”Asked whether he believed it was likely Mr Johnson would challenge the prime minister for leadership of the Conservative Party, Lord Heseltine added: “I think it’s much more likely that events will dictate the pace of change.“I would not expect him to make a decisive move – the move may be made inevitable by vacuums or by other people signing letters of no confidence, all these sorts of things, or by losses of votes in the House of Commons.“There has never been in my view such an unpredictable, calamitous set of events facing us.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/28/10/Theresa-May-africa-visit-14.jpg","title":"theresa may uk post brexit trade deal africa visit cape town leave eu","story":"Created with Sketch.But the prime minister faced questions as to whether the UK was playing catch up for African tradeClick to followIndy PoliticsTheresa May is greeted by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in Cape TownTheresa May has announced that the UK has secured its first post-Brexit trade deal during her trip to boost British exports in Africa.The prime minister confirmed that Britain would replicate a deal the EU currently has with six southern African nations.She also added that the UK would invest an additional £4bn in African economies, with the hope of further match investment from the private sector to come.\u0026nbspBut the prime minister\u0026nbspalso faced accusations that she was playing catch in courting African trade, with France, the US and China all having\u0026nbspmade concerted efforts.\u0026nbspSpeaking in Cape Town she said she wanted\u0026nbspto see “strong African economies that British companies can do business with” adding that the “integrated global economy means healthy African economies are good news for British people as well as African people”.She said: “That’s why I’m delighted that we will today confirm plans to carry over the European Union’s Economic Partnership Agreement with the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) and Mozambique once the EU’s deal no longer applies to the UK.“As a Prime Minister who believes both in free markets and in nations and businesses acting in line with well-established rules and principles of conduct, I want to demonstrate to young Africans that their brightest future lies in a free and thriving private sector.”Countries in the SACU agreement include\u0026nbspBotswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Swaziland, with Mozambique also included in the pact with the EU that the UK will take on.Britain plans to take on all of the EU’s current trade deals after Brexit with agreement of the other country’s involved, but the announcement that the first has been locked in will be a boost to Ms May.\u0026nbspShe\u0026nbsphad already let it be known that she was preparing to use the UK’s aid and development spending to support Britain’s private sector in making greater investment\u0026nbspin the continent.The prime minister said the “driving focus” of the UK’s development programme will be to ensure the\u0026nbspgovernments in Africa have the “environment, knowledge, institutions and support” to private sector investment.Theresa May visits Africa on trade trip – in picturesPrime Minister Theresa May meets students and staff at I.D.

A month later, Russia’s Supreme Court upheld the decision and ordered the group’s official representation to disband. \u0026nbsp“It doesn’t matter where in Russia they try to worship – in their meeting houses, which the state is beginning to confiscate, or in private homes,” said\u0026nbspGeraldine Fagan, author of Believing in Russia – Religious Policy after Communism. “It\u0026nbsprepresents the worst roll back of religious freedom since the fall of Communism.” \u0026nbspIt is unclear exactly why the Kremlin chose to use its broad extremist laws against the movement. Initially\u0026nbspthe Russian Justice Ministry’s moves against the group appeared to be\u0026nbspa response to an aggressive leafleting campaign.\u0026nbspSome have suggested the group’s opposition to overt patriotism and violence played a role. The influence of the Russian Orthodox Church, which views Jehovah’s Witnesses as a dangerous sect, is also apparent.\u0026nbspIn the 17 months since the ban was enacted, dozens of Russian Jehovah’s Witnesses have been arrested. Most of an\u0026nbspestimated 175,000 members of the denomination\u0026nbspin Russia no longer advertise their faith. Many, it seems, are looking for new lives elsewhere.\u0026nbspAccording to the Finnish Immigration Service, the number of applications from Russian Jehovah’s Witnesses grew from five in 2016 to more than\u0026nbsp100 in 2017 and 2018. The number of asylum applications also grew, from 193 in 2016 to 309 in the year to date. The\u0026nbsplatter figure\u0026nbspincludes all kinds of groups – from opposition activists to refugees from the northern Caucasus.Finnish immigration officials told The Independent the vast majority of Jehovah’s Witnesses applications have yet to be processed. There had been only a “handful” of accepted applications and a “handful” of negative decisions, officials\u0026nbspsaid with nearly all of those rejected since appealing.\u0026nbsp“Each of the cases is dealt with on an inidual basis,” The Independent was told. “Persecution of these groups has not been systematic across Russia, and the approach of the ministry has taken this into account.”\u0026nbspWorld news in picturesA police officer walks by the front of a Chicago Pizza and GLHF Game Bar at the scene of fatal shooting at The Jacksonville Landing.

(Image: )She will announce her desire to make Britain the G7\u0027s number one investor in Africa with Britain\u0027s private sector companies taking the lead in investing the billions that will see African economies growing by trillions.Noting that Africa must create millions of jobs a year to keep pace with its fast-growing population, she will stress: The challenges facing Africa are not Africa\u0027s alone.It is in the world\u0027s interest to see that those jobs are created, to tackle the causes and symptoms of extremism and instability, to deal with migration flows and to encourage clean growth.If we fail to do so, the economic and environmental impacts will swiftly reach every corner of our networked, connected world.

(Image: )But she will underline - as International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt has previously done including during her own visit last month to Nigeria - how she wants aid to be more than just a hand-out, and to show taxpayers that it is in their interests too.I am unashamed about the need to ensure that our aid programme works for the UK, Mrs May will tell her audience.So today I am committing that our development spending will not only combat extreme poverty, but at the same time tackle global challenges and support our own national interest.This will ensure that our investment in aid benefits us all, and is fully aligned with our wider national security priorities.

Inside the sick market where 80,000 dogs are SLAUGHTERED for food After the furious dog owner stumbled across the macabre scene, the dog-killer told him: \u0026ldquoIf you dare to chase me, I\u0026rsquoll poison you with a dart.The man then sped away from the scene while the dog owner took chase.The chase ended when the dog owner ploughed his motorcycle into the dog hunter\u0026rsquos, accidentally killing him.And now a animal rights campaigner has warned dog hunting could come to the UK.                Rabies WARNING: Diseased animal found in Far East dog and cat meat                 Why is dog meat so popular in South Korea and what is \u0027Bosintang\u0027?Gordon Mak, a spokesman from the World Dog Alliance (WDA), said it is \u0026ldquopossible similar instances could happen in the UK.He added: The materials required to make a poison dart are highly accessible. Guides are easy to find on the internet too.This is why dog meat industry brings so much harm to the society.Last September a restaurant owner who killed dogs for hot pots surrendered after a vigilante chased him in China.Cases of dogs being killed for meat are on the rise in the US (Image: )Eight dog carcasses were found inside his car when police searched his vehicle.With a burgeoning dog meat market in the West, several dog meat vendors have been arrested for selling meat in the US.Over 30,000,000 dogs are slaughtered for human consumption every year, mainly in Asian countries.Out of this, 70 percent are stolen pets, the WDA claims.Half of UK households have a pet and freedom of information requests to UK police forces have found dog thefts are on the rise.In 2013, 1,491 dogs were reported stolen, 1,599 in 2014, 1,776 in 2015, and 1,774 in 2016.The WDA said: We fear some of the stolen dogs have become meals for dog-eaters like many other countries.

More integration or a breakup.Ms Bifarini\u0027s warning comes as financial traders have expressed mounting fears for Italy\u0027s financial health and the potential knock-on effects for its European neighbours.At the root of this lies moves by Italy\u0026rsquos new populist government to further increase astronomical levels of public debt \u0026ndash which is already way above the euro-threshold of 60 percent of the gross domestic product.\u0026nbspRome\u0027s government debt stands at 130 percent of GDP, just below that of the eurozone\u0026rsquos perennial economic basket-case Greece.Holger Schmieding, a\u0026nbspchief economist at Berenberg, said: We have to see how the government does its fiscal numbers.If they don\u0027t add up by the end of September, things could indeed get somewhat rough for Italy.\u0026nbspThis grave uncertainty about the fiscal plans is a significant rollback for Italy because it does mean that down the road, an Italian debt crisis \u0026mdash which would look pretty unlikely a year ago \u0026mdash is now a possibility.

Remainer sabotage? Or just another tone-deaf blunder?Either way, he left the Government looking even more chaotic than usual.Will No Deal happen? Consider this:Britain has offered “unconditional” security cooperation with the EU post-Brexit. In response, Brussels vows to CHARGE us to access its databases.They want capitulation, not a deal.JEREMY Corbyn’s sole motive in “changing the media” is to silence a hostile Press.The giveaway was when he attacked broadcasters yesterday for following up Sun stories. “Just because it’s on the front page of The Sun or Mail doesn’t automatically make it news,” he whined.Could this be because recent front pages have exposed Labour’s racism? That IS news, as page one stories in the two biggest daily papers tend to be.Britain already has the world’s most vibrant media. Corbyn is feigning some high-minded interest in improving it. But the last thing he wants is it holding a future Labour Government to account.He detests scrutiny, as his tantrums sparked by tricky questions prove.As for his plan for a state-run Facebook rival, can you imagine anything more ridiculous or pointless?The ­Austin Allegro of social media, making ­gargantuan losses for taxpayers?And how about his “Netflix levy” to fund the BBC?Is there no limit to the costs he wants to pile on ordinary people?NOW, by contrast, is the time for the Tories to CUT taxes.There is depressing talk of a new hike to fund the NHS. But the public finances are in unexpectedly good shape, the deficit plummeting and growth on the up.Corporation tax should be as low as Ireland’s, stamp duty slashed to get the housing market moving, fuel duty lowered, and income tax cut too.With No Deal Brexit more likely, we need to boost the economy and lure investment with a low-tax regime as never before.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a horrible time.”In light of his apology, some people might talk about rehabilitation. He’s said he’s sorry and he won’t do it again.People have to be given a ­second chance — right?Before I answer that, let me flag up a few other stories that caught my eye this week.There’s the tale of Sean Simmons, 28, a domestic abuser from Hull who waterboarded one of his ex-partners, tying her to a bath before covering her face with a towel and pouring cold water over her, saying: “This is what I do to people who lie. I’m going to make you tell the truth.”Later, he produced a knife and said he’d “have to kill her”.And Darren McKie, a 43-year-old police inspector who was jailed for life after strangling his wife Leanne, 39, at their home in Cheshire, then dumping her body in a lake.And Glyn Leedell, 39, who threatened to kill a woman with a kitchen knife within hours of meeting her in a Rotherham pub.Oh, and the news that Ian Stewart, 57, who was jailed for 34 years after smothering his wife, children’s author Helen Bailey, is being questioned over the death of his first wife, Diane Stewart, who died after collapsing in the garden of the couple’s home in Cambridgeshire.I could go on, but it’s too depressing.If you read the same stories you may have taken a moment to despair that the papers are full of similar stories every day — of women being killed, brutalised and attacked by the men who purport to love them.Or, you may have barely noticed because these stories are so ­commonplace.Of course, not all men who threaten to kill their partners go on to do so.But you can be sure that most of the women above had probably suffered years of traumatic intimidation and abuse before their partners actually acted on their threats.Meanwhile, those women were ­living in fear — that’s what these chumps get off on. They want to make their victim feel helpless and powerless.So, let’s talk about forgiveness and rehabilitation.Do I think people who really regret being a perpetrator of domestic violence deserve a second chance? Yes, I do.If someone is genuinely ­repentant about anything they’ve done wrong, you can’t refuse ­forgiveness forever.Do I think that Dan Osborne’s second chance should take the form of a public platform on which to rehabilitate his image and, no doubt, earn a pretty penny or two into the bargain?No, I really, really do not.Sure, it was three years ago and no, he didn’t actually go on to act on his threat to knife his ex.But by letting him into the CBB house, Channel Five are sending a strong message that domestic violence allegations are a trivial affair, not to be taken seriously.By welcoming him in, despite his “scandal”, they are normalising and turning a blind eye to the kind of behaviour that too often ruins — and sometimes ends — women’s lives.People on TV are role models. And to allow a man who has made verbal threats to kill his girlfriend to become a role model is irresponsible in the extreme.ITV recognised this when they decided to boot him off Towie.Channel Five should have done the same.SHIRLEY BALLAS has revealed she weighs herself every day in the run up to Strictly in order to get “telly ready”.You might think that sounds extreme but, believe me, the only way to get telly ready is to take very seriously the old adage that the screen adds a stone.I don’t exactly weigh myself before filming The Apprentice or Give It A Year but, in the three months leading up to filming, I always manage to lose – by hook or by crook – a stone.In fact we all do – Lord Sugar and Claude Littner are watching what they eat as well.Then, as soon as filming stops, we all immediately put the weight back on again as normal life resumes.And, let me tell you, it’s a lot harder to take it off than it is to put it on.I’M a big believer in benefits being available to people who need help because they can’t help themselves.But the story of Bangladeshi immigrant Abdul Jalil, a father of six who came to the UK in 1969, really makes a mockery of the system.Jalil, who is 64, hasn’t worked since 1988 for “health reasons”.But a probation officer found the only problem he had is a slightly tender right knee.In 2008, he exceeded the amount of cash that claimants are allowed to have when he was loaned £25,000 to buy his council house.He did not notify the Department for Work and Pensions and continued wrongly claiming more than £28,000 over the next eight years.He then lied to the DWP about his assets as he filled out his benefits review form in 2012.He had re-mortgaged his council flat in May that year for roughly £148,000 and given the money to his children so they could purchase their own properties keeping around £86,500 for himself.Then at court this week he was spared jail – in favour of community service and even had the cheek to say he would do it if it was “light work”.I know that some people need benefits to get back on their feet, and I’m proud to live in a country that provides that.But once a person is back up, they need to actually stand on their own two feet – rather than abusing the system that helped them.Like all benefit cheats, he should pay the money back or go to jail and never be allowed access to benefits again.AS taxpayers we give almost £14BILLION a year away in foreign aid of which almost £1billion goes to the EU, and this week the Government was threatening to withdraw our cash if there was no-deal Brexit.Why wait until Brexit? Just stop it now.We need this money to fix our own country – our NHS, our police forces, our schools, benefits and housing all need it desperately.And the worst part of all this is that we have to borrow the money to give it away.Our country has almost £2TRILLION of debt, which costs around £50billion a year to service in interest.Borrowing money to give it away, it’s the economics of the madhouse.I KNOW our prisons are full, but it beggars belief that Allan Williamson, 45, was let off with a two-year community order and 30 days rehabilitation.When police raided his flat in Hulme, Manchester, they found more than 600 images – including 68 films classed as Category A, the highest level of children being sexually abused.To be clear, the images showed children as young as seven being sexually abused by adults.Still, Judge Elizabeth Nicholls,  decided prison wasn’t necessary, saying Williamson had been “open and frank” with the police about his behaviour and because the man has allegedly taken “tentative steps to address these issues”.So the guy was in possession of 600 images including many of the worst kind of paedophilia – and he’s still in the community?Who in their right mind would want this guy in their community?I know the prisons are buckling, so let’s just build more – even if that includes sending prisoners out to sea in containers.When is the justice system going to start thinking about the victims as opposed to the perpetrators?I BET the boyfriend of Kay Longstaff – the air hostess who spent ten hours in the water after plunging from a cruise liner – is feeling a bit embarrassed.Longstaff was miraculously rescued ten hours after falling – or jumping – from the Norwegian Star, 60 miles off the Croatian coast last week.It’s not quite clear what happened beforehand but other passengers and crew claim to have seen Ms Longstaff in several arguments with her partner Craig Rayment, above with Kay, on the evening of the incident.Once she’d been rescued, Mr Rayment’s estranged wife Kelly offered Ms Longstaff some unsolicited support, saying: “If I was on a ship with him, I would get off any way I could.”Oh dear.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

with this and accepted, regardless of the fact I have never fiddled my expenses or taken cash for ­questions, some of those who come before me have damned all politicians to the sin-bin.I do, however, think there is one very simple thing all politicians could agree to do that would help rehabilitate us to the public.We could answer a straight question with a straight answer.This week doing the rounds on Twitter was a clip of Jeremy Corbyn on Channel 4 News being asked six times: “Do you honestly believe Britain will be better off outside of the EU?”Each time he answered with a iation of, “Labour wants to maintain good relations with the EU to protect jobs”.His words are not bad — it is certainly the answer he and his team would have practised.But it is not an answer to that question and that’s the problem.To the average punter it just looks like politicians can’t be straight.The answer, as far as I’m concerned, is a big fat no.Gavin Williamson, the Defence Secretary, suffered a similar cringeworthy encounter with Richard Madeley in May.The question in the wake of the Salisbury poisonings was: “You told Russia to ‘shut up and go away’.Do you regret that now?Do you think it was too informal?”He started by answering an entirely different question about paying tribute to healthcare workers, which had absolutely nothing to do with what he was being asked.God only knows why he didn’t just say: “Yeah, it wasn’t my finest hour but I guess I was just really cross that people in Britain were being poisoned.”He could then have gone on to say all the nice things about Salisbury health workers.Instead, Madeley savaged him and all that anyone remembers of the encounter is that Gavin Williamson should avoid interviews.Mind you, at least both Corbyn and Williamson gave an answer.At least they bothered to take part.Boris Johnson would just have offered his questioner a cup of tea as if he was Mrs Doyle from Father Ted.I honestly despair.I’m not sure when the art of just repeating the same message over and over again, even if it in no way answers the question, started.Most people put it down to the Tony Blair years of slick media management, but times have surely got to move on.Politicians spend too much time hedging their bets, trying to keep all the people happy and end up pleasing no one by waffling through an answer that is basically six of one and half a dozen of the other.I get that it is hard when your job is basically a massive popularity contest, but I am not sure we are made more popular by dodging questions and refusing to give our own opinions.People contact me every single week telling me they don’t always agree with me but they appreciate that I stand up for what I believe.I honestly don’t think the British people want politicians to say an approximation of a safe answer, or to try to be pals with everyone.People have a damn sight more respect for people when they say what they think, even if they disagree.For too long politicians have been especially scared of upsetting working-class people, without recognising that most people don’t even think of themselves that way any more.I have absolutely no idea where the idea came from that the average member of the public can’t stand a bit of discussion and disagreement, or are so fragile that they will all fall apart if someone says something not to their liking.I have never once voted for someone who I agreed with 100 per cent of the time.I didn’t marry someone I agreed with a 100 per cent of the time and, frankly, if he tried to please me, placate me and pander to all my views I would no longer stay married to him, because it would be dishonest.Don’t get me wrong — saying what you think is not a universally appreciated characteristic and some do get in touch with me to tell me to shut up and go away.Much like Russia probably felt when Williamson said it to them, I pay little mind to this and crack on.Journalists do sometimes ask stupid questions.Politicians do have to be careful about what they say as it can sometimes get twisted and misrepresented.Things are not always simple, and giving a quick answer on a complex issue takes some skill.All that said, it has got to be time to stop the waffle and give the public a break from shouting at their telly each night: “For God’s sake, answer the bleedin’ question!”IT’S that time of year where slow news weeks turn to how much wine we should drink and if swearing at work should be banned.Apparently no amount of alcohol is safe, which will change absolutely no one’s behaviour, and swearing at work is bad for morale.I cannot agree on the swearing front.I am not advocating we all run around barking sweary orders and aggressive expletives at our colleagues but I find sometimes, especially in times of high stress in the office, nothing will quite explain it like a collective FFS.I have seen how a bit of good old Anglo Saxon can be used to break down barriers between me and my constituents.It stops me seeming like some lofty bureaucrat who cannot understand their problems.In some cases it makes them physically relax if we get a bit sweary about their crappy landlord or their benefits being stopped.We all swear, and most of us drink, I doubt that’s going to change.PADDY DOHERTY of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding and Celeb Big Brother fame was in the papers this week, leading the funeral procession for his nephew.A sad affair, of course, but the diamond-encrusted funeral casket is reported to have cost £100,000.I remember organising my own mother’s funeral and balking at spending around £2,500 for an event I’d rather have not had to attend.I could hear her voice in my head saying, “How much?” as we wrote out cheques for cars and coffins. My wedding only cost £3k and I thought that was a bit much.When my time comes, I implore my family to keep their cash. I wouldn’t be thankful for money being literally burnt.THIS week’s, in fact this year’s, feminist icon goes to the unlikely Stormy Daniels.There is, of course, no reason why feminism would not extend to women performing in pornography but there are few crossovers.Stormy Daniels is a hero.World leaders across the globe pander to Trump, few are brave enough to publicly call out his racism, sexism and terrible decision making.Our own PM holds his hand, allowing him to make her look weak and feeble.Ms Daniels has been brave enough not only to take on the most powerful man in the world but also some pretty tooled-up lawyers too.After apparently receiving payment and signing a non-disclosure agreement to hush her up about an affair she had with Trump in 2006, she broke rank.This was not just a kiss and tell, this was a story that has caused Donald Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen to plead guilty to breaking election campaign rules.He explicitly stated that he was told to pay her the money by “the candidate” meaning Trump. Donald Trump will probably get away with this misdemeanour, but it is the closest he has come to being in real trouble.Without Stormy Daniels and her courage to face down legal threats, vicious hate mail and a campaign to discredit her, powerful men would continue to use women as playthings and just pay them off when they are done.Stormy Daniels is every woman who has been messed about and we salute her for fighting back.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Project Fear forecast dramatic downturns in the economy if the people were so unwise as to vote for Brexit. Wrong again.Since then, we have had record levels of employment, huge investments from the likes of Google, Microsoft, SoftBank and a long list of other companies.They demonstrated their confidence in the future of this great country in the best way possible — with their money.This time round the wise insight came from Andy Haldane, the best economist at the Bank of England.Ruefully he said “economic forecasting is having a Michael Fish moment”.Michael Fish was the weather forecaster who completely mispredicted the huge 1987 storm that struck Britain.If only economic forecasters were even as good as weather forecasters, we would be a lot better off. But they are not, and they are at it again.This week Chancellor Philip Hammond predicted the Treasury would need to raise an extra £80billion in 15 years’ time in the event of a no-deal Brexit.And yet the Chancellor insists on ­trotting out yet another bogus forecast, on the very day that my successor as Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab, is ­presenting the first set of preparation for no deal.Coincidence? I do not think so.The great departments of state are very careful about what they put in the public domain, and exactly when.For nobody is this more true than the Treasury, which has to judge the public perception of everything it does, if only because of its effect on the markets. So this was either spectacularly incompetent, or deliberate. I know what I think.And even more disgraceful, by doing so it will undermine the Government’s hand in striking a deal with the EU.If they do not think we dare walk away, then they will give us the worst deal they can think of. Bear in mind that the Chequers deal already concedes enormous amounts to the EU.It would not be long before our world-leading position in life sciences, gene technology, artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and a whole range of other modern industries would be being actively undermined by the Europeans.As for being out of reach of the ­European Court, pull the other one.But now the Treasury is beginning to fear that even these spectacular concessions the Government has made in the Chequers deal will not deliver agreement from the European Commission — or if it does, the Commons will turn it down.In that event you can expect attempts by the Remainers in Parliament to try to scupper our departure by delaying it beyond the General Election, or offer some other enormous raft of concessions to give back control of the EU.Hence the ridiculous suggestion that the Army would be used to move food around the country.Why? What conceivable aspect of European policy would handicap British hauliers moving British products from Kent to Cumbria?None of course, but it was just the bogus nonsense some of our Remainer media is only too happy to carry ­completely uncritically. Similarly, we have heard suggestions of all sorts of shortages, based it seems mostly on the idea that the French might impede the flow of goods between Calais and Dover.It would not be the first time we had dealt with such issues. We had about 30 days of such delays in 2015. I remember queues of lorries, but I do not remember shortages of food or medicines.And on other issues, are the Europeans really going to pick a fight on data with the biggest IT power on the continent, on banking are they going to refuse to cooperate with the greatest financial ­centre in the world?Are the Greeks, Italians and Spaniards going to disadvantage the UK residents on whom many of their local economies depend? Or stop tourism? I think not.I suspect we are quite likely to have the odd hiccup when we leave the EU, but we will be able to cope, which is what Dominic Raab was demonstrating this week. And any problems we have will be over in months not years.So in 15 years’ time, far from worrying about Mr Hammond’s £80billion bill, the country will have trouble remembering what all the fuss was about.The biggest question will be whether we have made the most of the opportunities created by Brexit.And that is what we should worry about today, creating the circumstances where this great country can take its proper place in the world. We will only be able to do that if we allow ourselves the freedoms a clean Brexit will deliver.So my advice to all my old colleagues in Cabinet is simple: Ignore the misery merchants of the Treasury, stop fearing things that will never happen, and start planning for the real opportunities that this great country can grasp when it sets its mind to it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But despite this, the pensions are unfunded - meaning the whole bill has to be paid out of general taxation.Government liabilities for all exisitng unfunded pension obligations was a staggering £1.7 trillion in 2017. This is nearly as much as Britain’s official national debt of £1.8 trillion.The Taxpayers’ Alliance has called on ministers to stop raiding private pension pots and start funding public sector pensions to narrow the gap.Total pay in the public sector - including the value of pension contributions and bonuses, is on average 23 per cent higher than the private sector for comparable workers.Taxpayers’ Alliance boss John O’Connell blasted: “Workers in the private sector are paying for their public sector counterparts to enjoy a retirement they can only dream of, and that disparity has been brutally compounded over the years by politicians continuously launching raids on private pensions.“What’s more, pension promises made to public sector workers are unfunded and will continue to be paid out of general taxation - that is unsustainable as people are living a lot longer than when these schemes were cooked up.“To stop kicking the can down the road, reforms must ensure that new public sector pensions are properly funded and not paid for by the taxpayers of the future, namely our children and grandchildren.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He even lifted up a woman bather with his snout, mayor Roger Lars told the local newspaper Ouest France.The dolphin has been hanging around the Bay of Brest for months, swimming near the beaches of Plougastel-Daoulas, Logonna-Daoulas and Landevennec.He likes to frolic around tourist boats and even lets swimmers grip onto his dorsal fin and go for a ride with him, but recently he has become just a little too friendly.Locals have told of the sexed-up mammals antics, with several going into some detail about shocked tourists being confronted with the animal’s sexual arousal.Experts say dolphins appear to have frequent recreational sex and sometimes display sexual behaviour towards other species - including humans.They point out that they are very large wild animals and could cause serious injury - even inadvertently with a flipper - if they feel in any way threatened.But attacks or injury to humans by dolphins are so rare that a Breton lawyer says he plans to take legal action to have what he calls the “excessive” swimming ban flipped.“The mayor wants to make dolphins look like almost ferocious beasts, completely unpredictable and likely to drown people,” said Erwan Le Cornec.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it can’t come at the expense of the EU’s integrity.France wants to maintain a strong, special relationship with London, but not if the cost is the EU’s unravelling.

They want the 20 billion euros paid by Italian citizens? Then let them demonstrate that they deserve it and that they are taking charge of a problem that we can no longer face alone. The borders of Italy are the borders of Europe.”EU budget chief Gunther Oettinger hit back by pointing out Italy actually pays in around 16 billion a year, leaving a net contribution of just 3 billion.

That’s our approach.”Mr Hammond’s attack on Mr Gove follows a similar rebuke by his deputy Liz Truss, who used a speech in June to openly mock Mr Gove over his nanny state crackdown on disposable cups, plastic straws and wood-burning stoves.Earlier this month the Treasury signalled it would announce a new “plastic tax” on firms selling single-use water bottles, takeaway boxes and coffee cups.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Republican McCain urged America not to hide behind walls in a statement dictated just days before he died - likely a direct dig at Trump\u0027s plans to build a border wall with Mexico. McCain\u0027s letter appears to contain a number of swipes at the sitting president, with whom he had a long standing and often ugly rivalry. The Letter In Full  My fellow Americans, whom I have gratefully served for sixty years, and especially my fellow Arizonans, Thank you for the privilege of serving you and for the rewarding life that service in uniform and in public office has allowed me to lead. I have tried to serve our country honorably. I have made mistakes, but I hope my love for America will be weighed favorably against them. I have often observed that I am the luckiest person on earth. I feel that way even now as I prepare for the end of my life. I have loved my life, all of it. I have had experiences, adventures and friendships enough for ten satisfying lives, and I am so thankful. Like most people, I have regrets. But I would not trade a day of my life, in good or bad times, for the best day of anyone else\u0027s. I owe that satisfaction to the love of my family. No man ever had a more loving wife or children he was prouder of than I am of mine. And I owe it to America. To be connected to America\u0027s causes -- liberty, equal justice, respect for the dignity of all people -- brings happiness more sublime than life\u0027s fleeting pleasures. Our identities and sense of worth are not circumscribed but enlarged by serving good causes bigger than ourselves. Fellow Americans\u0027 -- that association has meant more to me than any other. I lived and died a proud American. We are citizens of the world\u0027s greatest republic, a nation of ideals, not blood and soil. We are blessed and are a blessing to humanity when we uphold and advance those ideals at home and in the world. We have helped liberate more people from tyranny and poverty than ever before in history. We have acquired great wealth and power in the process. We weaken our greatness when we confuse our patriotism with tribal rivalries that have sown resentment and hatred and violence in all the corners of the globe. We weaken it when we hide behind walls, rather than tear them down, when we doubt the power of our ideals, rather than trust them to be the great force for change they have always been. We are three-hundred-and-twenty-five million opinionated, vociferous individuals. We argue and compete and sometimes even vilify each other in our raucous public debates. But we have always had so much more in common with each other than in disagreement. If only we remember that and give each other the benefit of the presumption that we all love our country we will get through these challenging times. We will come through them stronger than before. We always do. Ten years ago, I had the privilege to concede defeat in the election for president. I want to end my farewell to you with the heartfelt faith in Americans that I felt so powerfully that evening. I feel it powerfully still. Do not despair of our present difficulties but believe always in the promise and greatness of America, because nothing is inevitable here. Americans never quit. We never surrender. We never hide from history. We make history. Farewell, fellow Americans. God bless you, and God bless America.  The letter was read out at a press conference in Arizona today by longtime aid and former campaign manager Rick Davis. McCain, who lost his battle with a brain tumour at the age of 81 on Saturday, makes reference to \u0027tribal loyalties\u0027 and \u0027present difficulties\u0027 Both are likely references to the ongoing trials and tribulations of the Trump presidency. Despite initially backing Trump for the presidency, McCain dealt Trump\u0027s leadership a major blow in his last final major act as a senator. He blocked Trump\u0027s attempts to repeal Obama\u0027s Affordable Care Act with a decisive vote that killed the president\u0027s big legislative push. His torpedoing of the bill killed his relationship with Trump, and, once McCain had been diagnosed with a brain tumour the pair began aiming a iety of digs at each other. During an October speech accepting the National Constitution Center’s Liberty Medal in Philadelphia, McCain criticised the president’s worldview as “some half-baked spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kevin maguire former bingo caller","story":"NewsopinionKevin Maguire: The former bingo caller who can make Labour clickety-clickThe Liverpool-born MP for Hayes and Harlington in West London is overseeing the party’s preparations for government, as they sense the Tories’ collapse is imminent amid an uncivil war over BrexitShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByKevin MaguireAssociate editor21:32, 26 AUG 2018Updated08:05, 27 AUG 2018NewsopinionShadow Chancellor John McDonnell is reasserting his position as leader Jeremy Corbyn’s closest comrade\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLabour\u0027s fate is in the hands of a former bingo caller and trainee priest with a growing reputation for solving problems. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used to call out “Number 10, Wilson’s Den” in Great Yarmouth. He spent three teenage years in a Catholic seminary before, as he puts it, discovering women – so celibacy went bang out of the window. Now, he is reasserting his position as leader Jeremy Corbyn’s closest comrade. The Liverpool-born MP for Hayes and Harlington in West London is overseeing the party’s preparations for government, as they sense the Tories’ collapse is imminent amid an uncivil war over Brexit. “I had been saying pessimistically that the Tories would cling on to office,” he told me. “Now, I think anything can happen.” McDonnell is the architect of Labour’s alternative economic plan to boost living standards by ending Conservative austerity.  And he has lined up meetings next month with bankers Goldman Sachs and Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, as well as trade unionists Len McCluskey, Dave Prentis and Tim Roache to fine-tune Labour’s policies. The party’s plan to hike taxes for high earners and big corporations was a 2017 masterstroke that he’ll repeat in the next election manifesto. Once the fearsome “Mac the Knife”, McDonnell has recently morphed into a peacemaker. He’s demanding Labour stamps out anti-Semitism and appealing to pro-Europeans by leaving the door open to giving people a vote on Brexit. These moves were described by an ally as signs that McDonnell is clearing roadblocks to power.

The woman, who has not been named but has shared her story in her shock, is due to get married to her fianc\u0026eacute in Colombia this December. However her soon-to-be mother-in-law who is not her biggest fan is causing a stir by interfering with the wedding arrangements and has done the unforgivable with her wedding dress. The woman wrote on Reddit : Future MIL is very upset about our destination wedding.  She thinks we\u0027ll all be murdered , b***hes constantly about the cost of her airfare, the size of the wedding, the guests that won\u0027t be able to come, the thought of my fianc\u0026eacute getting malaria, the fact that no one in Colombia speaks English...you get the picture. I try to limit her exposure to my wedding planning, though when I do this, she complains to my fianc\u0026eacute behind my back on how she\u0027s being excluded. The woman goes on to say how her partner\u0027s mum has criticised how extravagant her ring is - and that she needs to watch her calories as she\u0027s getting fat and won\u0027t be able to fit into her dress. However, the final straw was when she found her mother-in-law in her bedroom doing something disturbing with her wedding dress while she and her partner were putting up a bed in their guest room.  She explains that she left her to her own devices and to watch Netflix while they assembled the bed. But 40 minutes later, the woman went to the toilet and found her mother-in-law in their bedroom putting her wedding dress on - and she wasn\u0027t wearing knickers. Things got even worse when she saw her mother-in-law was stuck in it and had torn the sheer back of the dress, broken the zip and left a foot print on the train. The furious woman wrote: I asked her, as soon as I got her out of the dress , what the HELL she was thinking. She responded that she was just trying to make sure the dress would fit me because if the dress fit her, then it absolutely fit me too. If it didn\u0027t fit her, then I obviously had some work to do. Nevermind that I just had my final fitting and it had fit like a glove.

New mum Rachael Glaister, 26, only had one hour sleep when she joined her sister-in-law Leanne Johnston for her big day. She and husband Jason, 28, had welcomed their little girl into the world at 11.50pm last Friday - but at 12pm the next day they were celebrating with Leanne and husband Sean. And little Rose only met her grandma 15 minutes before Rachael walked down the aisle. Rachael and Jason, of Newlands Lane, Workington, Cumbria, did not know if they would have made the wedding when the first-time mum went into labour on Friday morning, a week after Rose\u0027s due date.  But they said thanks to the amazing support of the super-nurses at Whitehaven\u0027s West Cumberland Hospital they were able to make the wedding at Sella Park Hotel, Calderbridge, where they also spent their first night as parents. Rachael said: Everyone was panicking and thinking we wouldn\u0027t be there, but the staff in the delivery suite were brilliant, they got me ready and made sure the baby was okay. It meant the world for me to be there, Leanne is my sister-in-law and I wouldn\u0027t have missed her wedding for the world. Jason added: It was really emotional to see Rachael coming down the aisle holding our baby at my sister\u0027s wedding. My mum only met Rose 15 minutes before the ceremony.  We\u0027d only had an hour sleep the night before, but we weren\u0027t tired because of the buzz.

Upton Fish Shop has become one of Britain\u0027s most popular chip shops despite only opening six hours a week. Even the hour-long queues fail to put customers off. Owner Sally Shaw, 45, uses a 66-year-old batter recipe which attracts customers from miles around. The fish and chips are cooked in dripping in a huge coal-fired range - believed to be one of only two in operation in the UK.  People queue down the street in Gainsborough, north Lincs., when it opens on Friday nights and Saturday lunchtimes - and some even bring camp chairs to sit on. The takeaway, which recently celebrated its 70th anniversary, has had customers to fly into a nearby airstrip on private planes from across the country. It\u0027s popular with staff too, as one devoted staff member has worked there for 52 years. Sally, who purchased the takeaway at auction in 2005, said she can\u0027t believe the popularity of the 70 sq ft shop.  She said: People will queue all of the way down the street. I never get to see how many people are outside from behind the counter but customers will get to the front and say \u0027we have been in the queue for over an hour tonight\u0027. It is a regular thing, if someone tells me they have been queuing for half an hour I cheekily tell them that doesn\u0027t sound too bad.  Long-serving member of staff, Janet Gillespie, 74, jokes she\u0027s probably past her sell-by date by now, adding: I have enjoyed every single minute of it. The customers are all fantastic, they are like friends to me. I have never heard a bad word or complaint said about the shop, we treat everybody exactly the same whether they have been coming forever or it is their first time.   Is this Britain\u0027s most expensive pint? Hipster pub selling beer for 5 TIMES the price because of its very odd ingredients  Janet started work at the shop after making a pledge when she was eight years old to the previous owner. She explained: I told Mrs Longden, \u0027I want to work behind the counter here one day\u0027. It is the best decision I ever made. I have such a passion for it. I will carry on working here until I get thrown out, I will never leave.  My family joke if I\u0027m not at the chip shop on a Friday night, I\u0027m probably dead. The limit operating hours were used by the previous owner and Sally continued with them to keep everything the same. Sally said: I have known people come from Leicester, from North Yorkshire, from all over the place, she explained.  Some customers come every week without fail and many have been coming for decades. Customers have become so used to having to wait for their favourite meal they have created a system to work out how long they have left to wait.  Sally explained: The customers can work out how far away from the food they are by different points on the street. At one post they know they are an hour away, at another they know they are half an hour away.  It has become a bit of a social event, people bring their camping chairs and sit and have a chat while waiting.

Rod Puckey, 63, felt unwell, was sweating and constantly running to the loo after coming down with a viral infection in March. He went to hospital and claims doctors said the dad-of-four had an early onset epileptic episode - and wrote it on his medical record. Rod says he then informed the DVLA who told him he would be unable to drive for six months. It meant Rod - who delivered medical supplies around Europe - was left unable to work.  But Rod then went for a second opinion at a private clinic and discovered he had been wrongly diagnosed - and simply had a very bad case of the runs. Despite the second opinion ruling out an epileptic fit. Rod had already phoned the DVLA to tell him of a potential change in his medical condition. Rod has since been made unemployed after being dubbed unfit to drive and having his licence revoked. But the dad-of-four says he did the honourable thing by informing them and claims he has been unfairly punished. Rod, from Stourbridge, West Midlands, said: I was only ill for a few days and I didn\u0027t drive in that time. It was an extreme case of diarrhoea - it was really difficult going to the doctors as I had to dash off every couple of minutes.  I thought I would let the DVLA know of the illness incase I needed to change my insurance. I use my car every single day and was aware of the potential fine so I was doing the right thing. I\u0027m very by the book and a law abiding citizen so why wouldn\u0027t I keep them informed? Turns out doing the honest thing really comes round to bite you. They won\u0027t give me my licence back despite doctors admitting the epileptic-like note was done in error! I\u0027ve drive around 25,000 miles-a-year for work and have been doing so for almost 40 years.  I\u0027ve been dealt a hefty punishment for something that only lasted a couple of days. He added: I\u0027ve never had any issue with my driving. My wife doesn\u0027t drive, my kids have left home and I\u0027m not old enough for a bus pass. I\u0027ve had my livelihood stripped away from me from something that wasn\u0027t even my fault. I don\u0027t really mind on missing out on work as I\u0027m at that stage in my life where I\u0027m not fully dependent on it.

Instagram users have been mystified about how the Lure, who owns her own self-named clothing line, has maintained wrinkle-free skin into her early 40s.  After gaining more than 700,000 followers, she revealed to Taiwan\u0027s Friday magazine the secrets behind her ageless looks, which include a strict diet and regular exercise.  The 43-year-old suggested most skin problems could be solved with regular moisturising and has previously showcased brands such as SK-II and La Prairie online.   Lure also says she has been able to maintain her youthful looks while being able to enjoy a little bit of time in the sun, albeit in small doses. She told Friday magazine she does not sit in the sun often because it dries out her skin and can make fine lines show up more harshly. As well as always putting on sunscreen when stepping outside, Lure also has a daily skincare regime with oral supplements like Vitamin C and collagen.

Jade Norris, now 17, had visited her local GP with worried family after self-harming and numerous attempts to take her own life. But Jade\u0027s mum, Dawn, and stepdad, Ben Garnham, from Bridgend, Wales, were appalled when doctors allegedly refused to help their child because she fell into a \u0027limbo\u0027 age. They claim medics told the family Jade was too old for child mental health and too young to access adult services at 16. Mum Dawn went on to claim the doctor said as long as Jade wasn\u0027t \u0027cutting herself to death\u0027, she could continue until she turned 18. Now, her fraught parents are terrified the 17-year-old - who suffers from depression, body dysmorphia and gender confusion - could take her own life before she turns 18.  The Mirror has used images of Jade\u0027s self-harming after her parents released them in a bid to raise awareness and get help. Mum, Dawn Norris, 41, a hairdresser, said: We took Jade to the doctors because she continually self-harms. They basically told us that we have to \u0027learn to cope\u0027 with what Jade does. The GP told us as long as she isn\u0027t \u0027cutting herself to death\u0027 she should continue self-harming until she is old enough to see a proper adult mental health specialist. What they told us was unbelievable - it\u0027s madness. After filing a complaint with Oak Tree Surgery in Bridgend, Dawn and Ben received a two-page apology from Jade\u0027s GP.  The letter states: I am sorry if the way I discussed the issues with Jade led you to believe that I thought her problems were incurable or that self-harm is ok. Self-harm can be dangerous, and I discussed how this can be a risk-factor in more serious harm but that for the time being Jade was practicing this in a low risk way. Jade\u0027s parents said 17-year-old also sees things that aren\u0027t there and hears voices that have told her to kill herself. Her parents are also convinced she has autism, as she has failed to socially develop at the same rate as her peers and has been diagnosed with a speech-language impairment. But despite being seen numerous times by doctors and child mental health professionals, Dawn and Ben claim she has yet to receive a positive autism diagnosis and is \u0027being passed from pillar to post\u0027. Stepdad, Ben, 39, a DJ, said: Jade has been fobbed off too many times with the excuse that there are no services available for her until she turns 18. She doesn\u0027t turn 18 until next May, and her self-harming has been going on for the last four years and is getting worse.  If she were to kill herself between now and then who will be accountable? We feel like we can\u0027t get any help. We took her to the GP who referred her to CAMHS . So we went to CAMHS who told us we should seek counselling through her college. We went to the college, they gave her counselling, but it was discontinued. Then we went back to the GP and were referred to CAMHS again. It\u0027s just a vicious circle and we\u0027re not getting anywhere with it. Dawn said she first noticed something was wrong with Jade when she was a baby. Jade began self-harming at the age of 13, after being bullied at high school, and has tried to hang herself on several different occasions.  And her parents believe that her undiagnosed autism heightens everything she feels, which leads her to self-harm. Ben and Dawn have also written to their local Labour MP, Madeleine Moon for help. Ben said: When Jade was 14, she began \u0027seeing\u0027 a person called Claire, who she says is the dark side of her personality. Claire tells Jade she\u0027s no good, and she should cut and kill herself. We\u0027ve had a crisis team out to Jade on numerous occasions and still, nothing is being done. We\u0027re so worried and frustrated. We believe Jade needs proper psychiatric care. We just want to get her some help, we\u0027re desperate. Something needs to change with the whole mental health system.

Several shots ring out in the footage released by Bedfordshire Police, as a group of men are heard screaming at each other in the middle of a residential street in Luton. The gun used in the unsolved December 2017 shooting was supplied by Mathew Harwozinski, 29, who imported a large number of replica pistols and blank ammunition from the Czech Republic. With the help of Ricky Garner, 48, he modified weapons so they could fire lethal rounds.  The guns and live ammunition were then sold on to be used in a number of gangland shootings - with at least one involved in an attempted murder. Estimates suggest the weaponry was sold for between \u0026pound1,500 and \u0026pound2,000, with buyers having to return to the pair for their unique ammunition. Garner and Harwozinski pleaded guilty to their role in importing and modifying the weapons, some of which could fire around eight bullets per second. Luton Crown Court heard how between May 2017 and January of this year, Harwozinski used a false name to buy blank firing handguns and more than 1,000 rounds of blank ammunition. The weapons were then converted by Garner, an engineer at a metal fabricator factory, so they could fire modified live ammunition.  The duo sold weapons to at least one gang based in Luton, Bedforshire, while their guns and ammunition have also been recovered in London and the West Midlands. Harwozinski, from Bedford was given a life sentence at Luton Crown Court on Friday and will serve a minimum term of 11 years and eight months, minus the time he has already spent in custody. Garner, from Elstow, Bedfordshire, will serve at least half his sentence of 20 years and three months before he is considered for release on licence. Sentencing the pair, Judge Andrew Bright QC said: The offences to which each of you have pleaded guilty are of the utmost seriousness and this court has a duty to the public to ensure the sentence placed upon you reflects the incalculable danger your actions have caused to the safety of the public and those in the criminal underworld.  Ballistics testing found the converted weapons were more than capable of firing lethal shots. A number of the weapons were fully automatic and able to fire around eight bullets per second. The converted weapons have been discharged in public on a number of occasions, endangering the life of innocent people, and on at least one occasion their use caused injury in circumstances amounting to attempted murder. The weapons were used in at least three shootings in Luton last year, including two on the same night last December where bullets caused substantial damage to a McDonald\u0027s and a number of vehicles. Since the pair were arrested in January, there have been further incidents in the politan Police area and in Bedfordshire that have involved pistols and ammunition supplied by them.  The operation was led by Bedfordshire Police\u0027s Serious \u0026amp Organised Crime Unit , assisted by the politan Police , National Crime Agency  and the Eastern Region Special Operations Unit . Detective Inspector Justin Dipper, from Bedfordshire Police\u0027s SOCU, said: A combination of good intelligence, proactive policing and sheer persistence on behalf of our officers has taken dozens of lethal weapons off the streets and stopped any further supply into Bedfordshire. The fact these weapons have been repeatedly fired in public shows the huge danger Garner and Harwozinski placed innocent people in, and we are glad the court has responded with such strong sentences for those involved in organised crime.  Through this investigation, SOCU has demonstrated its ability to work with, and lead, other agencies in pursuit of dangerous criminals. The fact Bedfordshire\u0027s SOCU has been able to mount such a proactive and wide ranging operation is testament to the dedication and talent we have in the team. Garner pleaded guilty to converting the weapons, manufacturing ammunition and possessing ammunition without a firearms certificate. Harwozinski pleaded guilty to importing and converting firearms, manufacturing ammunition and possessing firearms with intent to enable others to endanger life. How police caught Harwozinski and Garner Intelligence linked Garner to some of the defendants and the weapons used in the Bedford gang shootings in July 2016, for which the total sentence for those involved has now reached 185 years imprisonment.   The force’s Operation Kruse investigation into these shootings then linked Garner and Harwozinski.  Slowly, Bedfordshire Police officers and partners from the Eastern Region Special Operations Unit  built up a network of their associates, which included gang members based in Luton and London as well as criminals linked to drugs supply in Bedford. In January a number of converted weapons and rounds of manufactured ammunition were found at addresses in Bedford, with Harwozinski observed at one of these properties in Offa Road. Scene of crime officers identified this unique ammunition from the previous incidents in Luton. All the recovered firearms were the same makes with the same type of adaption and with the same unique ammunition.

Kamaljit Sagoo and his then girlfriend were on a night out to mark his 44th birthday but they began arguing when they returned to their home in Longbenton, Newcastle. Following the row, Sagoo decided to drive to the local Tesco in his Audi A4 to buy some cigarette papers while over the limit, a court heard. However, the plasterer was pulled over and arrested within minutes as his other half had reported him to the police, reports Chronicle Live . Now, Sagoo, of Longbenton, has been fined and banned from the roads for 17 months after he pleaded guilty to one count of drink-driving and one of driving without insurance at North Tyneside Magistrates\u0027 Court. Lorna Rimell, prosecuting, said an argument had flared between the pair at their home late on June 18 this year.  “The defendant decided to drive to Tesco to get Rizla papers,” she told magistrates. “Unusually, he has been reported by his partner for driving while drunk and he later found by police in the driver’s seat of his car. “He’s then failed a roadside breath test.” The court heard Sagoo blew 61 microgrammes of alcohol in 100ml of breath when the legal limit is 35 microgrammes.

Louis Makepeace, who has dwarfism, has been refused a place at Heart of Worcestershire College after being originally offered a conditional spot. The 18-year-old claims college bosses branded him a health and safety risk to the other 14 pupils and would cause a disruption if he got under their feet. He\u0027s won the backing of Michelin-starred Ramsay, 51, who tweeted to his 6.8million followers: Disgusting attitude, I’d offer him an Apprenticeship any day.  Louis\u0027 mum, Pauline, 56, said she was told by a course leaders there was no point in her son doing the programme as he would never be allowed to work in a restaurant anyway. The teenager - who dreams of being the next Gino D\u0027Acampo - has had his confidence seriously knocked following the humiliating blow. Louis, of Worcester, has achondroplasia, a form of short-limbed dwarfism.  He said: It was really upsetting as I had my heart set on this course. We are supposed to have equality of opportunity yet I\u0027m not allowed to do something I love doing. They are simply not prepared to make the necessary adjustments to accommodate me such as making the surfaces and hobs lower. We were prepared to be flexible and my mum said I could maybe do the cooking at home whilst the new equipment was installed but they kept saying no.  They said I would be a health and safety risk and disruption to the other students and get in their way, which was really humiliating. It really has dented my confidence, how am I ever supposed to get the culinary skills that\u0027s going to get me a job in a catering environment. All the time I was at school I was always very confident, I had lots of friends and my disability was never an issue. But how am I supposed to get by if this is how I\u0027m treated - I feel like I have been excluded from the real world.  My confidence is shrinking and I feel that people stare and laugh at me. People just think I\u0027m still a kid and will push in front of me in queues. I just want to be treated as a normal person without them laughing at me and go around and do quite normal stuff. Full-time mum-of-two Pauline said she is still pushing for a final answer from the college but has been told to find Louis another course. She added: They won\u0027t give me straight answer but when I asked the course leader whether he should find another course he told me it would \u0027probably be a good idea\u0027.

The iconic image was taken on August 22, 1914, the day before the Battle of Mons , the first engagement between British and German soldiers of the First World War.  All that was known about the soldier in question was that he was a Private Carter. Officials in the Belgian city gave it pride of place in the local tourist information office, and it was used on the cover of a Commonwealth War Graves Commission leaflet. But no one knew if he had survived the fierce fighting, and the years of trench warfare that followed. Now - more than a century later - historians in the Belgian city have identified the man in the picture as Arthur Frederick Carter, a member of D Company, 4th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment. He was 20 at the time. They discovered that not only did he survive the whole four years of the war – a rare feat - he also served as an anti-aircraft gunner in north London in the Second World War between 1939 and 1945. Last week Private Carter’s descendants were invited to Mons as locals paid tribute, on the anniversary of the date the photograph was taken. They included two grandsons, several great-grandchildren and a great-great-granddaughter. Until recently, all were unaware of their ancestor’s importance in Mons.

Beatrice said she wrote back: Do you know you cannot answer \u0027no sorry just English person\u0027 to somebody who is applying for a job? This is DISCRIMINATION.

Ryan Howarth struggled to consume anything other than the low-nutrition meal from the age of four and felt like eating much more would be like eating insects. The 21-year-old, from Andover, Hampshire, has Selective Eating Disorder, which left him eating chicken nuggets and chips for 90% of the last 17 years - occasionally being able to eat steak, sausage, pasta and sweets. When offered other foods, the cinema host felt like they were so foreign that they were impossible for him to taste. He even cried for 20 minutes when his mum asked him to try root vegetable mash.  The disorder saw him eat by himself, leave the room when everyone else was eating and have arguments with his parents His family kept reminding him about the health risks of his diet, which led him to finding a therapist who persuaded him to try out some other foods before even leaving the room. Within minutes, Ryan was eating a iety of dishes with no hesitation. He said: I used to just think that\u0027s what my life was. I just ate the foods I wanted to. The way I reacted when someone asked me to eat more was the same way most people would react if I asked them to eat an exotic food, like insects. It just felt so foreign to me. My family started getting worried that my diet could cause health problems later on in life.  When I was still in the room with Felix, I was eating a bunch of different foods without hesitation. Now I\u0027m eating so many different things. There\u0027s ones I like and there\u0027s ones I don\u0027t like, but I\u0027m basically testing everything out. It\u0027s amazing how I\u0027m enjoying foods I never expected I\u0027d like. I never thought I\u0027d like pineapple, but now it\u0027s one of my favorites. Just one month after he\u0027s been introducing these foods to his diet, Ryan already feels healthier. Before the switch, he had a low energy levels, took a lot of vitamins to make up for the nutrients he wasn\u0027t getting from his meals and ate a chocolate bar whenever he was feeling weak. Ryan said: It\u0027s amazing. I feel healthier and I feel like I have more energy throughout the day.  That was no way to live. I was eating candy to keep myself going. I had three cavities as a kid. Another thing Ryan realized after changing his diet was that his eating disorder had a negative affect on his relationship with his family saying he alienated himself from everyone and dreaded going out to restaurants. Ryan said: I never used to eat with my family. I feel like I was letting them down and I was also letting myself down. Now I finally know what it\u0027s like to sit and have a meal with my family. It\u0027s really nice. I always tried to avoid going to restaurants or only went to ones where I could order the few foods I liked. Now I can finally go out to eat with my family and have lots of different foods to chose from. His mum Christiane, 45, has noticed a drastic change in his personality since taking up the new diet.

Simon Williams, from Swansea, claimed his Employment and Support Allowance benefit went into his bank account at 2am before a mystery withdrawal was made six minutes later. When Simon went to the supermarket the next, he realised he had just \u0026pound10 left in his account.  In total, the 37-year-old was left with \u0026pound13 for his food shop, bills and travel -leaving him relying on charity food parcels after claiming he was refused a refund by the bank, reports Wales Online .  He said: I realised when I got up and went to go shopping, I noticed I was able to withdraw just \u0026pound10. I thought it was a mistake so checked my phone app. Once I saw the \u0026pound250 withdrawal I knew immediately I was the victim of fraud as everything came together. I was using my phone to take money out as I couldn’t find my card, I had only used it the day before and wasn’t aware it was missing. Obviously I knew then it had been stolen. As I had never divulged my PIN I was at a loss as to how they had accessed my account.  At first, I wasn’t too worried as I phoned my mother to tell her, and she assured me this had happened to her, and all I had to do was report the fraud to the police, then give the crime reference number to the bank and they would refund my money and claim it back from the thief themselves. Mr Williams followed the process, expecting things would be fine, but they weren\u0027t. They took details of my complaint and immediately I started to feel there was a big problem, he said. They really didn’t seem interested. After I provided them with all I knew they said I would have a decision within three days. I contacted them after the three days, they then told me: \u0027We will not be taking up the case, as you cannot tell us how your PIN was compromised.\u0027 I tried explaining that if I knew that, I would most likely either be able to tell them who, or at least how it happened. But they were adamant they weren’t taking up the case. They explained this wasn’t just \u0027no refund\u0027, but that they would not expend any resources on tracking the thief. Mr Williams requested a copy of a CCTV photo from the cashpoint so he could find the person responsible and take them to a small claims court, but he said the bank refused.

In the royal house he’s the most popular of all of them, Smith told Variety .  All the research I did found him to be brilliantly funny, very clever, very popular. If you’ve talked to any of the staff, Philip’s the one they all love really. I think more than a lot of them, he’s a bit more of a man of the people. Smith , 35, also described how it is Philip\u0027s naughtiness and cheekiness that makes him so well liked. Meanwhile, Philip reportedly scoffed at the \u0027ridiculous\u0027 suggestion he watches The Crown, Smith added.  Philip is said to have made the remark during dinner with one of the actor’s pals and said: “Don’t be ridiculous”. Netflix has confirmed the series will be back in 2019. Olivia Colman will take over from Claire Foy in the role as Queen Elizabeth, while Tobias Menzies will star as Philip.

Emma Allen, her husband and two sons aged four and seven, checked in to Pontins Prestatyn on Monday for their four-night \u0026pound500 holiday .  But when they got to their apartment they discovered broken furniture, dirty cupboards, bedding smelling of urine, and even toenails on the floor.  The Daily Post reports that the family, from West Sussex, claim that when they complained to staff they were “laughed at”.   Mrs Allen said: “I cried as soon as I walked into the room. My husband wanted to leave but the staff at reception refused us a refund and we can’t afford to go elsewhere. “When my husband complained to the shift manager he just turned round and said ‘What do you expect? We’re not a five star hotel. It’s not the Ritz’. “Our room has a plastic futon for a bed and that is broken. The pillows and duvet also smell of urine. There are suspect white stains in the bedroom and we’ve found toenails, fingernails, a dead wasp and metal staples on the floor. “We feel so dirty, ashamed and humiliated. The front door to our apartment does not close properly – there is even a sign inside saying don’t leave your valuables.  “There were so many families in reception complaining but there were people that were worse off than us – someone had found used tampons on the floor. “The worst thing about it all they do is laugh and it just makes you feel rotten.” Mrs Allen requested a re-clean of their apartment but due to staff not coming until 10pm she had to clean the area herself at her own expense. The family also shelled out a further \u0026pound240 to have breakfast and dinner at the resort – but there were flies in the salad and mould growing on cake. “It’s just been disgusting. The staff were all just sat around eating and were not serving so I took the mouldy cake to the head chef and she just laughed in my face and told me I was stupid and said get out. All of the staff sat sniggering. “Since we arrived my husband and four-year-old have had stomach cramps and suffered from diarrhoea.”  She has kept hold of the cake to be sent to Environmental Health officials. Mrs Allen told how the trip has left the family miserable and has particularly affected her seven-year-old son who has autism. She also plans to set up a petition to get the Prestatyn resort and other Pontins sites shut down. She said: “People are coming to your area hoping to have a lovely time and instead it is being shattered by the illusion of this holiday establishment.

The mercury reached 20C  in Suffolk, the Met Office said, which is around the average for this time of year. Wet weather is forecast to return for northern and west parts of Scotland as well as Northern Ireland on Tuesday.  But the predicted maximum rainfall of around 15mm is far short of the 40.2 mm which fell in Mumbles Head, near Swansea on Sunday. Heavy rain on Sunday had forced the cancellation of the Silverstone GoPro British Grand Prix MotoGP.    While party-goers were also soaked at the annual carnival in west London on day one, Monday saw better conditions for dancers as well as those watching along the colourful parade route. The rest of the week is expected to remain dry for most, with temperatures forecast to dip midweek and then climb up to 25C  in the south of the country by the weekend.  Meteorologist Rachael West said: The general trend over the next few days will see a fair amount of dry weather.

But Meghan was a bit nervous about one of her maid-of-honour duties - organising the hen party , or the bachelorette party.  She didn\u0027t like the idea of running around a city trying to get into clubs and wearing headbands of the phallic persuasion. So instead, she decided to organise a low-key stagette - and it sounds like it was really lovely.

Exciting, of course, but immense – especially when it came to a bachelorette party.  Because the thought of running around a city trying to get into clubs and wearing headbands of the phallic persuasion didn\u0027t seem very on brand for us, I opted instead to woo the bride to be with a more low-key stagette. Now splitting half her time in London, it was easy for Linds to have a European weekend jaunt – so along with our friend Lucy, we ventured off to the sleepy chic island of Hydra. It\u0027s a two hour ferry from Athens, and a little rock trapped in time with the only mode of transportation being bikes or donkeys.

A very deep thinker. He’s a lovely kid,” he said.Charlie had initially hoped to raise £500 but by Friday their campaign had already attracted almost £3,700 worth of donations.“It’s incredible,” Adam said. “I’m totally shocked by how much this raised and Charlie is as well.”“The generosity has been unbelievable.”The Tay Road Bridge is just under one-and-a-half miles long. Adam estimated that in the 10-hour trek the duo covered about 30 miles.After completing the challenge, Adam said: “It all went fantastically well.“I’m bursting with pride at Charlie’s efforts. He just kept going and was still full of running at the end, even though his legs were like elastic. He was a complete trooper.“So many people came and walked with us and supported us including Nicola King of Oranges and Lemons Nursery who was a huge support when Eileen passed away.”Adam said that friends, family and even complete strangers supported them on the day with people coming up and handing them money.He added: “Many people had a tear in their eye when they spoke to Charlie and congratulated him on his amazing efforts.”Adam said: “We were about 15 minutes late in starting but we kept going until 6.30pm and completed 10 laps, or 20 lengths of the bridge.”All the money raised

united new boy pavol safranko admits understanding the dundonian accent has been his biggest hurdle","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United new boy Pavol Safranko has revealed the biggest hurdle he’s encountered since arriving has been learning to work out English – Scottish-style.The Slovakian international was an instant hit in Tangerine as he scored a cracking debut goal in the 2-0 win at Queen of the South a fortnight ago.And from what he’s seen of Scottish football so far, the 23-year-old is feeling good about fitting in to life in the Championship with United.Having already switched countries successfully once when he moved from Dunajska Streda in his homeland to Danish outfit Aalborg last year, he did not anticipate too many problems with getting used to the culture here.Particularly as his language of choice in Denmark was very often English.“I was one year in Denmark and everyone speaks English and I thought this is good for me coming here,” he said.“But when I came to the training ground from Dundee for the first time, the taxi driver spoke with me and I didn’t understand anything.“I had to ask him two or three times to say again before I understood what he said. It was not a big problem because he was a nice guy.“I will try to learn the accent here and it will happen but when I arrived it was more difficult to understand English here than I thought it would be.”While learning to speak, or at least understand, Dundonian, Safranko will also be reading up on the opposition he’s going to face in the Championship, starting with today\u0026#8217s visitors Partick Thistle.For him, though, the most important factor being at Tannadice will be getting to know his team-mates and focusing on playing to his and their strengths.“I do not know Partick Thistle. I do not know too much about any of the other clubs, so we have to see some videos, play games, and after I can say something about our opponents.“I think this can be a good thing. You always have to start from the ‘us’, from what we will do and not think too much about the other teams. This is a good way to build the winning mentality.“It’s more important to learn about team-mates than the other teams. I have had three weeks training now, that helps.“And it is important that we are winning games while we are learning about each other. There are many new players here and we will get better as a team but we must win while this happens.”With that impressive debut coming down in the Dumfries, for most United fans today will be their first glimpse of Safranko.Giving them a preview of what to expect he’s told them to look for him in the penalty box. He knows that’s where his worth to the team lies and that is where he wants to spend most of his time.“I am a striker who gets into the penalty box. This is my area to play. Hey, I am not good outside the box – I know where I am and that is where I play.“I hope this is good for United and that it is where we will play. Then I can help the team and that is what is most important.“We were good in my first game and we were the better team first half, so we were attacking.“Maybe not second half but we won. I hope the second game will be even better.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b83bfe7be608.jpg ","title":"dundee woman uses make up to show that real life is not like you see on social media","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA student mental health nurse has used her talents as a make-up artist to show young girls that beauty is more than just skin deep.Ash Mullen, 36, from Douglas, said she had a lot of concerns that young women and girls were left feeling inadequate after seeing social media posts of people looking “amazing”.Now she’s teamed up with her friend Jennifer Hill and used make-up to show that everyone can’t be beautiful all the time.Ash, who is a mum to a teenage daughter, said: “Jennifer and I came up with the idea to make-up her face to portray all the issues that I know young girls suffer from.“They face a lot of pressure to look great and there is also a lot of stigma attached to mental health issues.“I wanted to do something visual to represent this and because I’m a make-up artist using make-up it seemed a good way to go about this.“Social media has a lot to answer for. So many young girls follow Facebook and other social media sites and, as a result, believe that everyone else always looks amazing.“They are also led to believe that everyone else is leading a better life than they are.“I have worked in mental health for more than 10 years and I have seen for myself the mental health issues that this can cause.“I am also involved in the business of making people look good for a special occasion or a night out, but it is unrealistic to believe that everyone can look like that all the time.“However, too many girls think that everyone always looks the way they do when they are on social media posting fabulous pictures of themselves.“By taking make-up and using it in this way, I wanted to highlight that real life is not like you see on social media. If my work can help make mental health and life situations that little bit easier and let people know that it is OK not to be OK, I will be very happy.”Jennifer 31, from Fintry, said: “I thought this was a really clever concept and was happy to allow my face to be made up to help.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b7fd04af1b5a-836x564.jpg ","title":"elton ngwatala dundee players must trust each other to turn form around","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBelief is key for Dundee, says Elton Ngwatala, if they are to chalk up their first league points of the campaign.The Dark Blues will make the short journey to Perth to take on Tayside rivals St Johnstone in what has become a crucial fixture.The Dens men go into the clash stuck on zero points after two Premiership games keen not to repeat their slow start to last season.It took last year’s team until mid-September to register their first victory of the campaign – notably against today\u0026#8217s opponents, Saints, in a 3-2 victory at Dens Park.To repeat that, Ngwatala – one of the summer recruits – insists it’s about the players trusting each other to earn themselves a first win of the campaign.The Frenchman said: “Last week was, obviously, a very disappointing result for us but I think we have to look forward now.“We are back in the league matches and we have to start winning games, that’s the most important thing.“We can take a lot from the last game and learn from our mistakes. We will do everything we can to win but we have to score as well.“Obviously, we can do so much better than we have done.“Everybody in the team knows that but we have to improve and keep improving every week.“Now, everybody is on it. Everybody wants to do the best for the team, whatever the starting XI or subs, everybody wants to be part of it and we need that to be successful.”Before the 3-0 home loss to Championship side Ayr United, Dundee’s big problem was putting away the chances they were creating against St Mirren and Aberdeen.The defeat to the Honest Men has put a whole different spin on the club’s start to the season, however.Ngwatala, though, says there is plenty of talent in the current squad to create a positive twist in the story of Dundee’s season tomorrow at McDiarmid Park.“The first two games, I don’t think we deserved to lose,” he added.“That’s the way it is, though, and now I think we have to be prepared to fight every game.“As a team you have to give everything to get the win.“Even if we have to wait to score in the 95th-minute we’ll do that – you have to believe to the end.“We have to go there with confidence and express ourselves and do the best we can to get the three points.”And Ngwatala says the points will only be heading their way if they can work as a team and trust each other to get the better of their Tayside rivals – that’s the message from boss Neil McCann, anyway.“The manager has said we have to believe in ourselves, believe in what we can do and trust each other.“If we do that, we’ll get what we deserve.“It’s going to be a tough game – we have to treat this game like any other and prepare like we would against any team.“We must go there and do everything we can to get a result.”In those two league games, getting anything positive on the scoresheet was a big issue with Ngwatala the only Dundee player yet to find the net.He’s pleased to have got off the mark in goalscoring terms but would much rather have points on the board.“It was good for me to get the first goal so now I’m relaxed, the first is gone and I can carry on now.“However, I need my teammates to help me score and I will help them to do the same.“I want to score but when I do, I want my team to win, not just get a goal and we lose the game.“I want to help my team get points, that’s all I want.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b472af617d8e.jpg ","title":"hotels close to capacity and new cocktails promised as va opening draws nearer","story":"\t\t\t\t\tV\u0026ampA fever is spreading throughout Dundee as businesses gear up to welcome thousands of extra visitors. 100vw, 3000px\" /Bars across the city are promising to shake things up when the £80.1 million attraction opens its doors in mid-September, with a iety of cocktails themed around the museum.The Apex, Malmaison and Bird \u0026amp Bear are just some of the nightspots which have been working on specialist drinks.Hotels say they are close to capacity, while ScotRail and Stagecoach have vowed to put on extra trains and buses.The museum will officially open on Saturday September 15 with the free two-day 3D Festival to mark the occasion – headlined by Scots rockers Primal Scream.Apex barman David Montgomery has created two cocktails in celebration called The Victoria and The Albert.Ronnie MacKay, general manager at the Apex Hotel, said excitement was building by the day.He said: “We are in a prime spot right on the quay, so our guests will be right in the heart of all the action when the V\u0026ampA opens its doors. ”Meanwhile, transport firms are also making plans for the opening weekend.A ScotRail spokesman said: “It’s going to be a hugely exciting weekend for Dundee, and we’re delighted to be adding extra carriages to get everyone to and from the City of Discovery.”A Stagecoach spokeswoman said: “We intend to duplicate journeys around the opening to ensure we can cater for the additional customers expected to visit the V\u0026ampA.“We are also working on publishing a ‘guide to getting to the V\u0026ampA’, highlighting all our available bus services.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b83c01bc452a.jpg ","title":"jute jam journalism and jokes as edinburgh fringe stars flock to dundee this week","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee is famous for it’s three Js of “jute, jam and journalism” – but it might be adding “jokes” to the iconic title as the city’s comedy scene grows in stature.The city centre is to rock with laughter as stars of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival arrive this week, thanks to Dundee comedy promoter Luis Alcada, 29.Luis, who runs the Icebreaker Comedy Club, has secured three Fringe stars.

The acceleration up amplifies the spin in the air which can lead to a ‘funnel cloud’ developing.“When it extends all the way down to the ground it becomes a tornado.“Funnel clouds and tornadoes can happen anywhere, even in Dundee, though coastal areas are slightly more favoured because of the iation in air movements over the sea.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-to-create-thousands-of-apprenticeships","story":"                          MCDONALD\u0026rsquoS has pledged to create 43,000 apprenticeships across Europe by 2025, including a substantial number in the UK."},{"url":null,"title":"popes-visit-an-opportunity-to-end-the-cover-ups","story":"                          THE Pope\u0027 visit to Ireland is an opportunity to end the cover-up of abuse, Sinn Fein\u0027 vice-president said."},{"url":null,"title":"community-officer-confiscates-mans-frosty-jacks-before-pouring-it-into-a-bin","story":"                          A PCSO has been branded a \"bully\" for confiscating a man\u0027 sealed bottle of cider and pouring it in a bin -

time","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDons boss Derek McInnes today warned Celtic will be wasting their time launching another move for Scott McKenna.A £3.5 million bid from the Hoops for the Scotland international defender was knocked back by the Pittodrie board last week.The champions are understood to be considering coming in with an improved offer to test the Reds’ resolve to retain the 21-year-old.McInnes, pictured, insists any further Celtic approach would be doomed to failure as the Dons aim to cash in on a future “big ticket” transfer to the English Premier League.Any switch to the top flight south of the border cannot happen this summer as the English transfer window closed on August 11.However, the Scottish window shuts on Friday and Celtic have been warned off any late move for McKenna.McInnes said: “We have had a conversation with Celtic and it has been made clear and they have accepted that.“I have spoken to Brendan  and at boardroom level they have spoken.“It is difficult to me to react to another rumour that someone is thinking about putting in another offer.“We are not in a position where we need to sell or need to do a deal.“We want him to be a big part for us this season and hopefully he can be exactly that.”McKenna, who is contracted to the Dons until summer 2023, missed the 1-1 draw at Hibs through injury.He will be out until after the international break next month having suffered a hamstring tear in the 1-1 draw with Rangers.Celtic boss Rodgers criticised his defence after the 1-1 Europa League draw with Lithuanian side Suduva and is looking to strengthen his rearguard.However, McInnes insists McKenna, who was being tracked by Championship Swansea this summer, will go to a higher level than the Hoops.“McKenna’s market, for me, will be the English Premier League,” he said.“For me he will go to the English Premier League and we will get the bigger ticket on the back of that.“I am very confident of that.“It is not a case of if, it is when he goes there.”Aberdeen extended their unbeaten start to the domestic campaign to four games with a 1-1 draw at Hibs.The Easter Road side netted an equaliser with just four minutes remaining.Boss McInnes was left frustrated that referee Andrew Dallas failed to award the Reds a penalty in the first half for a foul by Paul Hanlon on Lewis Ferguson.McInnes confirmed he did not discuss the incident with Dallas after the game and had no plans to.He said: “Paul Hanlon had already been booked.“It was a genuine attempt for the ball but the referee is in such a brilliant position so credit him for that, for getting up with the speed of play.“But how on earth he doesn’t give that penalty – I have watched it back and there is no way Hanlon touches the ball.“He just comes through and takes young Lewis Ferguson down.“That is such a pivotal moment as it should have been a yellow card and a penalty kick. And two yellows make the red.“Coming away from home at such a tough venue that would have been a huge shot in the arm for us.“It was the wrong decision.“Every team gets bad decisions, but if he has seen what I did on the laptop I am scratching my head to see why he cannot give a penalty.”Aberdeen were within minutes of victory with a one-goal advantage earned by on-loan Watford defender Tommie Hoban, who returned from injury.However, McInnes was left frustrated at the late equaliser.He said: “When you go so close to the end of the game at a place like Easter Road and lose a goal late on there is that disappointment.“It is a hard one to take when you come to such a difficult venue and get yourselves in front.“We should have had enough experience and wherewithal to get the job done.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"demolition of old nursery is end of an era1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStaff from an Aberdeen nursery are asking former pupils and their families to share memories ahead of the demolition of their old building.The building, on Logie Place, used to be home to Middlefield Nursery, which has since moved to the Hub in Middlefield.The old building is due to be demolished as part of the £30 million Haudagain redevelopment scheme.Staff at the current nursery are hoping for a big turnout when the building is taken down on Monday, in what will be an “emotional” moment for workers.Marie Macdonald, who is the nursery manager at the Middlefield Community Project, which runs the nursery, said: “When we found out the time and date of the demolition, we thought that it was an end of an era.“With all the families in the area that have used the nursery, we thought that it might be nice to mark it together.”As well as people from the community, Marie hopes to take some current pupils to the site.She said: “We don’t have a huge number of pupils who were attending in the old building, but we do have a couple, so we were hoping to be able to take them down on Monday afternoon.”Marie added: “It’s for any other families, past and present – it’s quite poignant and it’s the end of an era for some people.“The Community Project has been running for a long time so we’ve had people messaging us with their kids now in their 20s.“We just want people to have that shared experience, because the whole community is changing, a lot of the community is being knocked down.“The project and the nursery has played such a big part in people’s lives and it’s the end of that, in a positive way.”Marie also expects her staff to be feeling nostalgic. She said: “There’s always going to be nostalgia for the place.“Our project co-ordinator has been here for a long time, we’ve got a member of staff who’s been here for 20 years, so it’s part of their life. I’d imagine it’ll be emotional.”The nursery moved from Logie Place into purpose-built premises within the Hub, on Manor Avenue, in January last year.According to Marie, the move has dramatically improved the quality of the nursery, with more children being able to attend, increasing the catchment area they can serve.Marie said: “Before, we could only serve Middlefield, but now we can take children from Heathryfold, Cummings Park, Marchburn and other places in the local area, so more people are really seeing the benefits.”The new facility has also improved the quality of care, she added.“It’s greatly improved the facilities that we have – it’s a purpose-built nursery and the space we have is much bigger, and it’s much more open plan,” Marie said.“We have better access to the outdoors – the doors open up into the nursery garden, which was always our vision, to give the children a choice.”Transport Scotland announced that the demolition will take place between 1.30 and 2pm on Monday.A spokesman said: “Transport Scotland is pleased to accommodate the request of Middlefield Community Project Nursery for the opportunity to visit the site during demolition of their former premises, which are part of the ongoing works being carried out in preparation for the A90/A96 Haudagain Improvement Project.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"north east service for vulnerable adults gets top marks from inspectors","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA support service for vulnerable adults in the north-east has been awarded top marks by inspectors for helping them make friends.Monitors from the Care Inspectorate watchdog visited Aberdeenshire Council Shared Lives Scheme’s adult placement programme and rated it “excellent” the best of six possible ratings – a rating rarely given.Based at Viewmount on Arduthie Road, Stonehaven, the service arranges for vulnerable adults to live with families and receive personal care, support or counselling either on a temporary or permanent basis.At the time of the inspection the scheme had 20 sets of carers and 26 service users.The report said: “The service achieved an excellent standard. We were confident that this performance is sustainable.”Service users often go on weekends away and take part in activities such as canoeing.Such outings, said the report, “provided a stimulating programme of new and enjoyable experiences and opportunities to meet up with old friends”.Placements allow service users to make friends and become less isolated, the report added.They have also become fitter, started to eat better and have learned about alcohol awareness and work opportunities.The report said: “A culture of continuous improvement was evident and involved the whole team under the manager’s highly capable and supportive leadership.”The report added: “Family members felt the weekends away allowed opportunities to mix with others and for their relatives to improve self-confidence and to have social opportunities.“Another felt her son would do things on the weekend away that he wouldn’t normally do.”The service’s team leader Sue Mahony said: “We are delighted to

to the final 12 in this year’s contest, Sarah didn’t even know about it.She was alerted by her mum’s partner Joe McGee, 54, who works in a newsagents.Joe said: “I was just putting the papers out and I had a look at the Evening Express and there he was.“I phoned Sarah straight away and said he got through.”Proud grandmother Fiona, 56, said: “I had no idea that he had won.“We just thought that people were coming to take photographs because he had made the top three.“He’s such a clever little boy, he’s really good at talking, and he’s really outgoing as well.” 100vw, 422px\" /Joe said: “He’s a

is set to start this autumn on the north-east’s newest railway station.Network Rail will build the new facility featuring two platforms at Kintore.The transport body received planning approval from Aberdeenshire Council earlier this year for the site in the north of the town beside the B987 and Northern Road.A report, which has gone before councillors, said work to clear the site would start in autumn.It read: “It is envisaged that access to the land will be available from mid-autumn for site clearance and compound establishment.“This then enables the ramping up of construction activity during spring 2019, ready for main construction during the rail blockade, required for the wider Aberdeen to Inverness rail improvement project, from May 2019.“It is anticipated that the station will be operational from December 2019 in time for the biannual timetable change.”The Kintore station will be the first new one in the north-east since 2009 when the £3 million Laurencekirk platforms opened.Along with the two platforms, a footbridge linking them will be built, as well as waiting shelters, seating and a car park for 168 vehicles.East Garioch councillor Glen Reid has raised the issue of electric vehicle charging, having been assured there will be two at the site.He said: “I welcome the continuing progress that has been made with the planning, procurement and design work for Kintore Station, which will be transformational for the local community.”Kintore station has been closed for 54 years, after being in operation for 110 years – opening in 1854.A Network Rail spokesman said: “We are working closely with the council and Nestrans to progress the new station development. Kintore will deliver a real boost for transport links in the area.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/EE1_6501.jpg.jpg ","title":"bosss delight with new boys","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCove Rangers manager John Sheran was happy to see two of his summer signings off the mark in their 3-0 win over Turriff United.The Aberdeen team were just too strong for Kris Hunter’s young side, and could have ran away with it early but for Fraser Hobday in goal.But Turra, who showed plenty of potential, lost their discipline slightly as the game went on, with Mitch Megginson smashing into the top corner after recent additions Blair Yule and Jordan MacRae had netted.Sheran said: “I don’t know what the possession stats would have been, but certainly we had a lot of the ball and plenty opportunities.“Bit frustrating we only scored three but we’re just pleased to have got the win and another clean sheet.“Fraser Hobday  did have some great saves, but we needed to be a bit more ruthless in front of goal. We were maybe just choosing the wrong options or whatever. But we’re happy.”Of his scorers, he added: “It was Jordan’s  first goal for us. He had a couple of great strikes, the keeper had a couple of great saves off him.“So it was pleasing to get him off the mark.“For his confidence it’ll do him the world of good.“He’s just getting to know the boys. At a new club it takes time with new players.“The third  wasn’t a bad strike, but I thought the first was a really good move.“It was counter attack where Jordon  played in Blair  and Blair tucked it away really nicely.“That’s his first goal since he came back too. We played him a bit further forward today and he certainly revelled in that role.”The win continued Cove’s perfect start in the Highland League and was their sixth clean sheet in a row, despite resting veterans Eric Watson and Paul McManus as the twice-weekly games continue.Brown thrashed at a chance from 12 yards early doors at the Balmoral Stadium, before Adam Cross just failed to hit a shot inside Stuart McKenzie’s back post for Turriff on 17 minutes.Cove started ramping up the pressure on the visitors, however, with Megginson having a six-yard shot blocked on the line by Ross Anderson, before the prolific scorer saw an effort tipped round the post by Hobday.He rounded the keeper 10 minutes later, but was denied again by a block from the right angle, before Hobday made a point-blank stop from MacRae.The opener came on 41 minutes. Jamie Masson spotted Yule charging through, Turra tried and just failed to step out and Yule was free to slot it past the on-rushing Hobday.Turriff never looked like coming back into it after half-time, and on 71 minutes things were sealed.MacRae forced a block from Hobday at close range before sliding in to smash his second bite at the chance into the bottom-left corner.And on 88 minutes, a frustrated Megginson, teed up by Scully, leathered it in the top-left corner from the edge of the area.Turra boss Hunter, who thought the first goal was offside but conceded he sees Cove as Highland champions again this year, said: “We did all right for a young team, but their quality showed.“The players acquitted themselves well, for their first time on a big park, they had a couple of half chances.“I’m more disappointed the belief went in the second-half with our players.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK  urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ .energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK.

Builder John MacDonald followed with colourful tales of Archie McVicar, with whom he worked as a young man.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

Consistency, however, paid off for Inveraray as they were crowned Grade 1 Champion of Champions across all five major competitions during 2018 \u0026#8211 for the third year running.In Grade 4B, a young Mid Argyll Pipe Band kept up the momentum started in May when they won the British title. Led by Pipe Major Craig Lang, they performed tremendously well all season.

The Labour list MSP hit out as it was announced rail users traveling to Glasgow from Kilmarnock will have to shell out an additional \u0026pound55 for season passes. Regulated rail fares are set to rise by 3.2 per cent, in line with the retail price index rate of inflation, from January. That will see a season pass increase from \u0026pound1692 to \u0026pound1746. Commuters in Ayr would see an increase of \u0026pound78 from \u0026pound2452 to \u0026pound2530 for a season pass. Mr Smyth said: “These rail fare rises are unwanted, unwelcome and unnecessary. “It is simply unfair that commuters in Ayrshire are being burdened with these rip-off rail fares for less than satisfactory services.  “The cost of rail fares being paid by passengers is simply unacceptable, with passengers from Kilmarnock having to fork out \u0026pound1746 a year to travel to and from work. “Scottish Labour is clear: it’s high time working people stopped having to pay such excessive fares to simply line the pockets of private companies. “Only Labour is fighting for a publicly owned railway which will serve the many, not just the few.” Elsewhere, an annual Lockerbie-Edinburgh fare will now cost \u0026pound5250 – up \u0026pound162 – after the Scotish Government decided peak fares were to increase. Transport secretary Michael Matheson said the rises were “unwelcome” and stressed action had been taken to minimise them.  Increases in off-peak fares in Scotland will be held at 2.2 per cent as the government have pledged to cap them at 1 per cent below inflation. All fares in England will rise by the RPI rate of inflation. Mr Matheson said: “This means in Scotland average fares increases are lower than England and Wales.” In recent months staff from rail union RMT have staged protests in cities around the UK. Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT, said it was “nothing short of a scandal” that ticket prices were up to five times more than fares in Europe. Lib Dem MSP Mike Rumbles MSP said the rises are the last thing hard-up passengers need.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartyScottish LabourGlasgowAyrKilmarnockEconomyTransportLockerbieKilmarnock NewsTransport ScotlandCheap travel"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"musical tribute concert honour loved","story":"NewsMusical tribute concert will honour loved onesFollowing on from the success of last year’s event, the Joan Price Memorial Concert will take to the stage once again next month.Share\u0026nbspByAbi Smillie16:27, 22 AUG 2018NewsColin Price and Pauline Moriarty join together for the tribute concert \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA musical tribute concert will honour the lives of two well loved members of the community. Following on from the success of last year’s event, the Joan Price Memorial Concert will take to the stage once again next month. Joan Price, a beloved trombone player, was tragically killed in a road traffic accident in January 2017 by two boy racers who are now serving jail sentences. Joan’s fellow band members wanted to do something to honour her memory and decided to organise a concert featuring all three bands which she had played for. Kilmarnock Concert Brass, Irvine \u0026amp Dreghorn Brass Band and Dunaskin Doon Band will join together on September 1 to pay tribute to the Troon gran. The brass band show will now be an annual event, with each band taking it in turns to nominate a charity. This year Kilmarnock Concert Brass has chosen Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out  as the worthy recipients. Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out  supports bereaved families of suicide victims and any troubled person by providing and funding services such as counselling, music, play and drama therapy.  The charity was set up by mum, Pauline Moriarty, originally from Ayr, following the suicide of her 13-year-old daughter, Jenna. The concert will honour Joan and Jenna with traditional marches, big band hits, movie themes and film scores. Tasty treats and a raffle will be on offer during the interval. Colin, Joan’s husband said: “Our family is delighted and honoured that the three bands have decided to make this concert an annual event in Joan’s memory. A lot of hard work goes on behind the scenes to make a concert like this happen and I’m indebted to everyone who has helped or who is playing on the night. “Last year’s concert was a fantastic night of entertainment and I’m looking forward to meeting many old and new friends again this year.” Pauline Moriarty added: “We are so touched the bands have chosen to raise funds for the work of a Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out . It is such a lovely tribute to Joan Price and it will help us to potentially save lives.” Joan Price Memorial Concert will take place on Saturday, September 1 at 7pm at Kyle Academy on Overmills Road in Ayr. Tickets, \u0026pound7  are available by emailing secretary@ddband or messaging Dunaskin Doon Band on their Facebook page. A limited number of tickets will also be available on the night.

Fraser and Freya Russell have qualified for the National final of the American Golf Junior Golf Championships. The pair, who live in Troon and attend Marr College, progressed from the qualifying competition held at Leven Links Golf Club and now go forward to the final which will be televised on Sky Sports later this year. Competing in the gross score stroke play competition, 14-year-old Fraser, who incredibly plays off a five handicap at Royal Troon, put in a superb performance to take the qualifier with a score of nine over par. Not to be outdone by her older brother, Freya, 12, put in a fantastic performance to score 32 points in a stableford off a handicap of 13 in the girls’ net score competition. That was enough to take top spot and secure a spot in the final at Gainsborough Golf Club, where she will take on the UK and Ireland’s best girls. Speaking after the qualifier, Fraser said: “I am delighted with how I played, it will be a great chance for me to play golf on a good stage and I can test myself against some of the best.”  And younger sister Freya is looking forward to the continuing her golfing journey as she commented: “I love to play different golf courses, meeting new friends and getting to play golf with other girl golfers.” The pair play their junior medals on the Portland Course at Royal Troon, but due to their impressive handicaps they are allowed to enter in competitions that are played on the par 71 Old Course. They are both coached by Royal Troon pro Kieron Stevenson. Both Fraser and Freya represent Ayrshire for their age levels, and Freya has been playing with the West of Scotland U18 team since she was just nine. And they both played in the World Championships at the stunning Pinehurst course, which held both the men’s and women’s US Open just a year later - won respectively by Martin Kaymer and Michelle Wie.  Pinehurst has also been pencilled in for the 2019 US Amateur Championships and the 2024 US Open. The pair’s dad, Craig, has always played golf and he helped get them into the sport. Craig, who played golf for Cambridge University, said: “They have always been interested in golf. “I took Fraser to play at a young age, and Freya’s first steps were when she got up to pick up her brother’s golf club! “I’ve never forced it on them though, anytime they play golf it’s because they want to, which I think is the key. “They aren’t just into golf though, Fraser plays rugby for Marr and Freya wants to play hockey for her school, and both of them swim.” "},{"url":null,"title":"innerleithen-ready-to-rock-with-annual-music-festival","story":"INNERLEITHEN is ready to rock ahead of this weekend\u0026rsquos annual music festival.\nThe town is set to welcome an array of musicians, artists, performers and audiences to the 16th Innerleithen Music Festival this weekend.\nAnd organisers are promising a three-day showcase of music, dance and drama events plus for, the first time ever, an art exhibition.\nLive and Local co-ordinator, Rachel Mays said: \u0026ldquoWe are so excited about this year\u0026rsquos festival.

had been donated to help boost restoration funds for the village hall.The painting, in a battered gold coloured wood frame, titled Village in the Valley, by H Shapiro, priced at £50, caused much debate.It was decided that the village looked most like Glencoe and due to the absence of television aerials it must have been pre-1965.The artist’s identity opened another discussion, with Arthur Duff taking centre stage.Had the best known 1960s Shapiro, singer Helen, performer of 1961 chart toppers, You Don’t Know and Walkin’ Back to Happiness, been a secret painter as well as pop and jazz singer and actress?Had the young star, who at 16 gave the Beatles a support slot in 1963, taken a Highland break?It all seemed a bit unlikely but could have made the painting a bit more valuable.Clues to the painting’s age lay in the method of stretching the canvas. It was nailed to the stretcher rather than the modern method of stapling. At some stage a further bar of yellowed wood had to added to keep the canvas taut.Further internet research revealed a painter known as H Shapiro, who was born in 1933. Helen was born in 1946.Unfortunately for those hoping for a massive price tag, the H stands iously for Hermon or Herman.A painting with a similar style, titled Loch Long, appeared recently on eBay and was described as: ‘Oil on canvas, possibly an early work by the artist Herman  Shapiro.‘It is hand signed, lower right, with “H. Shapiro” and dated ‘52 .’A large collection of Mr Shapiro’s other work, mainly of life studies of a distinctly different style is for sale with a gallery, named Hatfield Hines in Norwich.One of the partners at the gallery said they had bought the paintings. Despite having much biographical detail the partner claimed they had no way of contacting Mr Shapiro.That gallery states that Mr Shapiro was born in London and is settled in Scotland, which fits Clachan’s picture.He studied at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts from 1949-54 where he was apparently influenced by Bloch, Minton and Vaughan and was associated with the acclaimed Camberwell Group.By the mid 1950s he had started teaching in South Wales schools and went on to lecture at Cardiff College of Art.His paintings and sculpture are mostly based on the female figure, more recently in a domestic environment.

Despite two days and a night of rain last week the water level remains well down.The dam is crossed to reach the track to Whitehill farm, which is derelict, and on to the Ballywilline lane and the route\u0026#8217s end at the A83 pavement.In an emergency the simplest descent from the summit would be south-east, leading to a dip and due west to the Knocknan loch track and the Balegreggan waterworks.No doubt hill runners will race up Knock Scalbert but stout boots, a waterproof, picnic and a drink would make for an enjoyable walk, plus a map and compass, and the ability to use them.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter grieving for a cat","story":"In the run up to Grief Awareness Day on August 30, Cats Protection would like to let readers know that it offers a grief support service called Paws to Listen.For many, losing a cat can be a very traumatic experience and there can be a lack of understanding from family and friends about how deeply the loss can impact on a person.A survey carried out for Cats Protection earlier this month highlighted that 73 per cent of pet owners feel it can be as difficult and upsetting grieving for a pet as it is grieving for the loss of a person.Cats Protection understands just how much a cat means and what owners may be going through if their pet is missing, has had to be re-homed, nearing the end of its life or has recently passed away.Cats Protection has a large range of resources, information and support to help at this difficult time, including ways to celebrate the cat\u0026#8217s life.Anyone experiencing the loss of a cat can talk to Cats Protection on 0800 024 9494 between 9am-5pm Monday to Friday excluding bank holidays.It is a free and confidential service and our volunteer listeners can provide emotional support and practical information.To talk to someone please give the Paws to Listen service a call.We all need to be mindful of the emotional impact that losing a pet can have on a person.Stuart Sheppard,Cats Protection.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter school governance reform","story":"Deputy first minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools.If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved  school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities.Council authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system.Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is of course partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms so as to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew’s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch,Longniddry.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"nurserys outdoor play recognised","story":"Play More was set up to help deserving nurseries improve their outdoor play areas with financial support or murals.It is an initiative which was set up by nappy cream manufacturers Sudocrem to encourage parents and children to get back in touch with nature and explore the greatest playground on earth- the outdoors.As part of the campaign a survey asked 200 children, between the ages of four to eight-years-old, to identify some of the creepy crawlies in Britain.The survey revealed that nine out of 10 children were unable to recognise a butterfly even though there is an abundance of native British insects, with around 27,000 insect species calling the UK home.Moreover, 51 per cent did not know what a Bumblebee looks like.

Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

He added: \u0026ldquoIt was never thought by people supporting it that it was a magic answer to all our speeding problems but a step in the right direction and people become accustomed to going at 20mph in the town.  \u0026ldquoThereby the safety of pedestrians \u0026ndash particularly children and elderly but people of any age \u0026ndash will be enhanced.  \u0026ldquoThat is the hope and hopefully people will observe it.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe order has been made and we are just awaiting the appropriate signage, which should be within the next month.  \u0026ldquoThe order will be for an 18-month period and is an experimental order.  If the order is deemed a success, steps will be taken to see the 20mph speed limit become a permanent fixture.  Feedback from members of the public could also help decide whether any roads become exempt from the 20mph speed limit in the future.  Currently there are no plans for traffic calming measures, such as speed humps or chicanes, on the streets affected by the new speed limit.  The 20mph speed limit starts to the west of Edinburgh Road\u0026rsquos junction with Shore Road and Beveridge Row.  To the east, it comes into force as drivers make their way along the A1087."},{"url":null,"title":"your-chance-to-apply-for-thousands-of-pounds-of-support-for-your-charity","story":"  Last year, donations totalling almost \u0026pound300,000 were made up and down the country on behalf of Newsquest Media Group, one of the UK\u0027s largest publishers and owners of the East Lothian Courier.  The Gannett Foundation UK, which makes the grants, has given more than \u0026pound3 million to help charitable community causes all over Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland in the last 10 years.  One of the successful applicants last year was Lothian Autistic Society, which received \u0026pound5,000 for its East Lothian Basecamp service. This service supports children, aged 5-13, with autism and helps them develop social communication and social interaction skills through structured themed group and play sessions.  The foundation supports charities with projects which take a creative approach to fundamental issues such as education and neighbourhood improvements, economic development, youth development, local problem-solving, assistance to the disadvantaged or disabled, environmental conservation and cultural enrichment.  And it values projects that bring lasting benefits to local communities.  A spokesman said: \"While preference may be given to ideas which create a durable legacy for the community, judges will consider single events or projects of limited duration that otherwise meet the criteria.\"  Typically grants are made for substantial projects which require and merit awards of between \u0026pound5,000 and \u0026pound10,000, although applications can be for any size of grant and level of ambition.  The foundation will join with other contributors to support elements of larger projects, but prefers to be in a position of making a donation which will fund a project in its entirely or which constitutes the final instalment to complete a project.

The findings come at the same time as overall employment in the county has increased slightly.  Figures show that the number of people in either part-time or full-time employment in East Lothian rose to 78.6 per cent between April 2017 and March 2018, an increase of 3.6 per cent from the previous year, when the rate was at 75 per cent.  Councillor Brian Small, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoObviously the fact that 4,000 households are without work is worrying.  \u0026ldquoWork isn\u0026rsquot only important for the financial benefits to those in employment, it also generates health and social benefits for them.  \u0026ldquoHaving something to get up in the morning for is good for you.  \u0026ldquoBut we have to welcome that East Lothian is better than both the UK and Scottish average but there is still more that can and should be done to get people back into work.  Peter Dicker of East Lothian Foodbank, based in Tranent, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the statistics for the increase in the population in work is encouraging, the foodbank can only comment on the fact that over the same period that the statistics were compiled for April 2017 to March 2018 we here at East Lothian Foodbank experienced a 12 per cent increase on the number of referrals we had sent to us \u0026ndash this 12 per cent compares to a national average of a 13 per cent increase on referrals .  \u0026ldquoSince the introduction of Universal Credit in April 2016 we have seen an increase in people being referred to us by over 45 per cent .  The figures from the ONS estimate that last year 14 per cent of households in East Lothian were workless, lower than the Scotland-wide average of 18 per cent.  County MP Martin Whitfield said: \u0026ldquoClearly the increase in the local employment rate over the last year is welcome. However, the fact there are still many people out of work remains a concern. It underlines the complacency of the UK Government, which is simply not doing enough to help people into work.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, through its East Lothian Works employability service, is doing a good job supporting jobseekers, but both the UK and Scottish Governments must do more to enhance prosperity and create new jobs.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray added: \u0026ldquoI welcome the fact that East Lothian\u0026rsquos employment rate is higher than the Scottish average. However, too many local people are still not in work. We need a fundamental shift in how we grow our economy.  \u0026ldquoWe also need to ensure opportunities for creating these kind of jobs locally are maximised at the former Cockenzie Power Station site and the new innovation park at QMU.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoUnemployment figures in East Lothian are following a positive trend as there are over three per cent more people in employment now compared to last year.  \u0026ldquoThe council continues to strive to grow East Lothian\u0026rsquos economy and to make it the best place in Scotland to live, work and do business and we would very much hope our employment figures will continue to rise year-on-year as a result of this work.  \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to comment in detail on the figure of 4,000 households being classed as out of work as it\u0026rsquos unclear, as yet, exactly how this figure has been calculated.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to note that the roll-out of full service Universal Credit in East Lothian has had an effect on the recording of our out-of-work levels so this too needs to be looked at more closely.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Works continues to support people of all ages and abilities to gain skills, re-train and undertake courses and work experience to get them back into rewarding employment, working closely with employers and education providers. There are also many initiatives to support the most vulnerable in our society, including those living in poverty, including projects initiated by our area partnerships designed to meet the needs of our very different communities across East Lothian.  Across Scotland, the most common reason people gave for not being in work was being sick or disabled \u0026ndash 37 per cent of out-of-work individuals cited illness or disability as the primary reason.  Students made up 13 per cent of the group, and 18 per cent were early retirees, with 10 per cent of jobless people in the area officially \u0026lsquounemployed\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash looking for work and able to start within two weeks.  A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions  said: \u0026ldquoSince 2010 the proportion of workless households is down in every region of Great Britain.  \u0026ldquoThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest since 1971, but we\u0026rsquore committed to ensuring that everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so \u0026ndash while making sure there is a safety net for those who can\u0026rsquot.  The DWP has also said that the majority of employment growth has been in both full-time and permanent roles.  David Leese, policy analysis manager at charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said that workless families in particular were at a much higher risk of poverty.  Figures from the DWP for 2016-17 show that in workless households nearly 75 per cent of children were growing up in poverty, compared to only five per cent of children with two working parents.  \u0026ldquoIf a child lives in poverty, it affects their health, their education, their family relationships and their plans for the future, Mr Leese said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not right that any child lives in such insecure circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-courier-pet-idol-see-the-top-50","story":"  Pictured here are all the 50 pets still in the running.

Among the East Lothian pubs to have permanently closed during this period are the Elphinstone Arms in Elphinstone The Hub in Tranent the Bay Horse in Haddington and The Hayweights, Burgh and Mrs Forman\u0026rsquos in Musselburgh.  The figures from the Office for National Statistics  show that in 2010 there were about 55 pubs and bars in East Lothian but by 2017 that had fallen to about 45.  Michael Peters, who is behind The New Pheasant in Haddington \u0026ndash which opened this week at the site of the former Pheasant, which shut in 2009 \u0026ndash was not surprised by the figures.  He said that there were a iety of reasons for the decline in the number of pubs, including the lowering of the drink-drive limit in Scotland in 2014, issues with breweries, and the state of the economy.  Mr Peters felt that there was a real need for pubs in towns and villages and said: \u0026ldquoI am not biased but every town needs a pub.  \u0026ldquoIt is not just for drinking but socialising and the community \u0026ndash nothing would be happening. Most things that happen \u0026ndash golf trips, football, anything like that \u0026ndash it is organised when you are in the pub.  \u0026ldquoWhere do most people socialise?  Across the UK, 5,745 pubs closed over the same period, and there are 54 local authorities across the country where 30 or more shut.  Pubs have been pointing the finger of blame at the taxman for their troubles, complaining about the duty on beer, VAT levels and the cost of business rates.  Britain\u0026rsquos Beer Alliance, a group of organisations in the pub and brewing sector, has started a campaign called Long Live the Local with a petition and calls for people to write to their MP to have beer duty reduced.  The latest data from the ONS shows that between 2016 and 2017, 655 pubs and bars across the UK called time for the last time.  In East Lothian there was a slight upturn in that period, with numbers up by about five.  A change in consumer habits, with people drinking at home more often, has been blamed for fewer people visiting pubs.  There are 21 areas of the country that have bucked the decline and have more pubs now than they had in 2010. Top of the list is Hackney in East London, which had 55 more bars in 2017 than it did in 2010."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-mermaids-magic-storm","story":"  AFTER our return from a final camping trip in the midges and mist, my youngest daughter started school. She needed an early-morning shower to remove the lingering smell of wood smoke in her hair this morning before getting ready.  She protested a bit, as she said she liked the smell of wood smoke because it reminded her of camping in the Highlands. But soon she was all excited to be dressed up, smart and clean for school. She is attending Prestonpans Infant School, as her big sister did before her, and as I did when it was the primary school.  She looked so smart and business-like as she walked into class with a beaming smile. We shared this moment with many other parents, who were taking the same photos and shedding similar tears. Only the day before, Skye had climbed the side of a mountain in Glencoe as if she had once been a mountain goat and proclaimed she wanted to live by a waterfall.  Now, all dressed to conform , she has entered a formal system which in my day did its best to  beat out any original creativity that didn\u0026rsquot fit in with teachers\u0026rsquo expectations.  But as our daughter walked through the same doors I had once gone through, I was uplifted by a hopeful expectation that when we come to pick her up she will be less smart, less clean and her hair even wilder. That\u0026rsquos what school should be like for a wee girl not yet reached five. And I know she is in good hands in that respect at Prestonpans Infants.  But as I kissed her goodbye this morning, she asked: \u0026ldquoCan we have tea by a campfire in the woods? The campfire had been the communal focus during our camping trip. As darkness fell, the spirit of the fire glowed brighter and danced with our imaginations as we told stories and riddles with each other. I of course agreed, but her comment helped me think of which tale to tell this week.  Much of our summer has been spent exploring the wonders of East Lothian. We explored beaches and caves. We climbed hills and moors. We swam and paddled in rivers, climbed trees and sat under them having picnics.  But wherever we went there was one thing that we always saw, even in quite remote places: litter. Sometimes there was more, sometimes there was less, but we couldn\u0026rsquot escape it. My children notice it I suppose because I mention it. Our children pick up other people\u0026rsquos litter as we walk, so we now need an extra rucksack to carry it.  \u0026ldquoWhy do people do this? asked my nine-year-old after she had watched a family sitting in a car in a car park by a beach. They had been eating sandwiches and drinking juice, and then threw all the packaging out of the windows. The plastic juice bottles rolled about in the breeze and the sandwich packaging blew away and got caught in some sea buckthorn bushes nearby. The family then drove away, no doubt having had a nice day at the beach, but leaving their rubbish for others to enjoy.  I make no apologies for sounding angry at this. And I do not blame the children, it\u0026rsquos the adults who frame this behaviour. I understand people want to keep their cars tidy but I couldn\u0026rsquot answer my daughter\u0026rsquos question as we sat watching someone else\u0026rsquos rubbish desecrate a beauty spot. I just can\u0026rsquot understand the mindset. So all I said was: \u0026ldquoWell they just don\u0026rsquot know any better I suppose, or maybe just don\u0026rsquot care.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos so sad, she replied, then went very quiet. Then she came up with an answer to the problem: a story:  \u0026lsquoThe king of the sea told all the mermaids not to go close to the shore because of the dangerous litter that humans pollute it with. One mermaid asked what litter was and the king replied it was many things, such as broken glass and plastic which kills sea creatures, as well as making the place humans live look ugly.  \u0026ldquoWhy do they do this? asked the mermaid. The king shrugged his shoulders, and said: \u0026ldquoThey must be less clever than the animals they kill.  But one day the mermaid disobeyed her king and swam to the shore close to the beach at North Berwick. But her tail was cut by broken glass and then she got caught in plastic bags floating on the surface. She was in trouble and a fisherman saw her.  He helped her remove the bags and gave her cream for her cut tail.  \u0026ldquoWhy do you people do this? she asked him. He felt ashamed because he also would throw litter. He promised her he would never do it again. But there was so much rubbish in the sea that they agreed they would try and collect it.  So the mermaid gathered her friends and collected the rubbish. The fisherman\u0026rsquos boat was soon so full that it nearly sank, and when he returned to the harbour people saw the mountain of rubbish he had caught. They laughed at him, thinking he was not a good fisherman because all he had caught was litter and rubbish.  \u0026ldquoLook, said the fisherman, \u0026ldquothis is what we are doing to the sea and the land. Why do we do this? But nobody cared.  \u0026ldquoThis is impossible, we can\u0026rsquot collect all of it, said the mermaid, \u0026ldquoand every day the wind blows more into the sea.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hopeless, people will never change, said the fisherman. But the mermaid was angry: \u0026ldquoThey must change or else we will all die, including them too eventually.  Mermaids have powers to control the wind. They can whip up storms and so she decided she would make a very unusual, magic storm.  The wind blew not everywhere but where the litter lay. It blew all the rubbish thrown by the humans back into their houses and cars. People woke up with broken glass in their beds and plastic bags covering their children. Their homes were piled high with dangerous and ugly rubbish. When they tried to get rid of it, it just blew back in.  The countryside and sea became wonderfully litter free because of this magic storm, and when people littered the storm whipped up again and blew it straight into their house or car. They couldn\u0026rsquot escape from it. People were living knee-deep in the rubbish they had thrown out of windows or not recycled.  So soon they stopped littering because now they understood what it meant for the other creatures. Finally they cared, because they were the ones who suffered most. At last they got the wisdom of the animals.\u0026rsquo  This story, I think, would make the perfect start to any school day."},{"url":null,"title":"new-world-record-set-at-haddington-rugby-club","story":"  A total of 458 men, women and children took to the pitch at Neilson Park on Sunday as part of the Haddington 700 celebrations.

He said: \u0026ldquoThe day was a fantastic occasion despite the worst day of weather all summer, and we were delighted by the huge effort and support from the club and the rugby and local communities in getting past the record.  \u0026ldquoAs a celebration of the town\u0026rsquos 700 years of the Royal Charter it was a great success, with the match kicked off by Provost John McMillan, and great support from the town, with particular thanks to the boys\u0026rsquo football team who arrived late on, like the cavalry, to help get us over the line.  \u0026ldquoMore than that, though, it was brilliant to see players [aged] from five to 73 enjoying our great game, with several cases of three generations from the same family playing at the same time, including one connected family group of 18.  \u0026ldquoThis is the power of rugby. We look forward to seeing many of our record-breakers back at the club in the near future.  \u0026ldquoWe would also like to thank the Royal Bank of Scotland, sponsors of RugbyForce day of which we were one of two top prize winners, without whose support the event would not have been possible \u0026ndash in particular their many staff, including a good number from the local branch who helped massively on the day.  The match between Haddington President\u0026rsquos XV and Haddington Barbarians XV was kicked off by Provost John McMillan.  The councillor, who previously played for Murrayfield 3rds, said: \u0026ldquoIt was a real honour. I have not played rugby for well over 40 years and it was an amazing day, with a great turnout.  \u0026ldquoIt was very well-organised, despite the horrific weather. It was a great community thing and I was impressed how many people were there \u0026ndash men, women and children of all ages.  \u0026ldquoIt was a great tribute to the club but also the community.

Haddington RFC will also use the prize money to contribute towards a recruitment drive to increase playing numbers at all levels and fund community engagement projects.  Haddington RFC\u0026rsquos charity partner Wooden Spoon were also in attendance on the day.  Mr Wallace, who took part in the early stages of the mammoth six-hour match, thanked current Scotland internationalists Stuart McInally, Willem Nel and Sarah Law while there was also an appearance from ex-Lions and Scotland forward Finlay Calder, who grew up in Haddington.

Ms Cook, who lives in the county, previously worked in Edinburgh at a number of schools, including Drummond Community High School, Leith Academy and Tynecastle Academy.  The teacher, who has a background in physical education, started on Monday.  Two in-service days gave her the chance to meet the staff before pupils arrived.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.

Mother Nature has been kind and the pipe is, by and large, under sand once again \u0026ndash though there are concerns it is likely to be exposed again in future if a permanent solution is not found.  As well as being an eyesore at a popular tourist spot, sand and rocks collect around the pipe and are then blasted by the tide at the sea wall, causing it damage.  The town\u0026rsquos community council has long voiced concerns over the issue and claims houses overlooking the iconic West Beach are \u0026ldquoin danger.  North Berwick Community Council  contacted Scottish Water over the issue and the company\u0026rsquos response was read out at a NBCC meeting last week.  A letter from Brian Lironi, director of corporate affairs, said: \u0026ldquoWe are not able to re-lay this section of pipe. However, following an inspection of it, we plan to carry out some work on the casing around the laterals and raised manhole columns.  \u0026ldquoThis work will take place outside of the bathing season when the laterals are more exposed and the beach is less busy. This should help to improve the aesthetic of the pipe.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoOn the point of erosion, we do not believe our pipe is to blame for this. With that said, I am asking for this to be looked at in more detail as it is important that we take an evidence-led approach. This will not happen during the bathing season.  Mr Lironi said the community council would be kept informed of any developments.  Spring 2018 was not the first time that severe weather saw the sewage pipe badly exposed. The pipe was clearly visible in the aftermath of storms in December 2010 and it took many, many months before the tides re-covered it with sand."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  HADDINGTON...

Plans lodged with East Lothian Council are split into two.  The design and access statement states: \u0026ldquoThe brief is twofold: to diversify the core business on the site with the introduction of small-scale gin and whisky distillation to enable the production of speciality spirits for sale within the business pub chain.  \u0026ldquoSecondly, in light of the increasing demand for both brewery tours and the use of the Monk\u0026rsquos Retreat as a function venue, it is felt that the facilities require being upgraded, both in terms of general amenity, improving the visitor experience and to provide for the disabled visitor with the addition of a platform lift and accessible toilet.  A spokeswoman for owners Greene King explained why they were looking to diversify at the site, on Belhaven\u0026rsquos Brewery Lane.  She said: \u0026ldquoLike any business we are always exploring options to develop our business and facilities. The recent planning application is just one of many opportunities we are considering but no decision has been made yet about whether it is an option we will pursue if planning permission is granted.  In terms of the production of gin and whisky, a still house would be created.  According to the design and access statement: \u0026ldquoThe distillery will be designed to produce 250 litres of spirit a day. It will be unique in the marketplace, making spirit from the same wurt as the beer.  \u0026ldquoThe spirit will be a mixture of Scotch whisky, gin and rum.  \u0026ldquoThis volume and complexity will mean that the brewery will need to employ an additional person to run the distillery.  \u0026ldquoIn time the site would like to re-instate a historical greenhouse within the gardens in order to grow their own botanicals to add to the gin however, this will be part of a separate application.  The new still house would mirror the mash house, which was given planning permission in January 2011, in terms of its look.  It is two storeys, with a more modern design than some of the historic buildings on-site.  If the plans were given the green light, work would also be carried out at the main building on the Belhaven site.  A museum is already in place on the ground floor of the main building, with a pub on the first floor.  Plans show a refurbishment of both floors as \u0026ldquothe existing interiors are now tired and dated and in need of a revamp.  The application, which could go before members of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee later this year, adds: \u0026ldquoConsidering the site\u0026rsquos historic importance both locally and within Scotland, it is clear that any development both internally and externally requires to be sensitive.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to recognise the value of this development in terms of the improved visitor experience, which will impact visitor numbers to the area as a whole, and the business diversification."},{"url":null,"title":"avid-lynyrd-skynyrd-fan-pens-foreword-to-new-book-about-his-idols","story":"  Iain Monk has contributed to The Gospel According to Abraham by Paul Abraham, who was the American band\u0026rsquos road manager for a decade.  The new book is full of stories about the band, best known for hits such as Sweet Home Alabama and Free Bird.  Iain said: \u0026ldquoI became an instant fan of the band in the 1970s and was instantaneously hooked by the music, that kind of southern rock music.  \u0026ldquoMy obsession for the band just grew from there but the first time I saw them live was in 1988 in New York when I flew over to see them.  \u0026ldquoI had written to the band\u0026rsquos management to see if they could help me with tickets and I think they were impressed that I was coming from Scotland to see the band.  \u0026ldquoThat relationship grew with management, road crew and members of the band and I started following them across America.  Iain, who lives in Gullane, has spent countless hours travelling across the globe to see his idols perform at 31 shows, ranging from New York, Boston and Washington to Belgium, the Netherlands and all across the UK.  His friendship with band members and those associated with the band has even seen him spend a week at the family home of Randall Hall, who was the band\u0026rsquos guitarist, in Florida. A friendship also grew with Paul Abraham, with Iain interviewing the road manager for his Lynyrd Skynyrd blog about his intention to write a book.  Iain said the band, which was formed in 1969 and continued following the tragic death of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant in 1977, were \u0026ldquoamazing live but also \u0026ldquolovely people.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are down to earth, very friendly people in my experience and the people that formed the band are very approachable.  \u0026ldquoI have been very, very fortunate that I have been given access to the band over the years.  \u0026ldquoThat is something most fans would simply not get and I think that is down to trust and trusting me not to take advantage of their generosity.  The 55-year-old was delighted to be asked to write the foreword for the book, which is now available online.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis memoir provides a ringside seat, it is an intriguing glimpse into Skynyrd\u0026rsquos world. Fans will feel more than satisfied. Paul had a lot to get of his chest. The book offers up more explosive revelations than a Donald Trump press conference.  \u0026ldquoOver the many years I followed Skynyrd on tour, I was treated like royalty by the band. That was all down to Paul so I was delighted to contribute to his fascinating book."},{"url":null,"title":"teenage-tranent-judokas-shock-visit-from-love-island-star","story":"  Hannah Wood was stunned when Jack Fowler, one of the stars of the hit ITV2 dating show Love Island, walked through her door on Sunday.  Hannah\u0026rsquos world had come crashing down when she tore her ACL last April while fighting in a competition in Berlin, leaving her facing a summer on crutches.  Having binge-watched Love Island while off her feet, the 16-year-old Ross High School pupil was starstruck when Jack \u0026ndash who was already in Tranent to visit family \u0026ndash appeared at her Church Street home to wish her well.  \u0026ldquoIt was mental, Hannah told the Courier.  \u0026ldquoHe was in Tranent and my little sister [Sophie, 12] had messaged him, and I didn\u0026rsquot know.  \u0026ldquoShe told him I\u0026rsquod had surgery and was being really moody! He said he\u0026rsquod be down soon and the next minute he was at the door!  The 22-year-old came sixth with partner Laura Crane on this year\u0026rsquos season of Love Island. Having only entered the show\u0026rsquos Majorcan villa in the fourth week, he proved an immediate hit with viewers.  \u0026ldquoHe was always my favourite, said Hannah.  \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos just dead nice. He has family up here so he was up visiting them.  \u0026ldquoHe stayed for about 20 minutes. He plays sport too, so he was asking about my injury and about judo.  \u0026ldquoI just asked him about Love Island, and what life was like after the villa.  \u0026ldquoHe said that he had a gut feeling he was going to leave, and that they all shared clothes and had a laugh. He said they\u0026rsquore all best friends after the villa.  But what did Hannah\u0026rsquos mum think when a 6ft 3ins-tall personal trainer from London walked in her door?  \u0026ldquoSophie told her before me but I still think she was a bit confused, Hannah laughed.  After posting news of her surprise house guest online, Hannah said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove gained 4,000 followers on Instagram and had loads of people messaging me wishing me well. My friends all said they should\u0026rsquove come round to see me!  Jack\u0026rsquos visit certainly lifted Hannah\u0026rsquos spirits as she now faces another agonising four to six months off the mat through injury.  \u0026ldquoI just fell awkwardly, she said.  \u0026ldquoI actually carried on which probably wasn\u0026rsquot a good idea, and then I got withdrawn from the European Championships.  \u0026ldquoIt was my first big selection which is why I was in denial about being injured.  Even with this bump in the road, Hannah is adamant to make it to the top.  \u0026ldquoI got into [judo] when I was five through my friends doing it, she said.  \u0026ldquoWhen I was about 12 I started doing competitions and this year I\u0026rsquove been travelling loads.  \u0026ldquoI went to Japan for a six-week training programme and trained full-time with the Japanese kids.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance. It is important that the local community has its say and we look forward to engaging with this process."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-when-haddington-was-underwater","story":"  John Hamilton of the Facebook page Lost Haddington got in touch with the Courier to highlight how the floods of 1948 would look in present-day Haddington.  He said: \u0026ldquoUsing the flood mark in the video-still as a reference, I got a friend who has access to a theodolite to use this and project this water level to other landmarks around the river and town centre.  \u0026ldquoRobert Byers from Haddington Camera Club then used his photo editing skills and a photoshop \u0026lsquoflood\u0026rsquo plug-in to reconstruct the photos.  In August 1948, persistent heavy rainfall saw the county face its most serious flooding in history.  Although much of East Lothian was affected, Haddington took a major hit. High Street as far west as the Town House was under several feet of water which stretched to the gates of Amisfield Park, a distance of more than half a mile.  Distillery Park, the Nungate, Peffers Place and Brewery Park were similarly devastated.  The Biel Burn also flooded, submerging all the low-lying land north and west of West Barns.  The flood occurred as the culmination of a period of truly exceptional rainfall \u0026ndash 122 mm of rain fell between August 1 and 8, followed by 153 mm in the next five days.  The saturated ground then received a huge 139 mm of rain in the next 24 hours, bringing severe flooding across the county.  The Haddingtonshire Courier reported on \u0026ldquodisastrous flooding without parallel in living memory \u0026ndash if not in history.  In the August 20, 1948 edition of the Courier, \u0026ldquoserious damage was inflicted on the banks of the River Tyne while other streams burst their banks and \u0026ldquoleft destruction in their wake.  It added: \u0026ldquoSo heavy was the flood of water that the streams made courses for themselves, with the result that many people were flooded out of house and home.  \u0026ldquoOne of the worst areas to suffer was Haddington, where a large number of people were rendered homeless, while shops and business premises were flooded to a depth of several feet.  Meanwhile at West Barns, the Biel Burn overflowed, causing serious damage to houses and shops in the village but fortunately \u0026ldquono loss of life is reported, although some people had narrow escapes, so suddenly did the water levels rise.  The floods also caused serious damage to crops on farms close to the Tyne and extensive damage was also caused to the now-demolished New County Cinema on Hardgate.  Nungate residents who had been enjoying the evening\u0026rsquos film were instructed by cinema management to return home to avoid being cut off as water levels rapidly rose.  And slightly further afield, the electricity supply in Gifford and Saltoun was interrupted, and at the Maltings in Haddington the sub-station was completely swept away. It was anticipated it would take many months for the affected areas to return to normal, and calls for assistance to help with the recovery were issued."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-commodore-of-haddington","story":"  TEENAGERS often get a bad press. To be sure, it\u0026rsquos a time when parents wonder what has happened to their children and feel they have lost them or gone wrong somewhere. This is because teenage years are a time of great change in terms of brain development. Quite literally the teenage brain is being remodelled and new priorities and emotions are created as a result.  It\u0026rsquos a time when peers and their approval become more important than parents or family, or almost anything else. Taking risks, or doing seemingly foolish things, are all part of this. We are familiar with the term \u0026lsquopeer pressure\u0026rsquo, but in our teenage years, approval by our peers and being included by them takes on a massive importance. It is an essential part of growing up and creating a new self-identity.  And a story from over 200 years ago shows that although the word teenager may not have been invented, and that there was no such thing as \u0026lsquoyouth culture\u0026rsquo as we now know it, behaviour was much the same.  It involves a group of young men who we would now call teenagers. They were a group of friends from Haddington. They included George Neill, John and William Haldane who were brothers, Peter Martine, Benjie Hunter and John Davie, whose nickname was \u0026lsquoLettie\u0026rsquo. They were all from Haddington, and their escapade became a story told well into their senior years. The nickname \u0026lsquoCommodore\u0026rsquo was coined for George on this day and stayed with him until he took it to his grave many years later.  Much of the tale is left to the imagination but the essentials were well told. One of the group came up with the idea of hiring a boat and heading out to Fife. These young men were not from poor backgrounds and so had the means to do this. So with the madcap plan devised, they set off as a group to the fishing village of Prestonpans.  The negotiations to hire a boat were concluded and they set off for the foreign shore of Fife, aiming for the town of Kirkcaldy. I cannot comment on their sailing abilities but they must have had some experience for they successfully navigated themselves to the shore of the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo, possibly using the Lomond hills as a marker.  They came ashore like invading Vikings, intent on mischief. No social media in those days, but each town had a drummer who would disseminate news. And so they found Kirkcaldy\u0026rsquos drummer and paid him to announce to the town that at three in the afternoon there would be a spectacular diving and swimming show at the harbour entrance. The drummer set forth announcing the news, creating an air of expectation.  The group chose Lettie to be the performer. He was the best swimmer amongst them. As 3 o\u0026rsquoclock approached, a large excited crowd assembled on the harbour walls. The Haddington lads looked at each other with wry smiles and secret sniggers. Their ruse had worked, perhaps too successfully.  \u0026ldquoShow them what ye can dae, Lettie was told by his friends. And so Lettie stood on the edge of the boat and dived into the sea, from a height of about two feet. The crowd was silent, except for a wee five-year-old girl who clapped. She was the only one impressed by the spectacle.  There were murmurings as the Kirkcaldy folk began to realise they had been duped and were being made a fool of by these young Haddington lads. The mood began to get angry, and boos were followed by threats and words I cannot print here. It was clear it was time to go.  \u0026ldquoThank ye, the lads said, bowing to the crowd and laughing, mocking them for being so gullible. Stones began to fly towards them as they set off back towards Prestonpans, gesturing to the now-furious crowd. The lads in the boat were hysterical with laughter. They had raided and fooled the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo.  But then their laughter stopped. Emerging from the harbour was a boat filled with angry Kirkcaldy lads who were shouting serious threats. The prank looked as if it might end unpleasantly so the Haddington lads had no choice but to row for their lives.  George took command. His friends had nicknamed him the Commodore at the beginning of their voyage, not so much because of his nautical skills but because of his leadership qualities. They were now desperately needed.  \u0026ldquoRow lads, row, he called on them. To be truthful the Haddington lads were at a disadvantage. They were not skilled seamen and in truth they were more bookish than brawn. But fear can do mighty things to a man\u0026rsquos capabilities, and as the adrenaline pumped through their veins they found levels of strength they didn\u0026rsquot know they had. They rowed like true Vikings, heave ho, heave ho. The sea splashed at their feet, their hearts nearly burst, but they kept the pace.  Slowly they began to pull ahead from the Kirkcaldy boat. \u0026ldquoKeep rowing, lads, dinnae look back, dinnae slow doon, called George, who was himself rowing as hard as he could. The tide was strong, the night was drawing in and the weather was beginning to change. The Kirkcaldy boat turned back, but the Haddington lads dare not attempt a Fife landing. They had no choice but to cross the Firth.  Darkness fell, then a thick haar covered them in freezing mist. They rowed through the night not sure in which direction they were headed. They wondered if their parents would ever know what had happened to them if, as now seemed likely, they were lost at sea.  The morning sun slowly burned off the mist. Thankfully they were still in the Firth, and there in front of them was the smoke coming from the lums and salt works of Prestonpans. They wept with relief and summoned up their last drops of energy to row ashore. Their final few hundred metres to the stony beach was watched by village children and women drying clothes.  Some fishermen helped pull the boat to land and the Haddington lads literally collapsed out of the vessel onto the beach, utterly exhausted but elated to be still alive.  George Neill was later to become a well-respected Baillie in Haddington, a bookseller and publisher of great local repute. He outlived his friends who had shared that day of adventure and danger.  He was often asked by those who knew him less well: \u0026ldquoWhy do people call you the Commodore? He never tired of telling the tale of his teenage adventure."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-secondary-schools-delighted-with-pupils-exam-results","story":"  This year saw the best pass rate in Higher exams across East Lothian for five years.

His counterpart at Preston Lodge High School, Gavin Clark, also gave his thoughts.  At PL, four S5 pupils achieved six As at Higher, although the number of pupils gaining one, two, three or four Highers dropped from the last set of results.  Mr Clark added: \u0026ldquoWe expected that to happen, as a result of our regular tracking process.  \u0026ldquoThis dip in no way diminishes the achievements of those who performed so impressively in examinations.  At Knox Academy, new headteacher Susan Cook gave an update on how the school was performing.  She said: \u0026ldquoSeventy-four per cent of S4 pupils attained five or more qualifications at National 3 69 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 4 and 47 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 5 at grades A-C and 55 per cent at grades A-D.  \u0026ldquoThere were some outstanding individual performances in S4, with eight of our candidates achieving seven A passes at N5.  \u0026ldquoThese results are a really strong foundation to build S5 performance upon and I would encourage all parents/carers to continue to support their child to study at home as the transition from S4 to S5 in terms of challenge and pace moves up a few gears and much more study is required, especially at Higher level.  Meanwhile, the performance of S5 pupils in their Higher exams was down on the previous three years.  Ms Cook added: \u0026ldquoFifty-five per cent attained one or more Highers 35 per cent three or more and 16 per cent attained five or more Highers.  \u0026ldquoTwenty-two of our pupils achieved five Highers and some with straights As across all subjects.  \u0026ldquoMany other pupils achieved a mixture of Higher and National 5 awards and will build upon these in their sixth year.  Finally, there was \u0026ldquoan improving trend for S6 pupils over the last four years at Higher level, Ms Cook added.  The headteacher said: \u0026ldquoThose attaining one or more Highers was 62 per cent and then added to their results from S4 and S5  this rose to 76.22 per cent having achieved one or more Highers over S5/S6 \u0026ndash one per cent lower than last year, which in terms of statistics is not significant. However, it\u0026rsquos more than 13 per cent more than pupils attained in 2015 and 2016.  \u0026ldquoThirty per cent of the year group attained three or more Highers and the accumulate total was 66 per cent .  Finally, Claire Slowther, headteacher at Dunbar Grammar School, told the Courier that the staff at the school were \u0026ldquovery pleased with the exam results and said: \u0026ldquoAt Dunbar Grammar we are very pleased with the SQA results our students have achieved.  \u0026ldquoIt is wonderful to see the hard work of our students be rewarded with great results.  \u0026ldquoOur excellent team of teachers always work hard to support and challenge students and we were all really delighted to see them do well.  \u0026ldquoWe are incredibly proud of the achievements of our students and are looking forward to celebrating these at our awards evening, which will be held on September 12."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-longniddry-south-to-go-on-display","story":"  Developers Cruden Homes  and ZeroC will be displaying their proposals for development at the Longniddry Inn on Wednesday from 3pm to 8pm.

The commercial and retail space is being delivered separately by Socially Conscious Capital, acting for landowner, Wemyss and March Estates.  Should permission be received, it is anticipated that construction could start on site early next year.  Fraser Lynes, land and development director for Cruden Homes , said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to have the opportunity to take forward the great work carried out by Socially Conscious Capital and Taylor Architecture.  \u0026ldquoOur involvement in this development confirms our commitment to the county and complements our other developments in North Berwick, Aberlady and Dirleton.  \u0026ldquoWe fully believe in the design principles which are embedded in the existing consent and look forward to delivering a truly bespoke product in one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos best locations.

That project came about following rising safety concerns from drivers who did not feel confident using the unlit road.  Since then, driver confidence has improved by 78 per cent, with the project, which was undertaken by UK-based Clearview Intelligence in partnership with Transport Scotland and Amey, shortlisted in the Road Safety, Traffic Management and Enforcement category at the National Transport Awards, which take place in October.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, a Dunbar ward councillor and deputy leader of East Lothian Council, as well as chairman of the A1 Action Group, was one of those hailing the project as a big success.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe installation of the studs has, in my view, revolutionised the driving experience on the A1 after dark.  \u0026ldquoThe studs have improved night-time visibility beyond all recognition along certain parts of the route.  Concerns about driving conditions on the unlit road were first raised by the A1 Action Group, which comprises councillors from Scottish Borders and East Lothian Councils, transportation groups and community councils.  Transport Scotland met with the action group and, upon investigating the road, recognised that entering or exiting the A1 during the hours of darkness was a key area of concern due to a lack of visibility, junction definition and consistency in signage and road markings.  Clearview Intelligence was then appointed by Amey to make improvements to the road as part of a wider project and installed the road studs to give a visual consistency to the route by ensuring all major junctions were visible and treated similarly.  This included using white, red, amber and green studs to effectively highlight road edges, the centre of the road and junctions.  Andy Salotti, director of solutions at Clearview Intelligence, said: \u0026ldquoWe are immensely proud of the work we did to improve the driving conditions on the A1 and delighted this has been recognised at a national level.

However, the tracksuit billionaire warned on Tuesday that \u0026ldquotime is running out for the remainder of the 59-store estate.  A spokesman for House of Fraser said: \u0026ldquoSome landlords are being very collaborative in order to give us a chance at turning the business around, giving House of Fraser a lifeline and saving hundreds of jobs.  \u0026ldquoHowever, some greedy landlords would rather see the stores close than help save the jobs of hundreds of people.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue to try and convince these landlords but ultimately time is running out.

The increase, signalling ongoing trend of expansion and setting the festival on course for 3m tickets in 2019, represents a rise of 5% on last years figure at the same time, and is reflected in successful ticket figures of the major venues throughout the city.  The Edinburgh International Book Festival also reported a rise in \"footfall\" in its Charlotte Square site, and an 8% rise in book sales.  However, the Edinburgh International Festival reported ticket sales of \u0026pound3.8m, down from the \u0026pound4.3m reported this time last year, due, it said, to a smaller programme, notably in the opera section.

The Light on the Shore concerts at Leith Theatre drew 16,000 people to the resurrected Leith venue.  Mr Linehan said it would be \"great to go back\", but depended on what the Leith Theatre Trust wanted to do with the venue, among other factors.  The four major venues at the Fringe: Underbelly, Gildred Balloon, Pleasance and Assembly, sold 1,658,437 tickets, an increase of 9%.  Shona McCarthy, the chief executive of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society, said: \"2018 has been another fantastic year for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.  \"Artists from around the world have flocked to Scotland\u0026rsquos capital, delighting audiences with work that is exciting, shocking, entertaining, world class and often, hilarious.  \"Whatever the medium, so many Fringe artists help us to question the world around us and illuminate the most challenging areas of being human in new ways.\"  Yesterday afternoon, with hundreds of performances still to take place, the Fringe estimated that 2,838,839 tickets had been issued.  Last year, the figure at the same time was 2,696,884, and marks a rise in 1m in seven years.  The ongoing expansion in size and success of the Fringe continues to prompt debate over how the city can cope with the festival.  The city council\u0027s leader, Adam McVey, wants to levy a visitor tax, or transient visitor levy  which could raise millions for the capital.  There has also been an ongoing debate about the pay and conditions of Fringe workers, led by the Fair Fringe campaign and the Unite union.  Major venues at the Fringe have reported successful 2018 seasons.  Summerhall, in its eighth year of being a Fringe venue, sold more tickets than in 2017, which itself was a record year.  Underbelly reported its strongest year yet for tickets sold, with 422,120 tickets sold across its 22 venues and four sites, compared to last year\u0027s 291,000: however, it had a larger capacity, with the return of the 900-seater McEwan Hall as a venue.

Nick Barley, director of the Edinburgh International Book Festival, said: \"It\u0026rsquos wonderful to know that the Festival has been so popular and has broken records again in all the ways these things are usually measured.  \"But I wish there was an index of enlightenment, or an exuberance-ometer to show how the Book Festival also contributes to Scotland\u0026rsquos knowledge, happiness and well-being.\"  Ms McCarthy said that the changes to the public performances on the Royal Mile, a change to this year\u0027s Fringe, had been a success.  She added: \"We are committed to breaking down barriers to attending the Fringe and through the Fringe Blueprint we will continue to work to address issues that affect participants and audiences at the festival, to ensure that no matter who you are or where you come from, you feel you can have a voice and be welcomed here in August.  Fergus Linehan, director of the Edinburgh International Festival, said: \"As the 2018 International Festival draws to a close, we thank the many artists, staff members and audiences whose enthusiasm and tireless generosity make the Festival possible.  \"We were grateful for the many young people who joined us from across the world to perform and participate in their thousands.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7616149.jpg?type=article-full","title":"historic-sites-to-offer-bespoke-gaelic-tours","story":"  But now Gaelic is undergoing something of a renaissance in Scotland with a fresh interest apparent in the country\u0027s songs, signposts and schools.  Gaelic medium education - where pupils are taught most or all of their lessons in Gaelic as well as studying English - has become increasingly popular in Scotland with more than 3,500 children taught this way in 2014.  And now a new front is to be opened in response to the public\u0027s appreciation of the language with visitors to the country\u0027s historic able to delve into its past and its links to the community.    Gaelic signs have been in use for many years  Heritage body Historic Environment Scotland  is seeking Gaelic-speaking volunteers, or those with an interest in the language, to take part in new programmes developing bespoke tours for tourists.  The guides would explore links between the sites and Gaelic culture and history, running alongside the more traditional information available, and would be available on request.  Dunstaffnage Castle near Oban and Arnol Blackhouse on the Isle of Lewis have been picked as the sites where the project will be piloted, while there will also be a new initiative at Urquhart Castle, near Inverness, which aims to engage visitors with Gaelic language and culture.  The developments are part of HES Gaelic Language Plan 2018-2023, which aims to stress the language and culture importance to Scotland\u0026rsquos historic environment.  Alex Paterson, Chief Executive of Historic Environment Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoGaelic is a distinct and unique part of Scotland\u0026rsquos history and culture which attracts visitors from all over the world, contributing significantly to Scotland\u0026rsquos economy.  \"Currently, there is Gaelic interpretation at 29 of our sites throughout the country, from Glasgow to Aberdeenshire and the Isle of Lewis, which shows the extent of Gaelic\u0026rsquos influence on Scotland\u0026rsquos heritage and its relevance to our historic environment.\"  He added: \u0026ldquoDue to an increase in volunteers, we are currently developing and expanding our wider volunteer programme.  \"These new opportunities at Dunstaffnage Castle and Arnol Blackhouse will help us continue to support volunteers across the country and empower communities and partners to engage with projects that promote the value of Gaelic culture to Scotland\u0026rsquos past and present.    A new Gaelic language dictionary has been launched  The Language Plan, the first five-year roadmap developed by HES, was drawn up after a after discussions with\u0026nbsp partner organisations, B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig and the public.\u0026nbsp More than 200 people shared their views during a three-month consultation.  It comes as the Scottish Government announced it will fund a new landmark Gaelic dictionary, to safeguard the future of the language.  The \u0026pound2.5 million project will document the language and its history by tracing the development of every Gaelic word from its earliest written form to the present day.  Dr Coinneach Maclean, Historic Environment Scotland Board Member, said: \u0026ldquoGaelic language and culture has shaped Scotland\u0026rsquos history and is an important aspect of our nation\u0026rsquos heritage.  \"Our Gaelic Language Plan demonstrates our commitment to maintaining and promoting Gaelic language and culture, and encourages future generations to explore Scotland\u0026rsquos Gaelic heritage and history.  \u0026ldquoWe hope to build on the success of Historic Scotland\u0026rsquos Gaelic Plan 2012 \u0026ndash 2017 where 4,000 school pupils and teachers benefited from our Gaelic learning programme and 45 Gaelic publications were published in Scotland.    The Arnol Blackhouse\u0026nbspis a traditional Lewis thatched house, fully furnished and\u0026nbspcomplete with an attached barn, byre and stackyard.  Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs Fiona Hyslop, said: \u0026ldquoGaelic is a fundamental part of Scotland\u0026rsquos cultural identity and history. This development for Gaelic speakers is another excellent example of Scotland\u0026rsquos public bodies and authorities being creative in supporting our rich Gaelic heritage, while meeting and delivering the key aims of the National Gaelic Language Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government welcomes the contribution HES is making to the promotion and use of Gaelic through its volunteer programme. The programme provides an excellent opportunity to add depth and knowledge to Scotland\u0026rsquos visitor experience, allowing locals and tourists alike to find out more about our precious Gaelic heritage.  \u0026ldquoExcellent progress has been made over the years with the learning of Gaelic and it is encouraging to see initiatives such as this one, where people of all ages can use and further develop their Gaelic skills in different contexts.  \"The Scottish Government is committed to further creating and preserving a secure future for Gaelic in Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"meet-the-mcbots-how-scottish-cyber-activists-try-to-game-twitter","story":"  For years experts have been tracking automated and semi-automated accounts which try to \u0026ldquogame the complex algorithms which determine what we all see on our Twitter or Facebook feeds.  Many have blamed these so-called \u0026lsquobots\u0026rsquo on Russia, either on private businesses or on its current government\u0026rsquos propaganda machine.  But specialists monitoring online conspiracy theories about Alex Salmond - and the allegations against him - have spotted a new online weapon: the McBot.  Scottish online activists appear to have set up automated or semi-automated accounts to retweet a hashtag #dissolvetheunion.  Ben Nimmo, an analyst for Nato-linked think tank the Atlantic Council, found 10,000 tweets using the hashtag from just over 2000 accounts in just a week. This level of hashtag use, he said, was double what you would expect in spontaneous traffic.  Mr Nimmo said: \u0026ldquoIt looks like there a deliberate attempt by a relatively small user group to make the hashtag trend. Some were bots, some looked like human users.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026lsquos no reason to suppose they were Russian: this looked like a local attempt to hijack the trends.  Accounts using the #dissolvetheunion last week were prominent in spreading clams or innuendo about the investigation in to the former first minister and current host on a Putin TV channel.  One tweeted: \u0026ldquoTo succeed in the British State the establishment will have dirt on you, that\u0026rsquos how they control you.  \u0026ldquoIf you\u0026rsquore a threat to the establishment they will trap you, failing that smear you. Whatever happens the State must win. #DissolveTheUnion.  Mr Nimmo, meanwhile, stressed Russian state broadcasting outlets had \u0026ldquojumped to Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos defence after allegations surfaced.  He said: \u0026ldquoRT and Sputnik both ran stories on his accusations against the Scottish government neither one bothered to include the government\u0026rsquos response. That\u0026rsquos not journalism.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos worth remembering that Salmond has his own show on RT, so this partly looks like the Russian outlets coming to the defence of one of their own.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos also worth remembering that Ofcom found the first episode of the Alex Salmond Show guilty of materially misleading the audience.  \u0026ldquoRT tweeted about this, but only got 19 retweets. It\u0026rsquos not likely that this will add to Salmond\u0026rsquos credibility. It\u0026rsquos more likely to harm it."},{"url":null,"title":"ancient-clan-artefact-uncovered-after-being-hidden-for-400-years","story":"  But a rare find during an excavation at Dunyvaig Castle on Islay has uncovered the seal of Sir John Campbell of Cawdor.  The artefact dates back to 1600s when the Campbell and MacDonald clans were locked in a violent and bitter feud over Scotland\u0026rsquos islands.  Buried below mounds of rubble, the find - described as \u0026ldquoremarkable and \u0026ldquoextremely rare by archaeologists and historians - was discovered on a hidden clay floor at the historic site.  Archaeologist Dr Darko Mari?evi?, director of the excavation at Dunyvaig, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a remarkable find. Not only is it a beautiful and well-preserved object, but it comes from the floor of a building that we can now confidently date to the Campbell occupation.  \u0026ldquoSo buried below this floor, we will have the story of the MacDonald\u0026rsquos \u0026ndash the Lords of the Isles \u0026ndash to reveal.  Roddy Regan, an archaeologist at Kilmartin Museum, added: \u0026ldquoSeals are extremely rare finds. This discovery conjures up an image of a Campbell garrison fleeing from the castle when under attack, dropping and losing one of their most precious items, or maybe the seal had once been hidden within a wall niche and long forgotten.  Once used to sign and seal charters and legal documents, the seal is a circular disc of lead which carries the inscription IOANNIS CAMPBELL DE CALDER .  It carries the Cawdor coat of arms with a galley ship and a stag and is dated 1593.  The Campbells and the MacDonald\u0026rsquos fought over Dunyvaig in the early 17th century, with a series of sieges and bombardments of the castle until the Campbells finally prevailed.  Sir John took ownership of Islay in 1615.  Mr Regan added that the seal could have been lost in a later raid in 1646 when Alasdair MacColla, a descendent of the MacDonalds, reclaimed the castle.  He said: \u0026ldquoAlasdair MacColla, a descendent of the MacDonalds, retook the castle and installed his elderly father, Colla Ciotach to defend it.  \u0026ldquoThe castle was immediately besieged again.  \u0026ldquoWe may have Colla Ciotach\u0026rsquos hasty defences in the form of turf walls built above the already ruined stone walls of Dunyvaig, before he was forced to surrender in 1647 and then hanged from the castle walls.  The excavation at Dunyvaig is being undertaken by charity Islay Heritage in partnership with the University of Reading.  A team of around 40 experts, including leading archaeologists, geophysicists, scientists and environmentalists, are almost at the end of an initial three-week dig at the castle, which sits in Lagavulin Bay, with further projects planned for next year.  Organisers were keen to use the excavation as a teaching project for current archaeology students and it was one such student, Zo\u0026euml Wiacek, from the University of Reading, who discovered the seal.  She said: \u0026ldquoI removed a piece of rubble and it was just sitting there on the ground. I immediately knew it was an important find, but had no idea what it was.  \u0026ldquoI called over my trench supervisor, and when it was lifted, the soil fell away to show the inscription. Then everyone became excited.  \u0026ldquoI am so proud to have found something so important for the project and for Islay.  Professor Steven Mithen, chairperson of Islay Heritage and director of the Dunyvaig Project added: \u0026ldquoComing towards the end of the dig, after the team had worked so hard to move huge amounts of turf and rubble, this has been a thrilling discovery.  \u0026ldquoWe have found a piece of Islay\u0026rsquos past and Scottish history. We can\u0026rsquot wait to start digging again in 2019.  Islay Heritage hope to raise further funds to allow excavation work to continue at Dunyvaig over the next five years."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-accused-of-humiliating-climbdown-over-plans-to-merge-railway-policing","story":"  Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf confirmed he will \u0026ldquore-examine all options\" as he seeks to devolve railway policing to Scotland.  It comes amid sustained calls for the Scottish Government to ditch its proposals to merge British Transport Police with Police Scotland.  The UK\u0026rsquos three largest rail unions previously urged the SNP to rethink, while the plans were branded an \u0026ldquoact of vandalism in the House of Lords.  Scottish Labour justice spokesman Daniel Johnson called on Scottish ministers to rule out a merger completely.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is a humiliating climbdown from the SNP, but it is the right approach to the future of our railways.  \u0026ldquoNow the government\u0026rsquos dogmatic approach, which has resulted in huge uncertainty for BTP officers and staff, must be stopped.\"  Scottish Liberal Democrat justice spokesman Liam McArthur said the merger had gone \u0026ldquohorribly wrong from day one.  He added: \"This politically-motivated merger is in turmoil, leaving BTP officers and staff in limbo. The Scottish Government\u0027s substandard planning and lack of business case has been thoroughly exposed.  Mr Yousaf said the Government remained committed to the full integration of railway policing into Police Scotland.  But he said there was a need to \u0026ldquoidentify interim arrangements after it emerged a catalogue of potential problems remain unresolved.  Papers released ahead of an upcoming board meeting of the Scottish Police Authority reveal a number of outstanding issues \u0026ndash including concerns around costs, pension liabilities and IT investment.  SNP ministers had hoped railway policing would be absorbed into the national force by April 2019, but this was pushed back indefinitely earlier this year.  Scotland\u0026rsquos new chief constable Iain Livingstone was among those to raise concerns.  Mr Yousaf said: \"Throughout this process we have been committed to listening to officers and staff.  \u0026ldquoAs part of that on-going approach I have decided that we will re-examine all options for the devolution of railway policing, with clear governance structures that ensure accountability to the Scottish Parliament.  \"The absolute priority for all those involved is the safety and security of officers, staff and those who use Scotland\u0027s railways.  \"I intend to update Parliament following summer recess.

Investigators working for the UN\u0027s top human rights body took the unusual step of identifying by name six military leaders behind what they called deadly, systematic crimes against the ethnic minority, and who should now face prosecution.  They also sharply criticised Myanmar\u0027s de facto leader, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, for failing to use her \u0026ldquomoral authority to intervene to stop the attacks.  Mr Hunt took to social media to respond to the UN report, tweeting: \"Deeply disturbing to read UN report on crimes against Rohingya people.  \"There must be never be a hiding place for those who commit these kind of atrocities. Have decided to visit Burma to seek answers at the earliest opportunity.\"  The three-member \"fact-finding mission\" and their team, working under a mandate from the UN-backed Human Rights Council, meticulously assembled hundreds of accounts from expatriate Rohingya, as well as satellite footage and other information to assemble the report.  They detailed crimes, including gang rape, the torching of hundreds of villages, enslavement, and the killings of children some in front of their parents.  The UN investigation was set up in March last year, nearly six months before a string of deadly rebel attacks on security and police posts set off a crackdown that drove Rohingya to flee into neighbouring Bangladesh.  It is estimated that some 10,000 people have been killed and more than 700,000 people have fled their homes in the last 12 months.  Chris Law for the SNP called on the UK Government to impose more sanctions on the Myanmar Government at present it has an arms embargo and has also imposed a ban on the supply of equipment, which could be used for internal repression.  \u0026ldquoThe UN report confirms our worst fears about the crisis in Rakhine State and the true extent of the horrors faced by the Rohingya at the hands of the Myanmar military, declared Mr Law, the party\u0026rsquos International Development spokesman.  \"It is vital that the UK Government now uses its role as a permanent member of the UN Security Council to push for senior military figures to be investigated for genocide and crimes against humanity and to work with international partners to ensure further sanctions against Myanmar.  Earlier this year, the Dundee West MP visited Cox\u0026rsquos Bazaar in Bangladesh, the world\u0026rsquos largest refugee camp, and has campaigned for the UK Government to end spending on training for the Myanmar military.  \"With the weight of evidence now available it is crucial that the international community presses for a full investigation of war crimes and genocidal acts and ensures those responsible are referred to the International Criminal Court[ICC], he added.  His Nationalist colleague Carol Monaghan has written to Mr Hunt also calling for those responsible for the Rohingya massacre to be brought to justice.  Describing what happened in Rakhine State as \u0026ldquoone of the worst atrocities of the 21st Century, the Glasgow North West MP said the ICC was the only real hope for victims to see justice.  \u0026ldquoThe UK Government, as a penholder at the UN Security Council, has the power and influence to help bring perpetrators to justice through the ICC.

The Brazilian midfielder was denied a work permit earlier this month by the Home Office much to the frustration of the Premier League side. Luiz was signed from Vasco de Gama last year for a fee of \u0026pound12m but was then loaned out to Girona.  The Spanish side are keen to taking Luiz back again this term while Benfica and Celtic have also been credited with an interest in the 20-year-old.  City need the player to go out on loan and current requirements from Scotland regarding a work permit are less stringent than in England. In 2015 English FA rules on work permits were changed to ensure only the most talented non-EU players met new criteria.  Meanwhile, Marseilles have watched the French under-21 internationalist in his last two Celtic outings with reports in Dembele\u0026rsquos homeland suggesting that the player would be keen on talking to the League 1 side.  The French side have been frustrated in the current window after losing out on Simone Zaza and Mario Balotelli.  Dembele is believed to have moved up on Marseilles list as the French side scramble to get more players in.  Celtic, though, are keen on supplementing their own squad ahead of Friday night\u0027s transfer deadline.  The Parkhead side have been linked with a loan move for Leicester defender Filip Benkovic who joined the Premier League side on a \u0026pound13m move from Dinamo Zagreb just a fortnight ago.  The 21-year-old defender is expected to make his debut for the club this evening in the Carabao Cup against Fleetwood. Whether Leicester would be prepared to allow him to leave on loan remains to be seen.  The Parkhead side have also scouted French under-21 internationalist Harold Moukoudi, who is available for around \u0026pound5m.  The defender is currently at Le Havre but is expected to leave the club before the end of the window with a number of clubs keeping tabs on the player.  Middlesbrough are understood to have watched the player while this summer there was interest in him from Seville, West Ham and Burnley.  Celtic are keen to add another defender before the closure of the window with Jozo Simunovic the latest player to be added to the injury list at the club.  It is understood that there has been no bid placed for Dedryck Boyata.  Celtic are reluctant to allow the Belgian defender to leave the club unless they can source an adequate replacement for him. Boyata returned to the team for Sunday\u0027s game against Hamilton where he scored the only goal of the game.  It is understood that there has been no second offer tabled for Aberdeen defender Scott McKenna with the Pittodrie side remaining insistent that the Scotland internationalist is not for sale."},{"url":null,"title":"major-push-to-get-labour-to-back-peoples-vote-on-brexit","story":"  Attempts are being made by the cross-party group to get MPs and activists to secure a motion on the issue at next month\u0026rsquos Labour Party conference.  A draft resolution states: \u0026ldquoIf the Government\u0027s proposed deal is unsatisfactory, then the people should be allowed to express their view in a public vote on Brexit. The Labour movement can then unite behind Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s determination to fight the Tories on a hard Brexit.\"  Tom Baldwin, the campaign\u0026rsquos communications chief, who was formerly Ed Miliband\u0026rsquos press aide when he was Labour leader, said the memo and draft resolution should not be seen as a bid to create a new centre party or an attempt to oust the Labour leader.  He made clear they \u0026ldquoaimed to move Labour to a \"sensible position, which reflects the position of the vast majority of Labour Party members and the vast majority of Labour Party voters\".  At present, Labour\u0026rsquos official policy is not to support a second referendum on the deal but there is a clear difference of opinion at the top of the party on the way forward were Theresa May\u0026rsquos final agreement with Brussels to be rejected by MPs.  In such a circumstance, John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, has said his preference would be to hold a general election while Sir Keir Starmer, the Shadow Braxit Secretary, has made clear all options should be on the table, including holding another referendum.  However, Barry Gardiner, the Shadow Trade Secretary, has argued that another poll would fly in the face of the democratic vote undertaken in 2016 and could lead to civil disobedience.  Indeed, at the weekend, the Scot reiterated his fears, saying a People\u0026rsquos Vote would be a \u0026ldquodangerous thing. The London MP told the BBC: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove seen the referendum create huge divides \u0026mdash real, crunching divides \u0026mdash in our country. A second referendum will not heal those divides it can only exacerbate them.  Recent polling commissioned by the People\u0027s Vote has suggested that voters targeted by Labour were more likely to back a new referendum - and to favour remaining in the EU - than the electorate as a whole.  Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, told a People\u0026rsquos Vote rally in Newcastle on Saturday that Labour support for a referendum on the final Brexit deal would be crucial if one were to be realised.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf the Labour Party change their position and the Scots Nats and smaller parties go along with it, you will only have the Tories against. If some of them shift, that\u0026rsquos it.  Crucially perhaps, this weekend the ruling body of the grassroots Corbyn-supporting Momentum will meet to consider a call for the group to back a Labour conference motion on holding a referendum on the final Brexit deal.  Meanwhile, the SNP leadership appears split on the merits of a second referendum on the final Brexit deal. Ian Blackford, the party\u0026rsquos Westminster leader, has said that while the Nationalists would not stand in the way of another EU poll, he fears that it could have a negative impact on the SNP\u0026rsquos bid for a second independence vote. It is thought his reservations are shared by Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister.  However, other senior figures are thought to believe that another poll could be best way to keep Scotland and the UK in the EU and, thus, the single market and customs union. Michael Russell, the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Brexit minister, has made clear he is \u0026ldquovery favourable to the question of a second Brexit vote."},{"url":null,"title":"last-years-strictly-winner-joe-mcfadden-hails-new-line-up","story":"  The Glasgow-born actor, who won Strictly in 2017, said there is somebody for everybody in the new crop of contestants for the BBC show.

Mrs May is expected to declare her desire for the UK to overtake the United States to become the G7\u0026rsquos leading investor in Africa by 2022, amid warnings of \u0026ldquogreater conflict and an increased susceptibility to extremism emerging if jobs are not created.  Downing Street believes helping young people in Africa secure jobs will stabilise the economy of their country while also reducing the likelihood of them undertaking risky journeys to Europe.  The PM is also expected to reassert the UK\u0026rsquos shift in strategy over aid spending \u0026ndash using the trip to encourage private sector investment alongside efforts to alleviate extreme poverty.  Britain\u0026rsquos overseas aid budget totalled \u0026pound13.9 billion in 2017, an increase of \u0026pound555 million in 2016 and in line with the legal commitment to invest 0.7% of national income in this area.  It has proven a controversial pledge among some Tory backbenchers, with successive international development secretaries vowing to use the cash to help develop trade against the backdrop of Brexit.  Mrs May is expected to use her speech to outline investment in Britain\u0026rsquos diplomatic network in Africa, with the use of trade experts to help encourage investment, amid growing influence on the continent from other countries including China.  Business leaders and ministers, including the international trade department\u0026rsquos George Hollingbery, are accompanying Mrs May on her first visit to Africa as PM which includes meetings with the presidents of each country on her agenda.  Speaking at the First National Bank in Cape Town on Tuesday, Mrs May is expected to say the private sector is key to driving growth in labour markets and \u0026ldquounleashing the entrepreneurial spirit in Africa.  She will say: \u0026ldquoHowever, for a iety of reasons the private sector has not yet managed to deliver the level of job creation and investment that many African nations need.  \u0026ldquoSo I want to put our development budget and expertise at the centre of our partnership as part of an ambitious new approach \u0026ndash and use this to support the private sector to take root and grow.  Mrs May will add: \u0026ldquoI am unashamed about the need to ensure that our aid programme works for the UK.  \u0026ldquoSo today I am committing that our development spending will not only combat extreme poverty, but at the same time tackle global challenges and support our own national interest. This will ensure that our investment in aid benefits us all, and is fully aligned with our wider national security priorities.

The deal aims to combine the best features from the two companies\u0026rsquo work on autonomous technology into cars that will be picking up Uber\u0026rsquos customers by 2021.  By the time that happens, Uber hopes to have completed an initial public offering of stock that will enrich a list of early investors that now includes Toyota.  Those investors have been pouring billions of dollars into Uber\u0026rsquos revolutionary ride-hailing service that still has not proven it can make money since its inception nearly a decade ago.  Uber is counting on self-driving cars to help it turn the financial corner by reducing the need to pay human drivers who arrive to pick up passengers in private vehicles summoned through a smartphone app.  By expanding into autonomous vehicles, Uber also hopes to ward off a looming competitive threat from another early investor, Google and its self-driving car spin-off Waymo, which is poised to launch its own ride-hailing service in Arizona before the end of this year.  \u0026ldquoOur goal is to deploy the world\u0026rsquos safest self-driving cars on the Uber network, and this agreement is another significant step towards making that a reality, said Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi.  Meanwhile, Toyota is trying to evolve from a pure car maker into a \u0026ldquomobility company, as are many of its industry peers, including General Motors and Ford in the US.  That crusade has prodded decades-old car makers such as Toyota and GM to invest in and partner with technology companies working on self-driving cars while also opening up their own research hubs in Silicon Valley.

Uber is turning to Toyota for help in autonomous vehicles five months after one of its self-driving cars ran over and killed a pedestrian crossing a dark street in Tempe, Arizona.  Authorities determined the sensors on Uber\u0026rsquos self-driving car sensors spotted the pedestrian, 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg, but the vehicle\u0026rsquos automatic-braking function had been disabled in favour of a human backup driver.  Tempe police said the driver was distracted and streaming a television show before the crash.  Uber had little choice but to find a self-driving car partner after the collision that killed Ms Herzberg, said Navigant Research analyst Sam Abuelsamid.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos going to be tough for them to build consumer trust in whatever it is they\u0026rsquore developing, he said.  \u0026ldquoI think that people will have a lot more trust in Toyota to do this the right way, to take due care and make sure everything is properly tested and evaluated.  Uber\u0026rsquos expansion into self-driving cars suffered another setback last year after Waymo accused it of stealing its technology in an elaborate scheme.  The case went through one week of a high-profile trial before Uber agreed to pay Waymo 245 million dollars  in stock to settle the allegations without acknowledging wrongdoing."},{"url":null,"title":"prue-leith-bake-off-fans-have-eased-off-comparing-me-to-mary-berry","story":"  Leith replaced Berry on as a judge in the popular baking show in 2017 when it moved from the BBC to Channel 4, and she is returning for her second stint in the tent for the new series along with Paul Hollywood.

The Department for Transport  launched a consultation last month on its proposal to encourage larger forecourts to sell E10 to help the UK meet climate change targets.  E10 involves increasing the proportion to 10% and is widely available across much of the European Union and other countries including the US and Australia.  The majority of vehicles in use today are approved to be fuelled with the petrol, but some older vehicles are not.  New analysis by motoring research charity the RAC Foundation shows that many cars still in regular use are incompatible with the fuel.  It found that by 2020 there will still be an estimated 28,066 Volkswagen Golfs on the road that would be affected, the most of any model.  Other models in the top 10 incompatibility list include the Nissan Micra , Rover 25  and Ford Escort .  In total, 634,309 petrol cars will be in use but incompatible with E10 in 2020, according to the research.  Of these, 150,000 will have been manufactured from the year 2000 onwards.  The DfT is proposing to introduce a requirement for larger filling stations to continue to stock standard petrol in an E5 grade if they decide to add an E10 option, in a bid to ensure the owners of older vehicles can continue to drive.  Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, said: \u0026ldquoAs and when E10 appears on the forecourts, drivers need to know whether their cars can use it without being damaged.  \u0026ldquoThis analysis shows that even in a couple of years\u0026rsquo time there will still be hundreds of thousands of cars on our roads that are incompatible with the new fuel.  \u0026ldquoWhilst some of the cars incompatible with E10 fuel will be historic models, many will be old but serviceable everyday run-arounds that people on a tight travel budget rely on to get about.  \u0026ldquoThe good news is both that the vast majority of cars on our roads are able to run on E10 and that Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has recognised the need to protect the users of those older vehicles which are not E10 compatible.  \u0026ldquoIt will be interesting to see whether the current consultation generates support for the Government\u0026rsquos proposed way forward.  A DfT spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoThis Government is ambitiously seeking to reduce the UK\u0026rsquos reliance on imported fossils fuels and cut carbon emissions from transport. But drivers of older vehicles should not be hit hard in the pocket as a result .  \u0026ldquoThe E10 petrol consultation will give a better understanding of the impact of E10 on the UK market, and to ensure that drivers are protected if any changes come into effect.  Here are the 10 models that will have the most registered cars which are E10 incompatible in 2020, according to the RAC Foundation :  1. Volkswagen Golf   2. MG MGB   3. Mazda MX-5   4. Nissan Micra   5. Morris Minor   6. Rover 25   7. MG MGF   8. Ford Escort   9. Rover Mini   10.

Used as training devices, the remote controlled collars can trigger an electric pulse of ying strength, or spray noxious chemicals at the animal.  However, a letter sent from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  in February, seen by the Press Association, suggested that there was insufficient evidence for supporting a ban.  The document, sent to the Royal Veterinary College, noted scientific research that it had commissioned \u0026ldquowas not strong enough to support a ban on \u0026ldquoelectronic training aids for dogs.  A similar statement was made by Defra Minister George Eustice in a 2014 letter, in which he said the department did not consider that there was \u0026ldquoevidence that the use of such devices causes unnecessary suffering.  Dog trainer and campaigner Jamie Penrith said Mr Gove had made an \u0026ldquoabrupt policy turnaround with no additional evidence.  He told the Press Association that in February the Government had \u0026ldquoinsufficient evidence to conclusively support the suggestion that the collars have a negative impact on welfare, but that \u0026ldquotwo weeks later at the beginning of March these \u0026lsquobarbaric, punitive devices need to be stripped from the market\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a complete 180, Mr Penrith added, saying it was not a welfare move.  Ian Gregory, a lobbyist for pet collars, said: \u0026ldquoThe Secretary of State should desist from feeding the nation\u0026rsquos pets to the wolves of Twitter.  \u0026ldquoThe anecdotal problems reported with pet collars can be resolved by product standards rather than by banning a proven technology.  \u0026ldquoThe hundreds of thousands of dog owners using remote trainer do not deserve to be criminalised.  The ban on remote controlled electronic training collars will not be extended to invisible fencing systems which can keep pets away from roads and within a boundary without receiving a static pulse, the Government announced.  Mr Gove said: \u0026ldquoWe are a nation of animal lovers and the use of punitive shock collars cause harm and suffering to our pets.  \u0026ldquoThis ban will improve the welfare of animals and I urge pet owners to instead use positive reward training methods.  The announcement was welcomed by the Dogs Trust, whose director of canine behaviour and research, Dr Rachel Casey, said: \u0026ldquoScientific research has demonstrated that electronic devices which deliver an aversive stimulus have a negative impact on dog welfare, so this ban will have a major positive impact for dogs in the UK.  \u0026ldquoHowever, we are saddened that the Government hasn\u0026rsquot gone a step further and used this opportunity to ban the use of containment fences, to ensure that all UK dogs are protected from this outdated approach to training.  Use of the collars has been banned in Wales, and earlier this year Scotland began moves towards prohibiting dog owners using them.

The east coast and the southern half of England have disastrous yields, crops have wilted and failed, the same is true across Europe.                                                                                                         “Supermarkets will increase the range of what can be packed to keep prices down. “With less intense farming plant disease pressure is less, traditional rotations and precision farming give Scottish vegetable growers serious advantages.“Climate change predictions suggest the use of water will become critical and UK producers will have to be more efficient.”Mr Clark also sounded a note of warning about the ongoing row over UK-wide frameworks in areas like agriculture post-Brexit.                                                                                                        He said: “The vast majority of output is supplied south of the border to national supermarkets who value the quality of Scottish produce.“A fully integrated UK market is essential to Scottish farming. This year more than any other shows how important food security is and the opportunity for Scottish growers to displace imports.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"rurie the seagull is an impressive 21 years","story":"        An Ellon-based animal sanctuary is currently caring for a wounded seagull, which it believes was hit by a vehicle.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Tuesday 28 Aug 2018 11:43 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117108.jpg","title":"Dont be put off if youre being bullied employees are told after Scrabster complaint is rejected by tribunal","story":"A LOCAL advice service is stressing that although a tribunal has rejected a complaint of workplace bullying made by a Scottish Government agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau , stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service  or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Tuesday 28 Aug 2018 11:43 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Jobs boost for AMTE Power in Thurso","story":"THE number of staff at a Thurso business is to increase by 25 per cent over the next year following a partnership deal with a British technology company.The workforce at AMTE Power Ltd, based at Thurso Business Park, is expected to rise from 32 to 40 following the deal with QinetiQ whose headquarters are in Farnborough in Hampshire. QinetiQ employs 6000 staff and has a turnover of around \u0026pound700 million.The deal comes as AMTE Power has invested \u0026pound1.5 million in a new automated production line at its Caithness operation.John Fox, the company\u0026rsquos marketing director, yesterday described the partnership agreement as \u0026ldquoa positive step for AMTE Power and the local economy.He explained the two business will work together to develop battery cells.\u0026ldquoWe will use our manufacturing expertise to utilise QinetiQ\u0026rsquos experience in battery technology and research to deliver new products, manufactured in Thurso to an international customer base, Mr Fox said.He said the companies will concentrate on four key areas: defence, the oil and gas industry, energy storage and electric vehicles. They plan to supply UK and European markets with niche batteries which customers would not be able to get elsewhere.Mr Fox said there is potential and opportunities in these areas and the increase in the Thurso workforce will be largely due to the link-up with QinetiQ.The partnership deal, he stressed, will allow customers to get products which \u0026ldquodon\u0026rsquot rely on standard mass-produced cells from the existing supply chain.The agreement will enable the companies to develop \u0026ldquoa mutually beneficial relationship and lead to advances in batteries and energy storage products.\u0026ldquoOur staff in Thurso are fantastic and we will continue to grow our base there, he said. \u0026ldquoWe have 32 employees in Caithness at present but have plans for that figure to go up to 40 over the next year \u0026ndash that is a 25 per cent increase.\u0026ldquoThis is a great building block for the future development of the organisation. We have had great support from the community and are committed to Thurso and Caithness.Kevin Brundish, chief executive of AMTE Power, said: \u0026ldquoThe combination of world-leading British innovation from QinetiQ coupled with the manufacturing capability of AMTE allows customers access to new and exciting energy storage options, giving them a choice beyond the existing supply chain.\u0026ldquoThe new products will see step change in capability and alternative options for our technology customers.Mike Sewart of QinetiQ said: \u0026ldquoWe recognise that our strengths lie in research, prototyping and scale-up of cutting-edge battery technology and not in large-scale manufacturing. This partnership will help us to take our technology to a broader customer base and provides us with the manufacturing support and expertise we need.AMTE is a privately owned company and is the UK\u0026rsquos only volume cell manufacturing facility.Tuesday 28 Aug 2018 11:43 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New group set up to save Trinkie","story":"MEMORIES of the golden era of the Trinkie came flooding back this week when a new group was set up with the intention of restoring Wick\u0026rsquos famous outdoor pool to its former glory.From the reflections, you\u0026rsquod think people were talking of the sun-swept coast of Spain, or \u0026ndash more closely \u0026ndash the holiday camp pools of Butlin\u0026rsquos or the 1980s TV show Hi-de-Hi.A significant number of Wick residents turned up to the meeting at the Francis Street Club, where it was decided to form the Trinkie Heritage Preservation Group.A previous group was disbanded earlier this year, blaming a \u0026ldquolack of community support.Friends of the Trinkie said it had enjoyed maintaining the outdoor pool at Wick\u0026rsquos South Head over the years, and stressed that it had not been an easy decision.For years, the lido on the Pulteneytown seafront formed a communal gathering spot, not just where people learned to swim, but also for barbecues, get-togethers and family occasions. Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Tuesday 28 Aug 2018 11:43 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

Accompanied by a support boat, Mr Cameron, 40, reached the shore on the other side, near Duncansby Head, sometime just before 8.20pm tonight.Mr Cameron decided to take on the seven-mile swim across the Firth in memory of his girlfriend Ena Brown, who died suddenly earlier this year. Money raised through the challenge will be going to the Kirkwall Maternity Ward, where Ena had worked.Speaking tonight, Monday, following the swim, he said: \u0026#8220It was a grind, I was swimming for over four hours and I never stopped for one second, I just ploughed on the whole way.\u0026#8220It was quite choppy to start with but it got better as I went on. Things eased off after about an hour or so. I knew I had it in me, I was just worried about the conditions changing and having to pull the plug, so I couldn\u0026#8217t relax during the swim. I went through all sorts of emotions \u0026#8211 I was confident and I had moments of doubt.\u0026#8220That last hour was a real grind, I must confess. I could see Duncansby Head in the foreground and I didn\u0026#8217t think I had long to go, but I was scared to ask. I had thought I had about 15 minutes to go, but I had an hour-and-a-half to go. It was real tough going.\u0026#8221\u0026#8220I\u0026#8217ve done marathons, I\u0026#8217ve won Scottish championship surfing titles, but that\u0026#8217s the toughest thing I\u0026#8217ve done.Asked how he felt following the swim, he replied: \u0026#8220I feel a big weight off my shoulders. If this hadn\u0026#8217t happened this week we would have been looking at next summer. I feel I\u0026#8217ve achieved something, I know this has been done before once or twice before, but this is something I will remember for the rest of my life. It\u0026#8217s very rewarding. All that stress is worth it.\u0026#8221A fundraising web page for the swim is available here.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Indeed, the evidence suggests that the capital grants previously available have made a real and positive impact.“Everyone agrees that encouraging new blood into farming is vitally important, including here in Orkney. At a time of real uncertainty for the sector, there is a need for the government to help provide what stability it can.“It is all the more surprising therefore that the minister has chosen to take this decision now.  I have written to Mr Ewing, who is due to visit Orkney next month, asking for a reassurance that the government does not intend to walk away from supporting new entrants and ensuring agriculture in Scotland has a bright future.”   \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Local residents are digging in the last few metres of cable to more than 35 per cent of the properties.Community spokesman Steve Jones said: \"It\u0026rsquos a tremendously exciting time. Like many residents I\u0026rsquove only been getting very slow speeds capped at 0.5Mbps, making even the most basic of online activities difficult and frustrating, so looking forward to ultrafast speeds is fantastic.\"Fast, reliable broadband will bring huge potential to regenerate our scattered communities. It\u0026rsquos a prerequisite for attracting families and businesses to the area, where the population has fallen in recent years. People now expect good internet as a basic. In essence, it will help us to build a closer and more integrated community.\"Lesley Negri, who runs the historic Aultguish Inn near Garve with her husband Dario, added: \"It will make a huge difference to us, especially for our booking system and payments.\"At the moment everything slows down from 4pm and we can\u0026rsquot manage customer expectations. Many of our customers want to stream things or download photographs and it\u0026rsquos impossible to do that at the moment. We\u0026rsquove lived with slow broadband for so long that we can\u0026rsquot imagine what it\u0026rsquos going to be like when we can access ultrafast speeds!\"Tuesday 28 Aug 2018 11:44 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

She has it all.\"I would definitely say she is the best that I have ever had.\"She has strong flat bones in her legs, the hock is nice and high in her hind legs, her second thigh is nice and short, and she has a good deep body and good long silky hair covering her legs and the back of her hooves.\"And she\u0026rsquos good natured too, they generally are.\"The plant fitter, who works for Macdonald Groundworks, has been breeding his own Clydesdale horses for more than 30 years, following in the footsteps of his father and his grandfather, Donald Clarke, who worked on farms with the horses and took a stallion around the area.Mr Johnstone said: \"We also have Ord Tinkerbell\u0026rsquos full sister Ord Destiny and her mother Ord Envy.\"We keep them on a bit of rented ground.

Although the provision of public toilets is a non-statutory function of local authorities, the Scottish Government ensured that the criteria for the fund did include capital support for toilet provision, where there was a demonstrable need.\"She added that she was aware of the council\u0026rsquos toilet closure plans and said she had \"personally pressed\" the local authority to reconsider.Council leader Margaret Davidson said the cuts were part of wider measures to \"balance the budget and safeguard essential services\" amid a climate of reduced funding for councils across Scotland and the wider UK.What do YOU think?

It consists of a retail box of fresh fish, sent directly to consumers all over the UK within hours of being landed. Fishbox now boasts in excess of 2000 subscribers with 100 new customers signing up every month.Mr Houston told the North Star: \"These are very exciting times for us. We will leave the Inverness premises on August 24. We have simply outgrown the premises and all of Coast \u0026amp Glen will relocate to Alness.\u0026nbsp We currently have 14 staff, plus four staff we have taken on from Summer Isles and are recruiting a further eight staff. There will me more next year too.\"Fishbox currently employs nine staff and this will increase next year too. We have big expansion plans for both companies.\"The award-winning businessman, a former motorcycle racer who taught himself the trade after a bad crash, has built up Coast \u0026amp Glen to a turnover exceeding \u0026pound2.2 million. The combined turnover for the two companies at the end of this year is set to top \u0026pound3m.His change in direction came by chance whilst out on a fishing boat. He went on to buy a small 21ft fishing boat, teaching himself from YouTube and Google. He decided to start selling his own catch and found the demand was so high he started selling from other boats. With the high demand from restaurants for a wider iety of products, Coast \u0026amp Glen was born.He said: \"I have always thought it\u0026rsquos very important to support the local community with jobs. It would be much easier for us to send fish to Glasgow to get processed just like majority of the salmon companies do and the whisky companies do for the bottling of their whisky, but that would have an impact on the area I was born and brought up in.\"This was the reason that I put a lot of time pressure on the people involved in the transition of the purchase of Summer Isles Foods.\"Tuesday 28 Aug 2018 11:44 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Opposition parties have called for \u0026#8220full transparency\u0026#8221 from the Scottish Government over the investigation of sexual harassment allegations against Alex Salmond.                Alex Salmond has formally written to the Scottish Government to demand an inquiry into the leaking of sexual harassment allegations against him.            The Government last night confirmed there were no recorded complaints about Mr Salmond from before January.            A statement was issued after opposition parties called for “full transparency” from the Government over their investigation into the former first minister.The call came as a statement sent on behalf of Mr Salmond to The Scotsman last night confirmed his letter calling for a Government inquiry had been received yesterday afternoon by the Scottish permanent secretary’s office.READ MORE: Alex Salmond allegations: Conspiracies run wild amid claimsMr Salmond wants to know how the explosive sexual misconduct claims against him were made public at the end of last week.He said on Friday: “Confidentiality is at the heart of a just procedure and is necessary for both complainers and those complained about. If it is breached, then who is going to complain in future with confidence and how can the person complained about secure any fairness?”            The Scottish Conservatives and Scottish Labour urged the SNP administration to release more information on the circumstances surrounding two complaints against Mr Salmond. He strongly denies the allegations, which were raised in January, and has launched legal action against the Government over the investigation.The claims about his conduct towards two staff members in 2013, while he was in office, have been handed to Police Scotland.Tory equalities spokeswoman Annie Wells had earlier written to Scottish permanent secretary Leslie Evans seeking to clarify whether complaints had been raised against Mr Salmond before January.She said: “The Scottish Government should instigate an independent review in order to find out the answer.            “This would show the Scottish Government was being fully transparent about its knowledge of any complaints of alleged misconduct.”In a statement issued last night, a Government spokesman said: “It is important to remember that two complaints have been made that could not be ignored or swept under the carpet no matter the identity of the individual involved.“There are no recorded complaints about Alex Salmond prior to January 2018.“For legal reasons we are unable to provide further detail at this time. However, in the fullness of time the Scottish Government will seek to make available as much information as it can.”Labour has meanwhile tabled a series of Freedom of Information requests seeking more detail on three meetings Mr Salmond said had taken place between himself and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon after he was informed of the allegations. The party is requesting any correspondence relating to the meetings as well as any notes or minutes from them.            Labour’s Rhoda Grant MSP said: “The people of Scotland expect full transparency over this most serious of matters, but the SNP government has so far not been forthcoming.“It is understood that Alex Salmond met the First Minister on multiple occasions to discuss the investigation into allegations of sexual assault made against him.”Read more: Nicola Sturgeon: No legal basis to suspend Alex Salmond from SNP"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4790723.1535446540!/image/image.jpg","title":"david beckham faces speeding charge trial","story":"        David Beckham is due to go on trial over an alleged speeding offence.

They include Clanyard Bay and Glasserton in Dumfries and Galloway and Red Point in the north west Highlands, according to the map.The map and photographs have been published online by the SCRAPbook  project, a collaboration of three charities - the Marine Conservation Society , Sky Watch Civil Air Patrol and the Moray Firth Partnership - that aims to help volunteers target their beach clean-ups.READ MORE: Impact of marine litter in Scotland revealed in photo of stagLaunched in April, Sky Watch pilots have flown over sections of Scotland’s coast for the last few months taking pictures when they see litter.Archie Liggat, Sky Watch chairman, said: “In the worst areas it is absolutely at industrial levels, with plastic blasted up the hills from the coast where it’s been blown.            “There are hundreds and hundreds of large plastic barrels and crates all over the place, and when there is any large plastic litter visible at all there’s usually a significant amount of smaller stuff too.”Richard Harrington from MCS said there is still a lot of coastline to be covered but it was clear there are large areas of waste “people simply aren’t seeing”.He said: “It’s largely hidden from view, but there are huge volumes of material in some of the most remote coves and on inaccessible beaches that will be a real challenge to move.”MCS is calling for volunteers to take part in its Great British Beach Clean on September 14-17.

Rock star, messianic man-in-tights, comedy-moustache camp commandant, Freddie Mercury was also a great seer, able to predict the future. Consider these lyrics, which he warbled way back in 1975: “Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality ... ”            Was that not Freddie anticipating the dread dawn of reality television? Has there not been a landslide of “real people” turning up uninvited in our parlours, a tsunami of ordinary folk keen to display their navel fluff and more besides on primetime? And hasn’t it felt like there’s no escape, that the fly-on-the-wall phenomenon would move inexorably to its inevitable conclusion – a programme with hidden cameras following the progress of flies on a wall, each of them adopted by carefully selected members of the great unwashed – except there will be no conclusion, for reality TV won’t end, ever?            Well, it just might, you know. The big beasts of reality are ailing. Small-screen juggernauts once thought to be impregnable and untouchable are creaking. There’s been a chain reaction of misfortune and mild calamity, as if each has been feeling the other’s pain, as if they might all perish together in some bizarre suicide pact. It’s a nice thought, yes?Strictly speaking, Strictly Come Dancing is celebrity-based, although you could have fooled the headline writer who with obvious exasperation asked the other day: “Is this the most obscure line-up ever?” The show returns next month and there’s a feeling it is overdoing diversity at the expense of glitter. Maybe good intentions have taken Strictly down this route. Or it could be arrogance. Berserk on power, the producers’ summoning a BBC3 documentary-maker, a video blogger and Lee from pop berks Blue – among others even less well-known – might be an act of willful perversity, bolstered by the belief the bovine masses will tune in regardless.

Nope, the man who sold the world, Simon Cowell, is still flogging his karaoke klamjamphrie. The programme has finally caught up with its crazed and capricious emperor’s fashion sense, and is now as hopelessly out of date as those flared stonewashed jeans. It’s tried everything to stop the viewing figures falling off a cliff, apart from a Cliff Richard theme night, that is. It’s tried auditions with audiences and without, Cowell present and  not present, freakshow and theatre of cruelty. If new judge Robbie Williams can’t save The X Factor, surely Cowell will proffer the downward-pointing thumb to the whole sad affair.Later this year I’m a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here! will attempt to carry on without its chief ant. Here’s a presenter – Ant McPartlin – who because of his well-publicised personal problems really needs a break from the show. Well, don’t we all? But the reality behemoth most vulnerable right now is Big Brother. At the Edinburgh TV Festival the other day, Channel 5 director of programmes Ben Frow admitted the end was nigh for the programme. “I plan for a year without Big Brother,” he said. “A lot of our very successful shows have started to decline, which is life.”            Life. That’s what BB was supposed to be: ordinary life in extraordinary surroundings, ordinary people in a ground-breaking social experiment, and for a while we fell for that tagline and were hooked. The early years were weirdly hypnotic. Who knew watching folk doing next to nothing could be so much fun? Maybe we were fed up with scripted, and often overwrought, dramas on TV – and actresses who claimed to still be 29 plugging them remorselessly on daytime chat-shows. Reality TV seemed to be democratising the goggle-box. Well, it just goes to show: not all democracy is good.READ MORE: Real Housewives ‘Queen’ tells all about reality TV seriesVery soon the contestants became aware of the cameras and what they could do for their ordinary lives. If they felt like laboratory beagles, required to undergo smoking tests, then they quickly turned the tables on the producers and lit up fat cigars for themselves. Fame could be theirs! It changed the nature of the show completely, and Big Brother changed telly completely.Suddenly, everyone was on TV, or everyone could be. Every profession, every office, could be the setting for a six-part series and many were. Big Brother was brought to our screens by Peter Bazalgette, a telly impresario whose great-great-grandfather laid London’s sewage network. Inevitably some latterday drainage workers got their own docusoap. What was it called again? Sludge? C**p? Plumbing the Depths? Real dramas were cancelled, actors found themselves out of work.            These shows were all the children, or bastard offspring, of Big Brother and it will take some time before they’re all sluiced away because reality still dominates the schedules. We will all have our pet hates. Mine is the property porn of Location, Location, Location and especially the moment when the dull would-be homebuyers are in the local wine bar with presenter Phil Spencer and waiting to find out if their bid has been successful. Is it wrong to view them as acquisitive morons when they probably just want somewhere nice to live? Maybe, but that’s what reality television does to me.All those shows about offices have given us The Office but reality has also begat Katie Hopkins and helped in the creation of this narcissistic age where children, when asked what they want to be when they grow up, reply: “Famous.”Still, the end could be in sight.

An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement , whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

Is anyone else finding it hard to put their head down at night? In this increasingly virtual world, where it’s becoming harder to discern right from wrong and truth from falsehood, I find myself losing sleep just trying to keep hold of something that feels real. Simply committing to one version of reality requires a tremendous leap of faith the algorithms have boxed us into circular and self-validating conversations that we too often confuse with a mythical ‘consensus’.            In these times of irreversible and sweeping change, we turn to leaders who appear just as baffled by it all as we are. Caught haplessly in the headlights of divided public opinion, our representatives have little choice but to dial up the empty rhetoric. From the chaos must come order and the global stage is truly set for a new kind of politics and a new kind of leadership. Which is why we should all be delighted that Steve Bannon has arrived in Europe to share some of his fantastic ideas about flags and walls.            A right-wing populist, widely regarded as the proximate cause of Donald Trump’s victory in the 2016 Presidential race, Bannon, a self-styled economic nationalist and student of political history – who counts Mussolini as one of its most “fascinating” figures – may well be the 21st century’s most audacious man. Entering a chaotic and unfocused campaign just 88 days before its climax, Bannon skilfully steered a floundering Donald Trump through a hurricane of self-generated calamity – including a tape-recorded admission to sexual assault – that threatened to derail his presidential bid. Bannon went on to serve as White House Chief Strategist in the administration during the first seven months of Trump’s term, before leaving the West Wing to play a more decisive and, arguably, dangerous role – as the political Rorschach of our time.READ MORE: Darren McGarvey: Beware your inner Trump, the monster inside us allMore so than Trump, Bannon embodies the American Dream. Hailing from a working class, pro-democrat, Catholic household, Bannon defied the gravity of his roots, ascending the ranks of academia where he earned qualifications in urban planning and national security studies , before graduating from Hard Business School as a Master of Business Administration. His subsequent career has spanned every prestigious domain of American society from Wall Street to Hollywood and later journalism and media before finally hanging his feathered cap on the shaky nail of politics. Now in political exile, Bannon is repositioning himself as the architect  of what he calls the “global populist movement”.For some, Bannon is the bitter palette cleanser that precedes the main course of fascism a charge he laughs off as proof his detractors in the “propaganda wing of the establishment” are resorting to smears “because they don’t want to talk about facts”. Others regard him as a natural and necessary disruption to the regularly scheduled neoliberal programming, observing his rise with great interest, arguably ambivalent to the consequences of his radioactive politics. But most worryingly, increasing numbers across the West regard Bannon  as a virtuous, straight-talking tribune of the little-guy. And it’s in this area that his working-class roots appear to be giving him a distinct and devastating advantage.READ MORE: Kenny MacAskill: Boris Johnson’s sinister ties to alt-right guru Steve Bannon            If you watch Bannon speak  he sounds like a class-warrior of old, with constant and deliberate emphasis on “workers” and “elites”. His carefully rehearsed rhetoric is more Chomsky than Trump, with calls for an end to foreign invasions, his assertion that mainstream media is largely a propaganda operation and that criminal charges should be brought against the high-priests of finance who presided over the near-collapse of the Western economic system just a decade ago. Like many on the hard left, Bannon also believes in a high rate of taxation for the wealthy and argued for a 45 per cent rate on anyone making more than five million dollars, before Trump pulled rank. And Bannon, like so many on the left, is utterly merciless in his assessment that the political centre is no more than a puppet theatre for the pampered “parties of Davos”. It’s frightening how hard-right figures like this have been able to co-opt the language of class struggle while our social-democratic systems managers flounder from one cock-up to the next, completely oblivious to what gives this ascendant, virulent strain of right-wing populism its muscularity and momentum. That’s not to cast centre-ground parties as bogey men, or pretend that we’ve seen no progress during the neoliberal period, but if Bannon’s continued rise tells us one thing, it’s that we’ve reached peak ‘easy-does-it’ where our politics and economy are concerned and that liberals, largely insulated from the economic insecurity that gives rise to populism, won’t be enough to stop this march to the far-right.Every trick in the liberal playbook has so far failed. Unlike Trump, May and the rest, Bannon is almost impervious to mockery the merciless, unending social media-driven onslaughts that have derailed and demystified the power and privilege of so many notable figures of late seems to ricochet off Bannon like rubber bullets. Mainstream media scrutiny doesn’t appear to be achieving anything but promoting him, as he smiles through every ‘tough’ question with a palpable lack of concern for whatever liberal hacks try to pin on him. Unlike the coterie of useful idiots that were used as battering rams to clear the brush for Trump’s ominous arrival, Bannon’s star grows brighter by the day, while alt-right poster-boy Milo Yiannopoulos and demented conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, as well as Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen among others, have been systematically delegitimised and side-lined. Meanwhile, Bannon has managed to peel-away from the Land of Oz that he, himself, created and may stand as the only serious sideshow to emerge from the political and economic circus of Trumpism.            Unsurprisingly, the fact Bannon comes from humbler beginnings than many of his media and political contemporaries has been largely edited out of the story. Understandably, we tend to focus on his Wall Street connections, his Breitbart ‘news’ site, his fingerprints all over Cambridge Analytica, his courting of the far-right in Europe and the neo-Nazis who – whether Bannon likes it or not – have been empowered by Trump’s hostile rhetoric on illegal immigrants and Muslims.But it’s Bannon’s working-class roots that give him the edge in a political and media climate dominated by people who struggle to both interpret and reflect what is going on further down the food-chain. I suspect the political response to Trumpism – and Bannon – may have to come from the same place."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4790579.1535396144!/image/image.jpg","title":"paris gourtsoyannis no deal brexit plans help politicians be honest","story":"        The UK Government\u0026#8217s publication of its no-deal Brexit plans has set all sides of the debate free to speak their minds, writes Paris Gourtsoyannis.                From the easiest trade deal in the world to a promise that you’ll still be able to enjoy a sandwich after Brexit – last week showed the distance we have travelled, and how little there is left to run.            It’s been said that these interesting times have killed off political satire: reality is so much more hilariously unpredictable than anything dreamt up in a writers’ room.            Watching Dominic Raab set out how it was a supreme act of responsibility to publish hundreds of pages of plans for a no-deal scenario that every Brexiteer once said was unthinkable, I had a sudden feeling that the last surviving bit of Brexit humour was being killed off.For those who never heard the Brexit Bulldog sketches on Radio 4, they were a send-up of David Davis’ unshakeable confidence, so his resignation has already put a end to them. But there was delicate balance between realism and absurdity to his promises of securing the best deal in the world before negotiating his way into indentured servitude down a salt mine. It was the unbelievable made just about believeable.Well, here was the Government calmly and responsibly explaining to the nation how life in the salt mine might look, licking the walls for mineral nourishment. Delivered by a perspiring Raab, a man once described as “a baseball bat in a suit”, the humour is gone. Brexit bulldog has been put down.In fact, it feels as if the bulldog spirit has gone out of Brexit altogether. The timing wasn’t his fault, but the new Brexit Secretary delivered his first speech and gave his first press conference on no-deal, something the Government insists won’t happen.READ MORE: No-deal Brexit will lead to Scottish independence, predicts ex-Catalan leader            Ministers will now struggle to credibly return to the sunny optimism of before, and those who were never particularly optimistic have been released from captivity. Philip Hammond reminded everyone of the Government’s own analysis showing the deep harm that a no-deal exit from the EU would inflict on the economy. Compared to before, the attacks on him were half-hearted. After all, he was only setting out Government analysis of a set of circumstances the Government was unveiling hundreds of pages of plans about.Publication of the first no-deal papers, with more to follow in the coming weeks, has acted as a release for Brexiteers, too. As time and arguments run out, they can do little else other than say how they really feel.So last week we heard Jacob Rees-Mogg describe how the failure to find an agreed solution to the Irish border was nothing to worry about, as there were police checks during the Troubles. Barbed wire and soldiers pointing their guns through windows does not promise to be good for business, or the interests of peaceful cooperation. Only a few weeks earlier, Mr Rees-Mogg had been insisting that a technological fix could ensure the free flow of goods and people without harassment or delay.READ MORE: No-deal Brexit does not threaten union, says Prime Minister’s deputy            And last week we also heard the likes of John Redwood, confronted with the possibility that the basic premise of Brexit – a new and better relationship with Europe – might fail, fall back on the old script that critics never wanted the UK to leave the EU anyway. Brexiteers are at last being clear: theirs is a policy that cannot be held to account.Nor can politicians on any side hide from the most basic questions – even if they try. The clip of Jeremy Corbyn being asked six times whether he believed that the UK will be better off after Brexit was telling, even though he failed to answer the question. His evasions said all that was needed: no, he does not think it will. Even Dominic Raab’s insistence when asked a iant of the same question – will a no-deal Brexit leave the UK better off? – his answer was revealing. He claimed it would, saying there would be “opportunities” for Britain to exploit. These were hard to ferret out from reading the 150-pages of no-deal advice and preparations. The failure of Brexit talks is evidently an outcome that Raab is willing to accept, regardless of the outcome.With parliament returning for what will be its most important session since the Iraq War, if not longer, this is the least that we can hope for: that its occupants continue, finally, to say what they really mean, and mean what they say."},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006. Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.  Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself ?  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen  and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nTuesday 28 Aug 2018 11:45 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117085.jpg","title":"Dalwhinnie makeover starts to take shape","story":"Tom Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nDALWHINNIE is on the verge of a major makeover at its southern entrance.\nFor too long dogged by a disused, overgrown compound and a rusting old water treatment works, villagers are now beginning to hope that things could change dramatically over the next few months.\nAll being well, they heard on Tuesday, a \u0026pound2.3 million upgrade by Scottish Water could get under way in the new year which would leave the village with a new treatment works by this time next year.\n\"There\u0027s a long way to go,\" said the north\u0027s corporate affairs manager Gavin Steel when the Strathy met with an SW team in the village hall, \"but we\u0027re hopeful that all the many stages will be gone through on schedule.\n\"We are having to consult with a lot of different individuals and organisations \u0026ndash not least the national park authority, the Highland Council, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and landowners \u0026ndash but this is work which will have to be done on behalf of the community.\n\"Quite simply the current system has reached its sell-by date.

There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/001WH1708NCA.jpg","title":"oidhche mhath runrig whfp editorial 24 8","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n night spoke for the Highlands.\nThe unassuming Malcolm has often been a coolly detached figure on stage, concentrating solely on his guitar.\nBut he has been playing with the Run Rig Dance and Ceilidh Band since he was 17 years old and he is now in his 60th year.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018.

The onset of the Tory Brexit, backed by the DUP, also represents an attack on the rights of people in the north. \nThe main speaker at the end of the commemoration at the Square in Dungannon will be former Sinn Féin MLA Mitchel McLaughlin. \nSpeaking ahead of Saturday\u0027s march, the former Northern Assembly Speaker called for a huge turnout. \"Let\u0027s exceed those who turned out on the very first civil rights march in August 1968 and let\u0027s ensure that a very clear and committed demand is presented to the governments - the Irish government as much as the British government - to address those issues of a rights based society that are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement,\" he said. \nThe parade will begin in Coalisland at 3pm on Saturday and make its way to Dungannon. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27461  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nHundreds of people took part in a commemoration in Tyrone yesterday to mark the 50th anniversary of the first civil rights march to be held in the north. \nThe march retraced the steps of the original march from Coalisland to Dungannon and was attended by Sinn Féin representatives from across the north. \nIt was led by Mid Ulster Sinn Féin MP Francie Molloy, who took part in the original march 50 years ago as a steward. \nMarchers carried replicas of the posters carried by the original march, reading \u0027One man, one vote,\u0027 \u0027Equal housing now\u0027 as well as banners referring to the Caledon housing protest which was the motivation for the march. \nContemporary posters on the threat posed to Brexit to rights were also carried by marchers. \n\nIn 1968 the original march was stopped before it reached the Square in Dungannon by the RUC because loyalist protestors staged a counter demonstration. \nThis time, however, the march reached its destination where speeches were made by Francie Molloy, local MLA Colm Gildernew and Fermanagh/South Tyrone MP Michelle Gildernew. \nThe main speaker of the march was veteran republican and civil rights activist Mictchel McLaughlin. \nIn his speech, the former Assembly Speaker said tat much has changed in the last five decades and that we are on the verge of a major shift towards Irish unity. \n\"The Orange state is now gone and we now have a peaceful and democratic way forward. \n“This is a very different place than it was in 1968 and I am convinced that we are now on the verge of another seismic shift towards a new, agreed and united Ireland that will provide a prosperous and shared future for all our citizens,\" he said. \n\nBut Mr McLaughlin also warned that our rights are still under threat today from Brexit and the right wing alliance between the Tories and the DUP. \n“My deep concern is that there are still people who want to deny rights and equality to their fellow citizens today. \n\"People in the north still face attacks on their electoral and civil rights, alongside the continued denial of rights to LGBTQ couples, women, Irish language speakers, and bereaved families seeking a coroner’s inquest.\n“Today, we are experiencing an unacceptable blockade on rights, imposed by the DUP and facilitated by the British government.\n“Rights are also under threat by a right-wing Tory Brexit and there are unwelcome echoes of gerrymandering and the hollowing out of democracy by the recent Boundary Commission proposals.\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago,\" he added. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27462  ","story":"Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0026#039Neill.\n Michael McMonagle\n\n“We must specifically acknowledge the damage done by the Catholic Church to the lives of many women and children in the mother and baby homes, the Magdalene Laundries and a succession of abuse scandals and cover ups.- Michelle O\u0026#039Neill\nThe visit to Ireland by Pope Francis this weekend is an opportunity for the Catholic church to address the ongoing legacy of abuse, Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0027Neill has said. \nMichelle O\u0027Neill made the comments ahead of the historic visit to Ireland of Pope Francis this weekend to attend the World Meeting of Families which is being held in Dublin.

But more than that, it is an opportunity to do something about it and that opportunity should be grasped. \n\"While the letter from Pope Francis acknowledged that hurt and suffering, it needs to be followed with more than words action is required,\" he said. \nThe former minister said the Catholic church needs to cooperate with investigations into abuse and address the legacy of abuse by providing redress to victims. \n\"This issue is not going away. While I acknowledge that the Pope will meet a number of victims and survivors of clerical abuse and it is important that he hears and listens to their stories, more is needed.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

grateful family of a Ballymoney schoolboy whose life was saved by his older brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a difference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such life-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back.

The Skoda man felt the format incurred unnecessary expense in terms of fuel costs.\n\u0026#8220The fuel isn\u0027t cheap and the cars run on it whether you are driving a stage or the road sections, said Bogie. A remote service after Friday\u0027s first two stages would work for everyone.

We have come close in the past, making it to the quarter-finals and the semi-finals, so to go one better this season is a great feeling.\n\u0026#8220There is a real buzz and a belief in the team that we can go and win the Irish Cup in our first final.\n\u0026#8220We have gone up against teams from all over the Province this season to get to the final.\n\u0026#8220We didn\u0027t know too much about any of them, they were all an unknown quantity, but we played to our strengths and we have been rewarded.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ? \"https:\" : \"http:\" + \"common.tibus.net/js/tibus.credit/v1.1/tibus-credit.js\"        document.write         ]]\n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n     gaJsHost =  ? \"https:ssl.\" : \"http:www.\"    document.write    \n    \n     pageTracker = _gat._getTracker    pageTracker._initData    pageTracker._trackPageview    \n      \n\n      \n              \n   return false\"\n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602227.1534344744!/image/image.jpg","title":"can you help a history project","story":"\nDid you ever work in the old Mayfair manufacturing company in Portadown? If so, then Mayfair Business Centre would like to hear from you.  \n\n                \nThe present day Mayfair Business Centre is inviting former workers who were employed at the sewing factory to discuss their memories and experiences of working there. This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInterested?

authority offers assurance about future of school crossing patrols","story":"\nThe Education Authority  has given an assurance that school crossing patrols will be in operation when children across Northern Ireland return to school in the coming days.\n\n                \nA spokesperson for the EA offered the assurance in response to media coverage revealing that the authority had considered removing “lollipop men and women” in a bid to save money.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nA letter obtained by BBC News NI revealed that the EA faces an estimated funding gap of £58 million in 2018/19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt highlights a number of “difficult choices” the authority is faced with in order to cut costs, including the possible removal of school crossing patrols, withdrawing uniform allowances and making compulsory redundancies in schools.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAccording to the BBC, EA board members regarded the possibility of scrapping school crossing patrols – and other potentially controversial savings measures – as “unpalatable” and decided that any decision to make such cuts should be down to the Department of Education.\n\nThe letter also suggests that “traffic control measures” are not the EA’s responsibility, but that of the Department for Infrastructure and the police.\n\nReacting to media reports about the future of school crossing patrols, a spokesman for the EA said: “The Education Authority does not intend to make any changes to the current arrangements for school crossing patrols in the current financial year.”\n\nManned crossings are seen as a vital for the safety of children crossing busy roads, and the DUP’s education spokesman said any move to remove lollipop men and women would be “unacceptable.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“While undoubtedly the Education Authority and the department have to explore every option to live within budget, this idea cannot be regarded as a serious suggestion and it is clear that the members of the Education Authority would reject any attempt to propose it,” said Peter Weir MLA.\n\n“The safety of our children must be paramount, and there is no need to remove the current process for assessing individual placements of lollipop people provision.”\n\nThe Strangford MLA continued: “This bizarre suggestion does however highlight two key issues. Firstly, the extent to which education is effectively subsidising other elements of government particularly on road safety and transport and there needs to be a debate about where financial responsibility is borne. \n\n“Secondly, it further shines a light on the heavy pressures facing education in Northern Ireland, and the need for strategic changes and reform which need commitment on an Executive-wide basis, which again highlights the damage being done by a single party putting their narrow interests ahead of proper decision making and the restoration of government.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602298.1534346604!/image/image.jpg","title":"fifty years on from first civil rights march","story":"\nOn August 24, 1968, Northern Ireland\u0026#8217s first civil rights march took place between Coalisland and Dungannon. \n\n                \nOn the march were teachers, students and politicians who all wanted the same thing, equality and civil rights.

this Stories In Sound documentary for BBC Radio Ulster, she follows ‘In The Footsteps’ of those first civil rights marchers. She revisits the issue of housing discrimination and the ground breaking protests of the young mothers of the Homeless Citizens League, and learns first-hand about the organisation of the march from the so-called “Protestor Number One”. She hears from Bernadette McAliskey about how the march turned her into a lifelong campaigner, as well as from those who took part in a counter protest.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nUsing a blend of highly personal interviews and archive audio, Lynette asks what spurred them to take to the streets in pursuit of civil rights, whether or not they achieved their aims – and at what cost. Fifty years on from that first civil rights march, how has Dungannon – and Northern Ireland – changed?\n\nIn the Footsteps - presented by Lynette Fay and produced by Freya McClements – is broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster on Sunday, August 19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8615613.1535442232!/image/image.jpg","title":"fundraising abseil in aid of action ms","story":"\nA fundraising abseil was recently organised by the staff at Thompson House Hospital in aid of Action MS.\n\n                \nA team  including neurologist Dr Stella Hughes, Nurse Sarah McCallan and administrator Laura Fisher scaled the dizzy heights of the Europa Hotel.

creating 10 jobs, breathing new life into a vacant\u0026#160100-year-old building in Bridge Street and giving the town\u0026#8217s evening and night-time economy a much needed boost.\n\n                \nRecognising a gap in the market for enhancing the town’s hospitality provision not just during the day but also after 5pm, Barrel and Bean is a new venture by entrepreneur Jamie McCutcheon who also owns local business, HealthBod Fitness, which specialises in personal and group training.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAlready the fledgling business is showing early signs of being a great success, with customers from the town and further afield flocking to the top-notch venue to sample a delectable selection of sweet and savoury food accompanied by a wide range of premium quality beverages.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nKeen to show their support for the new business, Councillor Paul Greenfield accompanied by Councillor Mark Baxter and Alderman Paul Rankin, were among the first well-wishers to visit Barrel and Bean.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nOf course they could not leave without enjoying a refreshing cup of coffee and sampling some cake and tray bakes supplied by The Little Bakehouse, Dromore and Tasty Wee Numbers, Ballynahinch.\n\nEconomic Development and Regeneration Committee Chair, Councillor Paul Greenfield, commented: “Supporting the growth of a vibrant and thriving evening and night-time economy in all urban centres in the borough is a key council priority – so it’s great to see Dromore benefit from this new investment.\n\nWith its newly expanded visitor offering, Dromore has an equally important role to play in strengthening the evening and night-time economy, and like other towns in the borough should be viewed among prospective hospitality providers as an attractive destination for investment.\n\nBarrel and Bean is already delivering big gains for the town – creating employment, rejuvenating a disused building, encouraging locals and visitors to socialise in the town well into evening and acting as a catalyst for further investment. I wish Jamie and his team every success in the future.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe council has recently approved a new five-year Evening Economy Development strategy, supporting its growth and diversification, in particular within strategic areas of night-time activity.\n\nThe strategy incorporates retail, arts, culture and leisure and supports and promotes existing businesses in their evening operations, encourages the extension of day time activities and strives to attract new evening uses and events that add to the evening economy.\n\nAn individual action plan has also been produced for all six urban centres, reflecting each centre’s unique and diverse assets, and identifying priorities for promoting their continued growth.\n\nBarrel and Bean is open Tuesday and Wednesday , Thursday and Friday , Saturday  and Sunday .\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8615611.1535442185!/image/image.jpg","title":"tremendous results at rathfriland high","story":"\nRathfriland High School has enjoyed another successful academic year withpupils achieving a \u0026#8220tremendous set of results which reflect the very good education provided\u0026#8221. \n\n                \nOnce again, an impressive number of pupils in the cohort achieved five or more GCSE passes at A* - C. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nPrincipal Mrs A McCullough said the results reward the hard work of the pupils, the dedication of the staff and very positive parental support. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“It is also important to recognise the contribution of our partners in the Banbridge Area Learning Community, “ she said. “This partnership allows us to offer a diverse range of subjects which affords pupils a wider choice at KS4.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“This year’s set of results reinforces our reputation as a high performing, non-selective secondary school. \n\n“Rathfriland High School has provided opportunities and opened doors across a diverse range of further education and training which will allow these leavers to choose whichever pathway most suits their skills and talents. \n\n“I would like to congratulate our pupils on their success, perseverance and industry. \n\n“I would also pay tribute to the talented and professional teaching staff who play a pivotal role in these achievements.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Parents also provide crucial support for our young people and I wish to thank them. \n\n“The performance of some pupils is particularly worthy of note, Alexandria Harbinson, Geri Georgieva, Laura Adams, Emily Cantley, Mallory Lutton, Jessica Thomas and Kerry Martin.\t\n\n“Success such as this only comes about when pupils, parents and staff work together to ensure all children reach their potential.  \n\n“We celebrate all our pupils’ achievement at this time and wish them every success for the future.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"excitement ahead of pope visit","story":"\n\nCATHOLIC\n churches around the city are bedecked with bunting and Papal flags as excitement builds ahead of the historic visit from the Holy Father Pope Francis to Ireland this weekend.\nThe momentous visit is being held to mark the World Meeting of Families , staged every three years for families to celebrate, pray and reflect together. This is the first time the event has been staged in Ireland.\nPope Francis will arrive in Dublin on Saturday, almost 40 years since Pope John Paul II came and addressed the faithful at capacity Masses in Drogheda, Knock and Phoenix Park. Pope Francis’ first engagement will be meeting President Michael D Higgins before visiting St Mary’s Pro-Cathedral and then the Capuchin Day Centre, which provides hot meals, clothing and showers for the city’s homeless. Pope Francis will then preside at the Festival of Families in Croke Park.\nHis visit will conclude on Sunday with a closing Mass at Phoenix Park. An estimated 500,000 people are expected to attend with thousands more watching the live footage from around the world.\nRector of Clonard Monastery Fr Noel Kehoe said that the parish is running a bus to the weekend events in Dublin “on Friday” and that he will be staying “to attend both the festival of Families and attend the Papal Mass”.\nParish Manager at St Oliver Plunkett Parish Glen Phillips told the Andersonstown News that Pope Francis’ visit had created “such a buzz within the parish”.\n“We have a coach leaving tomorrow  so that parishioners can attend the WMOF Congress in the RDS.\n“A number of families from the parish will also be attending the Festival of Families in Croke Park on Saturday and we are also running a coach to the Papal Mass in Phoenix Park on Sunday.\n “There is such a buzz around the parish as the Papal visit approaches. Many older parishioners remember Pope John Paul II’s visit and many young parishioners were brought up on stories about it. Pope Francis is re-invigorating the Church and many parishioners want to be part of that and show support for him,” he said.\nSt John’s Church was proudly displaying its bunting and Papal flags as parishioners filed out from Mass on Wednesday morning. Parish Manager Conor Neeson explained how some of the decorations had stood the test of time and dated back to John Paul II’s visit.\n“We will have a number of buses on from Friday morning taking parishioners down to Dublin for the Pope’s visit. As part of the Falls Road Pastoral Community, parishioners from Corpus Christi, St John’s, St Mary’s, St Paul’s and St Peter’s Cathedral will all be travelling this weekend. There is a great sense of occasion and I’ll be staying behind to organise the parish hall for the Mass on Sunday as we will be screening it live,” he said.\nChair of the Pastoral Council Annette Hinchcliffe said she will be attending the Mass along with her teenage children and had also been part of history when she travelled down on the train to see John Paul II say Mass in 1979.\n“Many of our elderly population in the parish would have loved to have attended the Mass on Sunday but a lot of the instructions about once people get off their buses is the walk to Phoenix Park which is a possible three miles. We thought it would be nice to bring everyone together to give them a flavour of the day so that they wouldn’t just be watching it in the house. Our parishioners will have an opportunity to come to the parish centre to watch the Mass and be with the other people in their parish,” she said.\nParishioner Frances McEvoy told us: “I’m going down today  for the different discussions and events that are taking place over the next couple of days each day ending with a Mass and I’m looking forward to enjoying the weekend celebrations as well.\n“I was in Phoenix Park whenever John Paul II came and I think this Pope has the same charisma. I think he will be very welcomed despite all that is going on at the minute.\n“It’s very exciting. I was in Rome before Christmas staying with friends and I was at one of his meetings, when he meets the people on a Wednesday. The atmosphere when he walks in is just incredible. There is definitely  something about him. I think despite in terms of some of the negative publicly there has been around the visit he will speak to the people and he speaks from his heart,” she said.\nAt an extremely busy The Holy Shop in city centre’s Chapel Lane sales assistants Maura McShane and Teresa Nolan told us how there had been “great interest” in their Pope Francis memorabilia ahead of the highly anticipated visit.\n“We have rosary beads, candles, framed photos of Pope Francis and prayer cards all to mark his visit for the World Meeting of Families,” explained Teresa. “He is a very popular Pope and the amount of our customers going this weekend to see him is unreal,” she said.\nMaura said that many people were calling in since staff created their window display and there was a real “excitement” with people ahead of the weekend.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mixed bag for belfast sides in antrim championships","story":"\n\nTHE Antrim\n

pre-game lead when Michael Bradley cracked home an early goal and while Kevin Barry McShane responded in kind for The Town, a Conor Johnston goal from a penalty gave the Whiterock side a 2-11 to 1-10 half-time lead.\nIt was plain sailing for the hosts in the second period with Johnston and Mícéal Dudley clipping over the scores and while Dermott McShane goaled for Ballycastle, this tie has long been settled.\nSt John’s will enter Group Two where the first game took place on Saturday lunchtime with Loughgiel romping to a 6-22 to 0-7 win over a badley depleted Rossa.\nShamrocks had this game decided by the break with Tiernan Coyle scrambling home their first goal on 13 minutes, while team captain, Shay Casey bagged two more before the interval to establish a 3-12 to 0-3 lead – Rossa’s scores coming from Stephen Beatty and Tiernan Murphy .\nThere was no let-up from Loughgiel in the second half as they emptied their bench.\nSian McGrath lobbed Danny Murray for goal number four on 51 minutes, while Dan McCloskey found the net twice more in the closing stages to complete the rout.\nIn Group One on Saturday evening, defending champions, Dunloy travelled to Cushendall and edged home

afternoon.\nMark Napier and Tomás O Cíarán hit first-half goals for St Gall’s before Conor Burke saw red, while Dessie McClean kept the Gorts in touch with a goal from a free to leave it 2-7 to 1-4 at the half.\nCJ McGourty and Jackson McGreevy plundered a further two St Gall’s goals early in the second half, but McGreevy and then Napier were both send off to leave them with a major disadvantage,\nHowever, Gort na Móna couldn’t take advantage with Darren Boyd’s goal with 10 to play ultimately proving mere consolation.\nEarlier in the day at Creggan, a badly depleted Lámh Dhearg were on the receiving end of a 3-21 o 0-1 defeat to Glenariffe.\nJohn Boyd hit the Red Hands’ only point of the game in the first half, but Glenariffe registered 2-11 in the opening period – Alex O’Boyle with their two goals.\nThere was no let-up from Oisin’s after the break as they piled on the scores and O’Boyle completed his hat-trick of goals to run out convincing winners.\n\nJunior Football Championship\nIn the Junior Football Championship on Friday, last year’s beaten finalists, St Patrick’s, Lisbirn eased to a 3-13 to 0-3 over Éire Óg at the Cricky.\nThe Lisburn men were well on top and were 0-9 to 0-1 ahead at the break with Eoin Fay, Shane McEvoy and Josh McMullan catching the eye.\nMcMullan fisted home a goal early in the second period with Denver Taggart adding a second, while Cathal McMeel stroked home a penalty as Éire Óg crashed out.\nAt Woodlands, Pearse’s overcame newcomers, Laochra Loch Lao 3-18 to 1-3.\nThe North Belfast men asserted themselves from the start with goals from Conaill Campbell and Daniel Magee and while Feargal Mac Ionnrachtaigh netter just before the break, Pearse’s still held a healthy 2-9 to 1-2 lead.\nThe New Lodge men kept driving forward in the second half and a third goal arrived from Liam Deegan from the penalty spot to wrap up their victory and place in the last eight.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"6m northern ireland housing

groundbreaking multi-million pound housing scheme will see 40 homes built in a factory before being delivered in modules to the construction site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nThe £6.2m project launched by Clanmil Housing Group will be a mix of family homes, apartments and bungalows. \n\nThe new social housing will be located on the site of the former Woodside\u0027s Foodstore in Carrickfergus. \n\nThe homes, each made up of six steel-framed components, will be manufactured and fully fitted out by McAvoy Construction in its Lisburn factory. \n\nThe parts will then be transported on lorries to Carrickfergus, where they will be lifted by crane on to foundations and pieced together within a day, ready for connection to gas, electricity and water lines. \n\nThe homes are fully kitted out with kitchens, bathrooms, windows, flooring and decorated walls. \n\nThe rented properties will be priced at £60 per week for a one-bed apartment and £70 per week for a two-bed apartment.\n\nThe average weekly rent for a house is £82.\n\nThe development is scheduled to be completed by spring of next year. \n\nClanmil development manager Jan Sloan said: \"We are very excited and very proud to

Contact newseditor@belfasttelegraph \n\nNorth Belfast SDLP MLA Nichola Mallon described it as \"unacceptable that our health workers have once again been underpaid by the Business Services Organisation \".\n\nShe called on the Belfast Trust to \"take immediate action to ensure all underpaid staff get their full wages within the next few days\".\n\nShe stated: \"I have been contacted by a number of Belfast Trust staff who discovered today that they have been underpaid this month, some by up to several hundred pounds. These workers have direct debits and bills to pay and if this is not rectified as a matter of urgency they will be pushed into debt.\"\n\nIn March 2014, the Business Services Organisation  took over the processing of healthcare salaries in Northern Ireland. But it has been blighted by problems, with a 2016 payroll glitch affecting almost 2,500 staff.\n\n\"This is the latest in a litany of wage blunders suffered by healthcare workers since this new pay system, which cost some £15m, was implemented,\" said Ms Mallon.\n\n\"I have been in contact with the chief executive of the Belfast Trust to ask for assurances that all staff members will receive their correct wages immediately.\"\n\nMs Mallon said she understood the Belfast Trust\u0027s Human Resources director is to make contact with BSO first thing this morning \"to get to the bottom of the issue and urgently resolve the matter\".\n\nShe said she had asked for an update from the HR director after these discussions.\n\n\"Overpayments in wages are quickly corrected. Underpayments should be no different,\" said Ms Mallon.\n\n\"Staff must be paid what they are owed and have worked hard for as a matter of urgency.\n\n\"There are clearly long running problems with the salary system that BSO and the Trust must take wider action on.\n\n\"I have asked for an update from BSO\u0027s HR director as soon as the issue is rectified.\"\n\nYesterday, a spokesperson for the Belfast Trust stated: \"This was brought to the attention of Belfast Trust today. We are committed to ensuring staff receive their correct pay. We will work with BSO colleagues as a matter of urgency to address this concerning matter for all staff affected.\"\n\nA BSO spokesman said: \"We are aware of the situation and are working with BHSCT to resolve matters as quickly as possible. We are also working with staff who are experiencing difficulties.

In the interim, management have done nothing to address their broken relationship with the workforce indeed they have attempted to play workers against each other by misrepresenting our criticism of senior management in the HR department as being criticism of those employed by the department as a whole,\" Mr Parry said.\n\n\"What is more, they have added insult to injury by claiming to be unaware of what is at the root of the workforces’ concerns.\n\n“Senior management in the council have adopted a heavy-handed approach in negotiations around job matching and restructuring around the establishment of the new Super-Council under the Review of Public Administration. They have also failed to engage through the formal negotiating structures with the trade unions.\"\n\nMr Parry called on the council\u0027s management to intervene before it\u0027s too late.\n\n“The trade unions have offered a series of dates for talks with management at the Labour Relations Agency. Following the failure of management to respond to this offer, the unions have been left with no choice but to proceed to a consultative ballot on industrial action. This is a historic mark of shame for the council as this is the first time that all four unions representing the workforce have jointly balloted for action.\n\n“The industrial ballot will open for ten days commencing Friday August 31st. In the meantime the workforce will hold a protest at the upcoming council meeting in Downshire Civic Centre on Monday September 3rd. \n\n\"In order to avoid any further escalation, the trade unions are calling on the councillors intervene to ensure that the Chief Executive and his senior team adopt a more constructive approach to resolving this dispute”, Mr Perry said.\n\nThe Belfast  has contacted Newry, Mourne and Down Council for a response to the criticism. \n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It was a big shock and we are still getting our heads around it.\n\n\"When we got the diagnosis and they said they would make a referral for her to see an orthopaedic surgeon, but it would take at least four months, so we went to see a private consultant.\n\n\"The consultant said he could offer her a brace, and we asked him if he could guarantee it would keep the condition at bay.\n\n\"He said no, that it could progress, and that they would X-ray her six months after the brace and if it progressed they would refer her for fusion.\n\n\"That would involve fusing her spine with rods and screws which could limit her mobility and growth.\"\n\nIn search of a treatment which would allow her daughter to continue with her passion for dancing, Mandy began to research the condition and came across vertebral body tethering  - a procedure not available here.\n\n\"It is a keyhole surgery and it doesn\u0027t affect growth. They put a \u0027cord\u0027 between each vertebrae so the spine will continue to grow,\" she explained. \"It\u0027s not a 100% fix, but it will straighten the curvature to maybe 10 degrees and it\u0027s a one-off, less invasive operation than fusion.\n\n\"We have found a surgeon in Turkey who has advised us to act fast, as the curvature is already 45 degrees, and if she continues to grow it will get worse.\n\n\"Another 10 to 15 degrees and she will no longer be a candidate for VBT.\n\n\"The surgery costs £35,000 and the surgeon said he would take her before the new school term started.

They May \nhttps:t.co/bXdvx6ynuo\n\n— The Citizen News  \nAugust 27, 2018\n\n\n\n\n“While the governments of Australia and the United States have taken official positions on South Africa’s land issues, the United Kingdom is likely to take a more diplomatic approach on the surface,” the paper says.\n\nMrs May’s trip is primarily billed as an opportunity to highlight opportunities for trade after Brexit.\n\n\nFor the first time since becoming Prime Minister in 2016, \n#TheresaMay\n will be visiting South Africa before heading to Nigeria and Kenya as part of a trade mission aimed at boosting post-Brexit fortunes. \npic.twitter/5m1VE1HQVs\n\n— SABC News Online  \nAugust 27, 2018\n\n\n\n\nAs she touched down in Cape Town, The Agenda, a television news and current affairs programme, held a Twitter poll of viewers, asking them if they believed closer ties with Britain after Brexit would benefit Africa.\n\nAfter several hundred votes were cast, the poll suggested a majority thought it would not.\n\n\n– Nigeria\n\n\nNext stop on Mrs May’s trade tour is Nigeria – where German Chancellor Angela Merkel will also visit this week.\n\nThe Nation, a daily paper based in Lagos, highlights that the trip comes after French President Emmanuel Macron visited earlier this year.\n\n\nUK PM May for Abuja, Lagos tomorrwow \nhttps:t.co/b0olsdyse3\n\n— The Nation Nigeria  \nAugust 28, 2018\n\n\n\n\nAhead of Mrs May’s arrival, former vice president Atiku Abubakar, who is running for the leadership, said Brexit could “blow life back into the old relationships in the Commonwealth and fan the fires of progress and prosperity in Nigeria and across Africa”.\n\nWriting in the UK’s , he said: “My sincere belief is that Brexit can be a great force for good. It could blow down barriers which have prevented Nigeria and other countries from grasping their potential.”\n\n\n– Kenya\n\n\nThe last call of Mrs May’s trip is Kenya.\n\nOne of the country’s largest papers, the Daily Nation, tells its readers her visit “could not come at a more difficult time” for the Prime Minister – referring to divisions in the Tory Party over Brexit.\n\n“Mrs May needs all the good news she can get,” an article says.\n\nIt adds of the visit: “Unofficially of course, it is another attempt to reassure the British public that the UK is capable of “going it alone” after Brexit and forging new trade deals with Commonwealth partners and other major economic powers like China and the US.”\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May meets Kenya’s President Uhuru Kenyatta in London in 2017 \n\n\n\n\nNairobi-based The Star says Mrs May’s visit comes as President Uhuru Kenyatta grapples with funding for his “big four” agenda.\n\nThe leader, who has been visiting Donald Trump in the US, is aiming to introduce universal healthcare and affordable housing, improve food security and increase manufacturing.\n\n“The president and his delegation are keen to tap from foreign investment,” the paper says.\n\nIt adds: “It is expected Nairobi will be pushing for the establishment of a British visa processing centre in the country.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch a woman complete tony hawks famous skateboarding loop","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

She pulled it just after our \n@nextvr\n event ended. It was an inspiring display of fierce determination and skill, and we at \n@birdhouse\n are incredibly proud. \npic.twitter/8ekbUrxkOr\n\n— Tony Hawk  \nAugust 27, 2018\n\n\n\n\nIf that spectacular trick wasn’t impressive enough, in the next video posted by Hawk he explains some of the history behind The Loop, which he first came across from pictures of failed attempts in a magazine.\n\n\nMy brief history of looping, made for BBHJ tour when we added one to the show in 2003. On Sunday at 3:30pm PST a whole new crew will be trying it for the first time. You can watch it live for free on any VR headset or on your phone through the \n@nextvr\n app. 🌀👀 \npic.twitter/TrMacuwkrn\n\n— Tony Hawk  \nAugust 24, 2018\n\n\n\n\nHawk himself hasn’t completed The Loop for 15 years, last doing so on tour in 2003, and has injured himself many times trying it, once breaking his pelvis.\n\n“It’s hard to explain it,” Hawk said. “If you’ve done it, you’ve checked it off the list. I’m not going to get the same gratification. \n\n“It’s not like a trick you do and want to keep doing. And I have paid the price for it.”\n\nHawk’s latest adventure with The Loop was part of a live virtual reality broadcast in San Diego with NextVR, which allowed viewers to watch the skaters in 3D.\n\nNone of the skaters Hawk invited to try The Loop had completed it before, and included in the group was Felipe Nunes, a teenage double-amuptee – seen here practising with stunt pads.\n\n\nHere’s Felipe Nunes getting a test run in preparation for our live loop challenge, tomorrow at 3:30pm PT, only in the \n@NextVR\n app. \n#HawkLoopinVR\n \npic.twitter/Wn7sdooH4O\n\n— Tony Hawk  \nAugust 26, 2018\n\n\n\n\nHawk said they use pads “so people can start to get used to the timing and feel of doing it in its natural state”.\n\n“If you don’t know what you’re doing and you go at it without ever trying it and there are no pads in place, it can be very dangerous,” he said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"french environment minister resigns in blow to macron","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

You’ve probably seen him in Sandinos, The Guildhall Taphouse, Rodden’s in Buncrana or the Grand Central.\n\nThe whole point of these articles is to highlight the importance of the local music scene and he and his brother Christy are widely regarded as innovators in the dance music fraternity, with tributes from Celtronic and other DJs piled up on Facebook since the terrible news seeped out last Saturday night.\n\nI’m a rocker myself and came quite late to the dance party, but God love him John did his best to educate me. \n\nHe had been for a number of years one of them Derry faces I was familiar with but had no name or conversation to put with it. \n\nOver the years of being his friend I was always amazed by the education he gave me, people I should at least give a chance to listen to and always revere Michael Jackson for he is the source of all that is good in music….at least it wasn’t The Beatles.\n\nWe eventually became friends over a shared love of music, films and a weird sense of humour. \n\nOur conversations always returned to music and would almost certainly contain the words Boards of Canada. \n\nAs a vinyl collector it was John who encouraged me to get into DJing myself so for all those who’ve endured my weird sets, it was his fault entirely.\n\nI spent many a night with him while he was on in Sandino’s and developed an appreciation for music.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nI would have otherwise never entertained, I attribute my love of Prince to his sets which goes to show a DJ has done their job right if they’ve turned at least one person on to something. \n\nJust as I’m writing this I wish I had referred to him as Jimmy Rabbitte from The Commitments at least once, he had been playing the Courteeners way before any of us had even heard of them and he was the first to realise they were s***.\n\nNot only did John entertain people with other people’s music but he made his own music, he never let me hear it though. \n\nI’m sure somebody out there has heard it and it won’t be lost. \n\nKnowing John the Greek as I did I’m sure it has his perfectionist stamp all over it.\n\nI could get carried away and paint him as a one-dimensional character and forget his many other loves, including the great outdoors and adventures. \n\nI have been privy to jumping in a car with John without actually asking for a plan and ending in Donegal for the day in absolute sobriety and perfect gratitude for the beautiful scenery and the many things we could do for free right on our own doorstep.\n\nI can’t miss the opportunity to point out two facts here, the first that John was actually a fairly decent barber, which leads to the second fact that once upon a time I used to have hair and he was my personal stylist – although he eventually admitted defeat and suggested accepting baldness and shaving it off!\n\nTributes have come in from all over, the bars and their staff he entertained in will miss him terribly, his ability to know what song to play isn’t that common, nor is the warmth and humour he exuded. His funeral was a testament to the love he showed the world with each of us leaving under no doubt that there is a time to moonwalk.\n\nI’ve waffled on enough and these memories are my own, but they are great memories and I will always look back with a smile. \n\nI’m glad I knew The Greek and I hope that your memories make you smile and hope our love is of comfort to Sophie, his parents and sisters Mia and Angela and their families.\n\n\n\nIf anyone reading this, musician or otherwise feels that they need help get in touch with Help Musicians here https:www.musicmindsmatter.org.uk/ or call 0207 239 9101 or contact Samaritans 028 7126 5511.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn fein slammed opportunistic civil rights commemoration set take place derry october","story":"\nA member of the civil rights movement who was involved in the historic march on October 5, 1968, has criticised Sinn Féin for organising a commemoration parade to mark its 50th anniversary later this year.\n\nAidan McKinney, who is a member of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Committee, said the parade organised for October 6, 2018, is ‘opportunistic’ on the part of Sinn Féin and ‘they should be ashamed of distorting a seminal moment in the history’ of Derry and Northern Ireland.\n\nOn the parades commission website the applicant listed is the ‘Sinn Fein Commemoration Committee’ and the proposed route for marchers will take in Duke Street, Craigavon Bridge, Carlisle Road, Ferryquay Street, the Diamond, Shipquay Street and finish at Guildhall Square.\n\nThe original planned route by the Derry Housing Action Committee  and Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association , was planned to end at The Diamond on October 5, 1968. \n\nHowever, the march ended at Duke Street due to a banning order signed by William Craig, Stormont\u0027s Minister for Home Affairs, where peaceful demonstrators were met with unwarranted police brutality, including four Westminster MPs.\n\nSpeaking to the Derry News, Mr McKinney said he is both ‘fearful’ and ‘highly sceptical’ as to why a ‘single political entity’ would select that date and route. \n\n“However, to be kind or naive, hopefully they feel that what was organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association on those dates, a totally peaceful protest and a willingness to endure state violence, is recognised and commended as the proper and unselfish approach to correcting existing wrongs in Northern Ireland,” he said\n\n“When the combined words ‘Civil Rights’ are used it is generally accepted that all genuine supporters embrace the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. \n\n“Its first articles include: The right to equality and freedom from discrimination The right to life, liberty and personal security.\n\n“These humanitarian rights were enshrined for all of us with an expectation that globally such would be implemented as part of our personal and collective social interactions. \n\n“If this is clearly understood and promoted, as part of these planned events, it is to be welcomed. If not, then they will fail to absorb and highlight, the true spirit of \u002768.”\n\nMr McKinney questioned why an application for the parade was put forward as early as March and whether Sinn Féin felt major civil rights\u0027 concerns, ‘not least a non-functioning government resulting in adverse social consequences, were irrelevant and had no great immediacy?’\n\nHe pointed to the significance of that date in Derry and the north’s history which is recognised by lowly-paid, unemployed, homeless and the disenfranchised as a ‘a turning point for radical political, social and economic reforms in Northern Ireland.’\n\n“October 5th 1968,” he explained, “is a date linked to an era of hope when pro-democracy citizens banded together to achieve equality for all sections of our population, following the examples of Gandhi and Dr. Martin L. King. \n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“If this historic analysis is distorted by sectarianism it will transpire that there are no limits on what this organisation would do to \u0027legitimize\u0027 themselves.\n\n“The NICRA was a non-party political cross-community organisation which gave the people of Northern Ireland an aspiration that radical change was possible. It created a vehicle whereby all were enabled to participate in a non-violent manner.\n\n“It seems blatantly partisan for one political group, rather than adopting a broad-front approach to contemporary issues, to proceed with a demonstration that suggests an opportunistic attempt to usurp the date and message of NICRA in 1968.\n\n“If that is the case, as many former campaigners and others from a wide range of backgrounds believe, then they should be ashamed of distorting a seminal moment in the history of this place to attract short-sighted populist gain via unpredictable media attention, alongside the inherent dangers, e.g. uncontrollable violent elements.”\n\nIn response Sinn Féin provided a statement from Tyrone MP Francie Molloy who said the party ‘were and remain’ at the forefront of civil rights and social justice campaigns. \n\nHe commented: “Fifty years ago, likeminded people from all communities, including republicans – outraged by the routine injustice and sectarianism of the six county state - came together to form the Civil Rights movement.\n\n“To mark the 50th anniversary of the civil rights march in Derry, Sinn Féin have organised a commemorative march from Duke Street to Guildhall Square, along the original planned route of the march. \n\n“Republicans were to the fore of and remain to the fore of civil rights and social justice campaigns. We would welcome anyone who feels the same to join us.”\n\nSurviving leaders and supporters of the original march were said to have met last November in Belfast City Hall where they decided on a programme of events.\n\nIt is noteworthy, Mr McKinney said, that \u002768 veterans at the initial meeting unanimously voted down a public commemorative demonstration ‘to avoid what may have been interpreted as a coat-trailing exercise’ thereby avoiding any possible violence on the streets. \n\n“It was agreed that such incidents would be highly injurious to the civil rights\u0027 cause, with resultant harmful images of our struggling city and general population, via regional and global media,” he said.\n\nA three-day programme of events will run at the Guildhall from October 4-7 to mark the international Civil Rights Festival, commemorating the 50th Anniversary of Duke Street Civil Rights March, which will see the Irish President Michael D Higgins make a keynote address.\n\nThe event was launched by 50th Anniversary Civil Rights Commemoration Committee last week, and will explore the civil rights\u0027 legacy through documentation, conferences, films and other educational activities.\n\n\nABOVE - Aidan McKinney, far right, pictured with some of the key figures of the Civil Rights Movement with then then President Mary McAleese during her visit to the Guildhall in Derry to mark the 40th anniversary in October 2008.

In April, Newry, Mourne and Down Council also backed the campaign to retain the sweeping beam at the lighthouse, vehemently rejecting the controversial proposal to remove it.\n\nSpeaking following Sunday\u0026rsquos community protest, Mr Hazzard said: \u0026ldquoFor 150 years the iconic sweeping beam from St John\u0026rsquos Point Lighthouse h\u0026nbsp as been a fundamental part of life for those of us who live and work in East Down.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe Commissioners of Irish Lights current proposals to alter this beam as a result of their planned refurbishments of the lighthouse are unacceptable and are therefore opposed by both heritage campaigners and the local community.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe have unfortunately seen CIL\u0026rsquos modernisation policy diminish the unique character of Irish lighthouses in recent years.\n\n\u0026ldquoRecent problems at Tory Island, Mew Island and Fastnet are a timely reminder as to why we must not tamper with the special heritage at St John\u0026rsquos.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe message remains the same \u0026mdash leave our light alone.\n\nLocal Sinn F\u0026eacutein Cllr John Rice, who also attended the protest, added: \u0026ldquoSt John\u0026rsquos Point is one of the most iconic pieces of social heritage that we can offer.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe light itself can be seen right across the constituency and it is something that locals enjoy greatly from as far as the Mournes and Slieve Croob.\n\n\u0026ldquoI like most other people grew up always admiring this great light house and I feel that the Irish Lighthouse authority must stop their proposed changes immediately.\n\nEileen Peters, one of the local campaigners, said the protest was chosen to coincide with International Lighthouse weekend.\n\nShe said Captain McCabe from CIL made a \u0026ldquosurprise entrance with plans for the lighthouse \u0026ldquowhich unfortunately, are still at iance with those of the local community.\n\n\u0026ldquoHe presented the case for a replacement light, which he claims would provide the same beam as the original, said Ms Peters. \u0026ldquoThis cannot be the case as the range of the light would be reduced by several miles.\n\nMs Peters also argued CIL had not taken into account reports by eminent toxicologists on the safe use of mercury in lighthouses, or the findings of the Royal Society\u0026rsquos Publication on the detrimental effects of LED lighting on epifaunal marine communities.\n\nMs Peters said that following their extensive research and campaigning they were \u0026ldquodismayed at the ease in which the heritage of Irish is discarded.\n\n\u0026ldquoLecale Lightkeepers would like to thank the local community and all who made their way to the lighthouse on Saturday for their support, she said. \u0026ldquoWe are grateful to Chris Hazzard MP, Cllr Dermot Curran and Cllr John Rice for attending today\u0026rsquos event, and thank Cllrs Patrick Brown and Gareth Sharvin for their good wishes.\n\nAhead of Sunday\u0026rsquos protest CIL said it had confirmed its commitment to retain the sweeping beam with an LED light.\n\nA spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the Commissioners of Irish Lights ongoing investment programme to maintain and modernise its aids to navigation, planned work at St. John\u0026rsquos Point Lighthouse will deliver environmental, safety and cost benefits and is part of the continuing investment programme of maintenance, upkeep and modernisation of our coastal services to the mariner.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThe main programme of works at St John\u0026rsquos Lighthouse, due to take place in the coming years, is the replacement of the light source with a new LED light. This light source will be housed within the original Fresnel lens and there will be no changes to the visual structure of the light source. The new LED light will maintain its sweeping beam and will use less than 30 watts compared with the previous 1000 watt lamp thus improving its environmental footprint and removing the need for a diesel generator at the station. It will also allow the removal of mercury from the station.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoIrish Lights has addressed previously held concerns relating to the sweeping beam and has reiterated that the solution being considered for St John\u0026rsquos Point will ensure that the beam will retain its sweeping feature and rotating lens will be unaffected visually.\n\n\u0026ldquoSince this project was first proposed in 2016, Irish Lights has engaged with local stakeholders, including Lecale Lightkeepers, on the replacement of the lens, and has taken on board key concerns raised by these groups and will continue to engage with the community on an ongoing basis to ensure the unique lighthouse heritage is protected.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoIrish Lights is currently trialling a system that will allow the lens to rotate in the same manner it currently does and will engage with the local community once again when this trial project comes to a final conclusion. When the project is in a position to progress Irish Lights will continue to consult with the local community and will ensure all planning and heritage requirements are met.\n\n\u0026ldquoIrish Lights respects the right to protest however urges members of the public to be cognisant of tenants and tourists who are currently residing at St John\u0026rsquos Point Lighthouse.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Celtic tournament success  ","story":"\t\t\t\nTHE club\u0026rsquos fourth annual youth tournament took place in Dunleath Park at the weekend and it was another overwhelming success with 70 teams participating over the course of Friday evening and Saturday morning.\u0026nbsp\n\nCeltic Bhoys would like to thank all the clubs who participated in the tournament along with the players and spectators who attended on both days.\u0026nbsp\n\nFurthermore, they would like to thank all all those who worked behind the scenes with the club including Newry, Mourne and Down Council Officials Davy Duggan,Tony McShane, Rita, Lewis and all their support staff for the logistical support and the marking out off the 7-a-side pitches.\u0026nbsp\n\nSpecial thanks also goes to the local referees who officiated during the tournament and last, but certainly not least, all the club volunteers who once again outdid themselves to make it all possible.\n\nTraining has now recommenced for all the club\u0026rsquos youth teams.

The unacceptable delay of 17 minutes has caused us concern, the letter stated.\n\nBut the letter ended by warning that people who disregard advice and put to sea in unstable craft in bad conditions usually preclude rescue attempts.\n\nNEWCASTLE \u0026mdash Bulldozers moved in at the weekend to begin work in Newcastle\u0026rsquos new street widening scheme \u0026mdash and one of the first landmarks of the seaside resort to get the chop was the street wall at Central Promenade.\n\nThe scheme, which should eliminate Newcastle\u0026rsquos chic-a-bloc summer traffic jams, will take more than a year to complete.\n\nIn the meantime diversions and changes in traffic flow are in operation, the main change being at Bryansford Road, which will now carry two-way traffic, and at the main access to Donard Park, which will now become an exit only, with entry beside Patton\u0026rsquos Bridge.\n\nCASTLEWELLAN \u0026mdash A Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, has offered a \u0026pound200 reward in an all-out bid to catch the thieves who stole several thousand pounds from her on Saturday.\n\nA shocked Mrs Smyth told the Recorder that over \u0026pound5,000 worth of assorted furniture was taken and that she may have little chance of recovering it.\n\nThe burglary, described by Mrs Syth, as a \u0026ldquowell organised and large scale operation, occurred in the early hours when she was asleep at her home in Ballywillwill.\n\n\u0026ldquoMy husband and I were awakened by a notice outside. My husband got up and saw people outside. They had already loaded a van with furniture and were packing other items into a car, she said.\n\nMrs Smyth plans to do everything possible to bring the burglars to justice. \u0026ldquoI am offering \u0026pound200 as a reward in an attempt to get information about the incident. I would be satisfied just to know that the offenders were safely behind bars.\n\n\u0026ldquoSomeone in the area must know who was responsible and I only hope that this reward may help in tracing them.\n\nPORTAFERRY \u0026mdash Portaferry police are investigating a mystery death which occurred in the town on Saturday. The body of 47 year-old Mr John Glenn Clugston was found lying in a tent in afield adjacent to Mountain Road.\n\nA police spokesman said that the man lived in Dundonald and that foul play was not suspected.\n\nQUOILE \u0026mdash A killer weed which has poisoned several cattle and sheep along the upper reaches of the Quoile River has brought a warning for local farmers to be on their guard.\n\nSo far the deaths have occurred on a stretch on the river between Drumaness and Rademon, but the weed is believed to be spreading.\n\nDepartment of Agriculture experts have confirmed that is Water wart, which is highly poisonous to livestock. In this case it is believed that some of the weed has found its way into the river and has been washed up on the banks.\n\nThe death toll up to now includes a cow, a bullock and three sheep. In each case the poisoned animals had access to the river or one of its tributaries.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Agriculture said the weed resembles the more common and harmless \u0026lsquoFools Parsley\u0026rsquo, but is regarded as the most poisonous plant growing in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u0026ldquoIf farmers find it on their land the safest thing they can do is to dig it up entirely and destroy it, the spokesman said. \u0026ldquoHowever, great care must be taken to do this properly. Roots must not be left lying about.\n\nCOMBER \u0026mdash More than 6,000 \u0026lsquoBlackmen\u0026rsquo from all over Co Down will parade through Comber on Saturday for the annual August procession of the Royal Black Institution.\n\nThis is the first time in 13 years that the procession has been held in Comber and some 118 preceptories will be taking part, led by an equally high number of bands.\n\nComber, being the host district, will front the parade and others will follow in numerical order. A huge public turnout is excepted and the parade will be setting off from a field on the Ballygowan Road at 12.30pm.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash A compensation dispute with a landowner is now the only obstacle to Downpatrick\u0026rsquos long-awaited new car park behind Irish Street.\n\nThe car park plans were given full approval by local planners this week and a spokesman for the Department of the Environment\u0026rsquos Roads Service branch in Downpatrick said that work was hoped to get underway in this financial year.\n\nHe revealed that one landowner is still blocking the plans because he is unhappy with the compensation being offered. If no agreement is reached with him the land might have to be vested, meaning a lengthy hold-up.\n\nWhen it does go ahead, the new car park will be built between Irish Street and Market Street and will hold up to 80 cars.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe hope to enter the construction stage in this financial year because money is available, the Roads Service spokesman said. \u0026ldquoWe are very anxious to press on in an effort to provide good parking facilities at that end of the town.\n\nLOUGHISLANDREAVY \u0026mdash A builders hut at Loughinislandreavy, outside Castlewellan, was broken into on Thursday night. The hut belongs to McCartan and McAteer builders and rolls of steel wire and a pair of wire cutters were stolen.\n\nDUNDRUM \u0026mdash Heavy rain may have kept the numbers down, but \u0026pound8,000 was still raised at a garden fete organised by the William Keown Appeal Fund at Dundrum Castle on Saturday. The money raised will go towards the Northern Ireland Council for Orthopaedic Development.\n\nThe fete was opened by Mr William Harvey and comperes for the afternoon\u0026rsquos activities were Commander Bill Martin and Mr Christy Brown.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe main events were a bonny baby competition, a children\u0026rsquos fancy dress contest, children\u0026rsquos sports and a closely contested tug \u0026lsquoo war.\n\nBetween the ious events the RUC Silver Band played a selection of popular tunes and helped to keep everyone\u0026rsquos spirits up in spite of the bad weather.\n\nGAA \u0026mdash Down\u0026rsquos senior footballers failed in their bid to reach their first All-Ireland final since 1968 when they went under to a smooth and rampaging Dublin by a margin of 1-16 to 0-8 in Sunday\u0026rsquos semi-final at Croke Park.\n\nIt is doubtful if there is any team that could have lived with the \u0026lsquoDubs\u0026rsquo as they hit top form in this entertaining game in front of a crowd of 50,000.\n\nDown team: M McCabe, T McGovern, M Turley, M Sands, C Digney , B Toner, P Murtagh, C McAlarney , L Austin , B Gardner, M Cunningham, W Walsh , J Byrne, P Rooney, J Digney.
