a replica of the pictures from their engagement shoot           The Duchess of Sussex giggled as her husband had his beard stroked by a youngster in Croke Park stadium  Meghan met three-year-old Walter Cullen, who playfully tugged at her hair while she was turned the other way          Nonplussed by  her status, three-year-old Walter giggled after he pulled at the Duchess of Sussex\u0027s hair          Little Walter Cullen tried to hide behind his hands as he was gently told not to pull Meghan\u0027s hair           Later in the day, Harry and Meghan paid a visit to Dogpatch Labs, which is one of Europe\u0027s leading startup hubs           During the visit, the royal couple were treated to a \u0027tech display\u0027 by children taking part in an initiative called CodaDojo           Meghan looked animated as she and Harry spoke to children during their tour of the DogPatch Labs in Dublin today           The pair looked fascinated as the young people involved explained the work they do as part of the programme           Harry and Meghan looked relaxed as they conducted a busy day of engagements, including a tour of the DogPatch Labs          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex took part in a round table discussion during the visit to the leading start-up hub          Harry and Meghan were greeted by crowds of well-wishers as they conducted their second day of engagements today           Harry happily let a cheeky youngster play with his beard during his walkabout of the Croke Park stadium            Prince Harry was gifted a Hurley and Sliotar by one adorable youngster at Croke Park stadium    The Duke and Duchess headed onto the pitch where they watched traditional Gaelic sports being played          Harry opted for a slightly more dressed-down look at the stadium, wearing a light grey blazer, simple white shirt and blue desert boots          Prince Harry was animated as he chatted with two young players at the stadium, who giggled away at his antics          Harry and Meghan were relaxed as they chatted with players taking part in a Gaelic games demonstration          The couple had the opportunity to talk to players, many of whom are involved with community outreach projects that encourage the use of sports for social goodThe couple walked around the frighteningly realistic bronze statues with their sculptor, Rowan Gillespie, and Mike Murphy, editor of The Famine Atlas, who talked them through some of the stark realities of the tragedy for the people of his country.Mr Murphy said afterwards that the couple clearly had some understanding of the famine and what it meant to the people of Ireland but had been genuinely shocked at what they learnt.\u0027In fairness they definitely had a background understanding but were shocked to hear the nitty gritty,\u0027 he said.\u0027Harry mentioned several times at how appalling it was that we don\u0027t seem to have learnt the lessons of the past and we are still seeing famine and food shortages around the world today. \u0027 Sculptor Mr Gillespie added: \u0027This is a living monument and they were genuinely and powerfully moved by what they saw. They were very conscious that this isn\u0027t just about history, that this thing is still going on around us today and it\u0027s relevant to what we do today. The couple both managed to make a speedy change of clothes before arriving at Croke Park museum\u0027Every inidual is moved by what they see, which is incredibly rewarding. It is an incredibly important story between Britain and Ireland.\u0027They were profoundly moved to see the memorial and hear the story behind it. It is part of our joint histories.\u0027Meghan was very strong on the link with the city of Toronto where she lived and Harry spent a lot of time. The city only had 18,000 inhabitants but as those ships came across in their droves, Toronto took in 38,000 disease-ridden, starving famine victims. In the stadium museum the couple saw replica jerseys used in the film Michael Collins, which depicted the shooting, as well as the whistle used by the referee that day and a match ticket.They also saw club records featuring Collins, a key figure in the Irish independence movement, from when he was secretary of the Geraldines GAA club in London between 1909 and 1915. It was the IRA operation led by Collins to kill 14 undercover British intelligence agents operating in Dublin - known as the Cairo Gang - that led to the security forces opening fire on the crowd at Croke Park.Out on the pitch they watched as groups of boys and girls played hurling, camogie - the women\u0027s equivalent - Gaelic football and \u0027fun and run\u0027, a rounders-like game designed to be inclusive for people with disabilities. As the couple met Joe Canning, the Galway player who is regarded as one of the modern greats of hurling and is a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for Ireland, Harry told him: \u0027Apparently you\u0027re like a god.\u0027Harry also met a red-headed boy in wheelchair, Nathan Kiely, seven, and told him how impressed he was with his freckles. Jennifer Lawless, 22, an intern from North Carolina, said: \u0027He said, \u0027You have more freckles than I have. Lovely freckles!\u0027Although the couple were both given hurleys - the curved stick used to hit the ball, or sliotar, in hurling - the duke passed up on the opportunity of having a go himself.It is, however, very difficult: even Joe Canning missed his first shot at goal when he was showing the couple how it was done by the experts. \u0027The first one was a disaster,\u0027 he said. \u0027I had to redeem myself with the second one.\u0027He added about the duke not having a go: \u0027He didn\u0027t want to do it. I was thinking he might, but he will stick to the soccer later on, I think.\u0027          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex met a youngster taking part in a Gaelic games demonstration          Undeterred by the drizzle, the Duchess of Sussex even braved the grassy pitch in her stiletto heels  In 2011, Harry\u0027s grandparents The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh visited the arena, as part of their historic state visit to IrelandAs the couple walked round the hallowed turf, Meghan in her high heels, one onlooker said: \u0027I would guess that that is the first time a pair of stilettos has been seen on the pitch.\u0027Chatting to youngsters from the hurling pitch, Harry picked up the hurley and said: \u0027That\u0027s really light, isn\u0027t it?\u0027Picking up a goalie\u0027s helmet, Harry asked Tom Whooley, nine, if he had ever been hit in the face by a ball. When he answered no, the duke asked him: \u0027Have you hit a ball into someone else\u0027s face? Not yet? Working on it!\u0027 \u0027Meghan was very well informed about this link and Harry knew a great deal too. They were very conscious of this.\u0027While the couple were viewing the memorial there a handful of cat calls from across the river.          Harry follows in the footsteps of  the Queen the Duke of Edinburgh who visited Ireland\u0027s largest and most iconic sporting arena, as part of their historic state visit to Ireland in 2011          The stadium is the venue for the highest profile events on the Irish sporting calendarOne man and a woman could be heard shouting Sinn Fein slogans and another lone man shouted a crude remark at the duchess. Neither appear to have heard it, however, said Mr Gillespie.The pair also met excitable fans - one of whom said Meghan had \u0027made her life\u0027. Dylan Mahon, who is from Grange Rath, Co Meath, is a member of St Colmcille\u0027s GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association) club who met Harry at Croke Park.Afterwards Harry told him: \u0027You might have a beard soon - you never know!\u0027The visit to Croke Park was a chance for the couple to see children being coached in traditional Irish games. But it was also an opportunity for the duke and duchess, who are on the second day of their tour of Ireland, to see mementos of one of the most notorious days in Anglo-Irish history.On November 21, 1920, British forces opened fire at a Gaelic football match between Tipperary and Dublin, killing 14 spectators and players including the Tipperary captain Michael Hogan.The day, which became known as the original Bloody Sunday, has become enshrined in Irish folklore. But while the atrocity has lost none of its capacity to appal, a historic gesture of peace and forgiveness was made in 2011 when the Queen became the first monarch to be welcomed at Croke Park since the shooting.Now it is firmly on the itinerary for visiting members of the royal family.          At one point, Meghan urged Harry to have a go at hurling, but he politely declined to get involved     The couple chatted with the players who are involved with community outreach projects          Harry gave his wife a stern look as they held hands during their tour around the historic grounds          Croke Park is the headquarters of, the GAA. Prior to the Association buying the stadium in 1913, the grounds were privately owned    The couple were taken on a tour of the stadium\u0027s museum before going on to the pitch for a sports demonstration          The pair were pictured chatting and joking with young gaelic footballers at Croke Park           The Duke and Duchess heard about the important role that GAA plays in Irish life during their trip           The pair, accompanied by a security detail, strolled around the grounds of Croke Park           Meghan\u0027s second and final day in Dublin got off to a busy start performing two engagements before lunch time - and her wardrobe was equally busy          The Duchess of Sussex wore two outfits in the space of an hour and a half, in the form of an estimated total of £17,04 worth of designer labels  Meghan, 36, was pictured in a trouser suit for the first time since her wedding having last worn one to an awards event back in February             The couple looked delighted as they made their way out onto the pitch, despite the dismal weather           The pair were also shown exhibits from Croke Park\u0027s museum, including artefacts from the Bloody Sunday massacre          Meghan, 36, who brought one of her dogs to London when she relocated, looked delighted to meet the president\u0027s pets  As ever, Meghan looked ine in black velvet court shoes and a taupe green dress by designer Roland Mouret    The Duke and Duchess met with the President Michael Higgins at Aras an Uachtarain this morning          The Duchess of Sussex was snapped gazing adoringly at her husband Prince Harry as they attended a formal reception          The pair then made their way to Croke Park museum, home of Ireland\u0027s largest sporting organisation, the Gaelic Athletic Association  Meghan is a known friend of Mouret\u0027s with French designer Roland Mouret making appearances on her now deleted Instagram account so it came as no surprise to see her her opt for one of his pieces today          The Duchess of Sussex looked ready for business in the taupe dress and Fendi handbag - one of her most professional looks          The Duchess giggled as she stroked the large dog - and the pampered pooch looked just as pleased to meet the royal visitor      The Duchess of Sussex looked confident in her role as she smiled for the cameras at the official photo call          The Irish president and his wife looked delighted to meet the newlyweds on the second day of their visit          The Duchess of Sussex was the picture of polished perfection in the grey dress, black bag and black heels          Ireland\u0027s President Michael Higgins embraced the Duchess of Sussex while his wife, a former actress, giggled at a joke she made           Meghan put a hand on Sabina Higgins\u0027 back as they made their way back down to the steps to continue their day of engagements           The President and his wife cheerily waved from the steps of Aras an Uactharain as Meghan and Harry made their way to their car and on to their next engagement           Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex signed only with their first names in a visitor\u0027s book during the Presidential meetingIn a hurry, Meghan?

One containing the opening words of St Matthew\u0027s Gospel \u0027Book of Generation\u0027 and the other St Mark.The book comprises 650 pages on high quality calf velum. Anne -Marie Diffley, visitor services manager, explained to them that it was produced by Columban monks using goose or swan feather quills and brushes made from pine marten fur.The couple then entered the Long Room, which houses 200,000 books, and looked up to admire the huge domed ceiling.They both discussed the distinctive smell,\u0027 said Shenton. \u0027Harry said \u0027ah, leather\u0027, \u0027 she said, while Meghan said \u0027there\u0027s a sweet note to it\u0027.They also saw the Brian Boru Harp, dating from the 15th centur , and long recognised as a historic symbol of Ireland,Meghan was asked about her calligraphy and revealed she is also a book binder. \u0027As they were signing the visitors book, I said to the Duchess: \u0027I know you have done calligraphy \u0027.

Humphrys got more than £600,000 in last year\u0027s figures, but the BBC says t his salary will drop below £300,000    The pay of household name stars including Tess Daly is not knownBBC stars paid by BBC Studios, a TV production and distribution company, do not have to have their salaries disclosed. The company makes many of the BBC\u0027s popular programmes, but has been a commercial entity since April 2017 and is not funded by licence fee payers. Stars of programmes including Top Gear, Strictly Come Dancing, Planet Earth II, Doctor Who, Mrs Brown\u0027s Boys, EastEnders, Casualty and The One Show - all created by BBC Studios - are off the list, or have just portions of their salaries shown.For example, Strictly Come Dancing presenter Claudia Winkleman was last year in the £450,000 - £499,999 pay bracket, but in the 2018 report, she is in a £370,000 - £379,000 pay bracket for hosting a weekly show on Radio 2 and a \u0027range of programmes and series\u0027 on BBC.Her fee for hosting Strictly now does not appear.Casualty actor Derek Thompson, EastEnders star Danny Dyer and Strictly Come Dancing judge Dame Darcey Bussell are among those who were featured on last year\u0027s list, but have now dropped out.Some of the stars no longer the list: Zoe Ball, who made up to £300,000 in the last pay list, does not appear as  Strictly: It Takes Two is made by BBC StudiosMatt Baker and Alex Jones are also no longer on the list because The One Show is made by BBC Studios                                                       BBC accused of using \u0027smoke and mirrors\u0027 to mask how much rich-list stars are paidThe BBC agreed with the Government to publish its top salaries annually. But it includes stars only paid directly by the licence fee.This means a string of major celebrities, who are paid directly by production companies or the BBC\u0027s commercial arm, can be left out. It is thought a third of the stars who appeared last year may be absent this time.BBC Studios was created to let the corporation sell shows to rival broadcasters and compete with giants such as Netflix. It creates the likes of DIY SOS, The One Show and Strictly Come Dancing.

I thought how they would be hurt by my death.\u0027This made me keep going. I had to fight until the very end. I kept trying to overcome my gloomy thoughts.\u0027There was another fear too - sharks or other threats lurking in the deep.\u0027I felt things touching my legs.\u0027I kept assuring myself it was just seaweed, nothing dangerous, that there was nothing down there that could harm me.\u0027I just kept hoping that the right wind would come, or a current would carry me back to the shore.\u0027Her family only realised something was amiss at 7pm when she failed to return from her spa appointment - by then Olga had been in there sea already for four hours.Her belongings including her purse were found on the beach.\u0027This was the start of our nightmare,\u0027 said Yulia, a TV producer.Police came to the hotel and several large boats were sent out.\u0027It was not possible to use small boats near the shore because the weather was bad, it was a storm.\u0027They would use a helicopter to search but only next morning, they were told.Yulia was in panic.

Family members alerted rescuers after the medic (pictured) failed to return to her hotel room after a late afternoon swim.\u0027At 10.40 our aircraft located the missing person, floating on an air mattress, nine nautical miles from Rethymno and one nautical mile from the coastline close to Lavris.\u0027A Hellenic Coast Guard vessel was dispatched and rescued the 55 year old female who had been in the sea for about 20 hours \u0027Mrs Kuldo needed hospital treatment for exposure and resulting heart problems.  Her relieved daughter Yulia posted on social media: \u0027Miracles happen.\u0027She said her mother, an ultrasound diagnostics doctor, had been \u0027burned to ashes\u0027 by the daytime sun before the EU Frontex agency plane spotted her.A local report on the island said she was on her sunbed \u0027when she was carried away to the open sea so she could not be seen from the beach\u0027.It is unclear if she fell asleep but reports say she was carried away by a \u0027strong current\u0027. Local reports described Olga as \u0027lucky\u0027 to survive.The main damage to her health was from a cold night after she was wet for hours clinging to the air bed.\u0027She stayed alive despite a cold night, strong wind, occasional rain and even a small thunder storm,\u0027 reported neakriti.gr\u0027Her body temperature was as low as 32 C degrees\u0027 (normal is 37C) - causing hypothermia, it was reported.\u0027The tears of her family turned to incredible happiness.\u0027Day time temperatures can reach 35C, while at night they can drop to 18C - not cold but Olga had been hours in the water during the long night. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/12/09/4E2710EC00000578-0-image-m-8_1531382867749.jpg","title":"London pensioner sits woman order favourite seat","story":"    This is the shocking moment an elderly woman sits on a bus passenger in order to move her from ‘her’ seat‘You move!’, the elderly passenger yells, but the seated woman calmly responds saying, ‘I\u0027m not getting off here’.The pensioner retorts back ‘What do you mean you\u0027re not going to get off!’Why you should NEVER ride in the back of a pick-up truck!...‘#proud – thank you Mr Southgate’: Fans praise England’s...Share this articleThen shockingly, the furious old lady sits on the woman to force her to leave the seat.

Earlier this week, a photo of Mr Boon posted by hairdresser Emma Fitzpatrick showing him then taking up two seats in first class - including one for his bag and jacket - went viral online, prompting  fury          Emma FitzPatrick tweeted this message with the photo after being shocked by his actionsShe confronted him about his behaviour as the train pulled into London Victoria, telling him: \u0027I can\u0027t believe what you\u0027ve done today. You should be hanging your head in shame.\u0027 Ms Fitzpatrick claims Mr Boon handed his business card out to passengers as he turned them away.Sharing the photo on Twitter, Emma wrote: \u0027Totally shocked to see Govia Railway Head of Operations, Mark Boon, telling all commuters to stay out of an EMPTY First Class carriage on a LATE \u0026amp very packed train this morning. Meanwhile he took up two seats in there.\u0027She continued: \u0027It was a London bound Southern Train that arrived into London Victoria at approx 11.45am this morning.\u0027I still can\u0027t believe it. He even handed his business card out to the people that he was turning away! Talk about rubbing salt into commuters\u0027 wounds.\u0027Describing her experience on the train, she added: \u0027I saw First Class had just two men sat in there, so lots of spare seats - around eight or 10 available. So I started squeezing past those stood up, to go and sit in there.\u0027But then a lady told me the man there - pointing at Mark Boon, had told her not to sit in there as she had gone to sit down.\u0027I couldn\u0027t believe it. Then she showed me the business card he had given her. I said, \u0027You must be joking\u0027, but another female passenger nodded and said he had said the same to her.\u0027          Commuters on the line have experienced horrific conditions and delays in recent years          The franchise has been repeatedly criticised over the conditions on its trains. Pictured: 2017Ms Fitzpatrick said she made her way to the first class compartment - where Mr Boon glanced at her and immediately told her the same thing.\u0027He didn\u0027t even ask if I had a First Class ticket - he just looked at me and assumed I didn\u0027t,\u0027 she said.\u0027He told me the carriage was for First Class passengers only. I was so shocked.\u0027I told him I was feeling a little unwell so I needed a seat, but he dismissively said to go and get some water or something, and looked back down at his phone.\u0027I told him I would sit down on the arm of a chair, so as to keep the First Class seats free.\u0027I was just blown away looking back at the men and women packed in down the train.\u0027 Within 24 hours of sharing the photo, Emma\u0027s Tweet had been shared hundreds of times - with outraged Twitter users sharing their disdain.A Govia Thameslink spokesman said: \u0027Passengers need a first class ticket to travel in first class and there were other people with first class tickets in this compartment.\u0027This was an 11am off-peak service running just six minutes late and, while the front coaches were busy, there were seats and space in the rear coaches, as Mr Boon explained.\u0027       "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/12/16/4E2A688900000578-5946491-image-m-83_1531409213801.jpg","title":"Juncker struggles gala leaders step help","story":"    Jean Claude-Juncker bumps into the Presidents of Ukraine and Finland as a group of world leaders make their way to a gala dinner          Juncker took a remarkably long time to descend from a podium after a photoshoot with the other world leaders      ¿I¿m a stable genius¿: Trump declares victory in battle with...May warns Trump not to split NATO by appeasing Putin as she...Trump resumes his attack on FBI lovers en route to second...Share this articleJean-Claude Juncker addresses the media after the signature of the second EU NATO Joint Declaration on Tuesday            Delegations arrive for a working session of NATO leaders and the delegations from Ukraine and Georgia          President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel during their bilateral meeting, Wednesday, July 11, 2018 in Brussels, BelgiumTrump created tension with Chancellor Angela Merkel after publicly berating Germany for its new Nord Stream 2 pipeline agreement with Russia.\u0027Germany is totally controlled by Russia,\u0027 Trump said. \u0027I think its a very bad thing for NATO,\u0027 Trump said.Several EU leaders, including Juncker were quick to kowtow to the President\u0027s demands, saying the EU must \u0027take responsibility\u0027 for its security.In a statement on Tuesday Juncker said: \u0027Europe has decided to take responsibility for its own security.\u0027NATO is a cornerstone of that strategy and we are working full steam to implement the 74 joint actions which go from countering hybrid threats to cyber security, defence and research.\u0027This partnership is a cornerstone of our overall security and defence strategy.

Australasian Olympic Team at Stockholm Roddforening includes Fanny Durack and Mina WylieAfter some fundraising efforts by supporters, Fanny was able to travel to London and then Stockholm where she became one of two Australian gold medallists following her 100 meters freestyle win. Her friend Mina won the silver.Fanny was then recognised as a national heroine, went on to tour the US and promote swimming more than any woman, apart from her fellow Australian Annette Kellerman. Between 1912 and 1918, she broke 12 world records before retiring and marrying Bernard Gately.She coached juniors and became a member of the organisation that had at first prevented her from competing, which was renamed the New South Wales Women’s Amateur Swimming Association. Fanny died in 1956.What is a Google Doodle?Sarah ‘Fanny’ Durack has been celebrated in the Google Doodle for July 12, 2018 and to this day, her name lives on because of her commitment to gender equality in sports.

Because, just under a year ago, she became an egg donor, an act of pure altruism to help a childless couple be given the joy of parenthood.What’s more, she did it not as well as, but instead of, having children of her own.‘I’m not really very maternal at all — I have no real desire to have children,’ she says. ‘My two best friends have had babies and, while I am really happy for them, and the babies are gorgeous, the moment they start crying, I just want to get out of there.‘I love my career and I just don’t see children in my future. So, for me, this was a way I could help someone else have a child without having one myself. That’s actually what made it attractive to me.’It’s a laudable instinct and one that Kerri believes should be more widely shared — one reason she set up a no-holds-barred Twitter account for the duration of her egg donation journey, documenting the injections, the scans and the physical changes she underwent on her three-month egg donor ‘journey’.Every painful needle and mottled bruise, every stomach cramp and hormone surge are all carefully photographed and honestly described. It’s not easy reading, and certainly not for the squeamish, but it prompts the very obvious question: what drives a healthy, fertile young woman to put herself through this physical discomfort and mental uncertainty without the reward of a baby of her own at the end?It certainly isn’t money: in the UK, egg donors cannot be paid, although they can receive up to £750 compensation per donation cycle to cover their travel, accommodation or childcare costs. So, what was it?‘I had friends who were struggling to conceive and I had seen first-hand how desperate they were to have a child,’ says Kerri.‘My father also works as a foster carer and seeing what he does is a constant reminder of the unfairness of the world: so many people would give everything they had to have a baby, yet can’t have them — while others have them and don’t deserve them.’           Kerri Middleton was thrilled when she found out a woman she had never met was going to have a baby using eggs she donated to herKerri was also determined to spread the word on how women like her — fertile, but without maternal instincts — could help.‘When I was researching egg donation, there was lots of medical stuff to read up on, but not much from people who had actually done it,’ she says. ‘I thought the blog might be helpful — and, if it gets just one more woman to think about donating her eggs, then it has achieved something good.’There’s certainly no shortage of demand — a demand that continues to grow as more women and couples are deciding to start a family later in life, before discovering that it’s not plain sailing.The latest figures in the UK show that 3,924 babies were born from egg donors in 2016, almost double the number ten years earlier.Demand, however, is not matched by supply: the shortage of donor eggs has been described as ‘critical’ with many women travelling abroad in order to fulfil their dream of motherhood — leaving clinics to rely on emotion-tugging adverts to entice prospective donors.Kerri spotted just such an advert early last year while travelling on the underground in London, where she was then working.At the time Kerri, who grew up the middle child of three in Bournemouth, had a well-paid job in sales for a medical supply company, and motherhood could not have been further from her mind.Yet something about the picture of a smiling baby caught her eye. ‘Alongside it was a question about whether you had considered egg donation,’ she recalls.‘I’d never even heard of it but I was curious and it played on my mind so I did some research, read around it and the more I read the more I wanted to do something about it so I contacted the clinic and made an appointment.’And so, in early March, Kerri arrived at a small private clinic in central London for a 40-minute initial appointment.          The latest figures in the UK show that 3,924 babies were born from egg donors in 2016‘There was a lot of paperwork, mostly about my health and any family illnesses — which happily we don’t have. They also explained the risks and they then gave me some paperwork to look over but by then I had already made up my mind,’ she recalls.While the health risks of donating eggs appear to be few, there is a risk of ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome (OHSS), a rare but potentially severe condition that occurs when fertility medication causes too many eggs to develop in the ovaries. If not treated in time it can prove fatal.‘My view was that the risks were small — obviously with anything of this nature there is going to be some risk, but it was a calculated one.’Initially, Kerri told no one about her plans, but eventually mentioned it to a flatmate. ‘She’s very sensible — she was the one who said I needed to talk to my parents,’ she says. ‘I actually hadn’t thought about it but she was right.‘They didn’t really say much. I think they were a bit surprised but they were supportive and knew me too well to try to talk me out of it.’Over the coming days and weeks Kerri confided in other friends and colleagues. ‘Most people were fine but I was surprised by the lack of understanding around it. Some friends asked if it meant I would never be able to have kids of my own and one person asked if it meant I would go through menopause early.‘It was amazing the amount of women who didn’t even understand what happens in their own body.’The more negative reactions came from some male friends. ‘Some seemed freaked out by it. I don’t know if it was because they felt threatened by it in some way.’Because the start of the process has to be carefully timed to coincide with the start of her menstrual cycle it was not until June that Kerri —who had also received a counselling session from the clinic to ensure she was psychologically prepared — returned to start the process in earnest, receiving the kit she would need for ten days of daily injections to do at home that would stimulate her ovaries to release more eggs.‘It was actually harder than I’d been prepared for,’ she admits. ‘The way the injection was described I thought it would be a pinprick but in fact it’s a two-inch needle. I’m not good with needles at the best of times but I knew it was something I had to just get on with.’Aside from the briefly unpleasant nature of the injections, Kerri said she had few side-effects other than mild period pain, bloating and headaches.Every three days, meanwhile, she had to go to the clinic for an internal scan to check that everything was happening as it should.‘Obviously it wasn’t always convenient but then I would be in the waiting room and I would watch some lovely couple filling in paperwork and it would be a reminder of what it was all about,’ she says.Woman, 25, WINS fight to use sperm harvested from her dead...More women over 50 are choosing to have babies later as...Boys born to women who delay motherhood to put careers first...Share this articleTen days in, a scan revealed that Kerri was successfully growing healthy egg sacks, which meant she could now undergo surgery to harvest her eggs — a procedure preceded by one rather more unpleasant injection.‘I had to inject myself once a few days before surgery with what felt like a huge needle,’ she says. ‘It actually made me feel a bit sick and it took me 40 minutes to pluck up the courage to do it.’The ten-minute removal procedure under general anaesthetic took place at a clinic on London’s Harley Street on July 4 last year and Kerri admits that she had underestimated quite how daunting it would feel.‘I had felt pretty ropey in the days running up to surgery — very tired, and with really bad bloating,’ she recalls. ‘I had never had a general anaesthetic before and I think it just suddenly hit me what was happening. I did have a little cry.‘More than anything I was just anxious that they would actually recover some eggs — even if everything has been going well up to that point there are no guarantees and it would have felt awful if it was all for nothing.’In fact, she woke in the recovery room to news that doctors had harvested 16 healthy eggs. ‘I was buzzing,’ she says.‘I had honestly never felt so proud of myself. It felt so good that I had another little cry.’Sent home with what she calls a ‘mass’ of paperwork it took two days for the dizzy spells and soreness that were a consequence of the surgery to die down. ‘I had been prepared for that so although it wasn’t great it didn’t bother me,’ she says. ‘I just felt I’d done a really good thing.’Her euphoria was not to last: two weeks later she received a call from the clinic asking if she could go in to see them. ‘I wasn’t sure what to expect but when I got there I was told that half my eggs had been given to a private buyer,’ she says.‘It was a woman who didn’t live in the UK but she had bought the eggs and fertilised them with sperm she had also bought separately. Apparently the sperm was infected and the eggs had all been killed. The reason they had called me in was to ask if I would donate again.’          Kerry endured daily injections and painful operations to donate her eggs to other womenThe answer was a robust no.‘I felt pretty angry and upset, like it was a misuse of my eggs,’ she says now. ‘I understood that you don’t get a say in where your eggs go but it felt like this woman was playing God.’There were some happier tidings: the remaining eight eggs had been given to an infertile couple who had been referred to the clinic by the NHS.‘I said that I would be happy to donate again in future if all my eggs were used and they wanted a biological sibling for any baby they had.’ Kerri heard nothing further until, in April, she learned that there was a ‘live pregnancy’ from her donation.She will, subsequently, be told the date of birth and the sex.‘I was thrilled,’ she recalls. ‘I knew how excited this unknown woman must be, that she would have been on the most enormous rollercoaster to get to the point where she was carrying a baby in her tummy.‘I felt nothing but happiness for her.’ Not so her mother, however.It was at this point, with a biological grandchild growing somewhere, that Kerri’s ‘gift’ started to feel real.‘I think it did make her see things differently,’ Kerry acknowledges.‘For the first time she said she felt a bit funny about the fact that she will have a grandchild out there she may never meet.’          A pictures of a scan showing Kerri\u0027s eggs which she goes through daily injections so she can donate themBut from Kerri? Nothing else? Not a twinge of curiosity, or a pang of longing for a child that is genetically at least, half hers? Not at all, she insists.‘Whether it’s a boy or a girl makes no difference to me’ she says.‘I don’t feel it’s my baby. The way I see it is that there was a couple who desperately wanted to get to an airport to go on holiday but they couldn’t find a car to take them there. I provided the car.‘So I helped them to their destination but their life there is nothing to do with me.’ The baby, of course, may see it differently: since the law changed in 2005 all donors in the UK are required to sign a register containing their contact details and babies born as a result of egg donation are allowed to access information about their donor when they turn 18.It means that some day, nearly two decades from now, Kerri may receive an email, or a knock at the door, from her biological son or daughter. ‘I am open to that but it is not something I worry about either,’ she says. It will, of course, be fascinating to see if she feels the same way in five years time — or if it impacts on future relationships.Currently single, might a future partner find it hard to accept that his girlfriend’s offspring is out there somewhere unknown to her.‘I actually don’t worry about that — for me I think the bigger conversation is the fact I don’t want children,’ she says.‘It’s a hard conversation to have.‘All I know is that there are women out there right now who are yearning to carry their own baby. I’m not one of them — but I have helped someone who couldn’t’.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/13/01/4E2DEEC300000578-0-image-a-5_1531440392606.jpg","title":"Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich puts UK visa worries aside kits 30m London penthouse","story":"    Abramovich has bagged the penthouse at this Chelsea Waterfront development for £30million          The Chelsea owner\u0027s apartment is the biggest of 75 in the development and he has a team of interior designers fitting it out The 51-year-old is said to have given up on the application and obtained an Israeli passport that allows short trips to London despite having no visa, The Times reports.  Father-of-seven Abramovich was the first big Russian name to withdraw his investments in Britain as tensions between President Putin and Theresa May\u0027s government worsened.Plans for a £1billion redevelopment of Chelsea\u0027s ground were halted last month as the club cited the \u0027current unfavourable investment climate\u0027.

A handout picture released by the official Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) today shows Syrian men also waving the national flag near the city councilThe corner of south-west Syria is an important corridor for trade between Syria and Jordan, and onward to the oil-rich Gulf states.But most of the important fighting against the revolt has already been concluded in shattering battles farther to the north for the main cities of Damascus, Aleppo and Homs, and territories in between.Some 400,000 people have been killed in seven years of war.Protests in Daraa in 2011 against the government’s mistreatment of teenage detainees ignited a national revolt against decades of authoritarian rule.          In this March 23, 2011 file photo, anti-Syrian government protesters flash Victory signs as they protest in the southern city of Daraa. Syrian activists and state media said today that the rebels have agreed to surrender Daraa to government forcesDEAL TO HAND OVER WEAPONS On Wednesday, state media said opposition fighters and the regime had reached a deal for rebels to hand over their heavy weapons in Daraa al-Balad and other opposition-held parts of the city.That deal come after a ceasefire announced last week stemmed nearly three weeks of regime bombardment on the symbolic wider province of the same name bordering Jordan.The Damascus regime is bent on retaking the whole of Daraa province, including its symbolic capital where 2011 protests against President Bashar al-Assad are seen to have started the uprising that spiralled into civil war.           Russians forces are seen as displaced Syrians from the Daraa province come back to their hometown in Bosra, southwestern Syria, on July 11.The regime assault against Syria\u0027s southern province of Daraa has pushed more than 320,000 people to flee their homesACTION DISMISSED AS \u0027SYMBOLIC\u0027 But the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said the regime forces entering Daraa al-Balad on Thursday was merely \u0027symbolic\u0027.Measures to implement the so-called reconciliation deal for rebel-held parts of the city had not yet been implemented, it said.Number of refugees accepted into the U.S. falls below the...Syrian air defences \u0027strike an Israeli jet and shoot down...Share this article\u0027The rebels are still inside Daraa city,\u0027 Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said, but they had not yet handed over their heavy weapons and there were no signs of any evacuations.Under the deal, \u0027those (rebels) who want to settle their status with the regime will hand over their heavy weapons, keep their light arms and remain in the city\u0027, he added.  A bus stops at a checkpoint as displaced Syrians from the Daraa province come back to their hometown in Bosra, southwestern Syria, on July 11, 2018\u0027Those who refuse the deal will head out towards the north of Syria.\u0027The reconciliation deal for Daraa city is the latest in a string of such agreements that have seen the regime retake large parts of the country since 2015.They usually follow blistering military campaigns and sometimes stifling sieges that effectively force the rebels into surrendering.Previous such deals have seen thousands of rebels bused up to areas still under opposition control in the north of the country."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/11/15/4E1F09D500000578-0-image-a-79_1531318208892.jpg","title":"Mobile phone lost 100ft underwater diver lit receiving text","story":"Result!

Gerry Connolly called the moment \u0027a new low in the United States Congress.\u0027Trump shows off \u0027very nice note\u0027 from Kim Jong-un praising...The Donald arrives for four-day red carpet visit: Trump and...¿I¿m a stable genius!¿ Trump declares victory in battle with...Macron says allies did NOT make new commitments to boost...Share this articleThe contentious moments were there from the start. House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy did not hold back in his criticism of Strzok and his texts, which President Donald Trump and his allies used to paint the Russian investigation as tainted.\u0027You are the lead investigator, you originated the investigation, you are the point of contact, you drafted the document, and here you are before you interviewed a single solitary witness saying \u0027F Trump,\u0027\u0027 he said.Strzok did not hold back either. Given time to speak, he demanded lawmakers consider his texts in the context in which they were written - during the contentious 2016 presidential campaign when Trump had gotten into a fight with a Gold Star military family who spoke at the Democratic convention.\u0027You need to understand that was written late at night, off-the-cuff, and in response it to a series of events that included candidate Trump insulting the immigrant family of a fallen war hero,\u0027 Strzok said. \u0027My presumption, based on that horrible, disgusting behavior that the American population would not elect somebody demonstrating that behavior to be president of the United States. It was in no way, unequivocally, any suggestion that me, the FBI, would take any action whatsoever to improperly impact the electoral process,\u0027 he noted.The agent went on to tout the virtues of the FBI and said the multiple layers of supervisors and staff would not have tolerated any signs of biased behavior from him.\u0027That is who we are as the FBI. And the suggestion that I in some dark chamber somewhere in the FBI would somehow cast aside all of these procedures, all of these safeguards, and somehow be able to do this is astounding to me. It simply couldn\u0027t happen. And the proposition that that is going on, that it might occur anywhere in the FBI, deeply corrodes what the FBI is in American society,\u0027 Strzok said.Applause was heard when he finished his remarks.           Deputy Assistant FBI Director Peter Strzok is sworn in before a joint committee hearing of the House Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform committees          Peter Strzok consults with an adviser during the hearingEarly on, a procedural fight broke out as Republicans threatened to hold Strzok in contempt for not answering their questions while Democrats attempted to adjourn the proceedings.Civility did not rule as the day went on.  Chaos reigned on and off throughout the proceedings with Republicans attempting to get details of the Russian investigation and Democrats using every parliamentary weapon in their arsenal to disrupt proceedings. The first 90 minutes of the hearing saw only one lawmaker get to question Strzok. And, at two and half hours into the hearing, 72 members still had to question the FBI agent. Only four members had gotten to speak to him at that point.  The hearing was a joint session of the House judiciary and oversight committees, which meant an unusually large number of lawmakers were scheduled to get questioning time.But the political firestorm started with the first question of the day.Gowdy asked Strzok about his August 8, 2016 text exchange with his then-lover, fellow FBI agent Lisa Page, where Strzok reassured Page that she needn\u0027t worry about Donald Trump winning the White House.The Republican lawmaker asked how many interviews Strzok, who was working on the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u0027s email server and examining Russia\u0027s role in the election, had conducted at that point to make such an allegation.Strzok checked with the lawyers sitting behind him and then answered that the counsel of the FBI \u0027have directed me not to answer any questions about the ongoing investigation of the Russia.\u0027 Republican Rep. Bob Goodlatte, who was chairing the hearing, responded that \u0027your testimony is essential to this hearing\u0027 and says the subpoena compels him to answer.\u0027I am specifically directing you to answer the question in response to our subpoena,\u0027 Goodlatte, the chairman of House Judiciary Committee, demanded.\u0027You at risk for a contempt citation,\u0027 he warned Strzok.And that threat set off a firestorm of fighting and shouting among Republican and Democrats. Republicans wanted to hold Strzok in contempt while Democrats ferociously defended him and tried to end the hearing.Several Democrats started to demand a point order and when Goodlatte refused to hear them, the lawmakers began to quibble on what is a point of order.  \u0027The gentleman has not cited a rule of he House that is being violated so therefore it is not a point of order,\u0027 Goodlatte said in response to Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler\u0027s demand for clarification.  At that point, Nadler made the motion to adjourn the hearing.      Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee Rep. Trey Gowdy, left, speaks with the ranking member of the committee Rep. Elijah Cummings during a hearing with FBI Deputy Assistant Director Peter Strzok          Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Rep. Bob Goodlatte questions FBI Deputy Assistant Director Peter Strzok          FBI Deputy Assistant Director Peter Strzok testified before two House Committees in a joint sessionSeveral Republicans used their five minutes of questioning time to make statements criticizing Strzok.Representative John Ratcliffee hammered Strzok for using FBI phone to send anti-Trump texts and argued he left personal opinion at the door. \u0027Agent Strzok, are you starting to understand why some folks out there don\u0027t believe a word you say?\u0027 he said. And Goodlatte wanted to know if Strzok would allow lawmakers to look at texts on his personal phone.\u0027I would authorize the release of any work related texts that are out there,\u0027 Strzok said. \u0027I would never agree to the release of any non-work related texts.\u0027Democratic lawmakers, in the meanwhile, used their time to ask for investigation into Trump\u0027s immigration policy or to defend Strzok.Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen told Strzok that \u0027if I could give you a purple heart I would,\u0027 which led to some snickers from Republicans. And Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson asked the agent: \u0027You used your career to keep America safe?\u0027\u0027It\u0027s my proudest moment sir,\u0027 Strzok said. Strzok laid down the gauntlet from the start of the hearing, saying in his opening statement that his work has never been tainted by politics and that the intense scrutiny he is facing represents \u0027just another victory notch in Putin\u0027s belt.\u0027Strzok was testifying publicly for the first time since being removed from special counsel Robert Mueller\u0027s team following the discovery of the derogatory text messages last year. He was also a member of the Russia investigation.He said in his opening statement that he has never allowed personal opinions to infect his work, that he knew information during the campaign that had the potential to damage Trump but never contemplated leaking it and that the focus on him by Congress is misguided and plays into \u0027our enemies\u0027 campaign to tear America apart.\u0027But he also acknowledged the high tempers and tension that characterized the day.\u0027I would absolutely agree with you that there are things that I regret in retrospect and I hope that comes across today. I know a large portion of today have been combative,\u0027 he said.            Peter Strzok, the FBI agent facing criticism following a series of anti-Trump text messages, walks to gives a deposition before the House Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in June          President Trump has been critical of Strzok and former FBI agent Lisa PageTrump himself has launched personal attacks against Strzok and Page, including a Wednesday evening tweet that asked \u0027how can the Rigged Witch Hunt proceed when it was started, influenced and worked on, for an extended period of time\u0027 by Strzok. He described the texts as \u0027hate filled and biased.\u0027Strzok acknowledged that while his text message criticism was \u0027blunt,\u0027 it was not directed at one person or political party and included jabs not only at Trump but also at Clinton as well as Sen. Bernie Sanders. He said there was \u0027simply no evidence of bias in my professional actions.\u0027\u0027Let me be clear, unequivocally and under oath: not once in my 26 years of defending my nation did my personal opinions impact any official action I took,\u0027 he said.He says that he was one of the few people during the 2016 election who knew the details of Russian election interference and its possible connections with people in the Trump orbit, and that that information could have derailed Trump\u0027s election chances. \u0027But,\u0027 he said, \u0027the thought of exposing that information never crossed my mind.\u0027Although Strzok has said through his lawyer that he was eager to tell his side of the story, he makes clear his exasperation at being the focal point of a congressional hearing at a time when Russian election interference has been successfully \u0027sowing discord in our nation and shaking faith in our institutions.\u0027\u0027I have the utmost respect for Congress\u0027s oversight role, but I truly believe that today\u0027s hearing is just another victory notch in Putin\u0027s belt and another milestone in our enemies\u0027 campaign to tear America apart,\u0027 Strzok says. \u0027As someone who loves this country and cherishes its ideals, it is profoundly painful to watch and even worse to play a part in.\u0027          Strzok says \u0027I have the utmost respect for Congress\u0027s oversight role, but I truly believe that today\u0027s hearing is just another victory notch in Putin\u0027s belt\u0027          Strzok says the Russian investigation is \u0027not a witch hunt\u0027He also flatly rejected the president\u0027s characterizations of Mueller\u0027s work and the threat of Russian election interference, saying, \u0027This investigation is not politically motivated, it is not a witch hunt, it is not a hoax.\u0027The Justice Department\u0027s inspector general has criticized Strzok and Page for creating the appearance of impropriety through the texts. But the report said it found no evidence of political bias in the FBI\u0027s decision to not pursue criminal charges against Clinton. And many Democrats say actions taken by law enforcement during the campaign season - including announcing a reopening of the investigation into Clinton just days before the election - actually wound up harming the Democratic candidate and aiding the Republican candidate, Trump.FBI Director Chris Wray says the FBI has referred to internal disciplinary officials employees who were singled out for criticism in the inspector general\u0027s report. Strzok\u0027s lawyer has said he was escorted from the FBI building last month as the disciplinary process winds its way through the system.Page left the bureau in May. She will appear before the committees in a closed session on Friday that is expected to go into Monday."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/12/11/4E27F3A800000578-5945797-image-a-10_1531392595452.jpg","title":"Tourists queue crack dawn best sunbeds Gran Canaria hotel","story":"    Holidaymakers staying at a Gran Canaria hotel queued up at the crack of dawn before sprinting to secure a sunbed          Joanne Kennedy, from Lincoln, filmed the chaos when she stayed at the Dunas Mirador hotelShe captured the queue of sun-worshippers lining up from 7am every day in their bid to bag a sunbed – and one man even suffered a broken toe in the melee.Ms Kennedy\u0027s clip is featured in a new Channel 4 documentary called Holidays From Hell: Caught On Camera.It\u0027s a PARASOLNADO!

At the time they were aged just nine, six and four          The family decided to undertake their voyage in 2002 after the birth of Marien and the death of Jamie\u0027s mother coincided. It took them six years to prepare for the trip\u0027We had high-paying jobs, dual income. It was so perfect and white picket fence it was almost painful. It makes your teeth hurt.\u0027Then in a two week spell in 2002, our eldest daughter was born and my husband\u0027s mother passed away. It was hard to see those milestones of life happening together.\u0027My mother-in-law was going to go traveling but she had cancer and literally died within weeks.\u0027It forced us to think about our priorities and what we wanted, and when Jamie and I met this was something we were always going to do.\u0027We had been telling people we were going to take our children on a boat and sail and we didn\u0027t know when we would be coming back, and we got some looks like, You\u0027re crazy.\u0027When we left in 2005, we felt exhilarated and euphoric. I couldn\u0027t believe it. It was something we had worked so long and hard for.\u0027It\u0027s such a crazy, different way of life from the outside. On one hand, we have given up so much to do this but we have zero regrets.\u0027We barely saw each other before and now our family is very tight. We have had the most wonderful opportunity to experience the world with our kids.\u0027While there is no typical day aboard Totem, the Giffords wake up when the sun rises and sleep when it sets, bedding down in one of two cabins on their floating home.Behan and Jamie also homeschool their children, teaching them standard subjects as well as devoting time to cultural immersion and hands-on learning.The kids don\u0027t have mobile phones so there\u0027s no Snapchat or Instagram and they\u0027re \u0027not dialed in to popular culture\u0027, but they spend time relaxing or exploring.They also chip in with chores, including doing laundry without a washing machine, helping maintain the boat and preparing meals.They eat local wherever possible - rice dishes in Mexico roshi flatbreads in the Males - and stock up on vegetables and pasta at markets as well as catching fish.\u0027Before I went cruising, we could load up the minivan with a half dozen bags of groceries and walk them up to the double fridge,\u0027 Behan said.\u0027Now everything I\u0027m finding at markets and carrying it back, but I can only carry so much at a time.

The average cost of living for a family of five in Seattle, their hometown, is around $122,000 per year.The family are currently in the US for the summer but will be back on Totem by October and plan to sail to Mexico for a year and a half before returning to the South Pacific.Despite the fact Niall will be staying behind to study French and economics at college in Portland, Oregon, Behan said the rest of the family have no plans to return for good.She added: \u0027Everybody has to be healthy and happy.

But they haven\u0027t felt compelled to make any kind of pronouncement that they\u0027re romantically involved,\u0027 the source said. The source added the pair have been open about their relationship and hold hands when they are together.The couple attended the Montana Republican Party\u0027s annual convention, where Don Jr. gave Kimberly a special shout out. The two were later seen kissing at the event.\u0027Just as everyone else thanks their significant others I got to thank Kimberly for coming out here.

The couple were pictured canoodling at the new sushi restaurant at the Trump International in DC on May 31They also enjoyed a concert date night in Long Island, New York at a Poison gig where Don Jr couldn\u0027t help but wrap his arms around the Fox host while backstage.He\u0027s also been spotted writing sappy comments on her pictures and fending off other men vying for his girlfriend\u0027s attention.Don Jr and ex-wife Vanessa, 40, announced their decision to split after 12 years of marriage  on March 15.The two released a joint statement saying: \u0027We will always have tremendous respect for each other and our families. We have five beautiful children together and they remain our top priority.

Beyond advances in the manufacture of clothing, the whims of fashion, and the occasional fad – who remembers Levi’s twisted seam? – cotton has remained cotton, and polyester is still polyester.But an award-winning Italian design duo is trying to realise the potential of smart technology in clothing to improve lives.Emanuela Corti and Ivan Parati, who met while studying at the Polytechnic University of Milan, have developed Sensewear, a collection of smart clothing and accessories for people who suffer from SPD. Also known as sensory integration difficulties, SPD can affect the way people, particularly those on the autism spectrum, process everyday stimuli, from light to touch.Their innovative work won Corti and Parati an AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You Award as part of the AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You programme, which aims to identify inidual champions, innovators and organisations that are creating exciting and pioneering health tech. In addition to winning awards, Corti and Parati’s work has also gained the attention of research academics and manufacturers in Italy.“If it is not treated effectively, it can result in clumsiness, behavioural problems, anxiety, depression or failure at school,” says Corti, a product designer specialising in textiles and furniture. She says hypersensitivity is often part of SPD, which can result in an enhanced sensitivity to sounds, smells and physical contact. “The textures, stitches and labels in regular clothes can cause unsustainably painful reactions,” she says. Left untreated, these symptoms can be disabling, leading to social isolation, anxiety and low self-esteem.The couple, who now have a young daughter, started with comparatively low-tech solutions, looking at the potential for 3D knitting processes, for example, to reduce potential rubbing points. They also looked at ways to redesign – or to build into clothing – some of the specialised toys and medical accessories already available. “Our focus was on incorporating those therapies into everyday objects that would not stigmatise the user as a disabled person,” Corti says. “We wanted to create invisible magic.”But the designers also wanted to think big. What if the elements of a wardrobe could talk to each other? For this, Corti and Parati looked at some of the smart clothing that is starting to become available, typically now targeted at the fitness market, such as Nadi X smart yoga leggings, which pulse on different muscles to encourage correct positions, and the sports vests that measures an athlete’s heart rate and position.“Our smart T-shirt will collect vital data – such as heart rate, breath frequency and movement – which is processed by an app to indicate the stress level of the wearer. It can then trigger the functionalities of other garments in the collection,” says Corti.One such garment is an inflatable pullover, capable of delivering a targeted “hug” to a wearer in need. “Deep pressure or deep touch pressure therapy (DTP) is a firm, tactile sensory input that can consist of firm hugs, stroking or cuddling,” says Corti. “It can have a calming effect on children and adults. Many people affected by autism refuse physical contact with others, but might be happy with a mechanical surrogate.” Other Sensewear innovations include Biteme, a biteable silicon necklace that measures pressure, and an aromatic scarf that can emit familiar, comforting scents.“This is a visionary concept that materialises ideas initially described by Mary Temple Grandin,” says Cesare Furlanello, head of the research group at the Bruno Kessler Foundation in Trento, and an expert in the way machine learning can be applied to biomedical and environmental data. Grandin, now 70, is a US professor of animal science and campaigner for autism awareness. She specialises in the emotional as well as physical welfare of livestock, and also invented a mechanical “hug box” for humans, after noticing how confined cattle calmed down before being inoculated.“As a child, I craved to feel the comfort of being held, but I would pull away when people hugged me,” Grandin wrote in 1992 in a description of the machine, a sort of pneumatic cocoon with pressurised padding that allowed her to control her own hugging. She suffered panic attacks throughout her teenage years before building the device in early adulthood. “Gradually, my tolerance of being held by the squeeze machine grew. Knowing that I could initiate the pressure, and stop it if the stimulation became too intense, helped me to reduce the oversensitivity of my nervous system.”Medical vests that replicate this mechanism have already been developed, but Corti’s priority is to make smart clothing that looks cool. “If you have a difficulty you don’t want people to stare at you, right? You don’t want to feel different,” she says. This summer, a team including Furlanello will introduce some of the Sensewear range to children with autism, to explore its potential to make their lives easier. “Patients are very often reluctant to ‘wear’ cumbersome and ugly scientific devices,” says Furlanello, “but we expect Sensewear smart clothes will be much more acceptable, which will help researchers to collect data and expand the context of the study.”Corti now hopes that the ideas behind Sensewear’s smart clothing might one day find broader applications. “We would like to expand our philosophy to furniture, interior design and objects,” she says. “We think that everyone faces a certain degree of discomfort, so we are also thinking about people who just live in a hectic urban environment and might want protection from overwhelming sensations or stresses.”Imagine having a slow, firm hug, administered automatically and invisibly, on a delayed, crowded commuter train. There might well be a market for that.We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream. Innovations in health technology are transforming the way we care for our minds and bodies.

And it really is newSweden’s librarians have spoken: a wonderfully eclectic lineup of authors has emerged on a long-ish longlist for the New Academy’s alternative to the postponed 2018 Nobel prize for literature.Traditionally awarded in autumn by the opaque and austere Swedish Academy, the Nobel was called off in March due to an ongoing sex scandal – and swiftly replaced when a group of the country’s cultural figures decided that the “world’s greatest literature prize” should still be awarded. “In a time when human values are increasingly being called into question,” the New Academy’s solemn opener read, “literature becomes an even more important counterforce to stop the culture of silence and oppression.”The New Academy asked Swedish librarians to nominate an author from anywhere in the world who has told the story of “humans in the world” – and the resulting longlist is surprisingly surprising. Yes, some of the perennial Nobel contenders are here, and deservedly so: Cormac McCarthy is nominated, as are Margaret Atwood, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o, Amos Oz and Haruki Murakami.But the librarians have also added some fresh faces to the usual suspects: we have the fiction of Finnish rising star Sofi Oksanen, the fierce originality of Polish Man Booker International prize winner Olga Tokarczuk and the sizzling fantasy of Nnedi Okorafor (I love Who Fears Death and The Book of Phoenix so much I think Okorafor’s going to land my vote, but I’m not quite decided yet. How many lineups – for anything, let alone a literature prize – feature Neil Gaiman, JK Rowling, Thomas Pynchon and Don DeLillo alongside each other? As well as Patti Smith, rather more celebrated for her music than her books. Could she be this year’s Bob Dylan, the New Academy’s contender for controversy who will befuddle all by blurring the line between lyrics and poetry?Perhaps the most striking detail of all is found not in the names, but the fine print. The New Academy is enforcing a gender quota on the shortlist stage, stipulating that it comprises two men and two women. How different this is to the Nobel, which counts among its 114 winners just 14 women.Could a win bring the pseudonymous Elena Ferrante, also nominated, out into the open? The only thing to do is to cast your vote and see: the New Academy is now asking the public to vote by 14 August. The shortlist will then be put to the New Academy’s judging panel. How open. How inclusive. I can’t wait to see who they end up with."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95909f403a40b7c6704e78f30144e800d0704477/16_133_2069_1242/master/2069.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6088079e29d0c30a31e22a262bcd841","title":"uk to pass 1000 hours without coal as energy shift accelerates","story":"Revival of last eight plants when ‘beast from the east’ hit Britain proved to be briefBritain will soon have been powered for more than a thousand hours without coal this year, in a new milestone underscoring how the polluting fuel’s decline is accelerating.The UK’s last eight coal power plants staged a brief revival when the “beast from the east” pushed up gas prices earlier this year, causing coal plants to fire up.However, the blip proved short-lived and immaterial, figures compiled by MyGridGB show. The country is expected to pass the threshold of 1,000 coal-free hours before the weekend is out and possibly as early as Thursday night.The pace of coal power’s demise is speeding up. Throughout the whole of 2017 there were 624 coal-free hours, up from 210 hours in 2016.Andrew Crossland, an energy expert who runs the MyGridGB site, said: “In 2018, Britain saved its coal use for when it needed it most – during the March cold snap. The decline will deepen in the second half of this year, with the planned closure in September of a Yorkshire coal plant and one in Northern Ireland. After Eggborough and Kilroot cease generating there will be six coal plants left.For the first time since the industrial revolution, the UK went a day without coal last year, followed this year by three days in a row.Coal’s fortunes have been in contrast to a series of record highs for renewable sources of energy, including wind, solar and biomass.The recent weeks of sunny weather have also created a series of solar records. The most recent was a new high for solar output over a month, with 1.94 terawatt hours of power generated between 10 June and 9 July, beating the previous record of 1.77TWh.Alastair Buckley, a solar expert at the University of Sheffield, said: “Some of this increase is due to more solar having been installed since 2017 but most of the increase is climatic, with summer 2018 being the fifth sunniest on record so far. “These figures highlight the growing importance of solar energy as a low-carbon and low-cost source of electricity.”Ministers have pledged to phase out coal entirely by 2025 but generation will dwindle well before then. The government’s own projections forecast the amount of power from coal plants between 2019 and 2025 being less than was produced in 2015 alone, Friends of the Earth pointed out.Cottam in Nottinghamshire and Fiddler’s Ferry in Cheshire are thought by observers to be next in line for closure, from October 2019, when their contracts to supply backup power have expired. Drax in Yorkshire and Ratcliffe in Nottinghamshire are likely to be the last to close in the face of unfavourable economics brought about by the UK’s carbon tax and gas being cheaper."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ac6cdd4ea490473a0a6af3b3830e28297875951/211_130_4747_2848/master/4747.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4cc6104c1fcee890245270f9872a91b5","title":"eu britain brexit plan chequers theresa may","story":"Britain is making a fair and reasonable proposal, given the compromises that the government has had to makeDear Ambassadors and High Commissioners,I write regarding the British government’s Chequers plan, a white paper on which is published today.

And liberal Euroscepticism has had a strong foothold here, on the political centre-left and centre-right, and in the press.Although the prime minister, Theresa May, made clear over a year ago that Britain intends to leave the EU’s single market and customs union, it has taken the government too long to come up with a more detailed plan on Brexit. Now, finally, it has.We need a path to a balanced relationship that would work for future decades. Most European leaders agree that this will have to be a bespoke relationship, designed to suit our size and proximity, as well as the historical, economic, personal and cultural ties between the UK and EU.So far, however, the European commission team, which negotiates on your behalf, has only offered the UK two unacceptable choices. On the one hand, Michel Barnier suggests a thin free trade agreement, which comes with the coda that the EU would indefinitely control regulations for the province of Northern Ireland alone – something that many in the UK see as an attempted “annexation”. On the other hand, there’s a relationship even closer than Norway’s, inside a customs union and single market, which would limit the UK’s ability to end free movement or control regulations across its wider economy. The latter would almost certainly prove politically unsustainable in the medium term, and – as we saw with Brexit itself – unsustainable political relationships tend to unwind in the UK.The Chequers plan tries to put forward an innovative, bespoke option for a new partnership with the EU. Essentially, it would entail the UK aligning with EU single market rules on goods, but able to erge on services and end free movement. The purpose would be to maintain essentially frictionless goods trade to support growth in all of our economies, and to avoid a hard border with Ireland.Some on the EU side claim that the free movement of goods, services, people and capital is “inisible”. But the EU has already entered relationships that ide these, and which allow partial participation in the single market – such as those with Switzerland or Ukraine.Others claim the UK wants to have its cake and eat it. Yet the Chequers plan would leave the UK with fewer obligations but also fewer rights. We would lose the ability to set rules on goods regulation, and would lose rights on free movement of services and capital.As a (soon to be) non-member, the UK cannot expect the EU to change its fundamental order to suit us. But equally, the EU should be able to accommodate a deep partnership with Europe’s second biggest economy and major security and military power. Although the UK is just one country, in size we are equivalent to the smallest 19 EU members. It behooves all of us to find a way to work out stable relations on our continent at a time when the transatlantic security alliance itself is at risk, and when all around Europe, and within it, we face unprecedented challenges.Your capitals will be looking closely at the detail of the Chequers plan today. As you will be reporting back – given recent ministerial resignations – this is very close to the maximum compromise the UK could sustain politically. The government has moved substantially to get here.I hope this proposal is taken seriously by European member states and the EU itself. I believe it should provide the basis for a future partnership. But if it’s judged insufficient, then I fear the British people will think that the UK has already made a fair and reasonable offer. They would be very wary of further compromise , and so regrettably our relations will probably end up being looser, with concomitant effects on both sides of the Channel for economic growth and security cooperation in the future.• Henry Newman is the director of Open Europe"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0871e1c12b18674a6e356b6203c25fe80f5dc87e/0_240_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5ff817696758500c86b74edb12f5444","title":"fahrenheit 100 summer britain climate change heatwave","story":"I don’t know anybody who remembers 10 August 2003 and its significance, although the date has never faded from my mind. That was Britain’s hottest ever day, the day the current British air temperature record was set: it leapt from the old record of 37.1C, set on 3 August 1990, to the new figure of 38.5C.Those bare numbers may not mean much to you, though they may well appear more meaningful if you convert them to fahrenheit. For the old record was 98.8F,but the new one was 101.3F, and that meant that the 100F barrier had been broken in Britain for the first time ever. It seemed to me then, as it does now, that this was a hugely symbolic crossing of an environmental threshold yet the population instantly forgot all about it.The current heatwave bids fair to be the longest period of sustained hot weather since the fabled summer of 1976. But will it actually be the hottest? Might we actually see a new British record air temperature? Local records are already being broken and there was a brief flurry of excitement 10 days ago when it appeared that the Scottish national record had been smashed with a temperature of 33.2C (91.7F) recorded in Motherwell, but now the Met Office has rejected the claim because a vehicle with its engine running was too close to the thermometer.It seems a new British record is certainly possible this summer that, if achieved, would give considerable force to the suggestion that the very high temperatures that have been in evidence all over the northern hemisphere this summer are at least partly the product of global warming, rather than just natural variation.For anyone interested in following and watching out for this, I have a suggestion: keep your eye on the fahrenheit as well as the celsius measurement it will mean more. I say this as a baby boomer who grew up with F rather than C it was not until 1962 that the Met Office adopted celsius, and in my early childhood I acquired the instinctive feel that everybody then had (and people still have in the US), which told you that, in fahrenheit terms, 60 was pleasantly warm, and 70 was really lovely weather, and 80 was seriously hot, while 90 represented the sort of heatwave that was a major event. Anything approaching 90 would result in front-page headlines in the  proclaiming: “88 … 89 … 90! Phew! What a scorcher!”That was the point about the 100 figure. It was off the map. It had never been recorded in meteorological history, in the daily temperature records that go back to 1772. But it had no place in cultural history either. There was no reference point for it: no stories, no memories, no jokes, no newspaper headlines. In our native land of showers and cool summers, 100 degrees fahrenheit represented an unknown country.The round number certainly helped. In celsius terms, 100F is 37.8C, and of course 37.8C as such isn’t any sort of figure the mind will register, any sort of boldly marked frontier whose breaching will seem significant. But once you represent it in fahrenheit, the move up from two digits to three has a symbolical significance of real power.That’s what I thought, anyway, in the years I spent writing about climate change and being something of a temperature nerd, waiting for the 100 mark to be hit, for “the ton to be up”. When the 100F threshold is broken, I thought, everyone will see at once that we are in new territory in terms of climate everyone will perceive the reality of global warming, in an instinctive way. And in August 2003 the day finally came, and I remember vividly how hot it was and the day went and people carried on with their business just as before, and have forgotten it completely.Yet my own view is that we did indeed enter new territory that day and if we have waited 15 years to get back there (and maybe we will wait still longer), it merely illustrates what we know, that climate change proceeds in a non-linear way, in irregular jumps rather than a smooth ascent. But watch out for it, this sweltering summer (probably in the first week of August) watch out for it on the old-fashioned fahrenheit scale as well as on the modern celsius. And if you see that the ton is up, and 100F is exceeded, be assured that even if a new outright temperature record is not set, the world is changing in the profoundest of ways.• Michael McCarthy is the author of The Moth Snowstorm: Nature and Joy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718df224c8c66f5f588612ba18907e1282228a85/0_228_3644_2186/master/3644.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a065ddc9586a0a97f9be7bb0c39957d7","title":"ireland becomes worlds first country to divest from fossil fuels","story":"Bill passed by parliament means more than €300m shares in coal, oil, peat and gas will be sold ‘as soon as practicable’The Republic of Ireland will become the world’s first country to sell off its investments in fossil fuel companies, after a bill was passed with all-party support in the lower house of parliament.The state’s €8bn national investment fund will be required to sell all investments in coal, oil, gas and peat “as soon as is practicable”, which is expected to mean within five years. Norway’s huge $1tn sovereign wealth fund has only partially ested from fossil fuels, targeting some coal companies, and is still considering its oil and gas holdings.The fossil fuel estment movement has grown rapidly and trillions of dollars of investment funds have been ested, including large pension funds and insurers, cities such as New York, churches and universities. Supporters of estment say existing fossil fuel resources are already far greater than can be burned without causing catastrophic climate change and that exploring and producing more fossil fuels is therefore morally wrong and economically risky. However, some critics argue say that remaining as shareholders and persuading fossil fuel companies to change can be more effective. The Irish fossil fuel estment bill was passed in the lower house of parliament on Thursday and it is expected to pass rapidly through the upper house, meaning it could become law before the end of the year. The Irish state investment fund holds more than €300m in fossil fuel investments in 150 companies.Meehan said: “Just last month Ireland was ranked the second worst European country for climate action, so the passing of this bill is good news. But it has to mark a significant change of pace on the issue.”Gerry Liston at Global Legal Action Network, who drafted the bill, said: “Governments will not meet their obligations under the Paris agreement on climate change if they continue to financially sustain the fossil fuel industry.

But she still can’t get a followup off the ground It’s a familiar story: a young director heads to the Sundance film festival with their debut feature. The crowd is wowed jury likewise. The movie gets picked up for a major distribution deal and is deemed an instant classic. But while the likes of Quentin Tarantino, Steven Soderbergh, Robert Rodriguez, Richard Linklater, Darren Aronofsky, Paul Thomas Anderson, Wes Anderson and the Coen brothers have converted Park City acclaim into enduring careers, even Oscars, things turned out rather differently for Leslie Harris.I meet Harris, now 57, for tea at the Trade Union Cafe in Brooklyn, not far from the home she shares with her husband, a New York Times photographer. Soft-spoken and gentle, she was born in Cleveland, Ohio. She loved cinema from an early age and, spurred on by her touring-musician father and a mother big on female empowerment, moved to New York to pursue a career in advertising, before jacking it in to shoot her first movie.Its $130,000 budget came from a day job temping, night work at a non-profit film organisation that provided equipment in exchange for time, occasional gigs directing commercials for beauty salons in her neighbourhood – and, when cash dried up in post-production, cheques from the author Terry McMillan and the film-maker Michael Moore.Just Another Girl on the IRT (1993) is the moving and exuberant story of Chantel (Ariyan A Johnson), an outspoken 17-year-old black girl, a top-grade student slated to graduate from her Brooklyn high school a year early, her eyes set on a career in medicine. The film’s poster was one of the first to feature a young black girl solo its tagline was: “If you think you know her, think again.”Harris had already had a lifetime of being prejudged and underestimated Chantel was an expression of her desire to prove people wrong. “I would see these young girls getting on the train after school and they would be so loud, people would go to the next car,” she says. “There was a stereotype that people had. I wanted to follow these young people home, to see what they were really about.” It wasn’t just the women who got stereotyped: when she pitched the script to studios, they wanted Harris to make Chantel’s boyfriend a drug-dealer she refused.Chantel breaks the fourth wall in the film, telling us how she seeks not to be defined by her background, or by the personal challenges that threaten to overcome her. But the real story is how her intelligence is often taken for granted by the people in her life, particularly men, black and white alike, who see her as a mouth to be silenced, rather than a mind to be cultivated.The film stormed Sundance, taking home the special jury prize and attracting the attention of Miramax, with whom she brokered the first ever wide-release deal for a film directed by an African American woman. It hit more than 200 screens in the US and travelled to 20 countries beyond. Harris was lauded as a game-changer. And then … nothing. Twenty-five years on, Harris has yet to make a second movie – just like Julie Dash, another black female director, whose debut film, Daughters of the Dust, took top honours at Sundance two years before.What happened? “I had scripts right out the bat after Just Another Girl,” says Harris. “Which I thought were interesting: people loved them. And my agent said,: ‘Well, I can’t get them funded. We can’t get a film financed with a black woman lead.’”The problem, thinks Harris, was always to do more with gender than race, both in front of the camera and behind. Back then, black people were making movies, but they were all men: Spike Lee, John Singleton, Ernest Dickinson. “If you look back at the 90s, it was really a boys’ club – Boyz in the Hood, Juice, Straight Out of Brooklyn, Hanging With the Homeboys. There were very few women who were getting that attention. Hollywood was embracing black males.“The difference for me is that they didn’t really want to tell stories about black women, and they surely didn’t want to have a black woman behind the camera.” She even had one such director tell her that she was “in the way”– taking up a valued token spot that should have gone to him.Harris has mostly spent the past quarter-century teaching, at colleges across the US and as a professor at New York University Tisch School of the Arts. Some screen work has come her way: she made a short for Showtime about Bessie Coleman, the first African-American pilot, which she struggled to turn into a feature. At the moment, she is still trying to get funding – as she has for the past five years – for a second movie, I Love Cinema, a sexual satire about a sophisticated and outspoken academic called Layla who becomes involved in a cinema-inspired racial controversy (Layla is evidently something of a spiritual relation to Chantel – and, indeed, to their creator). One Kickstarter attempt in 2013 ended up with just $4,074 of its $35,000 goal.Aspiring black female directors may be concerned by her example, but at least, she says, she has retained her integrity. “I made the film I wanted to make,” she smiles. “Never give up. I’m the perfect example, after 25 years. Tides change. The climate changes. Never compromise too much of your story.”Leslie Harris will attend screenings of Just Another Girl on the IRT at the Cinema Rediscovered festival at the BFI Southbank, London, on 27 July and Watershed, Bristol, on 28 July "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00d67cc7082a88ef3f7c6c7d5be8be6e1cc783b4/0_149_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43b1b93bd0af53b7df70ecf74287b163","title":"mira sorvino casting director gagged me with a condom at 16","story":"The Oscar-winning actor claims that during one of her first auditions she was tied to a chair, bruised and gaggedMira Sorvino has claimed that a casting director gagged her with a condom during an audition at the age of 16.The Oscar-winning star of Mighty Aphrodite revealed in an interview with the Hollywood Foreign Press Association’s podcast that she was auditioning for a horror movie when the situation got out of hand.“In looking back over at my career, I realized that one of my very first auditions when I was 16, I was completely treated inappropriately by the casting director,” she said. “In order to scare me for this horror movie scene, he tied me to a chair, he bruised my arm, and I was 16 years old, and then he gagged me, and I was all game because I’m trying to be scared for the scene.”She continued: “And at the end he takes the gag out of my mouth and he said, ‘Sorry for the prophylactic,’ so he had gagged me with a condom. I was too young to even know, thank God, what a condom tasted like. It was so inappropriate, and what the heck was a casting director doing with a condom in his pocket in an audition?”In the same podcast, Sorvino also called out “one big director” who she says “has Oscars” and is known for his “social justice profile” who ended an audition by saying: “You know, as I look at you my mind can’t help but traveling from the artistic possibilities to the sexual.”Sorvino had previously come forward with her own story about disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein, alleging that he sexually harassed her. Peter Jackson later revealed that Weinstein had told him not to consider her for a role in The Lord of the Rings as she was difficult to work with.The actor has also apologized for working with Woody Allen on Mighty Aphrodite, the film that won her an Oscar for best supporting actress. In January, she penned an open letter to his daughter Dylan Farrow, who claims that he molested her as a child. “I cannot begin to imagine how you have felt, all these years as you watched someone you called out as having hurt you as a child, a vulnerable little girl in his care, be lauded again and again, including by me and countless others in Hollywood who praised him and ignored you,” Sorvino wrote for the Huffington Post. “As a mother and a woman, this breaks my heart for you. I am so, so sorry!”Sorvino was recently seen in the mini-series Condor and her upcoming roles include thriller Look Away with Jason Isaacs and comedy Stuber with Dave Bautista."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e086afe2755cd2ffcbb0f6eb47151c5f29d555b4/0_71_2618_1571/master/2618.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f345d278f158e3f5c1b1a5aec1a8722","title":"antonio conte exit chelsea","story":"Given all the squabbling behind the scenes, and the discontent which has festered on both sides, it was appropriate the orce should end up seeming rather undignified. Antonio Conte finally took his leave of Chelsea on Thursday, with news of his departure inevitably leaked from his native Italy. The official club statement will follow at some stage, possibly burying the bad news beneath confirmation of the appointment of Maurizio Sarri as his successor. Conte has felt incidental for a while. And that, in truth, sums it all up.Theirs had been a relatively fleeting and distinctly acrimonious relationship, soured by disagreements almost from the outset over transfer policy, for all the significant silverware to celebrate. Maybe Conte had been wildly unrealistic in his demands, presuming there would be a return to the lavish spending of Roman Abramovich’s early ownership, particularly as he sought to build on the unlikely league-winning success of that first campaign in 2016-17.Perhaps the club could have relaxed what had become in effect a one-in, one-out approach on signings and added greater depth before last season’s return to the Champions League. As it was, neither party was ever going to agree on the identity of those to come in: one wanted experience which came at a premium the other preferred younger talent who could be developed, or players in a £30m-£40m bracket.That brief, frosty handshake between the head coach and the hugely influential board member turned de facto director of football, Marina Granovskaia, up in the royal box at Wembley in the giddy moments before Chelsea hoisted the FA Cup 55 days ago provided a snapshot of how dysfunctional it had all become. Conte, who had never been comfortable at the lack of direct contact he had with Abramovich, announced post-match that he was never going to change. “When you decide to take a coach like me, you must know who you are taking on,” he said. “I cannot change my personality.”His belligerent style would be maintained and another year of spats with the board, infecting the collective mood, whether played out in public or private, was unthinkable. The hope at the time was that both parties could swiftly go their separate ways, with Conte courted and claimed by a suitor – Italy, Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain, Napoli – and the club efficiently securing a successor.It would have been the cleanest separation and more in line with most of the managerial changes that Chelsea have instigated over the last 14 years. As it transpired, the ensuing weeks brought only inertia, the kind of which can drag into a new campaign.Virtually all communication ceased. The head coach had expected the axe to fall at any minute but was greeted instead by radio silence. There was a theory the club were getting their own back after Conte had subjected them to a period last summer where his mobile consistently rang out once it had become clear the close season would not be decorated by a procession of his preferred new arrivals.Such sulkiness did not go down well. The hierarchy’s apparent intransigence over the payment of a compensation package, either to Conte for the last year of his £9m-a-season contract or to Napoli for the successor in waiting, Sarri, seemed self-defeating at times. But the antipathy was deep and mutual.The club had grown tired of Conte’s griping and felt aggrieved over the impromptu text he had pinged to Diego Costa last summer, informing the striker he was no longer in his plans. Costa was always likely to move on in 2017 but they suspected that throwaway SMS – a sharp elbow in the ribs to a disruptive if effective striker – had undermined their negotiating position with prospective suitors and cost them millions of pounds, for all that the advertised £57m price secured from Atlético Madrid for Costa’s return felt hefty. Regardless of the reasoning for the delays, and with Abramovich’s priorities elsewhere given his visa issues, the resulting sense of drift has been damaging.Uncertainty has gripped the club. The first-team players not involved at the World Cup were given little more than a week’s notice that they were expected back for pre-season fitness tests on 7 July, with full training to begin two days later. The 14 at the World Cup had been left equally baffled as to how long their extended breaks would be once their nation was eliminated. Victor Moses suggested he “might get a telephone call tonight telling me how long I have off” on the evening Nigeria exited to Argentina, and did not have a clue who would be overseeing the sessions.As it transpired, that would be Conte. Yet the Italian’s pre-season programme, compiled on the off-chance he would still be in charge, had the squad returning for tests on the Monday, not the Saturday. He had dutifully if grudgingly reported back to his office at Cobham but had no real input until the players took to the pitches 48 hours later. By Chelsea’s standards it has all seemed uncomfortably haphazard. Conte had always insisted he would be professional, whatever the summer would bring, but he had no real desire to remain at the helm. Relations had become strained with a number of players over a difficult second season in charge, when the intensity of training had been only marginally tweaked despite the cluttered fixture list. David Luiz was apparently hampered by a thigh complaint over the last months of the campaign but had barely featured after openly questioning the tactics. He would not have played even if fully fit.Willian took to Instagram after the FA Cup final win against Manchester United and, on a photograph of the triumphant squad on the pitch at Wembley, childishly covered Conte with three trophy emojis. There was no real prospect of the Brazilian featuring again under the Italian’s regime. Courtois has his own issues with the club and is likely to move on this summer regardless of the identity of the manager but, most alarmingly for Chelsea, Eden Hazard was not entirely content last season. Retaining the playmaker, rather than the head coach, was always the club’s priority.The potential for everything to descend into petty spite was obvious and ultimately a parting of the ways benefited everyone. Conte may now enjoy a sabbatical, living off the last year of his Chelsea contract. The club, still ferociously ambitious, albeit operating in a different market from the Manchester clubs, will expect to compete for honours.They will look to Sarri, whose arrival will come with the considerable sweetener of the appointment of Gianfranco Zola in some capacity, and hope he produces something as miraculous as Conte’s Premier League success in his first season.That trophy remains his greatest triumph in London: to have hoisted a team who had finished 10th the previous year and restored them to the pinnacle was remarkable. Recall briefly the champagne-drenched celebrations at the Hawthorns after the title had been secured and it had looked the perfect fit. In reality, once the fizz was flat, that was to be nothing more than a mirage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cff71d4d914a8a5d47340070f5aafce2b31a0585/0_134_4012_2407/master/4012.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=693a51e4fa350f5714d0d4332f28a8d1","title":"dejan lovren croatia world cup best defender","story":"• Liverpool defender says Croatia’s win was answer to his critics• Lovren says his side ‘made history’ against EnglandDejan Lovren believes he has proved himself as one of the best defenders in the world after helping to steer Croatia into a first World Cup final, and suggested his team’s ability to see off England at the Luzhniki Stadium boiled down to strength of character.The Liverpool defender, who missed Euro 2016, grew into Wednesday’s semi-final and, seven weeks after enduring crushing disappointment in the Champions League final against Real Madrid, will now confront France on Sunday seeking to secure his country’s first World Cup. Croatia will be motivated further by the chance to avenge their semi-final loss to Les Bleus 20 years ago, though Lovren already feels he has restored his nation’s reputation, as well as his own, at the tournament in Russia.“But this criticism is what gets me more motivated to work harder and prove everyone wrong. Everyone. From today, everyone in Croatia and around the world saw we managed to make history. In 20 years’ time, people will remember us, and not just the team from 1998. That is why I am proud, and now we have one game to make people remember us forever.“It is special history when you look back and see we had to play 120 minutes three times and we still had fresher legs than that England team. The difference was mental because we knew we could write history and we did it.“We went through a lot of shit: war, all these things, and even now the situation is not the best. But it is unbelievable how many talents we have in sport. At basketball, at handball, at water polo, at tennis especially. We have good mothers and fathers, making good love.”Zlatko Dalic’s team, who eventually prevailed courtesy of Mario Mandzukic’s 109th minute winner, will now attempt to recover their energy levels after a third gruelling knockout game in succession that has gone to extra time, with memories of 1998 fuelling their intent. Croatia took the lead at the Stade de France against the World Cup hosts courtesy of Davor Suker, only for Lillian Thuram’s brace to see France through despite Laurent Blanc’s controversial dismissal.“I was nine and I remember my mum was screaming and crying after the French game,” said Lovren. “Maybe it’s our time for revenge. It’s going to be a tough game, it will be difficult, but we have a good chance to give them something back for 20 years ago.“For me, it is beautiful. If somebody had told me at the beginning of the season that I would play in two of the biggest finals in the world, I would have signed up straight away. I went through a lot of shit. Unfortunately I didn’t win the Champions League, but there is still this. I believed more that I could win the Champions League – I believe that from day one because we had the power and speed at Liverpool – than coming here to Russia. Here we have different players, but we have showed we can manage. France are definitely the favourites, there is no hiding from that, but we love to be the underdogs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aad591254d5db77a7b3be3d22190d2f7e91ac0f9/185_140_3506_2104/master/3506.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aaa1a77d5bd1e1b059620b68284327f5","title":"england gareth southgate world cup russia 2018","story":"Southgate you’re the one. England’s single greatest upgrade at this World Cup: they have a manager who sweated the small stuff that makes the big stuff. The great skill of Gareth Southgate has been to manage the details around this team, to implement the “elite sport” habits of British Olympic and cycling success through sports science, psychology, useful gimmickry. A carefully-schemed team culture has been fostered. Players have been picked on the basis of ability to “buy into” this, as well as physical types: fit, athletic, good habits. England borrowed the “No Dickheads” rule from the All Blacks. And they’ve become likeable. This isn’t surprising. They haven’t got any dickheads. The fact this kind of quality is being rewarded is progress in itself. But still not quite whole again.Southgate talks constantly about development. He will know the tactical, game-management part of his World Cup was less of a feature. This is understandable. Southgate is still inexperienced. England don’t have much on the bench to play with. Still, though, England’s substitutions were a non‑event. The tactic of pumping long passes forward in the semi-final became predictable. The entropy after half‑time against Croatia was reminiscent of other tournament deaths. Back in 2002 Southgate himself noted that England needed Winston Churchill but got Iain Duncan Smith from Sven Goran Eriksson. Watching on Wednesday night from his latest franchise-league outpost as England ran out of ideas, Sven might just have sighed a little to himself. There is much to ponder, as well as build on.The best thing about the past year has been Southgate’s understated ruthlessness. From the overdue ousting of Wayne, to the refusal to take anyone to Russia who wasn’t fit or in form, there has been a heartening element of coldness to the manager’s judgment calls. That must now be applied to his group, to the next step. No favourites. No favours. Keep on pruning back the dead heads.Keeping the ball, passing carefully. This was the revelation of England’s tournament, a genuine first right up to the moment they started sending it long and trying to hit Raheem at the Luzhniki. This was modern. This was progressive. This actually looked like international football. Don’t turn back now.At what point does going on about how you don’t go on about your team become going on about your team? How easy is to remain humble when everyone talks constantly about how wonderfully, spectacularly humble you are? It is easy to imagine that the hype will now be ramped up again, the expectations lumped on once more, the train cranked back into gear. The test from here is to keep that throttle low, to accept that England beating Panama, Tunisia and Sweden should be a cause of enjoyment and fun. But it’s not yet a sign of the second coming (home).There is a sub-set of human being who will maintain England somehow fluked a semi-final, that any team they managed to beat must, by definition, be useless. This is clearly misguided. England beat Sweden, Ukraine and Wales at their last three tournaments combined. They have just won three games and a shootout in a month. To denigrate this is sour grapes, the agony of seeing somebody you automatically dislike doing quite well for once. Either that or a degree of English arrogance that insists ultimate victory is the only kind of victory. Portugal drew with Iceland, Austria, Poland and Hungary en route to winning the last European Championship. Is Cristiano Ronaldo also a hair-gelled fraud? The sensible view is that this team performed with energy and adopted a set of tactics that worked against opponents at the same level. The parts that succeeded can be built on. The rest is just noise.There will also be carping about Harry Kane’s proximity to the golden boot. Three penalties, a deflection and two tap-ins. Just Fontaine must be bricking it. But Kane actually showed his ruthlessness at this World Cup. There is a reason his six goals were carved out of only 12 shots. England just didn’t make many chances from open play. Luckily they had a one-shot sniper on board when the moments came. There may be issues with this team. But Kane really isn’t one of them.They didn’t before the World Cup. They do know. Jordan Pickford may still make mistakes, may have some dips, but he was probably England’s best player in Russia and deserves a long run at this now.It has become hard to assess publicly Raheem Sterling’s role. Demeaning, racially tinged coverage of his personal life by the news pages of some newspapers has created a polarised position. Halfway through the tournament it was being suggested that in fact Sterling was playing wonderfully well, with the implication that to say otherwise was either further victimisation or a sign of football blindness. The truth is somewhere in the middle. Sterling performed the role given to him with energy, pulled the centre backs around and created space. But a large part of his job as a No 10 is to make or score goals and he lacked precision at vital moments. Sterling is one of England’s best players. But this simply wasn’t his best position.The evening changed in Moscow as Luka Modric began to get on the ball. Suddenly this felt like a two‑tier game. Hold everything: the talent’s here. England have no comparable midfielder, the kind of player who helps you beat the better teams. But there is playmaking talent in the age groups that might be identified and groomed. If only Pep Guardiola could get properly stuck into Phil Foden for the next two years. Pray, England fans, for a Manchester City creative midfielder injury crisis.Or Jadon Sancho. Or Callum Hudson-Odoi. Or Xavier Amaechi. Or Sven Hibblethwaite-Thomas. There will be an urge to fetishise England’s younger talent, to suggest some great new brave shining dawn is on the verge of breaking. But those younger players must battle with Premier League short-termism just for game time, and will require above all patience and the right to make the odd wrong turn. Stay calm. Again, defy the hype. And Sven Hibblethwaite-Thomas doesn’t even exist anyway.Good luck Gareth. History suggests you’ll need it. One of the side-effects of success has been the neutralising of a notoriously demanding press pack. Southgate has become bulletpoof through this World Cup, wearing a suit of armour in the form of three precious tournament wins. The wider culture has co-opted him. The news pages want to know whose shirts he wears. But it won’t take much. A few poor qualifying results. The realisation that England have an essentially defensive style. You can see how that could play out. All the more reason to stay patient, and for Southgate himself to keep working and improving, always trying to run ahead of the surf."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0848c5ca17b7c2d1f3393d0c9718543f6bb06205/4_375_3915_2349/master/3915.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4ed5f7831173b69ab3cb22221364149","title":"england harry kane belgium world cup third place play off","story":"• Striker two goals ahead of Romelu Lukaku in Golden Boot race• Alexander-Arnold, Rose and Eric Dier set to start final gameGareth Southgate will assess Harry Kane in training on Friday before determining whether his captain, pursuing the World Cup’s golden boot, will start in the third-place play-off against Belgium in St Petersburg on Saturday.Kane tops the scorers’ charts with six goals, two clear of Romelu Lukaku going into their teams’ second meeting at the tournament, and three from France’s Kylian Mbappé and Antoine Griezmann, who will compete in the final. The striker, rendered ineffective by Croatia, has declared himself fit, though the personal trophy would not compensate for the disappointment endured in Wednesday’s semi-final.“The third-place game is not a match we wanted to be in,” Kane said. “But we will try to play with as much pride as we can and finish on a high. We will still be thinking of the semi-final defeat, and what could have been, but of course I want to play. Everyone will want to.“We are extremely proud of what we have achieved. We know we have restored pride in the England shirt, back home as well, so we can hold our heads up high. But we know that it is an opportunity lost. The aim now is not to have to wait another 20-odd years to get into another big semi-final.”Southgate does not expect Kieran Trippier, Ashley Young or Jordan Henderson to be fit, the wing-backs having picked up injuries against Croatia and the midfielder having aggravated a hamstring complaint.“It will be more about the physical capabilities of the team,” the manager said. “It’s the chance to have our second‑best-ever finish and the chance for the players to get a medal. So there’s that and there’s the pride in playing for your country again.

It turned out to be rhetorical as he answered it himself by adding: “It’s Croatia, don’t even doubt that!”Vecernji’s website devoted an unusual amount of space to gloating over the fate of the losing team, with headlines such as “Football’s not coming home”, “The arrogance hit them back”, “The English are sore losers” and even published a photo gallery titled “Look how the English cry after losing to Croatia” with pictures of downbeat players and fans.The 24 sata daily published a video from the team’s hotel, where players can be seen standing on a dinner table and singing along with veteran entertainer Mladen Grdovic. “Pinch yourself and don’t worry, you aren’t dreaming, this is reality,” wrote Marko Snidaric. “Close your eyes without any fear, and when you open them you’ll see Croatia celebrating. You’ll see Croatia crying. Out of happiness.”Jutarnji list gave central space to quotes from players. “Croatia is burning, but we haven’t burned down yet,” Danijel Subasic said. Sportske novosti, the nation’s only daily sports newspaper, was full of praise for the manager, Zlatko Dalic, claiming he has outdone every other Croatia coach by leading the team to the final. “France, who are better than England, can hardly stop them,” wrote Drazen Antolic. “That will be a true final, a top clash between the two sides who have shown the most at the tournament.”Index.hr, a popular website, acknowledged that England were the better side in the first half, but when Ivan Perisic scored, Sasa Cobanov said, “it was the beginning of the end for the English”.Telesport’s Juraj Vrdoljak compared Croatia’s second-half comeback to an “adrenaline-driven man lifting a truck to save his child”. Croatia emerged victorious, he stated, after “clinching her teeth and biting on a knife in the manner of Cholo’s commandos before using it to rip the history apart at the finishing line”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0182da31d7b270ade32916c63126dae1a61bf21f/653_977_2863_1718/master/2863.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbed51e7cd7b8d9cb3b639d0f2a3626e","title":"gareth southgate sanguine england semi final defeat missed chance call composure","story":"England’s manager reflects on a ‘cruel lesson’ and will know the lost semi-final may have been a once-in-a-lifetime opportunityIt was coming up for 1am local time when Gareth Southgate walked back out to acknowledge the England supporters inside the Luzhniki Stadium who were refusing to leave until he gave them one more appearance. He waved politely. He dropped his water bottle and applauded back. Briefly he scratched his head and blew out his cheeks a little, as if he could not quite believe they were still there, waiting for him, singing that song again. He waved again. He bowed. But it was unmistakable sadness etched on his face.Over time, when the pain subsides a little, he will reflect that England have come a long way since Euro 2016 ended with chants informing the players they were not fit to wear the shirt. England’s previous World Cup campaign was wrecked by two defeats in the first week. This one made it to day 28 before the killer blow in extra time of the semi-final. England had scored more goals than the team of 1966 and shattered their reputation as tournament football’s Slapstick XI.That is progress in anyone’s language when there are so many wearers of that shirt with entirely different experiences. “People may have had a feeling that playing for England was always misery and regret and recrimination,” Southgate said. “Now, I think, they have seen it can be enjoyable.”At the same time there is a risk here that the tidal wave of goodwill is threatening to submerge a difficult truth: that England were a goal ahead, 25 minutes from a World Cup final, before it all became too much for them. Croatia wore them down with a superior mix of football knowhow, durability and the rare form of competitive courage that had Juraj Vrdoljak, a columnist for Telesport, likening the comeback to an “adrenaline-charged man lifting a truck to save his child”. But it was still the case that England badly lost their way and, in fairness to the manager, he was willing to accept that fact.In the dressing room afterwards Southgate told the players everything you would expect about being proud of their achievements, thanking them inidually and pointing out the warmth of the England supporters at the final whistle. First, though, he felt compelled to point out what they had to do better in the future. Even in the rawest moments, with many of the players tearful, he wanted them to listen.“I’m not sure it was perfect by any means because the whole place was desolate,” Southgate reflected, the morning after the night before.Instead England looked what they were: a team that would give you everything, with some fine players and, indeed, some excellent ones, but lacking the mentality the elite sides possess when it comes to the biggest occasions. “We just lost a bit of composure,” Southgate said. It was a “cruel lesson”. He maintained eye contact even in the hardest moments of reflection. But he spoke so quietly at times you had to lean in to hear his voice.If the immaturity of the team cost England, do not be too critical. Or at least remember it was the inexperience and freshness of this group of players that helped make them so attractive in the first place – unless you want to go back to those days in May when the nation was bickering about the non-selections of Jack Wilshere and Jonjo Shelvey and it became clear why Southgate had not used his Twitter account since April 2015.At the next World Cup almost all these players will still be available and, in theory, better for the experience. Jordan Pickford will be 28, approaching the age when goalkeepers are supposed to peak. Marcus Rashford will still be young, at 24, but armed with another four years’ experience. Raheem Sterling, at 27, should be a more competent finisher than he is now. Harry Kane will be 28, Dele Alli 26, Jesse Lingard 29, John Stones 28, Harry Maguire 29, Ruben Loftus-Cheek 26 and Trent Alexander-Arnold 23.Jordan Henderson, Kieran Trippier and Kyle Walker will be in their early-30s but still of an age to play at Qatar 2022. It is only Ashley Young, Gary Cahill and Jamie Vardy who can probably be discounted on grounds of age. “We have one of two paths to go,” Southgate said. “This is either a moment of rare hope and we sink back. Or we build in the way that Germany did in 2010.”Unlike 1990 with Bobby Robson, or the team Terry Venables guided to the semi-finals of Euro 96, the England manager will also be sticking around. “The team will be better in a couple of years,” Southgate continued. “We have to build. We have some good young players coming through. We’ve had success at youth level. What we’ve done over the last few weeks has shown what is possible. We want to be in semi-finals and finals and we’ve shown to ourselves that can happen. Now we have to use it as a springboard to reach the latter stages of tournaments consistently.”That, in turn, will mean new expectations. The next European Championship will culminate with a Wembley final on 12 July 2020, and suddenly it will feel a let-down if England do not reach the semi-finals at least. But there should still be France, Belgium, Germany, and Spain to encounter, as well as Croatia and more. England have beaten only two sides from the top 20 of Fifa’s world rankings on Southgate’s watch, and those were Colombia in 16th and the worst Netherlands side for many years in 17th. “At the moment we have to be realistic,” he acknowledged. “All the games we’ve had against the bigger teams we haven’t managed to win yet.”The other problem, in line with a succession of England managers, is that he has no way of influencing the leading Premier League clubs to accommodate the players who are pushing through. Will Phil Foden, for instance, get an extended chance at Manchester City? Southgate would like to think so but these reflections came on the same day that City held a press conference to display Riyad Mahrez as their latest signing.That is Mahrez, Sterling, David Silva, Kevin De Bruyne, Leroy Sané, Bernardo Silva and Ilkay Gündogan whom Foden may have to get past for a regular run in the team. All of which brings to mind Roy Hodgson’s old complaint – referencing Loftus-Cheek and Chelsea’s preference to “go racing out to buy the latest Dutchman every time someone goes down injured” – that the academies were producing players who were in danger of becoming “too good to sell and not good enough to play”.Southgate frequently mentions England’s next generation but is very aware the “pathway”, as it is known, tends to be closed at some clubs.He was also reluctant to talk too much about what could happen in the future when he was acutely aware the World Cup may never open up with so many possibilities again.Southgate did not need reminding that it might have been a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and, as such, Sunday’s final will feel like a form of torture. This is a man who hates losing so much he says he could sit for hours in a game of Scrabble trying to find two- or three-letter words that he suspects probably do not exist. Southgate still remembers a 1-0 defeat for Crystal Palace at home to Blackburn Rovers on New Year’s Day 1994, when he was at fault for the goal and the misery, living alone in a flat, of it churning in his mind. “It has never changed. I’ve always been a terrible loser. Defeat wrecks my head.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e53e1880c1ef768b906c57be492fb6cbf25e1ba3/0_167_5024_3014/master/5024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1458f6f5c8e9adac0dacaf1d72406db9","title":"penny finally dropped newly disciplined paul pogba","story":"Samuel Umtiti was first up, with Paul Pogba to follow, as France looked ahead to Sunday’s World Cup final against Croatia with a press conference out by the magnificent New Jerusalem Monastery to the west of Moscow. If Umtiti had any illusion about his warm-up act status, he was disabused of it within seconds of pulling his chair to the table.“Ladies and gentleman, I present Paul Umtiti,” the France federation media officer said, before wishing he could have his time again. To be fair to Umtiti, who has been in fine form at the tournament, he took it well. The Barcelona centre-half stood straight up and, to no little laughter from the audience, strode off in mock a fashion. He would return.Everybody was waiting for Pogba and it was ever thus but particularly so before this World Cup, after his erratic season at Manchester United. What sort of Pogba would turn up? The smart money was on the celebrity midfielder, who must give free rein to his talent and, if that means overlooking the dirtier aspects of the job, then fine. It was the attitude that had driven the United manager, José Mourinho, to distraction and it was one that helped to place a significant wedge between them.The Pogba that has shown in Russia has been a revelation. It has not been on the same scale as Kylian Mbappé, who has electrified France’s progress to a fifth major final in 20 years, but it has been a revelation nonetheless.“It’s a pleasure to defend,” Pogba said, early on in his Q\u0026ampA session and at that point one almost had to rub one’s eyes. Mourinho, from his seat as a pundit for RT, has to have been doing the same.How has Didier Deschamps managed to draw such discipline and balance from him? Or, to put it another way, how has the France manager succeeded where Mourinho has so often failed?“Pogba played with great maturity,” Mourinho said of his performance in the 1-0 semi-final win over Belgium. “When he had to hold his position and keep control of the game, he did. When Deschamps took off Olivier Giroud for Steven Nzonzi, Pogba had more freedom but freedom not to do silly things. Freedom to keep the ball away from the dangerous areas. To keep the ball, to assist Antoine Griezmann for a great chance. He was very, very mature.”The impression has been that a penny has somehow dropped in Pogba but why should it be? How has he come to strip things back to what truly matters, a theme he reinforced when he considered Mbappé’s outrageous touch and backheel that almost laid on a goal for Giroud against Belgium? “If you do a great move and it’s efficient, it’s good,” Pogba said. “But if you lose the ball, it’s bad.”Perhaps it is the magnitude of what is at stake or, maybe, the effect of having N’Golo Kanté alongside him. It is fair to say that Pogba has not always played with this degree of control in a central midfield two for United. Another theory is that there are 89 million reasons for Pogba to feel he has to turn on the style at Old Trafford – equating to the fee that the club paid to take him from Juventus. Yet another is that it is simply down to greater experience this is not Pogba’s first World Cup, rather his second. Whatever it is, self-sacrifice has been the theme for him.“It is a World Cup and we have to sacrifice,” Pogba said. “We have to defend. It’s not what I do best but I do it with pleasure. We have the same objective and it is to win. I think I have become more mature and all the other players help me a lot on that.“Antoine Griezmann, for example, is a forward but he talks to me. He tells me to go back to defence. If I get better, it’s thanks to the team and the coach. The second World Cup is different from the first one. You play against teams with experience, against great players and I also cannot play the same way as I play for my club. We have found a balance with everyone and with N’Golo Kanté.“We run together, attack together, defend together – it’s when we are strongest. Even the critics have helped me to improve but that doesn’t mean they should start criticising me! I think the image that people have of me has changed. I am playing as a midfielder now, which is my role. I am being less offensive. I think people judge me now on my role as a midfielder and not as a player who can score goals and make assists.”Pogba is 25 but, according to Umtiti, he has always been a leader. Now, the feeling is more pronounced. Pogba is one of the strongest voices in the squad. His presence fills the room. “Patrick Vieira gave me some advice,” Pogba said of the former France captain. “He told me to talk, to give out advice and I do it now. Vieira has always been an example. He is a born leader.”Pogba and France have narrowed their focus. The run to the final has been exhilarating but it will count for nothing if they do not beat Croatia. That is the mentality and it has been shaped by the experience of Euro 2016, when they beat Germany in the semi-final and expected to sweep past Portugal in the final. They would lose 1-0. Over-confidence was their downfall. This time they are determined to see the job through.“At the Euros we probably thought we had already won it before the final,” Pogba said. “When we beat Germany, we thought it was the final. We are aware of that mistake now and we don’t want to repeat it. We will prepare differently. The holiday after 2016 was horrible. I still remember it. It was a very bitter taste and no one wants that again. We haven’t come this far to lose in the final.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2add0d7eb156de2d2159dd03a3cfefc65991bb8c/0_352_4880_2928/master/4880.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=062a71752cbd773b409f6f5f6ab4720b","title":"toxic times unity england coming home","story":"We can all hope for a lasting legacy of unity from England’s heartening journey to the World Cup semi-final, but there is a queue of cautionary notesWhen England make it to a World Cup in normal times there is never too much need to agonise over the significance of it all beyond the football itself the coherence of midfield, confidence on the ball, the astonishingly fine margins between progress and exit. But these are abnormal times – with the UK ided by the toxic, anti‑immigration Brexit campaign – so, understandably, people have agonised.Looking for optimistic signs, many people have seen a warmer‑hearted version of England being encouraged by the extended exposure to the inclusive values of Gareth Southgate and his erse, likable group of players. In a tweet just after England’s elimination by Croatia, Kyle Walker channelled the spirit and nearly the exact words of the Labour MP Jo Cox, who was murdered by an English fascist just before the referendum: “We might live in a time where sometimes it’s easier to be negative than positive, or to ide than to unite, but England: let’s keep this unity alive. I love you.”We can all hope for a lasting legacy of unity from England’s surprisingly extended and heartening journey to the semi-final, but there is a queue of cautionary notes. The first is that it is not clear whether or how this message particularly communicates itself to the millions of people supporting England, whether in an ecstatic, pint‑chucking city square crowd or at home on the couch with a brew.For some the participation in England’s squad of 11 sons of immigrants may be absorbed, notable and a source of pride – including Southgate himself no doubt, given his comments about wanting to heal the country’s isions. For others it may not be if England had actually triumphed, perhaps for some the lesson would have been that the country is superior, we can stand alone, that the Brexit decision was somehow vindicated.The memory lingers of fans at the European Championship just before the 2016 referendum chanting in a French square: “Fuck off Europe, we’re all voting out.”We have a previous experience of this, the 2012 London Olympics, and the legacy was not long‑lasting. Then, the whole United Kingdom was treated to the stellar achievements and unrestrained patriotism of a Great Britain team including many black and mixed-race athletes. Few corners of the country were left unaware of Mo Farah’s inspiring story, that he came to London as a refugee from war-torn Somalia, and here he was with his cockney accent and smile as bright as a floodlight, running round the track with a gold medal, wrapped in the union jack. Danny Boyle’s opening ceremony was hailed around the world for its celebration of modern, multicultural Britain, showcasing the NHS and the Windrush Caribbean immigrants who helped to build it.Now we know too well what happened, despite that summer when the country was being told that old isions and resentments had been overcome. At the very same time Theresa May, then the home secretary, was implementing her policy to make the UK a “hostile environment” for “illegal” immigrants, many of whom are simply asylum seekers, like Farah was, whose claims the Home Office does not accept. We know what the results of that policy scandalously were for so many distinguished members of the Windrush generation whose contribution had been celebrated at the opening ceremony. They have been hounded for impossible proof of their existence in the country, lost jobs, been denied health treatment, detained, deported. May did all this because she believed years in which asylum seekers and immigrants were negatively portrayed in the media meant the public wanted a “hostile environment”, and perhaps she was right.The warm vision for Britain presented by Boyle was a memory four years later when the referendum campaign got going. Then the media was dominated not by positive stories of immigrants’ lives and achievements but relentless caricature and scare headlines, Nigel Farage standing in front of that Leave.EU poster of refugees with its blood-curdling warning: Breaking Point.It feels tragically late to be hoping Southgate and his men have undone some of that damage by playing football and conducting themselves better than people expected. Even as they were trying to write their history, their country was plunging into further political meltdown caused by the Brexit vote. If there is a wider lesson to be drawn from the benevolent vision of a erse country seen all over the media in the past four weeks, it is that we need much more of it, that it must not end with England coming home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf16481fce8c1286b042f8cf15ab731a3796349f/0_103_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3e2e53052328171fea559f50491ca28","title":"transfer roundup fulham sign 25m jean michael seri nice kenedy chelsea","story":"West Ham have agreed a club record €38m (£33.5m) deal to sign Felipe Anderson from Lazio, with the Brazilian winger set for a medical on Friday.Having completed a deal for Ukraine international Andriy Yarmolenko earlier this week, West Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini was also keen to add Anderson to his squad as he prepares for the new season. Negotiations with Lazio for the 25-year-old began last month, having initially seen an offer of €35m (£30.8m) rejected but an agreement has now been reached that will exceed the £25m paid for young French defender Issa Diop earlier in the summer.Meanwhile, Andy Carroll and Winston Reid are both facing three months out injured. Former England striker Carroll and New Zealand defender Reid have returned home early from a pre-season training camp in Switzerland to undergo follow-up operations on injuries suffered last season. Richard Collinge, head of the club’s medical department, told whufc: “Andy played and scored in Sunday’s match (against FC Winterthur) but is still reporting some discomfort in his ankle and further scans have revealed that he requires some minor surgery to provide more strength and stability to the area. “Winston has been suffering some swelling around the knee injury that he sustained at Swansea last season and he too is in need of explorative surgery to clean up the area. We have decided that this is the best course of action to ensure that both players have a chance of returning to full fitness as soon as possible.” Fulham have beaten off competition from several European clubs to sign the Nice and Ivory Coast midfielder Jean Michaël Seri for a club-record fee in the region of £25m, on an initial four-year contract.The deal represents a significant coup for Slavisa Jokanovic, the Fulham head coach, given Chelsea, West Ham United, Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund, among others, were also credited with an interest in the 26-year-old. But, Fulham moved quickly to make Seri their maiden summer signing following promotion to the Premier League.Fulham have also confirmed the signing of Seri’s former Nice team-mate, the 28-year-old defender Maxime Le Marchand, to take their summer business north of £30m. They remain intent on adding former loanee Aleksandar Mitrovic on a permanent deal, while Jokanovic is also keen on Dedryck Boyata, the Celtic and Belgium defender.Meanwhile, Newcastle United have re-signed the Chelsea winger Kenedy on a season-long loan. Rafael Benitez had hoped to sign the Brazilian on a permanent deal but is happy to have him back at St James’ Park, where the 22-year-old impressed after arriving on loan last January.Kenedy is Benitez’s third summer signing after goalkeeper Martin Dubravka from Sparta Prague and midfielder Ki Sung-yueng from Swansea. Meanwhile, the midfielder Mikel Merino has exited for Real Sociedad having determined to leave Newcastle after losing his first team place in the second half of last season.“I’m really pleased to have Kenedy back with us,” Benítez. “I’m sure every fan will be happy with this signing. “Hopefully he can keep playing at the same level that he reached with us last season. I wish him all the best.”Barcelona have signed the Sevilla defender Clément Lenglet after activating the 23-year-old’s buyout clause. The Frenchman exits Sevilla after a successful maiden season at the club following his move from Nancy last summer. The centre-back scored four goals in 52 games last season.Lenglet has signed a five-year deal, with the La Liga club inserting a €300m release clause in his contract. Upon his arrival, Barcelona described Lenglet as “one of the most promising defenders on the planet.”Meanwhile, Everton have turned their attentions to Barcelona left back Lucas Digne as they look to make the first signing of Marco Silva’s managerial reign. Silva is keen to reinforce Everton’s left flank prior to the new Premier league season and, having been deterred from pursuing a deal for Kieran Tierney by Celtic’s £25m asking price, the club have registered their interest in French defender Digne.Everton are also keen on Barcelona central defender Yerry Mina, a key figure in Colombia’s World Cup campaign, but he wants to know whether he features in the Spanish champions’ plans for the new campaign before deciding his future.Mina could be available on a season long loan while Digne would be a permanent transfer should negotiations, led by Everton’s new director of football Marcel Brands, reach a successful conclusion.

At 20 years old, he went straight from the show to a ridiculously charming turn as a judge on Bake Off: The Professionals. It didn’t revolutionise the genre – same suspense-building piano music, used exclusively and perhaps invented for competitive cooking, same high tensions generated by the composition of an egg – but it did revolutionise the potential of that genre. Charles has a face of such open-hearted admiration that it takes you straight back to first principles: this isn’t a game! Some of this stuff is really delicious!He is now publishing Cheeky Treats, a gly, Technicolor, many-faceted recipe book, whose title completely underplays the intricacy of its ideas. It is distinguished not by the two kilos of icing sugar in the Football Cake (and that’s just the buttercream!), nor the very simple, incredibly effective, domino pattern on his salted millionaire dominoes, nor his vertiginous layering or moments of French patisserie perfectionism, but by the joie de vivre conveyed by all those things, and the rest. “I think I’m a nice person,” he says, in his publisher’s office in central London, “regardless of the cake. I don’t like upsetting people. I just like making people happy. I thought cake was the best way.” Here, then, are his top baking tips.By the age of 15, “I could do cupcakes, cakes to a certain standard, I dabbled in pastry and bread. I did biscuits from time to time. I was solid.” Already, Charles’s friends had christened him Cake Boy, a nickname that stuck throughout his time on Bake Off.Charles went on to study drama at Goldsmiths, University of London two years ago, and will graduate this coming winter. “Over that summer between school and uni, that’s when I developed the most. That’s when I started to do chocolate work, tier cakes. If you make a four-layer cake, there is some kind of drama, you’ve got all this buttercream, and you’re like: ‘What’s inside? What’s inside?’ So there’s suspense there. There are more similarities between baking and drama than people think.”I am sceptical about the suspense – you are more or less assured that, underneath the icing, there will be cake – but no one could deny the impact of, say, his chequer cake, regally tall and plush. To those mystified by how you could fit it in your mouth: “You’ve just got to pace yourself, and enjoy it.”Mother’s day 2016 and Charles wanted to spring some doughnuts on his mother. Although a kitchen enthusiast herself, they didn’t bake together throughout childhood. “I was fixated on cake, I treated everything like a cake,” he says. Without a deep-fat fryer or any experience of proving dough, failure – burnt on the outside, raw on the inside, the texture of a padded cell if you brought yourself to eat it – was inevitable. “I did think: ‘Shall I leave this? Maybe it’s not my thing’. But it’s not in me to do that, so I just finessed it and finessed it. And the day I just bagged it was an amazing experience. But it took me months.”Charles still lives with him mum and his sister, and has a brother, too. He mentions his dad in passing – he used to take him to play football on the other side of London – but is extremely reticent about his family. The most detail you’ll get is about how many burners the oven has (six). His mum, he says sphinxishly, works in an office. Is it a secret, what she does, or have you just not asked? He smiles: “It’s definitely an office.”Goldsmiths, says Charles, was a haven of enthusiasts: no such thing as too experimental, even if that meant taking on a life-consuming TV commitment partway through a term. “They were, like: ‘Do what you have to do, as long as you come back to uni.’” When he finished Bake Off, placing fifth, he returned with three weeks to do his third-year project, a monologue he’d written himself, called The Metaphorical Meanings of Buttercream. “If I was going to go the easy route, it would have been clowning, because I’m apparently a very animated person. But I thought: ‘No, let me just test myself and find a deeper meaning with this piece.’ Most of the time, I’m mad positive, and when you’re really positive and hyper, people think you don’t think about things. So when I did show that level of intelligence, they were like: ‘Woah, he is a deeper brother.’” This is a motto borrowed from one of Charles’s baking idols, Christina Tosi, the US baking entrepreneur behind Milk Bar, and star of a Netflix Chef’s Table. “Because she comes from such a humble background, and her baking is still so humble, she stays true to herself through baking even though she’s on this massive scale now. That’s why people watch other people cook the interplay between the character and what they’re making. When something goes wrong, or when something’s good, people watching it really feel it.”Bake Off had been Charles’s dream since school, but even when he applied and got through, he thought it was probably a trial run. “If you’re not surprised to get on, you’re not human. It’s an audition process, there are so many stages, I just kept thinking: ‘If I get to this stage, that’ll be cool, I’ll go back next year. Oh, I’m through to the next stage.’ I cherished every single moment.” During his time as a contestant, Charles insists he had no rivals, “no competitive beef with anyone in that tent”, his worst and only enemy being himself. “I always want to do well, and sometimes getting up in my own head could be to the detriment of that. So I was constantly thinking: ‘You can do this, so shut up.’”Charles’s baking life hasn’t been without its flaws: one time he made a custard tart in a too-hot oven, and ended up with a beautiful looking pastry shell full of scrambled egg. “I haven’t had any training in it. It’s like baking instinct. It’s like Messi and Ronaldo, that’s why they’re so clearly above everyone else. You can have training but you have to have that extra sauce or that extra belief in what you do. I’m not calling myself Messi, by the way.”Cheeky Treats: 70 Brilliant Bakes and Cakes by Liam Charles is out on 12 July, available for £17 at the  Bookshop.

This is the best bit of covering sport. I’ve been going to tournaments for the  since 2008, and looking back I’m still amazed at the sheer amount of hard work and the sheer volume of content produced around these occasions. From minute-by-minute commentary sent directly to you from the vast pulsing brain of some insomniac footballing obsessive powered only by nicotine, chocolate and a haystack of empty energy drink cans. To on-the-scene reports and news from a band of reporters who write and travel and file and follow stories every day, returning to their families five weeks later hunched, unrecognisable figures unable to communicate on any subject beyond wifi quality, mixed zone ticket allocations and how to get to Salvador protea at 3am with a fair-to-decent chance of not being abducted. At the end of which comes the daily web presence and the pristine design and set of the paper itself. All of this arrives with you updated to the second, cobbled together from the corners of some sock-stinking press room, polished by endlessly patient whip-smart subs and made to look lovely by some sleep-deprived awkward genius of a layout designer. It’s no secret our industry is looking to find ways of continuing to do all this. The old way of selling bits of paper doesn’t seem to work. Advertising is a capricious business.

Here, she discusses sexism, her ‘emotional’ DJ sets and raving on the Great Wall of ChinaMusicians are often said to be on top of the world, but rarely are they actually perched on one of its wonders. Way up in the misty hills of Mutianyu, north-east of Beijing, the Siberian DJ and producer Nina Kraviz is soundtracking sunrise at the Great Wall of China. Forty ravers have gathered on an ancient watchtower to dance as dawn breaks, while two replicas of terracotta army soldiers preside over the decks beside her.A few hours earlier, the authorities had cut short Kraviz’s headline show at a nearby festival, claiming – incorrectly – that it was overrunning. So, this otherworldly afterparty feels subversive. It is being livestreamed on Facebook, which is banned in China, along with most western social media. Wine is passed around as though it is the prohibition era. Kraviz’s metallic sound feels thunderous enough to bring the terracotta warriors to life.Moments like these are why Kraviz has become the most talked-about DJ in techno. One of the first women to become a headline act, she thrives on challenging her audience. Her sets stand above other DJs’ slickly synchronised, clinically pristine beats as she plays fast and loose with ghetto house, old-school hardcore, footwork, trance, drum’n’bass and her favourite genre, acid. Her style is unkempt, never dull.“I’m not a psychopath,” she laughs. “I’m just extremely emotional.” An interview with Kraviz is as trippy and impassioned as one of her sets. Her body clock is back to front we end up talking in her hotel room at midnight the next day. Chain-smoking in her dressing gown, she spends an hour explaining how techno has been “underestimated” as a genre. “It’s a phenomenon, it’s as important as jazz,” she says. “It’s incredibly rich, culturally, but it’s so underground that it took me 15 years to have even a little bit of a frame of reference. There are still areas that I don’t know about.”Kraviz’s techno education started in her hometown of Irkutsk and developed in the early 90s (she won’t disclose her exact age), when she would listen to early-hours radio broadcasts of electronic music on the Europa Plus network. By the end of that decade, she was living in Moscow, working as a dentist at a war veterans’ hospital by day and holding down a club residency on Friday nights. She briefly fronted the band MySpaceRocket, but left to focus on her own productions after being told she was “just a singer”. Two of her tracks, 2009’s Voices and 2010’s I Am Gonna Get YouPain in the Ass, were released by labels outside Russia, putting her on the dance music map.But sexism was a problem. Back in the mid-00s, the male-dominated dance music scene struggled to get its head around a woman who knew what to do with electronic hardware. In 2012, she released her self-titled debut album, a collection of simmering 808 love songs and gauzy techno-pop. While “some people loved it”, says Kraviz, “people were suspicious of a pretty woman making music on her own, with a vision. They couldn’t handle me. It was like: ‘It cannot be true that you can have lipstick on and make music.’”A year later, she starred in a video portrait by dance music site Resident Advisor, during which she was interviewed in the bath. A picture of a foamy, playful Kraviz was plastered across blogs and ided the club world. The criticism levelled at her – including from male peers – said she was putting “sexuality” before artistry, as though the two were mutually exclusive. The renowned house DJ Seth Troxler called Kraviz a “bitch” in an interview.“With me, people feel very loose in expressing their opinions,” she says. “It sometimes seems like it’s bad to be a sexist, unless it’s about Nina Kraviz.” If a man had been in the video, she says, the focus would have been their music: “I was one of the only artists at that time who had made an album without ghost producers.” Still, she doesn’t regret the bath scene. “I’m thankful now, because it made me famous.”Bathgate encourage her to create a “comfort zone where I’m myself and no one affects it but me”. She started her record labels Trip (which celebrates 20 releases this month with a new compilation) and Galaxiid, which established her as a tastemaker for severe and surreal techno: the muggy, Kraftwerkian anti-anthems of Icelandic artist Bjarki Russian duo PTU and their breakneck whirls of pinging samples and Kraviz’s own releases, which sound as though they were made for the dungeon of a Detroit techno club in 1991.She still has to deal with sexist comments about her mixing skills and men leering during her live streams. “I try not to think about it, but the majority of people are maybe not that interested in music on a deep level.”As it nears 3am, I wonder how she maintains her sanity in a world of sunrise sets and constant travel. “I have a pretty serious sleeping problem,” she says. “I’m so excited I can’t go to bed for three hours after the show, no matter how tired I was before. But I cannot control it, so I just accept it.”Her schedule is about to get even more busy. There is a summer of festivals ahead, she is making remixes for art-pop musician St Vincent (“She’s a character I like characters”) and she is writing new music. “I think people are mostly attracted to the energy I bring,” she says. “And if people like my energy, that’s already the greatest compliment I could get.”The compilation album Trip 20: Don’t Mess With Cupid is released on 20 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a5132f699a17a1bcddcd51984b6e631e4f0c6bd/36_487_4776_2865/master/4776.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8b6a9b87c04353def64f2e96cdfa9e3","title":"nevis how the worlds most secretive offshore haven refuses to clean up","story":"The years since 2008 have seen a global crackdown on offshore finance. Yet a few places have doubled down on offering secrecy to the super-rich. Among these, one tiny Caribbean island might be the worst offender. By  Oliver BulloughTax havens hate attention. Places such as Jersey, Switzerland and the British Virgin Islands made a handsome living from helping their clients break other countries’ laws for decades, without anyone really noticing. And they liked it that way. Then came the 2007-8 financial crisis, and the good times ended. Rich nations, angry over the loss to their budgets caused by tax dodging, put diplomatic pressure on the havens. Activists, furious over the theft of hundreds of billions of pounds from poor countries, exposed them in the press. The release of vast troves of confidential information – SwissLeaks, the HSBC files, the Panama Papers, the Paradise Papers – cemented a public perception that offshore financial centres exist to help the powerful dodge their obligations to the rest of us, and governments have queued up to punish them. In May, when Britain’s parliament voted to force transparency on its Caribbean islands, it was just the latest blow to the offshore havens.Although cooperating with outsiders in this way has proven expensive, the havens clearly concluded there was little choice. If denied access to the global financial system, or sanctioned by Brussels or Washington, an offshore centre could be put out of business altogether.This is good. Tax havens have helped the world’s wealthiest and most powerful keep a disproportionate share of the benefits of globalisation, by preventing the rest of us from seeing how much they own. This, in turn, has eroded trust in democracy and capitalism all over the world. Restricting the operations of tax havens, and enforcing true transparency on the ownership of property, is crucial if citizens are truly to take back control of their countries’ destinies.Yet, at the heart of this increasingly encouraging picture, there remain a few holdouts – places that have stuck to the old habit of keeping the secrets of the powerful. Foremost among them is Nevis, a solitary volcano in the Caribbean with a population of just 11,000, which has been implicated in some of the most sordid financial scams of modern times, from Britain’s biggest-ever tax fraud to the fleecing of 620,000 vulnerable Americans in a $220m payday loan scam. The story of Nevis reveals the difficulties the world faces in trying to put an end to tax evasion, fraud and kleptocracy.While Nevis’s rivals have lost business by opening up, Nevis has doubled down on secrecy. Not long ago, I spoke to a lawyer with extensive experience of the island, who asked not to be identified because he still needs to work with Nevisian officials. “The only good thing that Donald Trump could do, if he was ever so inclined,” he said, “is take a battleship and roll it up to Nevis, and literally train the guns and say: ‘Get rid of these bullshit laws or I’ll blow you to kingdom come.’”In short, he said, “A bright light needs to be shone on this cockroach.”Tax havens are often lumped together as if they all do the same job. In reality, they are distinctive and highly specialised predators in the financial shark tank. At the top of the food chain – as far as the western world goes, anyway – are places such as London, Switzerland and New York. These apex predators are surrounded by clouds of pilot fish that snap up the scraps: places such as Monaco, Jersey and the Cayman Islands.These smaller centres all play different aspects of the offshore game: Jersey specialises in trusts, the BVI in incorporation, Liechtenstein in foundations. They also differ in their tolerance for criminality. Among the British territories: Gibraltar is dodgier than Guernsey, but cleaner than Anguilla. And they serve different geographical regions: Mauritius for Africa and India Cyprus for the former Soviet Union the Bahamas for the US.In the world of offshore, Nevis is a bottom-feeder. It specialises in letting its clients create corporations with greater anonymity than almost anywhere else on earth. Last year, information on 70,000 Nevisian companies was leaked as part of the Paradise Papers investigation, but that didn’t help us find out who owns them: ownership information is so secret there that even the island’s own corporate registry doesn’t know. In other words, there was nothing substantial to leak.“We feel very strongly that people are entitled to some semblance of financial privacy,” the Nevis premier, Mark Brantley, himself an offshore lawyer, told me when we met in his office in January. “Why shouldn’t you be entitled to a secret?”The secrets don’t belong to residents of Nevis, of course: it would be hard to keep anything quiet for long on an island this size. The secrets belong to foreigners and are being kept from other foreigners, with Nevis getting paid to protect them.We can see that these secrets exist thanks to the UK’s Land Registry, which releases spreadsheets listing all offshore-owned property in the country, along with the registered address of the company that owns it. Some of the secrets are mundane and could be entirely innocent. For instance, who is behind Shi Li Gao Trustees Ltd, the Nevis-incorporated company that owns 13 Brunswick Gardens, a handsome terrace a short walk from Kensington Palace? Some of them are intriguing: for what reason would a Catholic primary school in Liverpool be held via this little Caribbean volcano? And some are decidedly weird: who on earth decided to structure their ownership of a room in a hotel on Llandudno’s North Parade through Caribbean Establishment LLC?But all of these questions are impossible to answer since the secrets are sealed away in Nevis. If these properties were owned via a British company, the true owner of that company would have to be declared to Companies House, and would be visible to anyone with access to the internet. If they were owned via a BVI company, that information would be available to the British police. But a Nevisian company is a closed book, and some people really like it that way.While the BVI has seen the number of companies created there each year collapse, the number created in Nevis has stayed stable. Since 2012, the island’s financial services sector has grown by more than a quarter, as people with secrets have moved to a place that still keeps them. That is a pretty good argument for Brantley’s government not to follow the BVI in opening up its corporate registries to foreigners. Secrecy pays.“The numbers are relatively small, compared to other financial services industries around, but bear in mind the size of Nevis,” Brantley said. “We get direct revenues of $5m-$5.5m, simply from renewal fees.” Renewal fees are what you pay to maintain your company’s registration the more companies there are, the more fees you get. “When that is extrapolated outwards – in terms of rental of office space, employment – we recognise that it does have a multiplier effect on the economy.”It is this provision of secrecy that makes Nevis such an obstacle to law-enforcement investigators. If police can’t prove who owns something, they can’t prove it was criminally acquired, say, or that tax was avoided on the profits from it. This is what crooks are looking for when they send their business offshore. Around 300 British properties are owned in Nevis, and Brantley was unrepentant in defending the secrecy his island provides to those properties’ owners.“Why should a bureaucrat in London, or wherever, curious about his neighbour’s financial situation, pick up the phone and say, ‘You know what, I need to know if Mr John Smith, who’s my neighbour down the road, has an account or a company in Nevis.’ Why’s that his business?” Brantley asked. “Why are Mr John Smith’s financial affairs any business of a bureaucrat in London, unless there’s an allegation against Mr John Smith that he’s somehow contravening some law somewhere?”It is an interesting philosophical question, but it is also a major problem. Countries recognise and respect each other’s laws and sovereignty, so Nevis corporations have as much international validity as anyone’s. So, as long as Nevis persists in denying foreigners access to the ownership information of its companies – no matter how hard other places work to open up – scoundrels can keep routing their business via Nevis, breaking the chain of traceable ownership, and hiding themselves and their crimes from discovery. That means crooked politicians, tax dodgers and fraudsters in Ukraine, Nigeria, Malaysia, the US or anywhere else get to mismanage their country’s finances for their own benefit.And, thanks to Nevis’s curious constitutional situation – it is neither an independent country nor can it be controlled by any other country – there doesn’t appear to be anything we can do about it.From the sea, Nevis (pronounced “knee-vis”) resembles a green nipple. It is elegantly symmetrical, a tropical volcano ringed with golden beaches. By surface area, it is roughly the same size as Bristol, yet its peak is taller than any mountain in England, so the whole island slopes upwards, starting gently where the beach bars shelter among the palm trees, then steadily steepening, while the tree cover gets denser. If you hike up the peak, you are in true rainforest, and will find yourself scrutinised by monkeys in the overhanging greenery.It is a gorgeous place, much frequented by famous people. Earlier this week, John Cleese told Newsnight he was so fed up with how Britain is run that he is moving to Nevis for good. “It’s one of the nicest islands I’ve ever been to,” he said. “The children and adults are extraordinarily well-educated, the weather’s good the whole time, I’m very lucky.”The island was once a major centre for Britain’s sugar growers and slave traders, but it slipped into obscurity in the 18th century, when it was out-competed by larger and more fertile rivals. In the 19th century, Britain added it to neighbouring St Kitts for administrative purposes, and it was as the junior half of the Federation of St Kitts and Nevis that it became independent in 1983.The 80s were a bonanza period for Caribbean islands, as the global economy opened up and law enforcement was caught flat-footed. Tax evaders and drug dealers from North and South America flew planeloads of dollar bills into places such as Cayman and Anguilla, stashed them in bank accounts owned by untraceable shell companies, then invested them in property in Florida, the south of France or New York.In 1984, Bill Barnard, an American lawyer who had taken to vacationing on Nevis, asked the island’s premier if he would be interested in getting into the offshore game. Thanks to the almost complete autonomy Nevis enjoys under the federal constitution of St Kitts and Nevis, its first premier, Simeon Daniel, was free to do what he liked. He approved Barnard’s suggestion, passed the incorporation and secrecy laws the American lawyer drafted and awarded Barnard’s company, Morning Star Holdings, the right to act as exclusive agent for creating the companies. It was a win for both of them. (Neither Morning Star Holdings nor Barnard wished to comment for this piece.)At first, Nevis struggled to compete with already-established rivals, partly because it had no particular advantage of its own. Barnard and his team of American lawyers had borrowed their legislation from Delaware, which acts as a sort of tax haven within the US by offering laxer regulations and lower taxes than the other states, so there wasn’t much reason to look to a remote island for products you could already buy elsewhere. “It was certainly successful,” says David Neufeld, a New Jersey lawyer and an expert on company structuring and international tax. “But it was never at the level of BVI or Cayman.”When Barnard’s monopoly expired in 1994, Nevis took the opportunity to reboot. Neufeld already worked with Barnard, and was asked to help Nevis ersify its offering. Tax havens are always borrowing ideas from each other, seeking to improve on laws that are proving popular – and this process has led to progressively greater secrecy, fewer taxes and lighter regulations. Neufeld looked to the USnited States for inspiration, and specifically to Wyoming, which had invented the limited liability company (LLC), a useful hybrid structure that allowed people to avoid identification and taxes at the same time, as well as offering other benefits.LLCs make it hard for your creditors to find your assets, which also helps rich people avoid paying damages if they lose a lawsuit. Your creditors may have a court judgment against you, but if they can’t find your stuff, they will settle for perhaps 50 cents on the dollar to get the legal wrangling over with. Lawyers call this asset protection.But in the US, it is hard to hide property, since courts can order disclosure of information. Handily, those courts have no jurisdiction in Nevis, which made the idea of a Caribbean version of the LLC very attractive. “In my mind, I was trying to create an LLC for the 51st state,” Neufeld told me. “If you see yourself as someone who could be exposed to some kind of predatory lawsuit where people feel you have assets that are exposed, this gives you an opportunity to protect that.”In simple terms, Nevis’s laws allow rich people to put ramparts around their property, to protect it from someone who might want to use the courts to take it away, whether that be a business partner, a spouse, an estranged child, or indeed anyone. All tax havens do this, but Nevis turned the ratchet many clicks further than its rivals, in its efforts to tempt business away from its rivals.To bring legal proceedings on Nevis, you have to file a bond of $100,000 with the court as proof that your case isn’t frivolous. If you win, that is only the beginning of your quest for the assets. Nevis’s regulator holds no information on either the ownership of the company or its assets. Nevis’s LLCs – Neufeld’s innovation – can’t be wound up, meaning you won’t be able to confiscate any assets they own, and you would have to seek redress elsewhere. If you seek to challenge the legality of a property being put in a Nevis-registered trust – for example, if you thought the property actually belonged to you – you have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the trust’s creation was fraudulent, and you would have to begin that legal challenge within a year of its creation. This is tricky, since Nevis law requires all information on the trust to be confidential, so you would be unlikely to know it even existed.These ludicrously formidable defences are not really intended to be used, but instead – like the bright colouring of a poisonous tree frog – they exist to warn you off attacking in the first place. If they can persuade a plaintiff to settle out of court for less than is owed, then, for a rich person with vulnerable assets, they are well worth paying for.“I don’t like the word ‘hidden’,” says Laurie Lawrence, who retired a couple of years ago after two decades as permanent secretary to the Nevis government. “It’s protected, not hidden. There’s nothing to hide. Look at it from the other way: a lot of females are gold-diggers. You are married to a man you don’t really love him, but he has money. People find ways and means to protect their assets.”This is perhaps why a wealthy person might want to own a Kensington house (or, indeed, a Llandudno hotel room) via a Nevisian company or other structure: it prevents a orced spouse, or any other creditor, from accessing that property, without a tortuous legal process. “Nevis structures started coming up about 12 years ago, and they’re coming around with increasing prevalence,” Jeffrey Fisher, one of America’s leading orce lawyers, told me by telephone from West Palm Beach in Florida.“I’m a former prosecutor, and I know about the ways people hide money, and what they’ll do,” said Fisher. “My approach to getting assets that are in asset protection entities like a Nevis LLC, is that you don’t go to Nevis and try to get the money out – that is a foolhardy enterprise. They passed laws and they set up structures to stop us and to make it expensive and to make it take years and years and years. What we do here is we use some more creative approaches to, for lack of a better term, make them cough up the dough.”Fisher’s approach is to target property and bank accounts in the US, to make his opponents’ lives so onerous that they eventually beg to settle – and he’s extremely good at it. The trouble is that anyone who cannot afford to employ highly expensive specialists such as Fisher has no prospect of even finding where their spouse has put their property, let alone wrestling a fair share away from them. They have to accept what they’re given – there’s no court that can help them.“You’ve got to realise that the asset protection industry is trillions of dollars, not billions of dollars, it’s trillions of dollars,” said Fisher. “Essentially, it’s: we’re going to find a way to screw legitimate creditors out of collecting a legitimate debt. That’s the business these people are in.”Brantley, the Nevis premier, is fluent and passionate in his defence of the ramparts that Nevis builds for rich people looking to protect their assets from creditors. “All it does is say that you’re creating a locked box, so to speak, if you want to protect assets,” Brantley said, when we met in his office up the hill from Charlestown, Nevis’s capital village. “And people protect assets for a variety of reasons. It’s not always to get away from a pending orce.”The trouble is that when you cast your eye beyond the orce cases, Nevis’s business model begins to looks even worse. The Nevis financial system is rudimentary compared to the large tax havens – places such as Jersey, or the Cayman Islands, which have major accountancy firms, fund managers, large banks and other global behemoths. In Nevis, there’s precious little money for anyone to avoid tax on. But then, it isn’t really a haven from taxes at all, so much as a haven from scrutiny of any kind. The same laws that appeal to the kind of nervous and wealthy men who want to hide their assets from their wives, have been regularly exploited by crooks from all over the world.Britain’s biggest-ever tax fraud – for which five men were jailed in November, after attempting to scam the Treasury out of £107m in tax – involved Nevis-registered companies, which were helping to hide the identity of the fraudsters. The family of a former president of Taiwan used a Nevis trust to help to hide its ownership of corruptly acquired US property. Ukraine’s deposed president, Viktor Yanukovych, used Nevis structures to hide his stolen assets, as did corrupt Russian officials who stole $230m from the budget in 2007. (When the accountant Sergei Magnitsky uncovered the scam, they arrested him and left him to die in jail.) British trader Navinder Sarao, who pleaded guilty to fraud for helping cause 2010’s flash crash, erted some of his profits to a Nevis structure called the NAV Sarao Milking Markets Fund.According to the independent advocacy group Tax Justice Network, Nevis out-obscures all the traditional offshore centres: BVI, Switzerland, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, Luxembourg, and even fellow bottom-feeders such as Belize and the Cook Islands. And its enthusiasm for secrets impedes other countries’ efforts to enforce transparency.But a search of the Companies House website reveals how Nevis is able to defang Britain’s attack on secrecy. For instance, I recently came across three LLPs, all of which are owned by the same two Nevis companies: Tallberg and Uniwell. According to data gathered by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, one of these LLPs controlled a Latvian bank account used in a money-laundering scheme the other two have not been implicated in any wrongdoing (and neither have Tallberg and Uniwell). According to Companies House, the three LLPs have the same ownership structure, which means that their person or persons with significant control should be the same. Mysteriously, however, each of the LLPs is listed as having a different PSC. This is technically possible, but highly unlikely. But we have no way of finding out the truth, since Nevis does not cooperate with the UK in allowing law enforcement officers to see who really owns Nevisian companies such as Tallberg and Uniwell. These three LLPs are not isolated examples – Tallberg and Uniwell alone have owned dozens of British companies, and there are many more Nevisian corporations like them.The new UK law requiring disclosure of true owners is useless if that ownership can just be hidden in Nevis. And this is why Nevis-controlled but British-registered companies, whose ownership is unclear, have been involved in many of the massive eastern European money-laundering scams collectively known as the “laundromats”, which have moved tens of billions of dollars out of the former Soviet Union. Nevis ownership can transform a supposedly transparent British company into a secrecy vehicle as iniquitous as anything on earth.Charlestown is a handsome place, consisting of a long street of two-storey buildings parallel to the shore, many with first-floor balconies for catching the sea breeze. Its most striking feature, however, is the truly remarkable number of signs advertising lawyers, accountants and administrators. The Devon town of Ilfracombe, with its 11,000 inhabitants, has two lawyers’ offices, an insurance company and two sets of accountants, as well as a branch of Lloyds and a Nationwide. The 11,000 Nevisians, by contrast, host six domestic banks, one international bank, 18 insurance managers, seven international insurance entities, four money service businesses and 58 registered agents, many of them law firms. Nevis may be the most over-lawyered place on earth.When you get off the ferry, almost the first house you see is the Henville building, nominal home to the Azerbaijan first family’s business empire. If you then turn right at the T-junction, you see the Edith Solomon building (although it has lost two of the letters from its name), which hosted an Idaho payday loan company that was shut down by the state government in 2012, for operating without a license. Barely 100 metres in the opposite direction on Main Street, meanwhile, is the office of Morning Star Holdings, pioneers of the Nevis offshore industry.I was keen to find the registered address of Tallberg and Uniwell, the two Nevisian companies that had so successfully outmanoeuvred UK company law, in the – admittedly, rather forlorn – hope that I could find someone who would give me information about them. Their registered address was the same as that of the Nevis International Trust Company (NITC), which, according to its website, will supply you not only with a shell company, but also with nominee directors and shareholders, which will further obscure your involvement in it, as well as a bank account, a credit card and a stock trading account. “Nevis is an excellent location for: privacy, estate planning, asset protection, tax reduction planning, holding investments, royalty and licensing ownership,” the website states.I had an address for the NITC’s office, but no one on the island was able to tell me where it was. I spent a frustrating, hot and thirsty morning searching for it and, when I finally got through on the phone, was brushed off. “I’m not a robber,” I told the woman who answered the phone, after she had refused to help me. “I don’t know that, do I?” she replied.In fairness, she had a good reason not to talk. According to a 1985 law, anyone on Nevis disclosing financial information without a court order is liable to a prison term of up to a year, as well as a fine of $10,000. (This is another area where Nevis is resisting the trend towards openness. Cayman previously had a similar law against breaching confidentiality, but decriminalised the offence in 2016.) When I tried phoning the registered office of Tallberg and Uniwell, the receptionist refused to even tell me where the office was, so I couldn’t visit. When I emailed the NITC, there was no reply. Eventually I had to accept that it was not going to be possible to make contact with them, which meant the true ownership information for the three LLPs was undiscoverable.And it is not just journalists who are unable to check the reliability of Nevis’ financial information for themselves foreign police can’t either. That means we are all reliant on the Nevis financial services regulatory commission to do it for us. The commission is based in an office in the centre of Charlestown, and is run by Heidi-Lynn Sutton, its chief regulator, who works in an office on the first floor.Sutton started off unfriendly, and became less friendly as our 45-minute chat progressed, her manner becoming increasingly exasperated. She flatly dismissed the US state department’s description of Nevis as “a desirable location for criminals to conceal proceeds”. It was simply untrue, she said, that Nevis had anonymous bank accounts, bank secrecy and an opaque corporate register.This was odd, since her regulator’s own website states that bank account holders on the island have no obligation to provide any “statement, return or information (to) … the regulator or the minister”. However, Sutton defended Nevis against all allegations, no matter how serious. The heavy cost of bringing proceedings in Nevis court, for example, was simply to protect the justice system from being “bombarded with frivolous lawsuits”, rather than to protect the wealthy. “That is our weeding-out mechanism,” she said. “Some countries are very litigious. If you get a little burn on your hand because you spill a McDonald’s coffee, somebody will sue you.”When I explained the difficulty I had faced in even finding NITC, Sutton laughed, asking why I was looking for it. I explained that I had hoped to discover who actually owned the limited partnerships on the British registry. When I asked about whether the regulator she runs might have failed to notice a number of serious money-laundering schemes, she simply said: “I can’t speak to that, I really cannot speak to that.”What about the fact that the former ruling families of Taiwan and Ukraine, as well as lower-profile crooks from all over the world, had used Nevis vehicles to obscure the ownership of their stolen assets? Sutton laughed again. “I can’t accept that there has been multiple usage of our structures to facilitate whatever. I can’t accept hearing it from you. I won’t be able to speak to that.”If the island is so clean, why did online trolls looking to smear Emmanuel Macron before the 2017 French presidential election create fake documents supposedly showing he had a shell company in Nevis? Isn’t that a sign that the industry Sutton oversees has an image problem? “People make things up all the time,” she replied. “Once you are an international financial centre, and provide certain services, you will always be a target, it doesn’t mean that it’s true.”I have spent most of the last four years researching financial crimes, and have spoken to dozens of regulators and investigators in multiple jurisdictions, but never before had I met one who responded in such a way to allegations of grand corruption, money laundering and fraud that I was making against their jurisdiction.Like any financial centre, Nevis must choose between turning away dirty money, or attracting as much business as it can. I did not find my visit to Nevis reassuring.Since Nevisian officials appear happy with the current situation, it is up to outsiders to force change on the island, and sadly – thanks to the constitutional peculiarities of the federation – this is all but impossible. We know this because it has been tried.In 1995, in federation-wide elections, the St Kitts and Nevis Labour party swept to power with seven of the 11 federal seats, and its leader, Denzil Douglas, became prime minister. He had no seats on Nevis, but did not need any to pass laws for the whole federation. Among his priorities was restricting Nevis’ sordid financial sector. “We were aware that the international community had begun to frown upon Nevis, and on the international financial services that were poorly regulated, not supervised, etc,” said Douglas when we met in his office in Basseterre, the federal capital, which is on St Kitts. “And we sought to bring in new legislation. So they had their referendum.”In 2000, the Financial Action Task Force – a Paris-based group created by the G7 to develop policies against money-laundering – blacklisted the whole of St Kitts and Nevis, as one of 15 countries deemed to be non-cooperative. That forced Nevis to agree to federal legislation, but did not change the basic dynamic that it has significantly more autonomy than Scotland has within the UK, and in some ways more than inidual US states. One financial professional in Basseterre described the relationship between Nevis and St Kitts as like that of a teenager with access to his big brother’s credit card.None of the tools that large countries have used against tax havens such as Switzerland or Jersey – diplomatic pressure, legal proceedings against banks, and so on – are applicable to Nevis. It is part of a fully independent country (unlike the BVI or Gibraltar) and the companies providing its services (unlike the Swiss banks targeted by the US Department of Justice) are not large enough to fear losing their offices in the US.Major western countries will have to make their criticism of Nevis via diplomatic channels, if they want it to change its ways. Brantley got his retaliation in first, however, accusing the British government of hypocrisy.“It is no secret that the UK, and London in particular, has a disproportionate number of wealthy Russians, for example, and wealthy oligarchs from all around the world, and the question is: why? It can’t be for the weather. So, why are people flocking to London? So, if the United Kingdom can do that, then what is the issue with other countries, not as endowed as the UK, trying to stand on their own two feet?”The issue is that if every jurisdiction thinks only of how to stand on its own two feet – whether that’s post-Brexit Britain, Nevis or Wyoming – we will all be pushed over separately by the world’s crooks and thieves. Brantley is right that we all need to do more to fight kleptocrats and fraudsters, but by keeping their secrets and making money from it, Nevis is stopping the rest of us from moving forward.• This article was amended on 12 July 2018 to correct an error. An earlier version stated that it was impossible for the three LLPs mentioned in the text to have three different persons with significant control.

Within a second of the particle being spotted, IceCube issued an automatic alert, prompting an international race to find the neutrino’s origin.Because scientists on the IceCube experiment had worked out the path the particle took through their subterranean ice instrument, astronomers knew where in the sky to look for the particle’s source. A string of early observations came up blank, but days later Nasa’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope spotted the likely source: a flaring “blazar”.Most galaxies are thought to have spinning supermassive black holes at their centres. But some of these black holes appear to pull in material at ferocious rates, a process that simultaneously sends streams of highly energetic particles out into space. Such galaxies are called blazars, although the term only applies when one of these streams is directed straight at Earth.The blazar that appears to have sent the neutrino our way lies 3.7bn light years from Earth, just off the left shoulder of the constellation of Orion. While a single detection is not strong evidence, the IceCube scientists went back through their records and found a flurry of neutrinos coming from the same spot over 150 days in 2014 and 2015. Details are published in two separate papers in the journal Science.By discovering the neutrino’s origins, astronomers may also have solved the 100-year-old puzzle of what kinds of objects can create high-energy cosmic rays that occasionally hit the planet. Cosmic rays are made up of protons and other charged particles and are almost impossible to trace to their origins because the particles are deflected by magnetic fields as they travel through space. But high-energy cosmic rays also form neutrinos, which travel in straight lines so are easier to trace back to their source.“We know that there are these very high-energy cosmic rays being accelerated out there somewhere and it’s a century-old mystery where they are coming from,” said Erik Blaufuss, who works on IceCube at the University of Maryland. “The problem with cosmic rays is that they go out into space and get scrambled.”In tracing the neutrino back to its origin, scientists have launched a new era of astronomy, one in which the heavens can be observed not only with traditional telescopes, and even gravitational wave observatories, but with neutrino detectors too. “How much we are just starting to scratch the surface is the big question we are grappling with now,” said Blaufuss.Neutrinos are extraordinary particles. So light that they were once thought to be massless, they stream continuously out from the sun in vast quantities. Most of the time they pass through objects in their path: about 100bn pass unnoticed through the area of a fingertip every second. Collisions with other particles such as that detected in Antarctica happen very rarely.Julian Osborne at the University of Leicester was part of a team that used Nasa’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory to confirm the flaring blazar. “This is literally a new way of seeing the universe,” he said. “This really is the dawn of a new type of astronomy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c80eb0225f103e1b0d6da802e98396385ea2963/0_316_3082_1849/master/3082.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=809c0905bbd5b7b47fe366fdedee6eb9","title":"otzis last supper mummified hunters final meal revealed","story":"Scientists say iceman ate ‘horrible-tasting’ high-fat meal of ibex before his murder 5,300 years agoÖtzi the iceman filled his belly with fat before he set out on the ill-fated hunting trip that ended with his bloody death on a glacier in the eastern Alps 5,300 years ago, scientists say.The first in-depth analysis of the hunter’s stomach contents reveal that half of his last meal consisted of animal fat, primarily from a wild goat species known as the Alpine ibex.While researchers have previously studied remnants of food in Ötzi’s intestines, a more complete picture of his final feast was delayed because they could not find his stomach. It was finally located by a CT scan, tucked up under his ribcage near his shrunken lungs.“It was surprising to see this extraordinarily high-fat diet,” said Frank Maixner at the Eurac Research Institute for Mummy Studies in Bolzano, Italy. “He clearly knew that fat is a high-energy source and he really composed his diet to survive at high altitude.”Ötzi’s last meal may have fortified him for a hunting trip that lasted several days high up in the Alps, but it may not have been the most enjoyable feast. Maixner has tried ibex. He said the meat is not too bad, but struggled to find the words to encapsulate the experience of eating the animal’s subcutaneous fat. “The taste is really, well, it’s horrible,” he said. “And they had no salt at the time.”German tourists discovered the copper-age corpse in 1991 while hiking at 3,200 metres in the Ötztal Alps near the Austrian-Italian border. They thought the body, soon nicknamed Ötzi, was that of a modern mountaineer, but upon excavation the well-preserved remains were found to be more than 5,000 years old. The hunter, thought to be 45 years old when he died, was clad in a woven grass coat and wore leggings and shoes of leather. He was covered in simple line tattoos, and carried a copper axe, a knife and flint-tipped arrows.Ötzi’s body is stored at -6C to ensure the remains do not deteriorate. So to analyse his stomach contents, Maixner, part of an international team of scientists, had to partially thaw the corpse to collect samples to check for remains of his final meal.Through a combination of methods including DNA matching and microscopic inspections, the researchers found traces of red deer and ibex meat, ancient wheat and plenty of ibex fat. They also discovered multiple traces of toxic bracken, a finding that has the scientists stumped.Writing in the journal Current Biology, the researchers speculate that Ötzi may have eaten the toxic bracken to rid himself of whipworm parasites, which had been discovered in his intestines previously. But Maixner favours other explanations. Ötzi may have eaten the bracken as a food supplement, a practice known among some indigenous groups. “Another possibility is that he wrapped his dried meat in bracken leaves and some of the material got into his gut unintentionally,” Maixner said.However it got there, the toxic plant was not fatal. The discovery in 2001 that an arrowhead had shattered Ötzi’s shoulder blade suggests that events turned dark on the mountain that day. “The current thinking is that he bled out and died on the glacier,” said Maixner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/678906fe74460826e5ba341715b64cf168d789ab/0_200_4213_2528/master/4213.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5d0e3fe2260ce09613069b6e6ea77d8","title":"tour de france stage six report dan martin mur de bretagne","story":"Geraint Thomas slipped ahead of his teammate Chris Froome at the finish to stage six of the Tour de France as Ireland’s Dan Martin, one of the contenders for a top-three finish in Paris, took his first victory since 2013.Martin, sixth overall in last year’s Tour and second on the Mûr de Bretagne climb in the 2015 Tour, attacked in the final kilometre of the stage, in response to earlier moves from Julian Alaphilippe of France and Richie Porte of Australia, and held off a last-ditch pursuit from Pierre Latour, a team-mate of Romain Bardet, third overall in the 2017 Tour.“It’s a great feeling to actually get a win again as I’ve had so many second places in the Tour since the last win,” Martin said. “But today there was no question. I just attacked as hard as I could. It means this Tour is already a success and everything else will be a bonus.”Froome may only have lost five seconds on his Welsh teammate on the climb to the finish but in the group ahead of him with Thomas were his rivals Porte, Adam Yates and the past Grand Tour winners Nairo Quintana and Vincenzo Nibali. “In the final I tried to play it a bit too late,” said Thomas, who is now second, three seconds adrift of Greg Van Avermaet.Thomas, who snatched a couple of bonus seconds during the stage, said that he felt that “everyone will be watching me now”. He said: “I got away with it twice, I don’t think I could get away with it a third time. It was more just going for it because I saw the\u0026nbspopportunity.”Thomas, who appeared to momentarily hesitate and look over his shoulder as he moved ahead of Froome, may now be able to take the race leader’s yellow jersey before Monday’s rest day. Others speculated over which rider on whom Team Sky would focus. “It’ll be interesting now to see if Sky back Geraint Thomas or Froome,” Porte said. Froome is 62 seconds adrift of Van Avermaet.But there were other reasons for Froome to be cheerful after Tom Dumoulin, who he had identified on Wednesday as his principal threat, and the French contender Romain Bardet fell behind him in the overall standings after losing time in the final kilometres.The 2017 Giro d’Italia champion Dumoulin lost the best part of a minute after puncturing five kilometres from the finish. He was then docked a further 20 seconds by the race judges for drafting behind a team car as he chased back on to the rear of the peloton.While riding in the slipstream of a team car in a bid to chase back to the main field is often allowed, Dumoulin’s blatant drafting for long periods was ruled beyond the pale.Bardet, who suffered a broken wheel, was forced to swap bikes with a teammate and lost more than half a minute to Martin. He is now well over a minute and a half behind Thomas in the overall standings before the Tour reaches his favoured terrain of the Alps. “It wasn’t a good day,” Bardet’s team manager,Vincent Lavenu, said. “The time gaps are mounting. Romain made a huge effort to get back to the peloton and he paid for it in the finale.”Bardet, who is widely touted in France as Froome’s strongest rival, will have no choice but to go on the offensive when the mountain stages begin next week.The polemics around Froome’s presence continued. At the start village in Brest, the five-times Tour winner Bernard Hinault, who had called for the peloton to strike if Froome started the Tour, was unrepentant.Hinault refused to speak about Froome with the British media but told French journalists he had no regrets. “Regret what I said? Never. All I said was the truth of the matter, and that’s it,” the 63-year-old Breton said. “You have to stand up for yourself in life, they have forgotten that.”1 Dan Martin (UAE-Emirates) 4hr 13min 43sec2 Pierre Latour (AG2R La Mondiale) at 1sec3 Alejandro Valverde (Movistar) at 3sec4 Julian Alaphilippe (Quick-Step) same time5 Rafal Majka (Bora-Hansgrohe) st6 Adam Yates (Mitchelton-Scott) st7 Bauke Mollema (Trek-Segafredo) st8 Peter Sagan (Bora-Hansgrohe) st9 Geraint Thomas (Team Sky) st10 Primoz Roglic (Lotto NL-Jumbo) st1 Greg van Avermaet (BMC Racing) 22hr 35min 46sec2 Geraint Thomas (Team Sky) at 3 sec3 Tejay van Garderen (BMC) at 5 sec4 Julian Alaphilippe (Quick-Step) at 6sec5 Philippe Gilbert (Quick-Step) at 12sec6 Bob Jungels (Quick-Step) at 18sec7 Rigoberto Uran (EF-Drapac Cannondale) at 45sec8 Alejandro Valverde (Movistar) at 51sec9 Rafal Majka (Bora-Hansgrohe) at 52sec10 Jakob Fuglslang (Astana) at 53sec"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80cd4ac42a7bd0ceb6296954cf8895092c92c1a0/327_178_2023_1214/master/2023.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6c6079256cc4bbe8a8ee3be33fc37f0","title":"apple releases new faster macbook pro laptops","story":"Updated machines have hands-free Siri, the latest processors, True Tone displays and a quieter keyboard Apple has updated its MacBook Pro laptops with new processors, keyboards and display technology, and hands-free Siri.The update is slightly more than an expected specifications improvement for Apple’s popular “Pro” laptops.

So she’s brought that creative buzz into a multi-faceted retail space.Joining up with another clothing designer, The Grunge Monkey, Hyndman launched The 2nd Floor in Chester in April. The idea was to make it a place where people could come in to get a feel for her brand, but also where creative minds could relax and be inspired. Within it, she has set up a coffee shop, a space for artists to showcase their work and an area for local musicians to play and sell records. “We feel really passionately about what we do, but also about the creative community around us. We wanted to offer that support to other people in our position,” she says.Hyndman knows many sides of the creative industry, putting her in a good place to make the space work. Not only does she sell her own clothes, but she splits her time with her band, Campfire Social, and is a keen wakeboarder and surfer. Each summer, she travels from festival to festival, sets up shop, meets new people and sells her clothes to like-minded folk.“Part of the whole idea of the brand is going out travelling and being outdoors. I don’t want to lose that,” she says. “It’s great to have a place that reflects that.”Hyndman started Junkbox Apparel as an online clothing shop in 2013, drawing on a background in retail and her jewellery design hobby. “It came from my own interests and what I wanted in my wardrobe – leisurewear for people who enjoy the outdoors.” The name she picked out with her mum, inspired by where people tend to store their accessories, in particular their costume jewellery. “You used to call that junk jewellery, hence where Junkbox came from,” she says. “It applies to what the brand is now: you chuck your stuff in a bag and you’re off.”The idea of travelling light evolved from her days of going on holiday with a different outfit packed for each day. “I hate doing that now, but I still like to look good and I like to be comfortable.” Which is why she came up with the capsule set: a few items of clothes that centre around a similar colour palette and activity that mix and match, so they are all that is needed for a weekend away. “You chuck them in a bag and you’re done,” she says.It’s a simple concept, but growing the business has been anything but smooth sailing. Hyndman believes there is “no original idea any more” – instead, building a business means carving out a niche, getting the brand name noticed, and collaborating rather than competing. “I think that encourages you to look at what you’re doing,” she says. “Looking at the competition and making it not competition, making them your peers.”“The nice thing is, I take a little bit less along to festivals now,” she says. “I used to take a clipboard, notebook, stock sheets, and loads of things like that. The stock management side of it became a little bit of hard work. Now I just take a little box with my carrier bags, my Square Reader and then my van with as much stock as I can fit into it.”Having launched The 2nd Floor in April, Hyndman has bigger plans for Junkbox Apparel. “I want to say take over the world, but we won’t be doing that any time soon – I’ve got to be realistic,” she laughs.Learn more about Square"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84e86bc417428510a02ceb433a9716934eef9aea/0_159_2520_1512/master/2520.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2452eef2fb53fd7b16d0517cb73cab67","title":"sacha baron cohen sarah palin who is america tv show veteran response","story":"The former Alaska governor had called the comedian ‘evil, exploitative and sick’ after unwittingly featuring in Cohen’s new show – along with the disgraced Alabama Senate candidateA character of Sacha Baron Cohen’s has responded to Sarah Palin’s claim that she was exploited, calling it “FAKE NEWS”.The former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate called the comedian “evil, exploitative and sick” in a Facebook post on 10 July after he duped her into an interview for his new show Who Is America?In response, Cohen has posted a letter on Twitter as a new, previously unrevealed character, Billy Wayne Ruddick Jr, PhD, who runs the site Truthbrary.org.Palin had claimed Cohen disguised himself as a “disabled US veteran” during the interview before she walked out.“I did NOT say I was a War Vet,” the letter reads. “I was in the service – not military, but United Parcel and I only fought for my country once – when I shot a Mexican who came onto my property.”The letter goes on to praise Palin for “TELLING THE TRUTH about Obama’s birth certificate and the location of Russia” before claiming that she had “been hit by a bullshit grenade” and was “bleeding FAKE NEWS”.It arrives after a source told People that Palin decided to end the interview after a question about a “government funded sex-change operation for Chelsea Clinton”.The site Truthbrary.net features a variety of articles including titles such as Why Do Liberals Despise The West? and Hibernating Alien Discovered Inside Secret Chamber In The Great Pyramid.The disgraced US Senate candidate Roy Moore has also released a statement revealing that he too was convinced to appear on the show, saying that he was embarrassed and humiliated by Cohen.“I don’t need Sacha Cohen to tell me who America is, but I can tell him that America is a proud Nation which sprang from humble beginnings and a strong belief in God, virtue, and morality,” he said in a statement. “As an American, I would never hide my identity and deceive others only to mock and ridicule them as this Showtime series is designed to do. America is not only about being proud but about being brave and standing for what we believe.”Moore, who was accused of sexual misconduct by nine women, also complained that Cohen was part of a string of “vicious false political attacks” and that his art is “trickery, deception, and dishonesty”.The conservative pundit and ex-congressman Joe Walsh has revealed on Twitter that he was also duped into an interview with Cohen for the show after being told that Steven Spielberg and Rupert Murdoch also took part.“Dressing up as a wounded veteran is absolutely stolen valor, his tactics are disgusting,” he tweeted. “I totally get @SachaBaronCohen’s gig. He’s a comedian, and he can be funny, but mocking a disabled veteran to spoof @SarahPalinUSA is a serious matter. I am just telling you what I encountered – it was much of the same she experienced.”In a previously released clip, Cohen had Dick Cheney sign a “waterboard kit” while a teaser suggested a variety of characters used in the upcoming series which has been in development for over a year.Who Is America? begins on Showtime in the US on Sunday and on Channel 4 in the UK on Monday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7ded104fce7b40aa2c395a694b5f0479fa2002b/0_68_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdb918f6144d5716d9e6e8cc0691e0ff","title":"twin peaks emmys nominations mindhunter snubs","story":"While Game of Thrones takes the lead, Twin Peaks: The Return was stuck with just technical recognition and Mindhunter was nowhere to be seenThe Emmy absence of Twin Peaks: The Return shocked many last year, until it was revealed that it had missed the nomination window and was therefore ineligible for inclusion. This year was when that should have been put right. That hasn’t happened.Sure, Twin Peaks: The Return has been nominated for Emmys this year. Nine, in fact for writing, sound mixing, editing, cinematography and directing among others. But the show itself, as a body of work, is nowhere to be seen. Patrick Melrose was nominated, and The Assassination of Gianni Versace, and both are fine shows. But Godless was also nominated. Remember Godless? It was that nothingy Netflix cowboy show that squeaked out towards the end of last year, buoyed by a Next Big Thing buzz that couldn’t sustain itself once everyone realised what a colossal snooze it was.To nominate Godless over Twin Peaks is beyond bizarre. It’s such a monumental lack of judgement that it barely even qualifies as an insult. It’s little short of a tragedy. Go back and rewatch Twin Peaks – especially episode eight, which tore and mauled the entire medium of television into a shape nobody even thought possible – and ask yourself how it got overlooked in favour of a mumbling woman on a horse. It is ridiculous. It stinks. I’m not even going to start on Kyle MacLachlan’s lack of recognition, either, because there’s a good chance it’ll make me cry tears of blood.The Emmy nominations threw up a few other niggles along the way. Hugh Grant’s omission for his career-redefining work on A Very English Scandal can be put down to a simple scheduling snafu – like Twin Peaks last year it missed the nomination window – but the dismal lack of nominations for any regular female actor on The Good Place can only be explained by pure human error.Jameela Jamil’s Tahani is a classic enough oblivious dipstick, but Kristen Bell’s role – as a central character even more flawed than her supporting cast – is little short of a masterpiece. She holds the entire series together so effortlessly that you barely even notice, so it makes no sense for her not to be included. And D’Arcy Carden’s Janet is hands-down the funniest thing on all of television. Why hasn’t she been nominated? Why hasn’t she had to construct some sort of ramshackle barricade to hide from all the awards that people keep throwing at her? Aren’t people watching? What’s going on?Similarly, it seems odd to nominate most of the This Is Us cast but not Mandy Moore. The heavy lifting Moore does on that show – playing endless variations on the same character from twentysomething sexpot to regret-filled matriarch – is phenomenal. Next year, maybe. In happier news – especially for the hundreds of thousands of commenters who snarled up the Emmy Facebook feed with breathless cries of “DARREN!!!”, The Assassination of Gianni Versace has finally received the recognition it couldn’t achieve through viewing figures alone. As I wrote back in April, Darren Criss’ role as serial killer Andrew Cunanan was a star-making turn on a level I haven’t seen in years. It was a performance of such sheer bruised charisma that I haven’t been able to stop thinking about all year. Criss is up against Benedict Cumberbatch, who delivered a lifetime’s worth of acting in the first episode of Patrick Melrose alone, but only a fool would think of betting against him.Three years ago, the lack of any nominations at all for Modern Family – then an unstoppable Emmy-gobbler – would have been unthinkable. One year ago, the lack of nominations for House of Cards would have done the same. Go back a couple of months and you would have bet the house on Roseanne getting nominated. And yet, here and now, their omissions (for late-stage laziness, accusations of sexual impropriety and outright racism respectively) aren’t going to bother anyone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88b777759f906b5bae8aaad93e95a98f7a564a6a/13_98_1222_733/master/1222.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9572027ef7f2b27576abf2826b46f031","title":"archaeologists open huge granite sarcophagus alexandria egypt","story":"Untouched for millennia, tomb was found during construction work in AlexandriaArchaeologists are preparing to open a large black granite sarcophagus unearthed in the Egyptian port city of Alexandria.At almost two metres high and three metres in length, the sarcophagus is the largest of its kind to be discovered intact in the ancient city. It was found alongside a large alabaster head believed to represent the inhabitant of the tomb, which had remained untouched for thousands of years. The sarcophagus, discovered during construction work, has become a source of excitement for archaeologists because a layer of mortar between the body and the lid indicates its contents have lain undisturbed since it was buried.It is believed to be from the early Ptolemaic period, which began after the death of Alexander the Great in 323BC. “We are hoping this tomb may belong to one of the high dignitaries of the period,” said Ayman Ashmawy, the head of ancient Egyptian artefacts at the Egypt’s ministry of antiquities. “The alabaster head is likely that of a nobleman in Alexandria. When we open the sarcophagus, we hope to find objects inside that are intact, which will help us to identify this person and their position.” But opening it for the first time will require extensive work to be done in advance. “It’s risky to open it directly – we need to prepare,” said Ashmawy, explaining that the sarcophagus would be opened on site. In the coming weeks, a team of engineers will visit the site to provide heavy lifting equipment and structural supports to allow archeologists to remove the sarcophagus lid. Once inside, mummification and restoration specialists will be on hand to ensure the contents, exposed for the first time in millennia, are preserved."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6bd9e2d43bc245ab28209a2ec824e54d5c1f2b9/0_404_3593_2156/master/3593.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74e3a6ee250f67730d5850ab8fbfaeb0","title":"armistice centenary to feature 10000 strong peoples march","story":"A Nation’s Thank You at Cenotaph will mark 100 years since end of first world warA huge march past the Cenotaph in London’s Whitehall by 10,000 members of the public is planned to mark the centenary of the Armistice, the culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, announced on Thursday.A Nation’s Thank You – the People’s Procession will follow the traditional British Legion’s veteran march past at the end of the national service of remembrance, on the 100th anniversary of the end of the first world war on 11 November.Those taking part in the procession will be chosen by ballot, with descendants, family members and the public invited to apply for tickets.Meanwhile, the UK and German governments have joined together to invite nations to participate in international bell ringing to replicate the national outpouring of relief that took place as armistice was declared in 1918.Charlotte Czyzyk, a first world war researcher at the Imperial War Museum, said: “On November 11 1918 the fighting ended. Accounts show people pouring out into the street, singing and dancing, and gathering in large places to be part of that shared moment.“The bells didn’t ring during the war, mainly for security reasons. It was felt, perhaps, they would be used in an emergency, if there was an invasion.“So when the bells rang on Armistice Day it was symbolic, and also a good way to let people know the war had ended, particularly those in villages.“I think that silence throughout the war, then the joyful release with the bells, is very poignant. So it is wonderful that the British and German governments are working together to recreate that moment.”The culture secretary said: “On the centenary of the Armistice, it is right that we come together to give thanks to those who paid the ultimate sacrifice and those who returned home to help shape the world we live in today.“The 11th of November offers us a unique opportunity to show our appreciation for the generation who gave so much to secure this hard-fought victory. I encourage everyone, whatever their connection to the first world war, to apply to participate in the People’s Procession and join in with the bell ringing programme to help us mark this historic occasion.”Bell ringing and the People’s Procession form part of the national commemoration events for the centenary, and will be followed by a service at Westminster Abbey in the evening.

A violent crackdown on protesters would later lead to an armed uprising.The victory over rebels in the cradle of the uprising, and the reclaiming of the entire city for the first time in seven years, is a powerful symbol heralding the military defeat of a rebellion that aimed to unseat the Assad dynasty but was waylaid by violent government repression, the rise of Islamist extremists, the unwavering support of the regime’s allies Russia and Iran and the dithering of western powers.The surrounding province of Daraa also has great strategic significance due to its proximity to the border with Israel, and it straddles the Jordanian border. Tel Aviv has warned it would not tolerate Iranian-backed militias close to the Golan Heights.The Syrian government announced an offensive last month to reclaim all of the province of Daraa, where western-backed rebels controlled swathes of territory in what was ostensibly a “de-escalation” zone.But the offensive, backed by Russia, months after a brutal assault on the region around Damascus known as eastern Ghouta that killed 2,000 people and involved the use of chemical weapons, prompted the flight of more than a quarter of a million civilians from the area in one of the largest single displacements in the conflict.Rebels quickly sought to negotiate with Assad’s Russian sponsors after the US, which for years had backed the southern rebels, said it would not intervene militarily to protect them.The surrender deal mirrors that in other parts of Syria: the handover of heavy weapons and forced displacement of those who oppose the agreement to the country’s northern territories, which are controlled either by rebel groups or proxies of Turkey.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which has been monitoring the war, said rebels were still in the city, but on Thursday their departure appeared to be merely a matter of time. Government forces are now expected to turn to Idlib in the north, where Islamist militias and al-Qaida-linked militants control territory hosting more than two million internal refugees."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05b284d1fabe3f68eb080b344bae5e4d1865524d/0_13_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbb83801df6db07abe27277d22729d78","title":"nato summit world leaders gather in pictures","story":"Donald Trump and Theresa May pose with other world leaders for traditional ‘family’ photographs at Nato’s Brussels headquarters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3563104.1531417298!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"vending machines are sources of revenue for schools","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn Oireachtas committee this week recommended a ban on vending machines which dispense junk food in schools. Photograph: iStockSausage rolls, chips, mini-pizzas, Danish pastries and cookies. They are just some of the staples on the menus of most secondary school canteens today. Almost half of schools have access to vending machines which sell chocolate, crisps, sweets and fizzy drinks. A similar proportion of post-primary schools do not have access to free drinking water. “This is what confronts schoolchildren every day,” says Chris Macey of the Irish Heart Foundation, which conducted research on food in schools in 2015. “They learn about the food pyramid and the need to limit their intake of treat foods and drinks but, for many, once they leave the classroom, junk products are everywhere all day long. The temptation pupils face is constant.”It’s little wonder, say many, that obesity levels among schoolchildren have soared from around 1 per cent of children in the mid-1970s to about 10 per cent of boys and girls today. About a third of schoolchildren overall are now overweight.This week the Oireachtas education committee recommended that vending machines which dispense junk food should be banned from schools. In addition, it said unhealthy food should be phased out of school canteens and shops to help counter childhood obesity.A key problem, however, is that many Irish schools earn significant sums through vending machines on their premises or in contracts for tuck shops or private catering companies.Schools, in some cases, can earn thousands of euro in commission fees for allowing vending machines in their buildings.“This is money we depend on to re-invest in the school to help plug funding gaps,” says one teacher, who declined to be named.“It’s the same with the catering contracts. Healthy food is more expensive. You might see things improve for a while when an issue is made of it, but it’s soon back to chips and curries.”There are also social and cultural barriers. For example, celebrity chef Jamie Oliver found his campaign to promote healthy eating in schools did not succeed in many cases because eating well was considered a preoccupation of the “very posh” and middle class. While the proliferation of snack outlets is an issue at second level, most primary schools don’t have vending machines or canteens.Concerns among young pupils tend to focus on what parents put in their children’s lunchboxes – such as supersized treats – and sedentary lifestyles.Claire Heneghan, a primary school teacher at Scoil Róis, Galway, has spoken of how school uniform sizes among junior and senior infants are on the rise.“The larger size is now becoming the more uniform size,” she says. “Obesity is a real problem.”There are a variety of projects aimed at promoting more exercise and healthier lunches at primary level, though many are practised by schools on an ad hoc basis.On an encouraging note, obesity levels among schoolchildren seem to be stabilising overall.Data collected as part of a UCD childhood obesity surveillance initiative shows there has been a reduction in the prevalence of overweight and obese children in non-disadvantaged schools.As for whether a ban on vending machines or junk food can be enforced by the Department of Education, many teachers don’t think so. This is because most schools are run by inidual boards of management and owned by different patron groups.For Dr Celine Murrin of UCD’s school of public health, the argument is not whether banning vending machines will solve the problem of obesity, but whether we want our schools to be supportive of health and wellbeing or not. “Schools are places where children and young people should be enabled to achieve their full potential,” she says.“It is essential to create school environments which promote and support health and wellbeing. Having ready access to food and drinks which are typically of poor nutritional value, without having a healthier alternative, is not part of a healthy school environment.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3563202.1531424027!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"night time water restrictions to be introduced in dublin area","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish Water is to introduce the restrictions in the greater Dublin area from midnight to 5 am on Monday, July 16th.Night time water restrictions in the greater Dublin area will be introduced as early as next week to protect future supply and avoid widespread outages in the autumn. Irish Water and the local authorities are working through more than 800 district meter areas to establish where water supplies can be restricted and for how long while minimising the impact to homes and businesses.“At this point, Irish Water is to introduce the restrictions in the greater Dublin area from midnight to 5am on Monday, July 16th but the final decision will be made tomorrow,” an Irish Water spokeswoman said. There are more than 20 schemes across the country already on restrictions. Irish Water corporate affairs manager Kate Gannon said introducing restrictions was an option that Irish Water hoped could be avoided because of the inevitable impact on homes and businesses. She said positive conservation measures were being taken by the public in Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and Meath.The development came as Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy told the Dáil that water levels were at an all-time low in some parts of the country.He said that of 1,000 water supply systems controlled by Irish Water, nine schemes are currently experiencing severe drought, 51 are in drought condition and a further 77 are in potential drought situations.Mr Murphy said reports “indicate that a significant number of recent wild land fires were caused by careless discarding of matches and cigarette ends”. He said that as the drought continues, flammable conditions for fire will remain. “This underlines the need for care to prevent wild land fires from starting.”Mr Murphy was speaking during a debate on the urgent need for water conservation due to the current prolonged period without rain. The Minister said that providing water for the longer term was the overriding concern and Irish Water was considering restricting supplies as it had to plan for September and October.He also called on TDs not to blame Irish Water for the country’s legacy problems as things get worse, adding that “they will get worse”.“It is managing the situation better than anyone else could to date,” he said. “We now have information, technology and oversight that we would never had if 31 or 34 local authorities were trying to manage that between themselves.”He added that “Irish Water did not break the pipes or under-invest over the decades. It inherited the system and it is fixing it.”Sinn Féin housing spokesman Eoin Ó Broin said the State is the single biggest waster of water. “Some 36 per cent of water in the greater Dublin water supply area is lost in the distribution system.” "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Ireland\u0026rsquos Ambassador to Israel told of its annoyance over \u0026lsquoboycott initiative\u0026rsquoJason Bradley\u0027s debt to drug dealer a source of family angst, father told garda\u0026iacuteData protection officer \u0026lsquoon leave\u0026rsquo when alterations made, says Social ProtectionGarda search uncovers variety of chemicals suspected of increasing mushroom potencyFianna F\u0026aacuteil leader rules out confidence and supply renewal talks until after October budgetResidential Tenancies Board had 170,000 calls in 2017, up 31 per centUS president tells newspaper that Boris Johnson, who quit May\u0026rsquos cabinet earlier this week, would be a better leader than herD\u0026aacuteil passes Bill aiming to deal with outstanding claims from Setanta Insurance collapseKilmainham Gaol exhibition marking centenary of statesman\u0026rsquos birth runs till JanuaryPublic consultation on Ireland\u0026rsquos new development policy calls for public submissionsT\u0026aacutenaiste warns absence of Executive and defence of status quo \u0026lsquonot a safe strategy\u0026rsquoMember tells High Court organisation breached its constitution regarding ballotsLegislation championed by Shane Ross has not concluded committee stage in the SeanadTechnology breakthrough comes as politicians call for further grants and reduced taxAlone report says over 120,000 homes for older people needed between now and 2031\u0026lsquoI am Catholic and I wouldn\u0026rsquot mind becoming an Orangeman,\u0026rsquo says Michael Potter (56)Minister says \u0026rsquoother countries with hate crime law have major problems - we do not\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3559409.1531166658!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish breeder girls sent to australia during famine to be honoured","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe story of 110 teenage girls sent in 1848 from Skibbereen to Australia will be recalled in a bronze sculpture of 110 spoons by artist Toma McCullim. On leaving their famine-ravaged home town, each girl received two dresses, two petticoats, five pairs of stockings, two pairs of shoes, a bible, a bowl and a spoon.This summer, the poignant story of 110 teenage girls sent in 1848 from the devastation of a starving Skibbereen to Australia – where they were referred to as “breeders” – will be recalled in a bronze sculpture and a large piece of Australian sandstone in the West Cork town.“This is a story of bravery, the bravery of women it is a story of heroines,” says Skibbereen-based artist Toma McCullim. The girls from the Skibbereen Union Workhouse were despatched to Australia to provide labour, marry, have children and help colonise the sprawling continent.It’s uncertain how much choice, if any, they had in their departure, the artist says. At the time, 60 people a day were dying in the Skibbereen workhouse, which was rife with disease and hunger.The 110 were essentially “farmed”, says the artist with Uillinn, the West Cork Arts Centre, who has been the driving force behind the year-long 110 Skibbereen Girls public art project.In documentation she studied as part of her research through residencies at Uillinn, West Cork Arts Centre in Skibbereen and at the site of Skibbereen Workhouse, now Skibbereen Community Hospital Campus, the girls were referred to as “breeders”.The residencies allowed McCullim to carry out research and support a variety of tours, talks, film screenings and participatory workshops on the theme of the 110 girls and their journey to Australia.The 110 girls departed for Australia under the Earl Grey Famine Orphan Scheme, named after the colonial secretary who enacted it.This scheme had two aims: to reduce overcrowding in Irish workhouses through an assisted emigration scheme and to send female immigrants to settle in Australia where at the time there were nine men for every woman.The board of s in every union in Ireland put forward the names of suitable girls aged 14-18. An estimated 4,000 girls left the country under the scheme. Skibbereen Workhouse offered the most girls outside Dublin. There are believed to be in the region of 10,000 descendants of the young Skibbereen emigrants.Although the girls did not have to be orphans to be eligible for the scheme, it was stipulated that they were not to be living with their families, be of good character, unmarried and without children so that there would be no impediment to marrying Australian settlers.“Many of them did better in Australia than they could have done in the prevailing conditions in Ireland at the time,” says McCullim.At least two descendants are expected to make the journey to Skibbereen next month for a special ceremony honouring their ancestors’ story.One hundred and 10 bronze spoons have been cast by McCullim from beeswax moulds created by staff and residents at the Skibbereen Community Hospital complex, formerly the workhouse.Throughout this month, the spoons will be embedded in the archway above what used to be the workhouse’s Women’s Entrance, near the site’s famine burial ground.This piece of public art, which will be unveiled by the Australian ambassador on July 20th, will also include an installation of a piece of Australian sandstone, donated by the Australian embassy, which is expected to be placed in front of the archway.The ceremony will take place the day after the prestigious Coming Home: Art and the Great Hunger exhibition of historical and contemporary artwork from Ireland’s Great Hunger Museum, Quinnipiac University in the US state of Connecticut, opens in Uillinn, the West Cork Arts Centre in Skibbereen.The exhibition is on display in Dublin Castle"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3563193.1531426036!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ryanair pilots announce two more one day strikes in july","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRyanair pilots, who are members of the Irish Airline Pilots’ Association, on picket duty at Dublin Airport on Thursday.  Photograph: Conor HealyRyanair faces further strikes by Irish pilots following Thursday’s one-day stoppage across the State’s airports that led to 30 flight cancellations.About 100 members of the Irish Airline Pilots’ Association (Ialpa) - part of trade union Forsa - took part in the industrial action, which was the first ever strike by the airline’s Irish pilots. The pilots say they want a transparent system for dealing with issues tied to seniority and length of service with the company.Dressed in their uniforms a group of the pilots gathered near the entrance to Dublin Airport from 1am. They stood behind a large banner erected on the roadside and were met with a steady stream of beeping horns and thumbs-up as members of the public showed support for the strike. People Before Profit TD Bríd Smith, who came to support the strikers, said she would make the case for greater protection for airline workers in the Dáil. “I’m humbled to be among them today, it’s an historic occasion”.On Thursday night Ialpa said it had notified Ryanair that it intends to hold two further one-day strikes on July 20th and July 24th, both beginning at 1am.Ialpa said it and the company had found some common ground in talks on Wednesday on a proposal that a joint working group could help them agree a system for dealing with the pilots’ grievances. However, the sides clashed over the group’s terms of reference.“On a number of occasions in recent months, there have been suggestions that third-party facilitation could assist in reaching consensus on issues of disagreement,” Ialpa added. “It is, therefore, regrettable that Ryanair management has so far rejected the suggestion of third-party assistance.”Ryanair said it had encouraged pilots to take up its offer of a working group to deal with the issues but “if they wish to hold another unsuccessful strike again, then so be it”.The company added that it would contact customers in due course when it received details of the strikes from the union.Ryanair on Thursday had to cancel 30 of its 290 flights from the State’s airports, affecting about 5,000 travellers. The airline said that 262 of its flights to and from the Republic operated normally and that it had re-accommodated or refunded the customers hit by cancellations.The company added that the strike by 25 per cent of its pilots had “achieved nothing”.Around 100 of 350 Irish-based directly-employed Ryanair pilots are members of the union. It is understood that legal difficulties prevent Ialpa recruiting those on contracts.In a memo to pilots, Ryanair argued that the issues boiled down to annual leave, command upgrades and base transfers.“On all these issue Ryanair had a written proposal, provided in advance, to which we got no response yesterday,” it said.It argued the pilots’ proposals were not suitable for an airline with 87 bases and is increasing its fleet by 50 per cent a year."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3562994.1531411169!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"there must be no irish language act orange order insists","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBandsmen and Orange order members take part in the annual Twelfth of July celebrations in Belfast city centre. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThere must be no legislative concession on the Irish language, thousands of Orangemen and women and their supporters were told on Thursday at Twelfth of July demonstrations throughout Northern Ireland. At the order’s 17 parades in the North Orange leaders reasserted their opposition to an Irish language act – viewed by Dublin and London as one of the necessary compromises if the DUP and Sinn Féin are to strike a deal sometime in the autumn or next year to restore the Stormont powersharing Executive.On Thursday afternoon at the 17 fields where the Orange members gathered following the morning outward parades the three traditional resolutions on the Protestant faith and loyalty to the British crown and state were formally adopted.On the Irish language the resolution stated, “We reaffirm our opposition to the introduction of any form of legislation for the Irish language. Such a move would have far reaching detrimental consequences for our British identity and would rightly be acknowledged as a landmark victory for republicanism in their ongoing cultural war against our community.”The resolution also noted “with despair, the recent abortion referendum in the Republic of Ireland, and encourage our own government to resist any attempts to change the law in Northern Ireland”. At the Newcastle, Co Down parade the grand secretary of the order, the Rev Mervyn Gibson spoke of the need for the institution to adopt “new thinking new tactics and new alliances” in order to remain “relevant”. Mr Gibson said the principles and message of the order remained the same “but how we defend and promote them needs to be made fit for purpose in a world that would be unrecognisable to our fathers and mothers, let alone our grandfathers and grandmothers”. “Equally, there is to be no compromise on our cherished position within the United Kingdom, ” he said. “Nationalists and republicans seek to use border polls and Brexit to worry us into a united Ireland. Well, they couldn’t murder us, bomb us, intimidate us into a united Ireland – they are certainly not going to bribe us, cajole us or frighten us into a united Ireland.”The order’s grand master Edward Stevenson, speaking at the demonstration in Castlederg, Co Tyrone, said as an institution that lost 336 people during the Troubles it was vital the voice of the organisation continued to be heard.He said, “Republicans are daily attempting to rewrite history to make it look as if their campaign of murder was somehow justified. We will never allow the perpetrators of violence to become the victims, and that would be an insult to those who lost their lives and to their families.”The order’s grand chaplain, Rev Alistair Smyth, speaking in Rasharkin, Co Antrim, said “the United Kingdom as a whole is increasingly becoming a cold house for Bible believing Christians”. “In view of the decline in Biblical Christianity in the Republic and in Northern Ireland, what this island needs is not a visit from the Pope but a visit of God’s Holy Spirit,” he said. The order’s deputy grand master Harold Henning, speaking in Donaghcloney, Co Down said it was right to “cultivate good relations with our neighbours in the Republic of Ireland…but let no one confuse talking over the fence with taking away the fence”.“We recognise a sizeable minority of those who live in Northern Ireland seek a united Ireland, as is their democratic right in a free society,” he added. “Let us also recognise that the vast majority of them had no truck with, and were rightly ashamed of those republicans, who engaged in a sickening murderous campaign against their Protestant neighbours, whether in or out of uniform.”Derek Reaney, the order’s assistant grand master speaking in Garvagh, Co Derry said Brexit posed a “massive challenge to the future unity and economic wellbeing of the United Kingdom”. He added, “Any attempt to create any political, economic, or cultural barrier between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom must be opposed. A semi-detached union is totally unacceptable.”Another grand chaplain, Rev Ron Johnstone in Newtownards, Co Down, said King William’s victory at the Battle of the Boyne “cemented liberties” that all citizens can enjoy - “freedom of speech, freedom of worship, an independent judiciary and a freely elected parliament”.Mr Smyth concluded his speech: “We declare today this is our culture. It is not intended to offend anyone. It is part of who we are. Get over it.”Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister told the Independent Orange Order demonstration in Broughshane, Co Antrim, that as presently configured Stormont could never succeed because “Sinn Féin is not there to make Northern Ireland work”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3563295.1531429659!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"israel s defence minister calls for closure of dublin embassy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIsraeli defence minister Avigdor Lieberman said Israel should immediately close the embassy in Dublin.  Photograph: EPA Atef SafadiIsrael’s defence minister has called on his country to close its embassy in Dublin in response to the Seanad backing a Bill banning the import of goods from West Bank Jewish settlements. Ireland’s Ambassador to Israel, Alison Kelly, was yesterday summoned to the country’s foreign ministry to be told of its displeasure over the progress of the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018. Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon said, “The Irish Senate has lent a hand to a populist, dangerous and extreme anti-Israel boycott initiative, effectively undermining the dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians. “The boycott will affect the livelihood of many Palestinians who work in Israeli industrial zones, and they will be hurt by this initiative,” he added. “It will only cause damage to the diplomatic process in the Middle East.” However, defence minister Avigdor Lieberman said greater retaliation than inviting the Ambassador in “for a reprimand” was needed. “With Israel haters there is nothing to debate. Israel should immediately close the embassy in Dublin. We will not turn the other cheek to those who boycott us,” Mr Lieberman said.The Bill, proposed by Independent Senator Frances Black, would make it an offence to purchase goods and services from Israeli settlements which have been condemned by Ireland and the EU as illegal.It passed its first vote in the Seanad on Wednesday with the support of Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin, Labour and Independent Senators. It must pass through the Dáil before becoming law but if backed again by the same coalition of parties and Independents, it would have sufficient support.Ms Kelly had already been summoned to the foreign ministry twice this year. In January, when the Bill was first submitted, she told the Israelis that the legislation was not motivated by the BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) movement. She was also summoned to the foreign ministry in April to be reprimanded over then lord mayor of Dublin Mícheál Mac Donncha’s participation in a symposium held in the West Bank city of Ramallah, and over two anti-Israel resolutions passed by Dublin City Council. Speaking yesterday, Ms Kelly said: “One of the points I always make to the Israelis is that I represent the Government and the Government opposed the Bill in January and it opposed it today.” She said he also raised other issues of concern for Ireland, such as the situation in Gaza and Israeli home demolitions in the West Bank.Senior Palestine Liberation Organisation official Saeb Erekat welcomed the vote. “This courageous step builds on the historic ties between Ireland and Palestine, as well as it shows the way forward for the rest of the European Union. ” Members of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, from the predominantly Arab Joint List party also praised the development. “The settlements are a war crime and must be treated as such,” they said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3561957.1531350564!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord meghan and harry dazzle under terms and conditions","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Prince Harry and  Meghan Markle with  President Michael Higgins  and his wife, Sabina, with  Bród and Siodá, Michael D’s Bernese Mountain dogs. Photograph: Getty ImagesWhat about this handsome couple, with their good hair, smiling eyes and lovely manners?Gorgeous and utterly charming, a winning combination of impeccable breeding and lustrous celebrity. They won, and they melted, many hearts. They have to dazzle, because it is part of the terms and conditions for working royals on walkabout duty. The royal rambles were in Trinity College and at the CHQ venue in Dublin’s Docklands, where the celebrity drawing power of the newly wed Prince and American actress unleashed waves of unbridled enthusiasm and exaltation among the crowds who came along to have a good look at them. Their day began in Áras an Uachtaráin, a short distance from Farmleigh House where they lodged the night before. President Higgins and his wife, Sabina, bustled into the State reception room to greet them, a spray of pink-tinged white roses on the mantelpiece behind them and the visitors’ book open on a small table commissioned for the visit of Harry’s grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, in 2011. Outside, staff raked and reraked the gravel paths, and Bród and Siodá, Michael D’s Bernese Mountain dogs, lumbered lazily around the geraniums and fountains.“You’re most welcome,” smiled the President, greeting his guests. Meghan was toting a very large black handbag which cost thousands of pounds. Everyone reckoned she didn’t have anything in it, apart from a bit of lipstick and an emergency sliver of lettuce. According to Harper’s Bazaar, it was a Fendi bag, but that doesn’t really matter because apparently whenever she carries a new bag and the photographs appear, they sell out in a matter of hours. We’ll all just have to wait for the new order to come in. The two couples made polite conversation for the cameras and nobody in the heaving media contingent uttered a word because of protocol until Newstalk’s Henry McKean roared a question to the immeasurable relief of everyone else. There was only one question on Wednesday. “Is football coming home?” Michael D smiled and remained silent but, with England’s World Cup semi-final just hours away, the Duke couldn’t resist replying. “Most definitely!” he declared, and everyone in the room laughed uproariously and went weak at the knees.The group enjoyed a potter around the gardens and the royals rang the Peace Bell. Then came the news that everyone wanted to hear. “They met the dogs.” Or the “first dogs”.Staff from the Áras came out to witness the departure. When the presidential couple and the royal couple tried to gracefully exit the main doors, the two dogs barged their way past with not a care for status or office. Then Harry and Meghan had a final few words with their hosts – “Absolutely lovely” said Sabina – before waving farewell to Bród and Siodhá.Did the President, who announced on Tuesday he will be seeking a second term, say “this is not goodbye, but merely au revoir?” On the way to Trinity College, hugely important questions had to be teased out. What colour was the dress? Mushroom, stone, taupe? But there was clearly just a single ruffle and it was definitely cocktail length. Another fact had to be nailed down by the royal reporters. “Did she actually wave to the dog? Did she?” She did. “And the dog waved back,” snapped an RTÉ cameraman, rolling his eyes.People were anxious about the visit to Trinity. The Duchess was wearing very high heels. Could she cope on the cobbles? She nearly tripped on a very low step leaving the Áras and Michael D had to reach out a steadying hand. “She will be walking from The Long Hall,” declared an American journalist. We didn’t tell him this was the name of a nearby public house because people were worried enough. Finally, after viewing the ancient manuscript in Trinity’s Long Room, the couple emerged to delighted screams of welcome and a forest of upheld phones. Megan gingerly picked her way across the cobblestones. The international TV journalists got to work as the walkabout unfolded behind them. Ireland’s “long and troubled past” got a big airing but the royal visit was a “positive sign of improved relations between the two countries”. Strangers could be forgiven for thinking we were at war with some of the things being said. “Harreee! Harreee!” came the cries. “Meghan! Meghan! Over here!” The couple got stuck in, covering more space than Dulux, shaking hands, chatting, looking very interested, asking friendly questions, saying nice things. When the couple left, tourists and locals alike were buzzing with excitement. “There’s hardly a pick on Meghan but she’s perfectly proportioned,” said one woman. “Harry’s photographs don’t do him justice at all. He’s very handsome,” remarked Una O’Neill, a retired teacher from Templeogue. Beside her, student and top basketball player Chloe Mullins (19) held a framed black and white drawing she did of the couple’s engagement photograph. Harry stopped immediately when he saw it. “Is that for me? Wow!” He showed Meghan the picture, then said to Chloe: “You’ve given me more hair than I have.” He kept the gift, although Kensington Palace officials had gone around the crowd earlier saying they would not be accepting gifts.Then the visitors and their entourage broke for lunch at Delahunt restaurant on Camden Street to fortify themselves for the next leg – a trip to see the famine memorial on the Liffey quayside. Then they were introduced to Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe who said “thank you very much” to the royals for gracing his Dublin Central Constituency, along with the Epic emigration museum in the CHQ. Yet again, the crowd was thrilled to see them in the flesh. “Today is all about Harry – Windsor, Maguire, Kane” read a poster held high by London-born Melissa Moloney. Maguire and Kane would be playing later for England. Eight-year-old Ayana O’Callaghan from Clontarf in Dublin gave her opinion on Meghan. “I think she’s pretty but she shouldn’t have to wear tights because her skin is really nice.” But it wasn’t all fun and happiness among the selfie-sticks, delirious tourists and screaming girls. “Daddy, I touched both of them,” said a breathless Twinkle Polgolla (12) from Park West to her dad. “I felt special.” Her sisters Nikishi and Tharu were equally excited because they too shook a royal hand. But their sister June (14) was inconsolable, tears falling down her face. “She didn’t make it. They moved on,” explained her mum.

archaeologists prepare open huge mystery sarcophagus","story":"digitalservices@telegraphThe almost three-metre long by two-metre high sarcophagus was discovered in a long-concealed tomb below the earth during a survey of a plot of land digitalservices@telegraphEgyptian archaeologists are preparing to open a huge black sarcophagus unearthed in Alexandria, the city founded by Alexander the Great and where the legendary conqueror himself may be buried. The almost three-metre long by two-metre high sarcophagus was discovered in a long-concealed tomb below the earth during a survey of a plot of land for a building construction. An alabaster bust, its features eroded over the centuries, was found in the tomb.While the tomb likely belonged to a noble man, not a king, its discovery gave hope to experts who believe that the tomb of Alexander might one day be found in modern Alexandria, which is built on top of ancient city he founded.The Egyptian antiquities ministry said the sarcophagus had remained sealed for more than 2,000 years, with an undisturbed layer of mortar between the lid and the body of the massive stone coffin.Without opening the sarcophagus, there are few clues about the identity of the man entombed inside. His bust is worn beyond recognition and the sarcophagus has no writings to indicate its owner.Archaeologists believe, however, that it belonged to a noble or wealthy man of the Ptolemaic Period, between 323 BC and 30 BC, when Rome seized Egypt following the death of Queen Cleopatra.The tomb should belong to someone important, it is a granite sarcophagus, said Zahi Hawass, a former antiquities minister and leading Egyptologist. For someone to bring granite from Aswan means he would have had to have been rich. An eroded alabaster bust was also found in the tombAswan is more than 1,000 kilometres south of the Mediterranean city.Everyone is looking for the tomb of Alexander. We are sure he was buried in Alexandria. The discovery of this sarcophagus proves that one day when they are demolishing a villa or a house they can find his tomb, Mr Hawass said.Excavations continue at the site in the crowded Sidi Gaber district of Alexandria which lies between a railway and the Mediterranean coast. Alexander, who may have died of typhoid fever in 323 BC, would likely have been buried in what is today the Shatby district of Alexandria where royals were entombed, Mr Hawass said.The archaeologists will open the sarcophagus on site, Mostafa Waziri, the secretary general of Egypt\u0027s Supreme Council of Antiquities, told The Daily .Within days, when the debris is raised, we will open it. We will lift the lid, he said. It\u0027s very hard to know whose it is until now because there are no signs of it. But the tomb is too small for it to be for a king like Alexander.Waziri said it was not the largest such coffin found, and in the past archaeologists had opened sarcophagi only to be disappointed.We\u0027ve opened several such sarcophagi, some bigger than this. One was a Roman noble, another was a priest. It could be empty, we don\u0027t know. We\u0027ve opened hundreds of tombs, some were empty. Others were not.The discovery has provoked debates on social media with some suggesting, half in jest, that  the tomb be left alone. If the movies have taught me anything, guys don\u0027t open that. Just don\u0027t. Leave it alone, wrote American novelist Catherynne Valente on Twitter.Archaeologists however are keen to discover the identity of the enigmatic tomb owner.It ticks a lot of boxes with the public because it is sealed and enigmatic. It\u0027s a big black box, said Nigel J Hetherington, a British Egyptologist and founder of Past Preservers.It is rare to find intact burials that often, he said. What would be interesting is to find a new person, to find out about them.Donald Trump says Boris Johnson would make \u0026#39great prime minister\u0026#39Pensioner, 85, fights off burglars with

dinner, which has been held annually since 1985, would no longer take place.The Charity Commission\u0027s investigation found that the dress code for 140 female staff working at the dinner in January and the instructions for how they should look were not acceptable in a charitable environment.Staff were provided with a dress to wear, told to do their make-up and hair as if going to a smart sexy place” and to bring “smart sexy shoes with heels”.The regulator said trustees did not deal properly with the reputational risk caused by holding an all-male event with predominantly female event staff who had been issued with dresses purchased by the charity and with instructions on appearance.Helen Stephenson, chief executive of the Charity Commission, said: “Our report should serve as a warning to others that raising funds for charity does not absolve trustees of their legal duties or moral responsibilities.She added: The trustees thought insufficiently about the welfare of the women hired to work at their charity’s event while taking careful steps to protect the privacy of the male guests attending the dinner.It is not the Commission’s role to determine whether any of the women working on the night were subjected to harassment or abuse.Read more | The Presidents ClubWhat we can say is that the trustees’ attitude towards their welfare in the name of charity fell short of what would be expected in the 21st century.A separate report released by the Fundraising Regulator warned other charities who benefit from such events that they should do due diligence before they agree to be publicly associated with them.According to the charity\u0027s website the Presidents Club had in the past raised money for charities including Scope, the NSPCC and Great Ormond Street Hospital.Following the allegations, which were first published in the Financial Times, all three cut ties with the charity and said they would not accept any further donations.The regulator added that the trustees had little awareness of the expectations around fundraising and did not properly supervise the company which organised the event.Please review our commenting policyDonald Trump says Boris

UN world health meeting that would have protected breastfeedingDonald Trump’s administration has threatened Ecuador with trade sanctions if it\u0026nbspintroduces a United Nations resolution to encourage breastfeeding.The US had supposedly asked for language asking governments to “protect, promote, and support breastfeeding” to be removed. The resolution ultimately passed but not before world health officials were shocked at the behaviour of the US delegation at the May UN World Health Assembley\u0026nbspin Geneva, the New York Times reported.\u0026nbspEcuadorians, facing having important military aid from the US rescinded on top of harsh sanctions on critical goods, backed down. But, the US did not threaten Russia in the same manner.\u0026nbspAn unnamed Russian delegate said the country stepped up to back and help pass the resolution because they felt\u0026nbsp “it is wrong when a big country tries to push around some very small countries, especially on an issue that is really important for the rest of the world.The delegation was also opposed to another section of the resolution which called on countries to curtail promotion of products that medical experts agreed could cause harm to children according to more than a dozen delegates to the health meeting, the majority of whom requested anonymity because they feared retaliation from the US, according to the newspaper.Though US\u0026nbspefforts were unsuccessful since the bulk of the original wording survived two whole days of procedural talks, language calling for “inappropriate promotion of foods for infants and young children to end was removed due to US efforts.\u0026nbspThe US mission to the UN nor the State Department responded to a request for comment.\u0026nbspIt appeared,\u0026nbsphowever, the US was asking to have the language removed as a sign of support for the $70bn\u0026nbspinfant formula industry which relies on mothers not exclusively breastfeeding. Baby food lobbyists were in attendance as observers to the meeting.The US also reportedly threatened to cut its contributions to the World Health Organisation - the US contributes almost 15 per cent of the agency\u0027s budget or $845m last year - if the resolution was introduced and passed.\u0026nbspIn light of the threat on Ecuador, other poorer countries in Latin America and Africa refused to introduce the resolution out of fear of American retaliation which left Russia to push it through.\u0026nbspBreastfeeding in public controversiesA woman has sparked a heated debate among parents after she revealed that she breastfeeds both her and her friend\u0027s son.

Still, the runaway success in terms of the acting department is far and away The Handmaid\u0027s Tale which is looking to capitalise on its big win last year.Elisabeth Moss faces the likes of Claire Foy\u0026nbsp(The Crown), Keri Russell (The Americans) and Killing Eve\u0027s Sandra Oh who becomes the first Asian woman to ever be nominated in the lead actress category while co-stars turn competitors in the categories of Supporting Actress and Outstanding Guest Actress (the former sees nominations for Alexis Biedel, Yvonne Strahovski and reigning champion Ann Dowd).In the comedy stakes, it\u0027s nominations a-plenty for the second season of Donald Glover\u0027s Atlanta, Netflix smash GLOW and Amazon\u0027s Golden Globe-winning The Marvellous Mrs Maisel which sees Rachel Brosnahan\u0026nbspgo up against Pamela Adlon\u0026nbsp(Better Things), Allison Janney\u0026nbsp(Mom) and Issa Rae of Insecure fame.Twin Peaks fans won\u0027t be happy when they see the Limited Series nominations. Considering it was eligible this year as it aired the majority of its episodes after the Emmys cut-off point in 2017, it\u0027s fair to say David Lynch\u0027s revival has been snubbed (shout out to Larry David whose long-waited\u0026nbspCurb Your Enthusiasm return got noticed in the Comedy categories).Still, it\u0027s good news for The Assassination of Gianni Versace, Godless and Patrick Melrose who\u0027ll all duke it out while Laura Dern may as well collect her trophy now for The Tale.You can find the full list of Emmys 2018 nominations here.The ceremony this year will be hosted by SNL\u0027s\u0026nbspMichael Che and Colin Jost.As Game of Thrones comes to a close, HBO is probably\u0026nbsphoping Westworld starts picking up awards, but the show seemed to lose rather than gain buzz with its second outing.RuPaul has won Best Reality Host two years running now, but we can expect the Queer Eye Boys to get a nomination today, and they have an outside chance of stealing the crown.Not long to go, one and all - here\u0027s hoping for a few surprises and a willingness to stray from nominating the old usualsThis could be the year that The Americans\u0026nbspfinally sweeps the board - it aired its sixth and final season earlier this year to huge acclaim.Just a note - Twin Peaks *is* eligible for nominations this year as it aired the majority of its episodes after the cut off point in 2017.As bold as its second season was, Stranger Things\u0026nbspbeing nominated in the Best Drama category would feel a waste considering the fresh blood we have on offer this year (Killing Eve, Mindhunter and Ozark to name just three).The comedy category is very much up in the air! A lot of people will be disappointed if The Good Place is snubbed but I wouldn\u0027t get your hopes up...which is a good time to note that Veep won\u0027t be in contention this year as it was off the air while Julia Louis-Dreyfus could recover from her cancer treatment (we love you Julia!)This year\u0027s nominations will be announced by Samira Wiley of The Handmaid\u0027s Tale fame and The Blacklist\u0027s Ryan EggoldHere we go...Lead Actress in a TV Movie  Limited SeriesJessica Biel - The SinnerLaura Dern - The TaleMichelle Dockery - GodlessEdie Falco - Law \u0026amp Order: True CrimeRegina King - Seven SecondsSarah Paulson - American Horror Story: CultLead Actor in a Limited Series or TV Movie\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAntonio Banderas - Genius: PicassoDarren Criss - The Assassination of Gianni\u0026nbspVersaceBenedict Cumberbatch - Patrick MelroseJeff Daniels - GodlessJohn Legend -\u0026nbspJesus Christ Superstar Live in ConcertJesse Plemons - Black Mirror: USS CallisterLead Actress in a Comedy SeriesPamela Adlon - Better ThingsRachel Brosnahan - The Marvellous Mrs MasielAllison Janney - MomIssa Rae - InsecureTracee Ellis Ross - Black-ishLily Tomlin - Grace \u0026amp FrankieFull list of nominations to follow.Game of ThronesEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

And just as with the earlier discovery, the new development\u0026nbsprelied on scientists spotting the tiniest disturbance down on Earth, and tracking it to a mysterious black hole billions of light years away.The neutrino is the first of its kind detected and its likely origin was traced\u0026nbspto a “blazar” four billion light years away. There, it was thrown out by a galaxy with a vast black hole at its centre, flung across the universe as the cosmic consumes matter.Scientists have been mystified by cosmic rays since they were found more than a century ago, pouring down onto Earth. Despite their huge number and intense power, it has been unclear where they\u0026nbspcome from.The new discovery could finally explain where cosmic rays originate. If correct, the answer would be\u0026nbspa fittingly spectacular phenomenon deep in the universe.The neutrinos appear to be spewing out of fast spinning supermassive black holes and the discovery could give us an entirely new way of looking at the universe.The particles might be a “third messenger” carrying\u0026nbspenergy from elsewhere in the cosmos, in addition to light and gravitational waves.If so, the newly observed\u0026nbspparticle would be an unprecedented new way\u0026nbspof understanding some of the most intense and mysterious phenomena in the universe. Neutrinos could be doubly helpful because they have no mass and travel in an almost entirely straight line through the universe – which makes them very difficult to detect but very easy to track, as they travel billions of light years.“Neutrinos rarely interact with matter,” said\u0026nbspProfessor Paul O’Brien, a member of the international team of astronomers at the University of Leicester. “To detect them at all from the cosmos is amazing, but to have a possible source identified is a triumph.“This result will allow us to study the most distant, powerful energy sources in the universe in a completely new way.”The discovery was reported in two new papers published in the journal Science, and was the result of work by a huge\u0026nbspglobal team of researchers.The neutrino was found on September 22 by the IceCube observatory, a huge facility a mile beneath the South Pole.A grid of more than 5,000 super sensitive sensors picked up the characteristic blue “Cherenkov” light emitted as the neutrino interacted with\u0026nbspice.Having almost no mass and passing right through planets, stars and anything else in its way, the particle travelled in a straight line from its point of origin to Earth.As a result, astronomers were able to track its trajectory back across billions of light years to its probable source.News of the detection sent astronomers into a frenzy as telescopes were pointed in the suggested direction. The search led to a “blazar”, a special class of galaxy containing a supermassive black hole four billion light years away, just to the left of the constellation Orion.The finding was the result of a global effort to track down the source, triggered by an automated alert after the intriguing detection at the South Pole.“This result really highlights the importance of taking a multimessenger approach to these searches,” said Erik Blaufuss, a research scientist in the UMD Department of Physics who led the effort – over several years – to create and deploy IceCube’s high energy event alert system. “Any one observation made alone would likely not have let us piece together what is actually going on inside this source.”A key feature of blazars is twin jets of light and elementary particles that shoot from the poles of the swirling whirlwind of material surrounding the black hole. One of those jets happened to point towards Earth and led to one of the most profound discoveries in the history of astrophysics.The neutrino detected by IceCube is thought to have been created by high energy cosmic rays from the jets interacting with nearby material.Unlike high energy neutrinos, most cosmic rays carry an electric charge that causes their trajectories to be warped by magnetic fields, making it impossible to trace their origins. By contrast, neutrinos are unaffected by even the most powerful magnetic fields.The blazar believed to have generated the neutrino – codenamed TXS 0506 + 056 – was located in less than a minute, after the IceCube team relayed coordinates for follow-up observations to telescopes worldwide.Being able to detect high energy neutrinos will provide yet another window on the universe, say\u0026nbspthe scientists.The sensational discovery of the second “messenger”, gravitational waves – ripples in space-time – was announced in February 2016.France Cordova, director of the US National Science Foundation (NSF), that manages the IceCube laboratory, said: “The era of multimessenger astrophysics is here.Cosmic rays were discovered in 1912 by physicist Victor Hess, using instruments on a balloon flight.Later research showed them to be made\u0026nbspof protons, electrons or atomic nuclei accelerated to speeds approaching that of light.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

With an estimated worth of $1bn, a trade body and a recognised marketing award, they have finally been tamedClick to followThe Independent OnlinePep talk: Kendall Jenner’s Pepsi advert was pulled shortly after it aired for appearing to trivialise demonstrations tackling social causesLast month, the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity –\u0026nbspthe biggest grouping of advertising and marketing people you could ever hope to avoid –\u0026nbspintroduced a new award: the Social and Influencer\u0026nbspcategory.Yes, those\u0026nbspgurning thumb-flexers forever punching #YOLO, #instacool and #nofilter into their smartphones as they plug products have come of age.\u0026nbspInfluencer-dom is now a fully-fledged industry. Yet only a year or two ago we were told by many (rather gleefully in some cases) that the influencer was dead or at least in crisis.Earlier this year, this seemed to be confirmed as the owner of the White Moose Cafe in Dublin turned the tables on\u0026nbsp22-year-old YouTube vlogger and influencer Elle Darby, by exposing her demand for five free hotel nights in return for exposure.His public burn spoke for many: “If I let you stay here in return for a feature in a video, who is going to pay the staff who look after you?” The twitter-mob turned on influencers. Who were they? How do they get away with it? Do they actually earn money?When the influencer marketing industry began (around 2008-10, attest the form’s historians) the notion took hold that like celebrity endorsement before it, aspirational people could become marketing tools, accessing the consumer mind as if a recommendation from a friend.YouTuber with 139,095 subscribers, was refused a free hotel stay (YouTubeElle Darby)As one observer put it:\u0026nbsp“They emerged almost overnight and in 10 years have gone from a small network to a worldwide community.” Some sources suggest that there is now a baseline of 1.1 million influencers worldwide.\u0026nbspMediakix estimated\u0026nbspthe industry was worth more than $1bn\u0026nbsp(£750m)\u0026nbspin 2017. Malcolm Gladwell’s coinage, “the tipping point”, was used a lot in meetings.\u0026nbspBy about 2014, a baffled world had started to understand influencer marketing, but the industry’s breakthrough year was probably 2016 when, as Hamda Issa-Salwe of Bravado, part of Universal Music Group, found when she did a research thesis called Investigating the Use of Influencer Marketing on Social Media.“It began to soar,” she says. “Google classified ‘influencer’ as a breakout keyword with a 5,000 per cent month by month increase in the number of times the search term ‘influencer marketing’ was typed.”Also in 2016, it was established that Kendall Jenner was paid an estimated $300,000 per social media post. Advertising agencies took more careful notice of influencers and Instagram –\u0026nbspfounded in 2010 – became the key station of the social media cross, along with other key platforms\u0026nbspsuch as YouTube, Snapchat and Pinterest.Even the fustiest legacy-media type can now see the point. The barrier to entry is low. All you need is a smartphone and a certain brio. And the research seems to add up. According to Nielsen, 84 per cent\u0026nbspof consumers trust opinions from people they know, while 70 per cent\u0026nbsptake action based on other consumer’s opinions online.vlogger Zoella reportedly has a net worth of £2.5m (InstagramZoella)The Association of National Advertisers found that 75 per cent\u0026nbspof members already work with influencers, and the growing industry will take 20 per cent\u0026nbspof the total global marketing budget by 2023.No wonder that 82 per cent\u0026nbspof millennials hope to become influencers at least, according to a survey by London-based dating app CLiKD.\u0026nbspSo the money’s talking, and influencers can do well.It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rentAs Anthony Svirskis, CEO\u0026nbspof TRIBE and a juror on the\u0026nbspSocial and Influencer award says:\u0026nbsp“On a post by post basis, brands should expect to pay £50 for someone with 3,000 followers and upwards of £300 if someone has more than 100,000 followers.” Small wonder the market is seething with aspirant influencers.\u0026nbspYet influencers are still derided as being without any particular skills: even that they’re the apotheosis of the entitled “Me” generation, spreading paid-for blandishments in vocal-fry vlogs on YouTube.While it’s hard to blame someone who travels the world in return for Instagram snaps, is there an influencer bubble waiting to burst? Paul Dyer, of marketing company Lippe Taylor, believes it will, as trust has disappeared from the sector in the sceptical Facebook-Cambridge Analytica era.“There is tremendous value in influencer marketing,” he said recently. “However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls out.”Indeed, there have been several influencer #epicfails, perhaps the most notable being\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspFestival, the ill-fated 2017 Bahamas musical festival that paid Kendall Jenner and Bella\u0026nbspHadid\u0026nbspto drum up support.\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspbombed and the repercussions are ongoing.There’s also an undergrowth of freebie-hunting influencers harassing hotels and providers. Some hotels – the\u0026nbspDusit\u0026nbspThani\u0026nbspresort in the Males among them – now use weeding out processes. “When they work hotels love them,” says one travel PR.\u0026nbspThe influencer economy … is a market irrationality. Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money“Influencers are uncritical and often share films and photographs that would otherwise be paid for. But there’s a trust problem.”There are other cracks in the influencer edifice as brands begin to ask questions about the business efficacy of influencers. As publicist Mark Borkowski says:\u0026nbsp“More brands are beginning to realise that influencer activity doesn’t necessarily drive ROI.”And the pain is on both sides, he adds. “It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rent.” Anti-influencers are coming of the woodwork –\u0026nbspand they’re not all crusty oldies with a grudge.“The influencer economy … is a market irrationality,” wrote Sam Biddle of Gawker in 2016. “Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money.” As for bots and fake followers, that’s a real problem.Fyre Festival attendees locked in airport ‘for their own safety’At Cannes, Unilever’s chief marketing officer Keith Weed called for industry action to clean out the influencer stable, and vowed never to use influencers found to be buying followers.So the sands are shifting. Hamda Issa-Salwe says that while influencer activity remains hard to define and audit, it’s still growing. Although trust and authenticity (the great influencer bon mot) are major factors, brands still spend a lot on influencers: after all,\u0026nbspInstagram has more 800 million monthly active users.And the influencers themselves are fighting back. It’s a new industry: of course legacy dinosaurs wouldn’t get it. It’s just another marketing tool. And what are –\u0026nbspsorry, were –\u0026nbspnewspapers half the time, but a vehicle of paid-for information?“Indeed, there’s a growing distrust of traditional media advertising,” says Harry Hugo, cofounder at The Goat Agency, Europe’s leading influencer agency, which claims to be growing at a rate of 600 per cent\u0026nbspa year.“Just look at the rise in ad blockers, investigations into media transparency and big networks like WPP struggling. Influencers can be one of the most trusted, and therefore highest converting, information sources for people.”\u0026nbspAlso, we jeremiahs just don’t get the craft and graft that goes into an influencer’s brand persona, adds Florencia Lujani, influencer marketing manager at agency We Are Social London.“People struggle to see why brands would pay money to partner with influencers for something which appears relatively simple,” she says. “But it takes time and effort, talent, passion and commitment.”\u0026nbspAnd even the thorny issue of disclosure –\u0026nbspthat is, whether you should know what someone is being paid to promote –\u0026nbspis a smaller issue than is often supposed, says Svirskis. “Influencers are very compliant of requirements to disclose and are often represented by an influencer agency.”There is tremendous value in influencer marketing. However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls outMost importantly of all, influencers make money for clients. Currently, the average ROI of influencer marketing is £7 back for every £1 spent, says Amelia Neate of Influencer Champions.\u0026nbspSo,\u0026nbspdo you have to be pretty? “It’s definitely not reserved for those with looks,” says Svirskis. “The cheesy smiles are long gone.” It’s about style and tone, he says, and as the industry matures it’s moving beyond lifestyle products like travel, beauty and fashion to finance, automotive –\u0026nbspeven dog food.“There are new influencers emerging every day, in every single vertical,” says Lujani. They’re marshalling themselves into communities: mummy bloggers, healthy eaters, sports fans – why, possibly even news organisations.\u0026nbspWith the maturation of the influencer world comes a shakeout: Influencer 2.0, if you will. Sheer numbers don’t matter so much anymore.\u0026nbspThe smart talk is now about engagement and micro-influencers,\u0026nbspthose with fewer than 100,000 followers and possibly as low as 5,000, but with proper peer recognition.\u0026nbspYouTuber Alfie Deyes came under fire for his recent video, ‘How I lived off £1 for a day’ (YouTubePointlessBlogVlogs)“Data shows that influence by measure of engagement actually increases as the audience size reduces,” says Svirskis. In a hedge-betting strategy, brands now prefer to work with 50 micro-influencers rather than one mega-influencer, and brands are taking influencer management in-house as influencer marketing moves into the mainstream.If children are obese then blame food manufacturers, not ZoellaInvestigation promised into Trump campaign data firmThree arrested after Facebook group raid cannabis field – only to Sexist men who abuse women on Facebook and Twitter are compensating“Most new industries go through periods of turbulence as they form foundations,” says Svirskis, who thinks that many of today’s influencers will become tomorrow’s creative directors and entrepreneurs.He has a point.

Of these, 1,014 were born in Jamaica, 207 in Barbados, 93 in India, 88 in Grenada, 85 in Trinidad and Tobago and 638 were from other countries.Some 584 people have so far been granted citizenship through the Windrush scheme.The department is only in touch with 14 people who were wrongly deported, and no details have been given about their nationalities or whether any of them had been allowed to return to the UK.

That is why we have put in place additional safeguards and put a temporary pause in the proactive sharing of Home Office data with other organisations, including banks and building societies, for the purpose of controlling access to services.\u0026nbsp“Data on people over 30 have been excluded from sharing to make absolutely sure that members of the Windrush generation are not inadvertently affected.

number of crop marks have appeared, sometimes showing the presence of buried remains that have lain unnoticed for decades or, in the case of the new discoveries, for centuries.Langstone, Newport, south Wales (RCAHMWSWNS)In hot weather, crop marks expose the presence of things like historic buildings or burial mounds\u0026nbspbecause the grass or crops above them grow differently compared to plants in the surrounding soil.A buried ditch that once ringed a\u0026nbsphill fort\u0026nbspwill collect more underground water and nutrients, so the plants above it will grow taller and greener while the hot weather parches all the neighbouring vegetation.\u0026nbspThe underground remains of a wall, meanwhile, will have drier and poorer soil above it, producing shorter and browner plants.Ms Barker explained that the differences are more noticeable in the kind of prolonged hot weather that can affect even normally hardy greenery like grass.\u0026nbspWhich means that when the rain comes, the crop marks vanish again. \u0026nbsp“It’s a frantic race against time and the weather,” said Ms Barker.\u0026nbsp“There is just this window of opportunity, and then, according to the forecast, in the next couple of days the rain will come and it will all be lost again – the outlines will start disappearing before your eyes.”But even though the rain is coming, Ms Barker said the discoveries already made would produce great advances in archaeological knowledge, once the aerial images had been examined and the newly discovered features had been investigated at ground level.fortlet whose remains have lain hidden beneath a field near Magor, south Wales, for centuries (RCAHMWSWNS)She said: “We have found a Roman fortlet which will allow us to learn more about where the garrisons were and how the Roman conquest progressed.\u0026nbspWe have found an early medieval cemetery from maybe the eighth or ninth century, with the potential to tell us more about the period that used to be called the Dark Ages. \u0026nbsp“At the known sites, we have seen more and more things come out as it has got drier and drier.”Elsewhere in the UK, emerging crop marks have given archaeologists another look at the outlines of Venta Icenorum, the Romano-British predecessor of Norwich, which was first discovered when the RAF aeroplanes flew over it in the summer of 1928.Gawthorpe\u0026nbspHall (Lancashire CouncilSWNS)The heat has also allowed the outlines of a “ghost garden” to emerge at Gawthorpe Hall near Burnley, Lancashire. \u0026nbspDesigned by Sir Charles Barry in the 1850s, the garden was covered up after the Second World War.\u0026nbspNow the exceptionally hot weather has allowed National Trust staff to see previously unnoticed features that may actually be from gardens that predated the work of Sir Charles, at a site which has been built on since the 14th century.Long-lost North American Viking settlement was in CanadaBin lorry melts into road as hottest day of year forecast for UKMs Barker said: “The heat has allowed us to do things over a huge area and in a time frame that no amount of digging or ground radar surveys could have achieved, unless you had an unlimited budget and were willing to go slightly mad prospecting in hundreds of farmers’ fields on a hunch or nothing.“I think it will add a huge amount to our knowledge.”The heatwave has also allowed the public to discover their own crop marks revealing everything from wartime Anderson shelters to Bronze Age cremation sites.The result has been a widespread sharing of discoveries on social media.So

UK officials in Brussels say they have now have no plans to bring forward new proposals on the border, having proposed a solution to it last month.\u0026nbspThe EU raised serious concerns about that temporary customs plan at the time, including its time-limited nature and the lack of regulatory alignment, which would lead to border checks.But on Thursday British diplomats said they believed the new white paper on the future relationship would change the “dynamic” of talks and see Brussels look at their previous proposal in a new light.Brussels officials close to talks expressed doubt that this would be the case.The European Commission is understood to be working on revising its own Northern Ireland backstop plan, which Britain has rejected. Theresa May has said that “no UK prime minister” could agree to it because it entails customs checks inside the UK, between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.As Ms May’s cabinet met at Chequers last Friday, European Commission chief negotiator Michel Barnier urged the UK government to think again\u0026nbspand suggested the issue should be “de-dramatised”. But senior cabinet sources have said that even those in favour of a softer Brexit in the PM’s inner circle would reject the plan. The DUP, on which Ms May relies for a majority in the House of Commons, has also said it would not accept the policy.The European parliament’s Brexit steering group said it welcomed the new white paper as “a step towards establishing a new relationship between the UK and the EU”.But it added: “The Brexit steering group reiterated that negotiating a new relationship with the UK post-Brexit is conditional on an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU on the basis of a withdrawal agreement.\u0026nbsp“It reconfirmed the parliament’s position expressed in its resolutions that it will not consent to a withdrawal agreement, including a transition period, without a credible ‘back-stop’ provision for the Northern IrelandIreland border to prevent a hard border and safeguard the integrity of the single market, faithfully reflecting the commitments entered into in the joint report of 8 December 2017.\u0026nbspBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspMr Afwerki then travelled across the capital in a large motorcade as people wearing T-shirts with photos of the two leaders cheered. The leaders later met one-on-one, with a smiling Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspleaning towards\u0026nbspMr Afwerki under a wall hung with their portraits.The visit comes a month after Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspsurprised people by fully accepting a peace deal that ended a two-year border war between the two countries. Ethiopia and Eritrea have not had diplomatic ties since the war began in 1998, with Mr Ahmed\u0026nbsphimself fighting in a town that remains contested today, and the countries have skirmished since then in one of Africa’s longest-running conflicts.Mr Ahmed’s chief of staff, Fitsum Arega, said on Twitter that the visit aims to “further deepen efforts to bring about lasting peace.” He shared photos of the leaders’ meeting and said Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwas “very warmly received” by Mr Afwerki.“Our two nations share a history and bond like no other,” he said. “We can now overcome two decades of mistrust and move in a new direction.”Ethiopia’s foreign ministry called the visit “part of efforts to normalise relations with Eritrea” and said Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwas expected to talk with Eritrea’s leadership about “how to mend fences”.One Eritrean diplomat, its ambassador to Japan Estifanos Afeworki, said on Twitter that “no leader has received such a warm welcome like today in Asmara in the history of Eritrea”.Ethiopians expressed welcome shock at the meeting, which was shown live by Ethiopia’s state TV.“Historic ... the beginning of the end. The glass ceiling has been broken,” one resident, Shewit Wudassie, wrote on Facebook. Another Facebook user, Djphat Su, wrote: “Am I dreaming or what?”The decision to fully accept the peace deal was the biggest and most surprising reform yet announced by Ethiopia’s 42-year-old prime minister, who took office in April and quickly set off a wave of reforms, freeing journalists and opposition figures from prison, opening up the state-run economy and unblocking hundreds of websites after years of anti-government protests demanding more freedoms.World news in picturesUS President Donald Trump and Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg attend a bilateral breakfast ahead of the NATO Summit in BrusselsThe last four Thai Navy SEALs come out safely after completing the rescue mission inside a cave where 12 boys and their soccer coach have been trapped since June 23, in Mae Sai, Chiang Rai province, northern Thailand.

Frontex runs an operation off the coast of Italy that works closely with the local coast guard.The EU missions have helped rescue thousands of refugees\u0026nbspat sea, all of whom were disembarked in Italy. Spokespeople at Frontex and Sophia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Italy has so far refused to take back any migrants stopped at the German border.“Before receiving even one asylum seeker from another European country, we want to see a precise commitment – giving the timetable, costs, means, men and resources –\u0026nbspon how the EU plans to help us defend our external borders,” Mr Salvini said last week.Aid groups and United Nations’ agencies on Friday asked Italy open its ports to rescue ships because the policy could have a high human cost. More migrants could die at sea, or they could be trapped indefinitely in inhumane detention centres, they said.On Sunday, Mr Salvini said the previous government had agreed to welcome migrants rescued by ships participating in the EU sea missions.Mr Salvini said: “With our government, the music has changed and will change”.This comes after a rescue boat carrying 60 refugees arrived in Barcelona last week after being turned away by Italy and Malta.The mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, came to the ship’s rescue when she, with permission from the Spanish government, told the crew of the vessel that it could dock.\u0026nbspThe boat, which was said to have had five women, a nine-year-old and four teenagers on board, was turned away by Mr Salvini.He said the rescue boat “can forget about arriving in an Italian port” and then suggested the boat should dock in Malta which he claimed was the nearest port.Additional reporting by ReutersEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

All French parties are entitled to money in proportion to the number of votes it receives.The party, which recently changed its name from National Front to National Rally in an attempt to distance itself from racist and antisemitic associations, has long suffered from financial problems.In 2014 it took a loan from a Russian bank, saying it had been refused credit in France.

The shore is lined with hostile Remainers. As for the voters — the 17.4million “thick and ignorant racists” who backed Brexit in 2016 — who cares about them?Britain is now offering a peace deal to Brussels which, however we gloss it over, stinks of surrender.To quote Boris Johnson, who backed it: “You can’t polish a turd.”This is not a White Paper. It is a White Flag.We will have a “Common Rule Book” — written by the EU and imposed by the European Court of Justice.These rules will torpedo any trade deal outside the EU. Immigration continues under a scheme which by any other name means free movement.This is not even Brexit In Name Only. It is zombie EU membership — and the UK is the zombie with no say in rule-making and paying through the nose for rule-taking.Of course, we need to be realistic. Compromises are inevitable since we made no plans for No Deal.Thanks to Mrs May’s election horror, the sums do not add up for Brexit. Remainers rule in the Tory Party, the House of Commons and the Lords.Without a heavyweight leader, Brexit Tories know they cannot raise the numbers to oust Mrs May. A failed challenge would only boost her new-found confidence and authority.Michael Gove and others argue a future Brexit Prime Minister — Mr Gove, for instance — could finish the job once we are legally Out.In fact, Britain tends to keep its treaty ­promises.We can’t even count on EU bully Michel Barnier to stir up a revolt. He and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will probably accept Mrs May’s deal, with a few tweaks, because they are effectively its co-authors.The Rule Book will keep us in line — no ­separate trade deals, no sovereign control over our borders, no escaping the ECJ.Brexit Cabinet ministers must accept some of the blame. They failed to force Mrs May when they had a chance to prepare for a No Deal Brexit. That failure instantly handed victory to the Remainers and to Brussels.Should we one day choose to make a clean break, we will face harsh “consequences” — what Boris vividly calls “punishment beatings”.But the biggest punishment beating will come from voters.If the Tories don’t care about the 17.4million who want Brexit, they will be made to care.Constitutional lawyer Martin Howe, a Tory QC, warns we are entering “a worst-of-all-worlds black hole Brexit where Britain is stuck ­permanently as a vassal state.”The fragile Tory lead over Labour has just evaporated. Almost 40 per cent of voters think the PM has betrayed the 2016 referendum result.Tories might not switch directly to Labour, but they won’t forget. If only a small percentage sit out the next Election, Jezza will be our first Marxist PM.Michael Gove and Home Secretary Sajid Javid tried to put a shine on a deal they claim is the “best available”.And they didn’t even have the decency to hold their noses.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are highly doubtful but we hope he’s right.To us, a proper Brexit, which would have made us a freer, richer country and was backed by a 17.4 million majority, has been given up without a fight.Remainer Tories MUST study the polls showing their party could now face an election wipeout as their core voters desert them. Their sliding ratings will go into freefall if they vote alongside Labour this month to keep us in an EU customs union ­— a total negation of Brexit.If Brexit is further watered down to meaninglessness, the Tories are finished.MICHAEL Fallon is right to try to stop ­taxpayers’ cash being used to reopen cases from the Troubles.Our ageing veterans live in fear of arrest for difficult decisions taken decades ago in a war zone.This witch-hunt MUST end.OUR boys’ World Cup success is set to cause a baby boom as randy fans celebrate by romping.If the Three Lions deliver us the World Cup there will be a BOOM in certain names, too.Expect some Harrys and Gareths.

Hunt refused to be shunted aside and ultimately secured the promise of another £20billion a year in NHS cash. He has earned a promotion.His replacement Matt Hancock has an enormous brief to learn rapidly — but he too is highly capable.And Leave-backing Dominic Raab could make a terrific, energetic Brexit Secretary if Mrs May lets him. She sidelined his predecessor David Davis for her Remainer aide Oliver Robbins. He must NOT steamroller Raab too.Raab believes in rallying behind Mrs May’s Chequers compromise offer to Brussels.

But in practice, how does that work given that most sexual encounters are one-on-one with no witnesses?She can still say yes at the time then later pretend she didn’t and falsely accuse him of rape.And equally, he could pretend she had consented when, in fact, she had screamed no.Perhaps we are moving to an era when all young people will feel compelled to temporarily stall a moment of passion so they can film the consenting “yes” on their mobile phones? Or failing that, perhaps have a solicitor present.ACTRESS Paula Williamson wed “Britain’s most violent prisoner” Charles Bronson last November and said she looked forward to him getting out so they could enjoy a normal marriage.Yet just two months later he allegedly attacked the deputy governor of HMP Wakefield and now, just before appearing via video link at Leeds magistrates court, he tried to take his guards hostage in his cell.Hmmmm. Something tells me that – after spending 42 years inside – 65-year-old Charlie boy has become institutionalised and doesn’t actually want to come out, hence the litany of violent episodes that keep him in trouble and constantly embarrass his trusting wife.It gives a whole new meaning to the term blushing bride.NEW research shows that the ability to ward off fear and unhappiness is a skill that improves markedly with age.An American neuroscientist says the reaction of the old and the young to, say, the imminent results of an election were significantly different.That’s because, when you’ve seen a few governments come and go, we of a certain age eventually realise they’re all as useless as each other and whatever we say or do to try to change that has no effect at all.But if it turns out to be a France v England final, I may be heading home sooner than expected.FORMER Radio 1 DJ “Diddy” David Hamilton has weighed in to the #MeToo debate with his recollection of his Seventies heyday, saying: “We didn’t go around forcing ourselves on women.“It sounds conceited to say it but we didn’t have to because a lot of women were forcing themselves on us.”Meanwhile, Kinks frontman Sir Ray Davies reveals: “A world-famous groupie once threw me out because I was too kind.”A reminder, if needed, that not all men are b******s and not all women are innocent victims.And if further proof is required, look no further than some of the predatory females stalking their male prey on Love Island each night.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Will we be able to sign our own trade deals? And will the UK be outside the jurisdiction of the European Court?I’m very pleased to say the answers are very simple: yes, yes and yes.First, it will mean a genuine end to freedom of movement.No longer will people be allowed to arrive here from across Europe on the off-chance that they might find a job.We will always welcome the skilled professionals who help our country thrive, from doctors and nurses to engineers and entrepreneurs but for the first time in decades, we will have full control of our borders.And it will be the UK, not Brussels, that decides who should be allowed to live and work here.Second, we will have our own completely independent trade policy, our own seat at the World Trade Organisation and the ability to set tariffs and strike trade deals with whoever we please.British goods and services are in huge demand internationally, so it’s no surprise that countries are queuing up to make trade deals with us after we leave the EU.We are having good discussions with countries we would aim to sign trade deals with, including the US, as I will discuss with President Trump when he arrives in the UK on Thursday.Third, our plan will take back control of our laws.We will no longer be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union, instead, British judges in British courts will rule on our laws.And while we will commit to have common rules with the EU on things like exhaust emissions and food safety, Parliament will have to agree these rules.Put simply, such EU rules will no longer automatically and directly apply in the UK — Parliament will have a say.It’s clear to me that this is the right Brexit deal for Britain, although there are, of course, some alternatives.The EU’s preferred option — a standard, off-the-shelf trade deal for Great Britain with Northern Ireland in the customs union and parts of the single market — would break up our country.The other option the EU suggests, a combination of EEA membership with continued membership of the customs union, would not be Brexit at all.We would have no control over immigration, no ability to strike our own trade deals, and would still be liable for vast annual payments to Brussels.And while we must prepare for the possibility of leaving without a deal, I’m clear that the best outcome — for both the UK and the EU — is a deal based on the ideas we are setting out on Thursday.As for Labour, they are opening the door to a second referendum — ignoring the decision taken by the country and making it harder to get a good deal.Only our Brexit deal for Britain truly respects the will of the British people.And, as Prime Minister, it is the Brexit I am determined to deliver.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sometimes that’s the only way to sort stuff out.That’s what the US President Donald Trump is doing right now with his Nato allies. And it’s a mighty big sledgehammer.In the firing line is Angela Merkel, of Germany. And the other countries that are backsliding on their commitment to the civilised world’s safety and security.Trump thinks — and he’s right — that for far too long Europe and Canada have not been paying their share for our military defence. The Germans pay nowhere near enough. But even worse are the Belgians.Incredibly, Canada, led by that simpering idiot Justin Trudeau, spends scarcely more than one per cent of its GDP on defence. One of the richest countries on the world. The Spanish, as you might expect, pay four fifths of sod all. LESS than one per cent.Trump is telling them all they cannot depend on America any more. The US spends 3.5 per cent of its enormous GDP on the military. Much more than any other country in Nato.And as a consequence, Western Europe (and Canada) has been safe for decades. It was US military spending which led to the end of the Cold War and ultimately the break up of the “evil empire”, the Soviet Union.So where do we stand in all this? We spend more per head than our European partners, Estonia and Greece excepted. But still just the bare minimum of two per cent of GDP.And for years now we’ve been reducing our defence budgets. Cutting our armed services to the bone. Take the Royal Navy. In the 36 years since the Falklands War the number of warships we possess has reduced by a staggering 74 per cent.We now have a Navy which is 25 per cent smaller than it was in 1650 — when we had only a tenth of our current population. We were once a great maritime power. Today we’d do well to win a naval battle against Luxembourg — and that’s landlocked.Military spending does not create wars. It does the opposite. It makes them much, much less likely.The Falklands War against Argentina occurred because we had cut our spending on the Navy to the point where we no longer defended the far-flung islands. The Argies saw their chance and invaded.Luckily we still had a big enough Navy to respond and win back the freedom for the Falklanders. We couldn’t even dream of doing the same thing now.Meanwhile, the RAF has seen its number of combat aircraft cut by more than one third in less than ten years. We now have just 149. You probably saw them during the flypast on Tuesday, if you live in London. That was the lot. That’s it.The first duty of any government is to protect its citizens. The US does that and we should do so, too — never mind the backsliding Europeans.The world is no less of a dangerous place than it was 30 or 60 years ago. Trump has got this absolutely right.NAZ SHAH is a Labour MP. Not so long ago she was suspended from the party.She had agreed with the foul and offensive idea that Israel should be “relocated” to the USA.Shah also compared the Israeli government to Adolf Hitler. Now she’s back in the party – and guess what? She’s been given a front bench role. As shadow equalities minister!They certainly take anti-Semitism seriously in Corbyn’s Labour Party. Surely there cannot be any Jewish people left in the country who would vote for this racist rabble.I’VE seen many remarkable things in my life. I’ve watched my team, Millwall, play in an FA Cup Final.I’ve seen the sun set at lunchtime in the Arctic Circle. I’ve talked to Arab terrorists, American presidents and famous pop singers. But there’s one thing I’ve never done.I have never, ever, in my entire life, met anyone who liked Danny Dyer. I was at party last week with people from all walks of life, and Danny’s name came up.The reaction was immediate. “Oh Christ, not that d**k . . .I think one woman even went behind a bush to be sick. Anyway, just thought I’d mention that.Maybe one day I will meet someone who likes Danny Dyer. And my life will be complete.IMPORTANT news story. Emily Ratajkowski is on holiday.We know this because she has very kindly sent the world some photographs of her break.But I will make sure to send back to The Sun some snaps of me lying on a sunbed with my a*se in the air, or posing in something alluring by a pool with a big pout on my chops. Enjoy.The EUS chief negotiator, Michel barnier wit Jeane-Claude Juncker - and the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel.And that, frankly, is all you need to knowBEST news of the week, maybe of the year, was the heroic rescue of those young Thai kids from a flooded cave complex.It was an enormous, dangerous and brilliantly executed plan to get them out.And now, guess what? Hollywood is going to make a film about it all.YOU know the score, I don’t.All of my Wednesday is spent in a state of mental torture.What if we don’t crock Modric early on? When’s Harry going to start scoring again?I know the World Cup has been great fun. But does anybody actually ENJOY watching England – unless they’re 3-0 up? It’s too terrifying.Anyway, apparently there is a sharp rise in the birth rate when England win important football matches.Blokes take to their beds filled with passion.Me too, as it happens. And I like to relive the match by providing a loud commentary, in the manner of Jonathan Pearce, while I’m on the job.“Oh, just look at Liddle! He’s found a way through – AND IT’S IN!”ITALY has just turned away another ship full of migrants. It had been chartered by one of the many leftie charities bobbing about in the Med.Isn’t it time these mor- ons were prosecuted for people trafficking? Migrants now set off expecting to be picked up.

So he had gagged me with a condom.I was too young, thank God, to know what a condom tasted like. It was so inappropriate. And what the heck was a casting director doing with a condom in his pocket?Sorvino was one of the first actresses to go public with allegations against Weinstein.In the New Yorker magazine in October last year, she said that Weinstein had chased her around a room after he started massaging her shoulders in a Toronto hotel in 1995.Following the flood of allegations against Weinstein, Lord Of The Rings director Sir Peter Jackson revealed the producer had waged a smear campaign against the actress after she rejected his advances.Weinstein told the filmmaker Sorvino was a nightmare to work with, leading to her name being taken off his casting list.In December, Sorvino, who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for Woody Allen’s 1995 comedy Mighty Aphrodite, said she burst out crying after reading Sir Peters revelations.She said: There it is, confirmation that Harvey Weinstein derailed my career, something I suspected but was unsure. Thank you Peter Jackson for being honest. Im just heartsick.Weinstein, 66, has been charged with sexual offences including rape and is awaiting trial in New York."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000419851954.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brutal moment man is flogged eighty times 10 years after drinking at iran wedding when he was 14","story":"A disturbing photo showed the man tied to a tree in Niazmand Square, Kashmar, as a hooded official flogged him in full view of locals.The crowd watched as the whip tore away his flesh, leaving his body an unhealthy shade of dark red.Amnesty International condemned the punishment which was carried out for a crime committed when he was just 14.Spokesman Philip Luther said: The circumstances of this case are absolutely shocking.

Jordan seemed a decent lad, polite and well mannered, but we rarely saw him.He was shut away in the house and was never out on the streets messing around with the other kids.”The neighbour added: “You could often hear screaming and shouting and one of my mates who visited Dawn said the house was filthy, cram packed with junk and like a pig sty.”Jordan died of malnutrition, immobility and infection-riddled sores on June 30, 2016.Newly-released photos show the victim - who would have celebrated his 21st birthday last week - enjoying himself at home.In one image unveiled by West Yorkshire Police bespectacled Jordan, sporting a black beanie, appears like any other normal teen and is captured with a huge grin on his fourteenth birthday in his lounge.Another picture shows a relaxed and healthy looking Jordan, aged 16, engrossed in playing on Playstation Portable, while a third snap shows a chubby-faced Jordan, aged 14.But within several years of the images being taken Jordan had wasted away at the hands of his wicked family.In one of the last photographs taken of the teen and released by his dad Steven Burling - who is estranged from Dawn - he can be seen holding up his shirt - with his ribs clearly seen in his starved state.Another photograph reveals the squalid conditions the young man was forced to live in before his death, with the living room piled high with rubbish.But despite the young man desperately malnourished, the court was told the home had three refrigerators or freezers, all stocked with food.The family also revealed their shock at discovering Dawn Cranston had given birth to another baby boy who died - hiding his body in a rucksack at their Leeds home.Police had found the babys remains after searching the house, with Dawn admitting before the trial to concealing a birth by hiding her newborns remains in a bedroom cupboard.She told the court she was completely unaware she was pregnant until she began to feel something really heavy in her body.She gave birth within an hour and began to panic as nobody else knew she was expecting.Describing how she did not call for help despite other people being in the house, she tearfully said: If I remember rightly, I dont think its eyes were open. I heard no noise, nothing. There were no signs at all of life.She claimed that she had intended to bury the remains, but did not get round to it and was unable to as there were always other people around.She admitted a charge of endeavouring to conceal a birth at the start of her trial last month.Jordans sister Abigail Burling, 25, was cleared of manslaughter but guilty of causing or allowing the death of a vulnerable person and jailed for 18 months.During the four week trial, prosecutor Nicholas Lumley QC had told the jury: The fault lies with each of the accused.What met the eyes of the paramedics was a shocking and disturbing scene.Jordan was lying, utterly helpless, on an inflatable mattress in a cluttered living room.He was little more than skin and bones, he weighed 37kg, less than six stones.He wore a soiled nappy under some pyjamas.The expert dietitian said they had never seen such malnutrition in 26 years and likened the condition of the body to that found in WWII extermination camps.His heart stopped, his life could not be saved.He he expired in that living room.Dawn Cranston already admitted to concealing the birth of a child by secretly disposing of a body.Detective Chief Inspector Nicola Bryar, of West Yorkshire Police Homicide and Major Enquiry Team today said the teens death was completely unnecessary.She said: We are in no doubt that Jordan would still be alive today if those convicted of allowing him to literally waste away and die in front of them had sought the medical attention he so obviously needed.Why they chose to ignore the terrible state he was in has not been explained in any reasonable way and remains something only they know.It is almost beyond belief that his mother, grandmother and sister, who should have had his best interests at heart, would allow him to slowly decline towards a death that could so easily have been avoided.Today, dad Steven said he felt betrayed, having never known about the baby.The statement read: As a family, we feel we have been denied any knowledge of that baby boy’s existence.The family said they now wanted to be able to grieve in peace.In a final tribute to Jordan, his family said: Steven and the family will always remember Jordan having a bubbly and chatty personality.Jordans dad Steven had previously shared a statement in court, read out by his sister Susan Burling.In the devastating tribute, Steven told the court: I just cant understand why all these horrific things have happened to me and my family.I have lost all my children and I don’t know how I’m supposed to deal with all this trauma.I don’t know how I’m going to grieve for them or rebuild my life."},{"url":null,"title":"hannibal oceja anthony loreana martinez starved child","story":"Hannibal Oceja suffered a fatal cardiac arrest in February, weighing just five pounds.That is one pound, seven ounces less than Hannibal weighed when he was born.A coroner ruled he had died of failure to thrive, undernourishment and insufficient fluid intake.The boy’s parents Anthony Oceja, 30, and Loreana Martinez, 25, were charged with murder on Tuesday.First responders who treated Hannibal reported that his “bones could easily be seen, his spinal cord appeared as if it was about to poke out of his skin and his rib cage could easily be seen.”A paramedic who turned up at the couple’s home in Las Vegas, Nevada, even had to ask if the baby was five weeks or five months old, the Las Vegas Review Journal reported.Martinez insisted that her son was a “perfectly healthy” on multiple occasions and claimed her two other children had “developed small”, according to the report.She denied that she was asked by a doctor to supplement Hannibal’s breast milk last December, and insists she breastfed multiple times a day.The mum also disputed an arrest report which said she missed several doctor’s appointments for Hannibal in the weeks leading up to his death.Social services did not investigate the family before the boy died.Along with murder his parents have been charged with abuse of their two year-old daughter, and three year-old son, who have been taken into care.The couple also face an animal cruelty charge over alleged neglect of their two dogs."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000419568628.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"government approves 21st century fox buy sky rupert murdoch","story":"The green light comes as bidding for the broadcaster hots up.On Wednesday evening, US cable group Comcast tabled a £14.75 bid for Sky, valuing it at £26 billion.Yesterday’s UK government clearance  after a 19 month wait eliminates a critical obstacle to Fox’s pursuit of Sky -

It’s about celebrities improving their image.”Oh, but what record-breaking names they’d assembled.Robbie, Adele, Elton, Ed Sheeran, Coldplay and Stormzy, were just a few of those who didn’t attend.Blue, Coleen Nolan, Amber Davies, from last year’s Love Island, UB40, Kimberley Walsh and Tony Hadley, on the other hand, were all involved, as was JLS’s Aston Merrygold, right, who said, on behalf of the NHS, he was: “Happy to clear my diary.”So we thank him and whoever covered the shift at Domino’s.Job demarcation, though, among the celebs, was a bit vague. A few just seemed to have backing track duties, like Kimberley Walsh who was given the line “What would you do if I sang out of tune?” (IF?)Some were enrolled for the full, record-breaking, Abbey Road finale, while others went on recruitment drives at UK hospitals, where Tony unearthed “the singing ambulanceman”, and Sara set her sights on Debbie “who’s pouring custard on a spotted Dick” — in the staff canteen, rather than the Infectious Diseases Unit.Eulogies to the great NHS god, though, were compulsory and delivered with a glassy-eyed, lip-quivering intensity that has become a very familiar sight these past few months.Good intentions, as we know, though, pave the road to hell. And so it proved with Wednesday’s Big Singalong Live, which kicked off with a parp of a klaxon, from Ashley, and Sara screaming: “Can we now please break that record.”Perhaps we can put what followed down to the swirling p***storm, in North London, or the lack of practice time — they only had six weeks — but, dear Lord in heaven — Russell Crowe didn’t unleash this much hell in Gladiator.Missed cues, frozen screens, flat voices, Tony Hadley giving it the big ’un, on the Abbey Road zebra crossing, with his “woh-oh ohhhs”.Seven thousand drunk Millwall fans chanting: “You’re going home in a London ambulance” could not have been much less unco-ordinated, but would undoubtedly have delivered an equally powerful message about the NHS.Salvation, though, was on hand in the form of Sara Cox.“The results are in and . . . (drum roll).“We almost made it, but it looks like the weather may have rained on our parade. We didn’t break the record.” A MASTERCLASS in scheduling, editing and continuity, from Channel 5, on Thursday night, that began with the very chirpy announcement: “We’ll find out What Happened to Josef Fritzl after brand new Nando’s, A PERi PERi Big Success . . . ”Which isn’t the first thing I associate Josef with, to be perfectly honest with you.

It got me right on the crotch.We ended the day by sitting at anchorage just off Mousehole, finishing up dinner and getting in an early sleep before we move back to the GPS point at 4.30 am for the next swim at 6.00am.:: The eve of the swimYou are either a pioneer or a follower you can\u0027t be both.

If you don\u0027t know something is possible, you worry about it.I\u0027m about to embark on a swim with significant risks and consequences - financial, reputational and environmental. So there hasn\u0027t been a night in the last month that I haven\u0027t woken up.A few nights ago I was using the worry hours to plan, and remembered something Mike Tyson once said: \"Everyone\u0027s got a plan until they get punched in the mouth.\" I have a plan to try and swim 10km per day. But when I swim into my first bloom of jellyfish, that plan will become flexible.Admiral Stockdale was an American pilot who was shot down in Vietnam and spent eight years in a POW camp. He said that the people who survived had two important qualities.First, they always believed they would be freed. Second - and this is the paradox - they had no optimism. Because the people who did have optimism - the people who hoped they would be free by Easter, then by Thanksgiving, then by Christmas, and had those hopes dashed over and over again - those people didn\u0027t survive. The people who survived were the ones who confronted the brutal reality of their situation.I have to face some brutal facts when I look at the chart of our 560km swim route. This is the longest swim anyone has ever done, adhering to Channel Rules in water this low temperature. I honestly don\u0027t know how I\u0027m going to do this. But I do believe I\u0027ll see the white cliffs of Dover. So that\u0027s the paradox that\u0027s going through my mind.The swimming is only part of the challenge. We\u0027ve also had to co-ordinate with sponsors, raise funds for the expedition, recruit the right people for the team, and deal with the media... all the while juggling private lives with unexpected domestic crises. As if all that wasn\u0027t enough, after six months of campaign planning and preparation, we learned that Donald Trump is coming to London on the day I start swimming. We certainly hadn\u0027t planned on such a big media story distracting from our message.Because the message is the reason I am doing this swim. The truth is we are failing our oceans. And it\u0027s only through bold and courageous action that we\u0027re going to be able to protect them properly. \"Piecemeal\" protection is not going to safeguard our seas. We need an enormous shift in business and government and the public to be able to do this.There are challenges ahead.

The European Union Commission President, 63, had to be helped by the presidents of Finland and Ukraine had to prop him up. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte also stepped in to help the stumbling Commission chief at the event in Brussels on Wednesday night. Mr Juncker has said he suffers from sciatica that sometimes affects his movements. A video of the wobbly Eurocrat emerged after it was tweeted out by a far right German politician.    Martin Reichardt, from the Alternative for Germany party, tweeted that several people needed to support the EC President. And he said that Mr Juncker was seemingly too drunk to stand.  He called Mr Juncker\u0027s appearance shameful. Dutch PM Mark Rutte, who helped Mr Juncker, told Belgian news outlet VRT: “As far as I know, he [Juncker] has no serious health problems, but he has had a back problem for a while.” The Eurocrat denied claims of alcoholism in a 2016 interview where he guzzled four glasses of champagne. He said: “You think I’d still be in office if I was having cognac for breakfast?  “It really makes me sad and it has even led my wife to question if I lie to her, as I do not drink when I’m home.” Revealing past health problems, he added: “I have a balance problem with my left leg that requires me to grab the rail when on a staircase. “This problem goes back to a serious car accident.

The Ministry of Defence sold the married quarters to Annington Property Limited in 1996 and agreed to rent most back for up to two centuries. Unused properties are meant to be sold and profits split – but some 10,000 are standing empty while rent is paid on them. And rents could rocket from 2021, depending on fresh negotiations with military chiefs. The Commons Public Accounts Committee said the deal, covering 55,000 homes, has been “disastrous”, offering “no protection against the private firm making huge gains at taxpayers’ expense”.  MPs say the firm’s annual 13.4% return “is out of line with the limited risks Annington took on, fuelled by greater than forecast house price rises”.

Throughout school I was so overweight that when the boys found out I was playing Juliet in the school play none of them wanted to play Romeo and we had to get a girl to play the role. “I was 11-years-old, in Year Six and I heard all the boys say ‘no, I’m not doing it. It was pretty embarrassing.  “Secondary school was easier for me. I used my quick wit and humour to gain popularity and my weight didn’t feel like such a big deal anymore. “I slowly gained weight through the 10 years following until I had my daughter in 2009 when I hit 15st 2.5lb. My daughter’s christening photos sent me into shock. One day I had purchased a size 20 dress from Primark because I couldn’t find anything nice in my size. At 5ft 8, I suit being a little bigger but that was beyond crazy.  “I had sunk into a pattern of eating when I was tired, using my daughter as an excuse to not exercise. “I never exercised. I ate chocolate for breakfast, and I loved kebabs, crisps, chips and pizza – all the bad carbs! “I wanted to change. My mum was unfit and overweight and as much as I adored her, I wanted something different for my own daughter. I wanted her to be healthy.  After the birth of her daughter and her mum’s terminal cancer diagnosis Ceri decided to turn her life around and embraced a healthy lifestyle. She lost more than four stone, started to exercise, retrained professionally and landed her dream job at a hospital where she met her ‘soulmate’. “I never thought anyone would want to marry me but now I’m planning my dream wedding with my perfect partner and I’m so happy, said Ceri.  Her real life Romeo, Lewis, an electrician, strode into her life one day to fix a fan in the office. “At first I thought he was grumpy but then I noticed that he was very good looking. So I glanced at his name badge and looked him up on Facebook. “I messaged him and said I thought he was very good looking, and embarrassingly he asked who I was. After a few messages I asked him out on a date and he said he’d think about it! “Then the next week he messaged me back and said he’d love to go on a date.  Recalling their first date together, Ceri said: We went to a country pub. We sat by the fire and chatted over a drink, it was amazing. When we were leaving he asked if I’d walk with him to the boot of his car. I wondered if he was going to murder me and stuff me in it! But when he opened it there was a huge bunch of flowers which he gave to me. “He told my daughter, Jasmine, months before he proposed that he was going to ask me to marry him. We’re so close it was torture for her not to tell me. Every time we passed a place she knew I wanted to get married in she’d say ‘Mummy, there’s something I really want to tell you but I can’t.’ “So I had an inkling that he might be thinking about it. Then we went on holiday together and I was sure he would ask me then. I made sure I looked proper nice every day but nothing happened. When we got home from the airport I was devastated. “Then weeks later we went to a restaurant in Dartmoor to celebrate our third year anniversary. When we got back we sat in the car for a while just chatting and enjoying the peace.  “He asked me to get him something from the glove compartment and there was a ring. He said ‘Ceri Poulton, will you marry me?’ “And I said ‘yes’ immediately before he could change his mind! “He really is amazing. If I die tomorrow I’ll die happy knowing that my daughter is well cared for. The couple will tie the knot surrounded by family and friends in a Christmas ceremony in November next year. I’ve been dress shopping but I haven’t decided exactly what I want yet. I tried on really tight fitting dresses which looked amazing but I love dancing and eating so I think I’ll go for something less restrictive like a princess style in the end.” Ceri\u0027s fairytale ending comes after months of hard work and determination to lose weight.  “In 2009 I saw a billboard outside the local church which advertised a Slimming World class. I decided to go and check it out and I’ve never looked back. “I steadily lost weight over the next two years, just by changing the way I was cooking, walking more and treating myself once a week after weigh-in so I wasn’t missing out.” Ceri found Slimming World a hugely supportive environment and the more targets she hit, the more she wanted to smash the next weight-loss goal. “Losing the first stone was slow. I still treated myself a lot and wasn’t really that bothered about it. But once I lost the first stone I realized I really wanted this.”  “By November 2012 I was crowned Slimming World Miss Slinky 2012 for my slimming group and reached my 4stone award. “Before this I couldn’t swim and I never really ran but now I take part in charity runs and swimathons – even though that means doggy-paddling through all those miles of water. “You only have one life and you’ve got to make the best of it.” Ceri has maintained her 4stone weight loss and almost won Slimming World’s Biggest Loser award – the most challenging one there is recently. I cried when I didn’t make it but maybe next year I’ll get it, she said. “I am currently trying to reach my 4.5st award in time for my wedding but after being at target for six years it is very difficult! I never allow myself to get wrapped up in dieting, I live my life and I love it. “Now I work out hard, my week consists of running, weights and three body balance classes a week. “I challenge my work friends to Race At Your Pace cycling and running challenges and I am constantly increasing my medal collection.  “I have about 15 medals from charity runs, I bought a medal holder for them which is in my room and every time I see it it motivates me to win more. “In 2016 I zip lined across Bournemouth Pier and drove Segways around Prague, things I never would have done before. “My daughter chooses salad and fruit over crisps and chocolate and she knows that in order to have a large treat we have to go for long walks or swim.

Children have been left crying with some bargain hunters even turned away from queuing before the shops opened this morning. The Build-a-Bear offer is precisely what it says - a child pays their age to create one of the popular teddies, for one day only. If you want to get a bear for your five-year-old child, you\u0027ll pay just \u0026pound5. If you\u0027re 25 years old, it\u0027ll cost you \u0026pound25. All bears are included in the deal and the minimum price for this offer is \u0026pound1 (even for those younger than a year old). But now stores are turning away customers because the demand is so high it has led to \u0027safety concerns\u0027 - with the police even reportedly called to some shops. Are you stuck in a Build-a-Bear queue? Email webnews@mirror  In Belfast, the store was closed amid claims a person was assaulted and police were called.  Belfast Live reports the store ran out of stock and a spokesperson for the company said the store was closed in the interest of the safety of our employees and our guests.  Police were also called to the store in Solihull\u0027s Touchwood shopping centre after reports of trouble in the giant queue.  Birmingham Live reports that officers were called following reports of a disturbance.  One mother even claimed to have witnessed shoppers throwing bears out of the store, into the crowds. West Midlands Police said they were called to the scene but no arrests were made.  Stores in Telford, Shropshire, Basingstoke, Hampshire and Sheffield, were forced to shut early amid safety fears. One mum was refused entrance when she tried to join the queue at the Build-a-Bear store in Meadowhall, Sheffield, despite arriving before the shop opened. She said: “We arrived around 9.45am, about 15 minutes before it was due to open. “The line was almost full length of one side of the shopping centre. “A member of staff told us to go home as we couldn’t join the line and it was up to a nine hour wait for people already waiting.” Devon Live is reporting that staff members are \u0027exhausted\u0027 as they did not anticipate it being so busy.     The store say demand has been \u0027unprecedented\u0027 leading to huge queues and even some reports of violence. Deborah, who had taken her month-old newborn tot Elsie to the shop in Malton, North Yorkshire, said: I just thought it would be something good to do and save some money. But I\u0027ve seen kids who should be in school with their mums queuing up to get a toy - I think it\u0027s wrong. Fiona O\u0027Reilly, 31, from Gateshead, arrived at the  Centre at 8.15am today in order to purchase bears for each of her four children. She was shocked by the hundreds of parents already queuing before the shop opened at 10am and feared there could be fights as parents argued in the queues. She said: It was complete madness I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if there were a few riots over this today. I managed to get there early and it took just over an hour for me to get all four bears. However, the queues are starting to get so long, and the store only has four staff making the bears, so I reckon people will be waiting all day. There\u0027s already people fighting in the queues!  Mum Kimberley Gray, 24, from Cardiff, said it would be worth the wait for her three-year-old daughter Lilly. It will be worth it because she\u0027ll be so happy, she said. Dawn Collard, 52, from Barry queued at the Cardiff store with seven children. Two are her grandchildren and the others are children she looks after as she is a childminder. She said: “I think it’s amazing. My bill should have been \u0026pound150 but I only paid \u0026pound27. I bought them for all the kids. They absolutely loved it.  Queues started building outside stores early and have now ballooned to such a scale some stores are telling customers not to join. One shopper, who didn’t want to be named, told Essex Live: “It’s so busy, the whole of the centre outside Mark and Spencer is queueing like a snake back and forth, pushchairs and children everywhere. The Lakeside staff have said that the people at the front of the queue have been there since 8am. Huge crowds have gathered outside the store in Maidstone and a queue with an estimated four hour waiting time is zig zagging down the high street, with the end reaching as far as Card Factory, as parents desperately try to nab a bargain for their child.    Mum Leonnie Braker was lucky enough to nab an early place in the queue at the Greenhithe shopping centre, and her one-year-old twins escaped with Star Wars themed bears. She told Kent Live:  I\u0027m pleased. Wouldn\u0027t have bothered if I\u0027d got there later. Just heard they only have 1800 bears and there are 1000 at least in queue and people have more than one kid with them.     Kate Lowe said: We got to Build-A-Bear at Intu Derby before 9am for Pay Your Age Day and there was a four-hour queue! I couldn\u0027t even see the end of it! We got donuts and went home. A parent, who didn’t want to be named, said: “We got here at 9am, three hours we’ve been queuing for and we’ve just reached the door to the shop. It’ll all be worth it when we see the children\u0027s faces though.”  Nick Scully, manager of the store told Derbyshire Live the store has sold several hundred bears. In Hull security staff took control and erected barriers to control the queues before refusing to let anyone else join and giving vouchers out that entitled the families to \u0026pound12 off their next bought item at the store. Staff said they thought around 500 people were queuing for the bears. A huge queuing is spiralling inside Manchester Arndale, which Rebecca Robinson has joined with her daughter Sophia. She said: I reckon there\u0027s around 1,000 people at least. I got told at Bristol there’s over 2,000 people waiting. They\u0027ve stopped people queuing for now because there are too many. Sharon Price John, president and chief executive officer of Build-A-Bear Workshop, said:  We have overwhelming data that indicates Build-A-Bear is synonymous with childhood, and nearly one-third of our sales are associated with birthdays. “We ‘heart’ birthdays at Build-A-Bear, so we’re hosting the Pay Your Age Day to launch our year-round ‘Count Your Candles’ offer for guests celebrating a birthday with us in stores - an experience we designed especially to commemorate birthdays in a memorable way.”  "},{"url":null,"title":"devoted couple who never spent","story":"NewsDevoted couple who have never spent a night apart celebrate 70 years of marriageAlbert and Phyllis Twinley, 95 and 91, met in 1946 while serving together with the Royal Corps of Signals\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByLouie Smith22:46, 12 JUL 2018NewsAlbert and Phyllis Twinley celebrated their platinum wedding anniversary this week with family and friends (Image: SWNS)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA devoted couple who have never spent a night apart are celebrating 70 years of marriage.

Many of those protesting Donald Trump\u0027s visit are excited to catch a glimpse of the blimp. As people are so obsessed with the huge balloon, online card and gift retailer, Moonpig UK, thought they\u0027d try and give the people what they want. Taking to Twitter, they posted an image of a man holding a miniature version of the baby Trump balloon. They captioned the photo: If we make a 100 of these baby #TrumpUKvisit balloons will you buy them?    It seemed like a great idea. But boy were they wrong, the tweet backfired- big time. Thousands responded to the image, complaining about the idea and vowing to never shop with Moonpig again. One user wrote: Brilliantly out-of-touch, you lunatics. Your company is f*****.  Another said: That\u0027s backfired. My family and I won\u0027t be using your company again... A third called it the worst PR disaster ever. One of the original balloon designers also got involved in the debate, saying that Moonpig were using the design without permission. They added that the designers weren\u0027t looking to profit from the balloon, so neither should Moonpig. The company responded to the uproar by telling people it was a \u0027joke\u0027 and apologising. A spokesman for Moonpig tweeted: We won\u0027t really be selling these, don\u0027t worry! We are just enormous fans.  They continued to say that the image was just a \u0027Photoshop job\u0027. Their original tweet has now been liked over 3,000 times. Not everyone was offended by the post, with some saying if anything, it had encouraged them to shop with Moonpig.

Incredibly the device still had more than 80% of its charge, despite being dropped to the seabed two days earlier. It has now been reunited with its Canadian owner after it was dropped by a kayaker close to the coast in Dorset. Cerys Hearsey\u0027s attention was drawn to the phone when she noticed a flash of light on the seabed about 30ft down. It was in a waterproof case and still had 84% battery life.  She scooped it up, took it back to the shore and scrolled through the contacts to find its owner. It has now been returned to a grateful Rob Smith, whose Canadian cousin had lost it while the pair were kayaking at Durdle Door in Dorset. They were approaching the famous coastal landmark when the phone toppled over the edge of their boat. Although the phone was in a waterproof case they accepted they wouldn\u0027t be unable to recover it and returned home.  Two days later, Cerys, 34, was diving in the area when she noticed the phone sat on the sea bed. She arranged to meet Rob, 34, and his wife Evie, in nearby Weymouth after the pair explained their cousin was by that time on a flight back to Canada. The phone has now been posted back across the Atlantic.  Cerys, who was visiting Dorset from her home in Essex, said she is pleased to be able to to return the phone to its rightful owner. She said: I could see the phone sitting on the bottom of the seabed because it received a message and lit up. I picked it up and returned to land where I cut it out of its case as it was starting to get a bit of water inside. I then looked up the numbers and got in touch with the owner\u0027s family. Phones are so critical to life nowadays they can be difficult to replace. The owner of the phone was on a flight back to Canada, so I met with the owner\u0027s cousin Rob.

While they can’t help with the first two, Halfords thankfully has a range of products to help keep your pride and joy gleaming in the sunshine. H2-No! Water is certainly a good way to wash a car. Hosepipe bans don\u0027t prevent you from filling a bucket but we also know that any frivolous water use is making the problem worse for everyone. According to Uswitch, washing a car with a hosepipe uses between 400 and 480 litres of water, whereas completing the same activity using a faithful bucket draws around 32 litres. But there are risks involved with using a bucket and sponge, too. Sponges can pick up harmful foreign objects which can damage the layers of laquer on the panels of the car. With that in mind, let\u0027s look at other options.  The ArmorAll Waterless Wash \u0026amp Spray, \u0026pound10, is designed to clean your car of light dirt and dust. Simply spray the sections of the car that you want to clean and then wipe them clean with a microfibre cloth. The spray helps lift the dirt from your bodywork and allows you to wipe it off without risking damage to the paintwork. It\u0027s a much more high-tech solution than using water and it\u0027s helping to save water during our heatwave too. You may need more than one bottle if your car is large, so bear that in mind before you start. Careful wiping    The first thing you\u0027ll need to remember is that dirt causes scratches if you\u0027re not careful. Make sure that you have a decent amount of microfibre cloths before you start. Halfords sell a five-pack for \u0026pound3, so you may want to pick up a couple. When you\u0027re wiping the spray off it\u0027s important to use a cloth only until it gets dirty. So fold your cloth in half and use it four times before putting it aside for washing later. It\u0027s also important to only wipe in one direction. This will help keep the dirt from scratching the paintwork. Take precautions  Once your car is clean it\u0027s a good idea to wax it. A coat of wax puts a barrier between the paint and the outside world to protect it from rainwater, spray and debris.

The pair, from the prehistoric Vysotskaya - or Wysocko - Culture were found near Petrykiv village, south of the city of Ternopil in western Ukraine. Professor Mykola Bandrivsky - who conducted a study of ‘loving couple burials’ - said: “It is a unique burial, a man and a woman lying there, hugging each other tight.  “Both faces were gazing at each other, their foreheads were touching. “The woman was lying on her back, with her right arm she was tenderly hugging the man, her wrist lying on his right shoulder. “The legs of the woman were bent at the knees - lying on the top of the men’s stretched legs. “Both the dead humans were clad in bronze decorations, and near the heads was placed some pottery items - a bowl, a jar and three bailers.” This ancient culture was known for the “tenderness” of its burials, said Dr Bandrivsky, Director of the Transcarpathian branch of the Rescue Archaeological Service of the Institute of Archeology of Ukraine.  But this example is very striking as autopsy experts say it would not be possible to place the woman’s body in such a loving position if she was already dead. The experts say it is likely the woman chose to die and be buried with her husband and drank poison as she climbed into the grave and embraced her recently dead husband. In other cases, burials from this culture have revealed “a man holding the hands of a woman, the lips of a man touching forehead of a woman, or arms of both dead people hugging each other”.  Dr Bandrovsky - who has carried out an analysis of such burials - said: “From our point of view, this women did it voluntarily. “Maybe, the woman did not want to live with some other man, and get used to some new way of life. “So she preferred to pass away with her husband. “We suppose such a decision was dictated only by her own desire, and her attempt to stay with her beloved one.” He added: “She may, for example, have drunk a chalice of poison to make joining her husband easy and painless.” Marriage was well developed in the Vysotskaya Culture, with husbands and wives having clearly defined responsibilities, he said. A tenet of their beliefs was the idea that thew woman preferred to die with her man.

Teopanzolco is an Aztec archaeological site in southern Mexican, which due to modern building, now lies within the city of Cuernavaca. The impressive discovery has taken 10 months to unearth fully, after the earthquake which registered 7.1 magnitude, in September last year. The tremor damaged the base of the pyramid, called the Great Platform and exposed the previously-unknown temple. Most of the remains date back to the Mesoamerican Postclassic Period (900-1521 AD). The Tlahuica people founded Teopanzolco and nearby Cuauhnahuac (Cuernavaca), before they were conquered in 1427 by Aztec emperor Moctezuma I.  Following their defeat, they were integrated into the Aztec Empire and obliged to pay tribute and take part in military campaigns. The Great Platform is believed to date back to 1100 to 1150 AD and was later dedicated to Tlaloc, the supreme god of rain in the Aztec religion. Archaeologist Barbara Konieczna said: We are finding walls of a temple that, according to its location and architectural characteristics, was built early in the Postclassic Period. This archaeological site is older than Tenayuca in the Valley of Mexico and the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan in capital Mexico City. Experts now believe that this form of architecture was first developed in the Morelos region in the south and was later replicated in those other sites.

The pair were seen with their mum and the unsettling find on remote Arctic island Svalbard. Despite a human population of only 2,500, outnumbered by polar bears, researchers found plastic waste everywhere. Claire Wallerstein, of Sail Against Plastic, said: “It was very sobering to see just how much plastic is making its way to this incredibly remote, apparently pristine environment.” The group of 15 Cornish scientists and campaigners spent 10 days examining air, sea and beaches around the Norwegian archipelago, some 600 miles from the North Pole, for microplastics and larger pieces.  Claire said: “The saddest thing was just how much of the waste blighting the Arctic is the same old disposable detritus of our daily lives – plastic bottles, cotton bud sticks, cigarette ends, wet wipes, polystyrene and food packaging.” With currents reaching Svalbard from both the Atlantic and Siberia, local beach cleaners have reportedly found plastic waste traceable even to Florida.  Flora Rendell-Bhatti, of the University of Exeter, said: “As plastic pollution breaks down it is harder to identify the sources of fragments and fibres by eye. “Once samples are analysed in the UK, this will indicate the microplastic pollution levels in Arctic waters around Svalbard.” "},{"url":null,"title":"alan gilzean wont be forgotten says dundee boss neil mccann","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee manager Neil McCann says Alan Gilzean’s death is a “sad loss for the club” but the impact he made at Dens will never be forgotten.The club’s all-time top goalscorer and league- winning striker sadly passed away on Sunday at the age of 79.Speaking from the club’s training camp in Portugal, Neil said: “First of all, I would like to offer my condolences to the family.“Sometimes the word legend is thrown around too easily but Alan Gilzean is a legend in the true sense of the word.“I know first-hand about how important goalscorers are to clubs now I am a manager and, my goodness, could we have been doing with someone of his quality.“So, yes, it is a sad loss for the football club.“From when I first came into Dundee as a young boy from 12 years old and then after going full-time, you were always aware of the club’s history.“I never actually got to meet Gillie but when you know the history of the club you can see, clearly, the pride running through the place.“He will be forever remembered at Dundee, that’s for sure.“He won’t be forgotten and we know he made his mark as a footballer.“You don’t play football – well most of us don’t – for the fame and riches.

He was always the same nice lad.“I think that was one of the strengths of the Dundee team that won the championship – we were all good friends. There were no cliques in the dressing-room and none of us let our success go to our heads.“I remember when Alan was at Spurs and I was manager at Hearts, we played them in a friendly. He was a big star, but he was exactly the same as he was when we were at Dens.”“Gillie” scored a club record 169 goals in 190 appearances in dark blue and, after leaving for London in 1964, went on to earn similar legendary status at White Hart Lane, where he formed lethal striking partnerships with Jimmy Greaves and Martin Chivers. None of that came as a surprise to Seith, who rates him as one of the best ever.He said: “Alan was exceptional and a great header of the ball. His timing in the air was the thing and when he jumped he seemed to hang in the air. We knew that if we could get the ball to his head he would score goals.“At Dundee he had a fine partnership with Alan Cousin and he would have been the first to say Alan Cousin’s donkey work was responsible for him scoring as many goals as he did.“With Alan, though, it was not just about his heading, he had two very good feet as well. In fact, I was never sure whether he was left or right-footed.“He had the knack of being in the right place at the right time. He always seems to know where to be, that’s why he scored so many goals.”Former Dundee director and long-time friend, Dave Forbes, also paid tribute. Organiser of a number of events down the years to honour the 1961/62 team, he knew Gillie well.He said: “I knew he wasn’t well and I’m just glad it all seems to have been quite quick and he didn’t suffer for too long.”Particularly after spending 10 years in the limelight at Spurs, where he was dubbed the King of White Hart Lane, Gilzean was famous for valuing his privacy.For a long time after he retired, the native of Coupar Angus did not make many public appearances but, over the past decade or so, was a familiar figure at White Hart Lane on match days and made regular visits back to Dundee.“Gillie was a private man, but he was a gentleman.“I remember when we were organising Dundee’s centenary celebrations he was a big help,” added Forbes.“I am proud, honoured and privileged to have known him as a good friend.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b3b4f0f73369-846x564.jpg ","title":"dundee bar intends to reopen months after closure","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA West End bar that closed without warning will reopen in September.The Mayfly and events space Door Below, on Perth Road, closed without warning earlier this month.But the pub has now announced it intends to reopen later this year after an extensive refurbishment.A post on The Mayfly’s Facebook page stated: “We are currently closed for refurbishment, reopening at the beginning of September.”The bar is owned by Fuller Thomson, which also operates Duke’s Corner and the Jute Cafe Bar at the DCA.At the time, staff said they had felt “feel very hurt and let down\u0026#8221 at the sudden closure.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b4485911d088-685x564.jpg ","title":"dundee fans in portugal an inspiration for keeper jack hamilton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDens Park new boy Jack Hamilton says the sight of Dundee fans making the trip all the way to Portugal to watch their side is an inspiration.The Dark Blues have been in the Algarve since last Wednesday, playing a training game with Sunderland and another with Portuguese top-flight side Portimonense on Sunday before finishing things off with a friendly clash with local side SC Farense last night.That game is expected to draw some away support after a handful of supporters showed up for the 4-0 training game loss on Sunday at the Estadio Municipal de Albufeira.And that dedication to their team is something Hamilton wants to repay in the coming season.He said: “It says a lot for the fans to come out here.“They could have gone anywhere on holiday to be fair but they’ve come here to show the boys a bit of support and we really appreciate that.“It’s fantastic and, hopefully, we can repay them for coming to places like this with good results.”For Hamilton, as a new signing, the trip to Portugal has been a great way for him to get to know his team-mates a lot better. And he is eager to get going when the competitive games finally get under way this weekend away at Stirling Albion in the Betfred Cup.“It’s been good, I’m really enjoying it,” he added.“It’s a fantastic club, fantastic fanbase as well. Everyone has made me feel welcome, the boys are brilliant with me and the manager and staff are really good.“I’m enjoying it and just desperate to get back out on the park and get playing again.“The facility is brilliant, the hotel is nice, food and everything is good – it’s everything you want and it’s good to get the boys all together.“Being a new boy as well, it’s good to be able to get to know everybody that wee bit better and getting a better understanding with everybody, I’m really enjoying it.”Hamilton started Sunday’s game against Portimonense in Albufeira before being replaced halfway through by Elliott Parish with the score at 1-0.The final scoreline of 4-0 flattered the Portuguese side a little and Hamilton insists there was plenty of good work done to help their preparations for the coming campaign.“It wasn’t the result we wanted, it was disappointing in that way but it was good to get back on the park again.“It was difficult conditions, absolutely roasting, playing against a good side but I felt there were times we played well and are starting to look like a good team.“They were a good side, the effort from the boys was there, we lost a few bad goals but, other than that, the boys worked hard.“We’re all gearing up for Saturday.“It was good to get back playing two 45 minute halves, a full 90 minutes as well. It’s a game we’re looking forward to.”Former Hearts goalie Hamilton has a rival for the gloves at Dens Park, with last season’s No 1 Parish having done well in the Dundee goal following the departure of Scott Bain.The 28-year-old has already issued a challenge to his new pal Hamilton ahead of the campaign that he’ll have a battle on his hands.It’s not one the new man is likely to shirk away from, however.He added: “I don’t think there’s anywhere there isn’t a battle for the gloves but it’s a fight I’m really up for and I want to be playing.“I got a good run at Hearts, 60-odd games but I’m here now to further that and I’m desperate to get more games and make myself better.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people baxter park picnic","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlenty of people turned out for the Park Lives ‘Picnic in the Park’ event at Baxter Park in the sunshine on Thursday.The sun was shining was various activities which included a giant snakes and ladders board and face-painting.One woman getting in on the fun was Maryfield Community Officer – Constable Lydia Thatcher, pictured, who was spotted getting her face painted by some youngsters.The next Picnic in the Park event, Messy Play, event will take place on July 12 from midday to 2pm and is suitable for all ages.

However, it wasn’t to be as while he rummaged in his bag to find the ring, he was interrupted by a group of German tourists.With the mood killed, they went to the beach, but after sunbathing for just 10 minutes, Craig said they should go back to the hotel because he was too hot.He chose the balcony of their room which overlooked the lake to ask Aimee to become his wife.Aimee couldn’t even answer and instead simply burst into tears of happiness.After careful planning by the couple, the morning of the wedding arrived and the sun was shining.Aimee said: “When I woke up and saw the sun I was so happy that I was getting my outdoor wedding.“It made the photos taken by Burfly Photography from the day look really green and beautiful.“We had a flower wall created by Celebre which was stunning and it would have been a beautiful backdrop for the ceremony too.”The bride was accompanied down the aisle by stepdad Graham and the ceremony conducted by humanist Neil Anderson was the highlight of the day.“We made sure that the ceremony wasn’t boring and it was very personal,” said Aimee.“Neil was absolutely incredible and delivered our story in a fun way.“The night-time reception was brilliant but the day-time was our highlight.”The pair took to the floor to have their first dance as a married couple to The Verve’s hit song Lucky Man, which was performed by band Paper Tiger.Craig and Aimee would like to thank their wedding planners Katy and Fiona, videographers I Do, bridal shop Annarose and all their family and friends.Aimee added: “I wouldn’t change a thing about my wedding.

We think they’re keen to see it happening.”The Marketgait proposals are one of a small number of developments cropping up away from the Waterfront.Mr Mudie said: “Because of the Waterfront people have a keener interest in looking at city centre sites for development.“If it wasn’t for that there wouldn’t be any of the interest there is now. Companies in Glasgow and Edinburgh will be watching to see what the appetite is. They see Dundee as an untapped opportunity.”The Marketgait project is the biggest, in terms of cost, that Brunton has worked on yet.Mr Mudie added: “One of the reasons we think the council are so keen is because they want to take some of the attention away from the Waterfront.“The petrol station works on its own but I’m assuming our client believes they can get more out of the site.”Mr Mudie says the developer has given his firm free rein to design the new building, and plans are set to be submitted to council “imminently”.The plans received mixed reviews from the public.Pat Rae, 49, an admin assistant from the East End, said: “You have buildings across the road which are lying empty – I don’t see why they aren’t developed instead. You get a lot of traffic but a lot of it is commuters so I don’t think it would attract many folk to the restaurant or shop. I don’t think it would be of much benefit.”Colin Potter, 52, a telecoms engineer from the West End, said: “I think it’s a good idea. There’s always a need for new housing. These will maybe not be that cheap but it might be that people move into these and free up other houses in the city.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/01/5a53492e86b36-846x564.jpg ","title":"vision of low emission city as dundee hosts clean air

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"exciting shinty at the macaulay sixes","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 22/06/18, 8:15 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowNo fewer than 29 youth shinty teams travelled to Oban\u0026#8217s Mossfield Park for the annual Macaulay six-a-side competition.The winners of the main competition for P7 and under were Inverlochy, who defeated Taynuilt 1-0 in the final with Taynuilt taking the Oban Celtic Shield.The Alastair Campbell Shield for P5 and under was won by Braxi Boys from Inverlochy who defeated Bute in a very exciting final after extra time by one penalty to nil.The Macaulay Development trophy was won by Rockfield Rapids.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12468674.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_240218grant_07JPG.jpg","title":"maybole super school one step","story":"NewsMaybole super-school is one step closer to being builtCouncillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson15:27, 10 JUL 2018NewsNew Carrick Academy artist impression (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA \u0026pound42million super-school has taken a step closer to being built in Maybole.

St Cuthbert’s Primary – where parents responding to the consultation issued a rejection of the move – would also relocate but operate as a stand-alone school.

Nicola, 28-year-old classical singer married 30-year-old shipbuilding engineer John Hunter. The pair now live in Shawlands, Glasgow, but were both originally from Ayr. One Friday night back in 2009 John walked in to Harley’s Pub in Ayr to wish his cousin a happy birthday, and his sister told him to say hello to Nicola – her workmate at the time. “Nobody knows if it was the brown eyes, the sweet perfume or the six pints, three vodkas and the shot of Midori that caused him to steal my cardigan but steal it he did,” joked Nicola. She added: “A few days later, cardigan in hand, John returned it to H Samuel where I worked at the time. And that moment was the beginning of something special.” Since then both have enjoyed years of happiness and in October 2016 – seven years after meeting – John asked Nicola to marry him at Loch Lomond.  John and Nicola tied the knot on Thursday, June 7, at The Cruin at Loch Lomond. The couple said: “It was relaxing, elegant and absolutely perfect. “We can’t thank the staff enough. The weather, setting and scenery were breath-taking.” The bride wore a Vera Wang dress from David’s Bridal, Braehead, the bridesmaids also wearing gowns from David’s Bridal. The kilts were the Spirit of Lochearn tartan from Kilts 4 U. The wedding party consisted of Best man Mark Cosgrove, Groomsmen Niall Carney, Paddy McCurdie and Ryan Glass (nephew, aged 8), Maid of honour sister Jennifer Cassells, Bridesmaids Laura Dickson, Heather Armstrong and Aimee Trainer, Groom’s parents John Hunter and Hazel Hunter and the Bride’s parents Brian Cassells and Julie Cassells. The pair are currently celebrating being newlyweds in Bangkok, Thailand, and will be heading to Koh Samui, Thailand, then on to the Atlantis in Dubai.  3D Cakes created the couples wedding cake. The couple said: “We were inspired by the Scottish theme and used the same tartan ribbon that was on the kilts.” Kev Moulds Photography captured Nicola and John’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to look back on. The bouquets were arranged by Narcissus Flowers by Susan Hair and make-up was styled and created by Anna Wade (hair) and Lynn Brown (make-up). The couple added: “We would like to thank everyone who made the day possible, especially our parents Brian Cassells, Julie Cassells, John Hunter and Hazel Hunter. “And to our guests who contributed to an amazing day.” For more photos of the couple\u0027s big day, pick up your copy of this week\u0027s Ayrshire Post.

Bids of \u0026pound1.5million are being sought for Enterkine House, perched above Annbank. The luxury four-star retreat, which boasts 74 acres of land, employs around 50 staff. Kirk House and Steading, a six-bedroom farmhouse currently used as overspill accommodation for the hotel, is also included. Agents Christie \u0026amp Co and Galbraith said the plot offered “potential for development under a new owner”. It follows a long-running noise battle at the hotel which saw bosses spend \u0026pound80,000 soundproofing their wedding marquee. Council chiefs were told that slapping an 11pm curfew on party bands could put the hotel out of business.  But they finally got the all-clear earlier this year and revealed plans to build a permanent structure. However, the hotel is now being offered to the market. Bob Cherry, a partner with Galbraith, said: “The purchaser of Enterkine would find it relatively straightforward to continue the current business, which is well-established, and there are further opportunities for diversification or expansion of the tourism and events facilities on the estate, subject to the necessary consents. “This is a beautiful estate with a thriving hotel business and potential for further development.” Brian Sheldon, of Christie \u0026amp Co, added: “The market for country house hotels such as Enterkine House has vastly improved in recent years. “Its location in South Ayrshire and within such an enviable estate and countryside will attract local, regional and potentially international operators. “Whilst the business is trading well, there is certainly scope for further growth.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"royal troon golf club make","story":"NewsRoyal Troon golf club make generous donation to hospital unitIt follows a charity 18-hole golf event with Troon Portland and Troon Ladies, writes Charlene Bennie.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post15:39, 10 JUL 2018News\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRoyal Troon Golf Club has made the generous donation of \u0026pound1k to Crosshouse Hospital’s Acute Stroke Unit.

Steve the Seagull sneakily snatches a bag of crisps from bakery giant Greggs in Ayr. The sly bird checks to see if the coast is clear and grabs a packet of Walkers if staff are busy – and he’s tried every flavour. Greggs team member Charley Cooper said: “He could be in three times a day. He always goes for the crisps on the bottom shelf. He also took a pack of yum-yums recently. “He is like a thief in the night. He stalks this place. I shout ‘Steve’ and he flys off.” Hilariously the staff have dubbed the winged bandit ‘Steve Segal’ after the action movie actor.  Charley said the popular pest has been causing a flap for about two years. Air traffic controller Steve McNamara made a video of the bird in action last Tuesday. The dad-of-three said: “It was so funny. It landed outside Greggs, walked straight to the crisps stand inside, got a pack of ready salted and headed back out to the pavement. “ It then whacked the packet with its beak and devoured them. It only stopped to let out a cry of joy in the middle of its feast. “A few other people saw it and were incredulous. I had a feeling the bird wasn’t a first offender and it looked like it knew exactly what it was doing. It was a snatch theft.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article3294074.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/JS33570090.jpg","title":"up your game face boot","story":"NewsUp your game or face the boot - shock SNP ultimatum to South Ayrshire Council leaderIt comes as rival camps “fight like rats” to wrestle the council’s power base back on track.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson15:21, 10 JUL 2018NewsCouncil leader Douglas Campbell (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailUp your game or face the boot. That’s the shock ultimatum delivered by warring SNP councillors to their embattled leader. Douglas Campbell has been ordered to regain control of his split ranks during the council’s summer break. It comes as rival camps “fight like rats” to wrestle the council’s power base back on track. A racism storm and failed coup on Councillor Campbell has plunged the SNP into crisis. And the Post understands another plot to oust the leader is now brewing. It follows all SNP group members signing a declaration of support for their under-fire boss just two weeks ago. But a party insider has revealed growing disquiet is threatening to tear the group apart.  Within hours of the public show of support, Cllr Campbell was being placed under increasing pressure to step down of his own accord, rather than face another bruising challenge from within, the Post has learned. A senior source said: “People agreed to fall in line and sign the declaration for the sake of the bigger picture. “But it’s widely accepted that a change is required and this can’t go on. “The group is in a position where people will fight like rats to get what they want. “However, the even bigger concern is trying to keep the administration intact.” Worries over a potential walkout from Labour colleagues has, until now, ensured enough SNP support behind Cllr Campbell. A potential change in the their leadership is thought that have strained relations with administration partners, who have indicated they are happier working with Cllr Campbell.  But the Post understands that Cllr Campbell’s Labour past is forming a big part of the problem for the SNP leader as he battles factions within his new party. And a new warning – issued as councillors left for their summer break – stressed that he must crack the whip among his troubled ranks. The source added: “It was made very clear that if he doesn’t, the matter will be taken out of his hands. “The party is being crucified every week and it cannot be allowed to continue. “Some see Douglas as being far too close to Labour and that is undoubtedly a big issue for him. “Either way, he’s been given the message in clear terms that he needs to get everyone behind him and on the same page.” When asked about the warning, the group’s depute leader, William Grant, insisted: “This is news to me.” Cllr Campbell added: “Cllr Grant responded to your enquiry that ‘This is news to me’ and I have nothing to add.” "},{"url":null,"title":"26-year-old-admits-disturbances-at-bgh-and-innerleithen","story":"BACKGROUND reports have been ordered into an Innerleithen man who barricaded himself into a room before struggling violently with police.\nScott Ewart also caused a disturbance at Borders General Hospital later on May 28.\nThe 26-year-old of Millar Street pleaded guilty this week at Selkirk Sheriff Court to a charge of threatening or abusive behaviour at his home and also at the hospital.\nDuring the disturbance he had barricaded himself into a room in the house and ended up struggling violently with police constables.\nEwart remained disruptive at the hospital striking the handcuffs he was wearing against the wall.\nEwart also admitted a second charge of assaulting a police constable by spitting in his face.\nSentence was deferred for the preparation of a Criminal Justice Social Work Report until July 30.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"being-braw-lad-has-been-a-dream-come-true-says-greg","story":"ON Saturday Greg Kelly and Kimberley O\u0026rsquoMay realised their dreams of leading the cavalcade on Braw Lads\u0026rsquo Day.\nAnd it was an emotional occasion for the pair.\nBraw Lad Greg received the Burgh Standard at 8am on Saturday morning and returned it safely to the Burgh Chambers at midday, following a morning of celebrating Galashiels\u0026rsquo rich history.\nAnd it was a \u0026ldquodream come true for the 21-year-old who has always wanted to land the starring role.\nSpeaking after the events, he told us: \u0026ldquoA real highlight of today was receiving the Burgh Standard at eight o\u0026rsquoclock this morning and leading the cavalcade with my Braw Lass Kim.\n\u0026ldquoIt is a feeling that I will never forget.

Identity cards can be faked \u0026ndash phone the company to verify their identity.\n\u0026bull Some companies offer a password system. Ask your utility providers if this can be used and if you have a password with a company make sure the caller uses it.\n\u0026bull Never let people try to persuade you to let them into your home even if they are asking for help \u0026ndash they may not be genuine. If someone is persistent, ask them to call at another time and arrange for a friend or family member to be with you.\n\u0026bull Never agree to pay for goods or give money to strangers who arrive at your door.\n\u0026bull Don\u0026rsquot keep large amounts of money in your home.\n\u0026bull Remember, it\u0026rsquos your home. There\u0026rsquos no reason why anyone should ever enter your home against your wishes.\n\u0026bull If you\u0026rsquore not sure, don\u0026rsquot answer the door.\nFor more information, visit the Police Scotland website or contact your local community officer on 101.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"town-centre-building-set-for-facelift","story":"THE owners of a Bridge Street building in Kelso have applied to give their town centre property a makeover.\u0026nbsp\nDavid and Graeme Brechin, of Grant Avenue, Edinburgh, have applied to Scottish Borders Council for permission to renovate and repair the exterior of 6 Bridge Street.\u0026nbsp\nThe building is home to commercial properties, with a women\u0026rsquos clothes shop and charity shop occupying the ground floor, and the upper floors are divided into office accommodation.\u0026nbsp\nThe application outlined the aims of the proposal: \u0026ldquoRecently stonework had fallen off the building resulting in building standards involvement on public safety grounds and a scaffold has been erected.\n\u0026ldquoVarious options for repair have been considered, including renewing all the damaged stone with new natural stone indents but with 75 percent of the elevation delaminating it is prohibitively expensive and disproportionate to the capital value of the premises.\u0026nbsp\n\u0026ldquoRepairing individual stones in lithomix was also consider but is also not possible because of the large proportion of the fa\u0026ccedilade needing repaired.\n\u0026ldquoThe option the applicant wishes to pursue is for a more extensive render repair by cutting back virtually all of the facing stone, fixing an expanded metal base then expertly and uniformly stucco-rendering the fa\u0026ccedilade, scoring it to simulate ashlar stonework.\u0026nbsp\n\u0026ldquoCareful treatment around the window dressing, decorative eaves cornice and quoins will be carried out prior to the render coat application by a reputable, local stonemason, who will replace or repair the decorative stone to retain the character of the building.\u0026nbsp\nThe application will now be considered by Scottish Borders Council planning officers.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"noel-gallagher-tribute-band-to-play-galashiels-gig","story":"NOEL Gallagher fans in the Borders will be feeling supersonic as a tribute band rolls with it into the MacArts centre in Galashiels next week.\nThe band, named Acoustic Gallagher will be in town on Friday, July 13.\nThe gig will celebrate the songwriting talents of Oasis, as well as playing well-known classics and B-sides including Wonderwall, Champagne Supernova and of course, Don\u0026rsquot Look Back in Anger.\nDoors open at 7.30pm and music starts at 8pm.\nTickets\nare \u0026pound10, and are available by calling the box office on 01896 756852, or can be booked online at www.ticketsource/date/483994\nincluding \u0026lsquoWonderwall\u0026rsquo, \u0026lsquoChampagne Supernova\u0026rsquo, \u0026lsquoThe Masterplan\u0026rsquo, \u0026lsquoIf I Had a Gun\u0026rsquo, and of course, \u0026lsquoDon\u0026rsquot Look Back in Anger\u0026rsquo.\n\u0026lsquoSome might say\u0026rsquo that the Manchester band\u0026rsquos classics will receive an airing, along with work from Noel\u0026rsquos solo act, the High Flying Birds.\n\u0026lsquoWhat a life\u0026rsquo fans will also be in for a treat at the gig too.\u0026nbsp\nAdditionally, a licensed bar will be in operation on the night.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"galas-gareth-has-a-wicked-time-with-west-end-star","story":"AN aspiring performer from Galashiels has realised a lifelong dream by sharing the stage with one of musical theatre\u0026rsquos biggest stars.\nNineteen-year-old Gareth Williams, who is currently training for a BA (Hons) degree in Musical Theatre at The MGA Academy of Performing Arts in Edinburgh, was given the opportunity to provide backing vocals for West End and Broadway star Kerry Ellis during her 20th anniversary concert at The Queen\u0026rsquos Hall in Edinburgh.\nKerry is widely considered to be the one of musical theatre\u0026rsquos biggest stars and has previously starred in Wicked, We Will Rock You, My Fair Lady, Miss Saigon, Oliver!

help maintain supplies during the current period of hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer usage has increased significantly.With the current weather conditions forecast to continue people should take simple but important steps to conserve public water supplies.In some areas there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water during the summer and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely and  to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Some water treatment works and distribution networks are working at near capacity to meet demand.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of usage and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce usage wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their usage and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible, use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.Scotland’s public water supply is the lifeblood of the country, for household and business customers and more than 1.3 billion litres is used per day.There is a strong and resilient water distribution network but everyone will need to play their part as Scotland enjoys its hottest and driest summer in

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.

Mrs Morris said that although there were some trees along the boundary, they shed their leaves in the autumn, leaving the area bare.  She claimed that she and her husband had called on the housing association for permission to fill in the gaps in the fence to allow more privacy but claimed they had been told they couldn\u0026rsquot as another resident liked it that way.  \u0026ldquoWe wanted to get these slats which are only 94p. We would pay for them and fill in the spaces, she added.  She said they also called for a fence to be installed to stop people using an area past their flats as a shortcut to Tesco, claiming they were dumping rubbish including cans and bottles en route.  Neighbour Fiona Wilson said that motorists ate and slept in their vehicles and let their dogs out of cars.  \u0026ldquoWe are entitled to some sort of privacy, she added.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot go out \u0026ndash everybody\u0026rsquos looking at us.  \u0026ldquoMy bedroom is also to the front.

Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7991066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"vandals-force-nursery-to-end-term-early","story":"  Staff at Pinkie St Peter\u0027s nursery, in Musselburgh, said the damage had been extensive and the building would have to undergo a deep clean to ensure all the glass was cleared from it before any of its youngsters could be allowed back in.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.  The site had long been earmarked for Sainsbury\u0026rsquos after it won a lengthy battle with Tesco to build on the site in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8009220.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dunbar-student-heading-off-to-the-olympics-of-tech","story":"  A games development team, made up of students from Abertay University, will take on the best in the world at the Microsoft Imagine Cup in Seattle.  The competition \u0026ndash dubbed the Olympics of Tech \u0026ndash seeks out the most innovative and potentially world-changing software solutions and comes with a first prize of $100,000.  Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.  The Abertay team are focusing on making the simulator better before they head to Washington.  Twenty-year-old Emily\u0026rsquos involvement in the project is the latest step as she attempts to land her dream job.

A post from the youth project said: \u0026ldquoOver the past three years, young people have been looking at youth provision in North Berwick and have been shocked to learn just how much has been lost and never replaced.  \u0026ldquoThe team have been working hard to receive advice from East Lothian Council on what can be put in place to ensure a safe environment for all, as well as actions which can be taken to discourage anti-social behaviour. The young people would like to re-build the shelter with wider community involvement.  But Kathryn and Douglas Paul, who live at Glasclune Gardens, would prefer to see the shelter demolished.  Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.  The couple told the Courier they had experienced long-standing anti-social behaviour from youngsters who already gather at the shelter.  Mrs Paul said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had bottles thrown into the garden \u0026ndash they are loud and they get up to all sorts. It\u0026rsquos been going on five or six years.  Mr Paul, who is chairman of Glasclune Residents Association, said: \u0026ldquoWe feel that it is the wrong site for this.  \u0026ldquoWe are open to the accusation that it\u0026rsquos because it is at the back of our house and that\u0026rsquos partly fair \u0026ndash ideally we\u0026rsquod like to see the shelter pulled down.  \u0026ldquoBut rather than just saying it\u0026rsquos not right, we\u0026rsquove offered to the youth project to fundraise for an alternative.  \u0026ldquoThere are a lot of people who live here who have experience of managing projects.

Lauren Cowie, project manager at North Berwick Youth Project, insisted plans were \u0026ldquostill at a very early stage.  She added: \u0026ldquoWe are committed to working with the entire community and in particular those who live near the proposed shelter.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.

Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population.

Details of what happened have not been released publicly, although the Courier understands that it followed a private function on the premises the previous evening.  In April, Police Scotland asked East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board to review the pub\u0026rsquos licence and that of its manager Christopher Darling.  However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.  He said that if given approval to go ahead the pub could re-open early next year.  The board agreed to transfer the licence to Mr Hughes, wishing him luck with the venture."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-open-2018-trophy-tour-finale-at-tranent-school","story":"  Beth Allen, ambassador for ASI and member of the Ladies European and LPGA Tour, was there on the day and attended a special assembly and Q\u0026ampA session with pupils to give more insight into her life as a professional golfer.  Tranent\u0026rsquos Active Schools coordinator Adam Martin also presented information about both the men\u0026rsquos and ladies\u0026rsquo Scottish Opens coming to Gullane before primary five students took part in a ClubGolf session, led by East Lothian Golf Development Officer Kate Green with assistance from Scottish Golf, Active Schools, the Stephen Gallacher Foundation and Beth Allen.  A ClubGolf mass participation session was then held over lunchtime to give all children at the school a chance to experience golf, using everything from plastic ClubGolf equipment, professional clubs and golf balls to Scottish Golf inflatable nets.  About 14,000 primary and high school pupils in East Lothian have been visited at their schools as part of the trophies tour in the run-up to the Scottish Open, which takes place from next Thursday (July 12), and the Ladies\u0026rsquo Scottish Open which begins on Thursday, July 26.  Mr Martin said: \u0026ldquoThe trophies tour finale at Sanderson\u0026rsquos Wynd was an amazing day and these children not only got to see the trophies up close but also got to grill a brilliant professional athlete in Beth Allen. It was also fantastic to give them the opportunity to swing a golf club for the first time.  \u0026ldquoI hope that the trophy tour has inspired children across East Lothian to come down to Gullane in July and continue to get involved in golf.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable. It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.  She said: \"The announcement has been made to our network of hosts and producers, many of them will communicate to their members when they are ready, and we will do a public communication in August.\""},{"url":null,"title":"talented-teenage-drummer-clara-wilberforce-joins-national-youth-pipe-band-of-scotland","story":"  Clara Wilberforce, who has been playing the snare drum since she was in P6 at King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, has linked up with the National Youth Pipe Band of Scotland\u0026rsquos development band.  That came after a rigorous audition process, which saw the 15-year-old perform to a group of judges.  Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.  Her first event will feature Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain at the Phil and Aly RSNO St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day Concert at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on November 25.  Music runs in the family, with older brother Ninian, playing the pipes, while Juliet plays the piano and dad Marcus is a member of Haddington\u0026rsquos Siancio Singers.  Clara, who is in S5 at Knox Academy and studying Higher maths, English, geography and human biology, is also a member of the school\u0026rsquos pipe band as well as Haddington Pipe Band, where she is a senior drummer.  Her mum, who praised the efforts of Davey Barnes, who runs Knox Academy Pipe Band, and Dave Henry, drum teacher, said Clara \u0026ldquoloves the drumming and she had made a number of good friends through music and boosted her confidence.  Alastair Bruce, chairman of Haddington Pipe Band, congratulated Clara, who lives in the town, on the achievement.  The youngster won the band\u0026rsquos Niall Fairgrieve Award in 2014 for most improved drummer and has continued to impress.  Mr Bruce said: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoShe has done really well and she is an excellent drummer.  \u0026ldquoShe is onto the development band and that will open up lots of opportunities for her in the future.

Now his son Kit, who lives in Belhaven, has released a new version of the tale which looks at Chris\u0026rsquo 30-year career with the company, its characters and ships.  The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.  Kit \u0026ndash who last year released The Triumph and Tragedy of the Bantams, which focused on a band of \u0026ldquobrave but largely forgotten soldiers \u0026ndash has added his own stories of being a \u0026lsquoMacBrayne Child\u0026rsquo.  He added that his dad was known as the \u0026lsquostoryteller\u0026rsquo in the family and he wanted to make sure the stories were available to a new generation.  As well as his time with MacBrayne, the book looks at Kit\u0026rsquos dad\u0026rsquos time in the Armed Forces, as well as becoming a sub-postmaster in Aviemore as the town evolved from a \u0026ldquosleepy former railway junction into its present skiing and outdoor pursuits centre.

The 51-year-old, whose nephew is Scotland rugby star Huw Jones, has driven a taxi for nine years to pay his way through university and has built his own film studio and edit suite at his home in Longniddry.  The dad-of-three said: \u0026ldquoThe TV course has been a brilliant journey.  \u0026ldquoColleagues often ask where I find my energy, and sometimes I have to ask myself the same thing, especially at 4am when I have forgotten to go to bed. Perhaps my endurance and resilience comes from my 12 years as a commando.  \u0026ldquoThere have been sacrifices, the biggest of them being to have had no social life throughout this time, but I am passionate about television and I am now talking to production companies and hoping to make my mark in the documentary genre.  While Matt admits it was \u0026ldquoeasy to feel envious of weekend revellers partying, he said driving taxis allowed him to refine his interview skills for his TV career ahead.  And among those to grace the back seat of his cab over the last nine years have been the likes of Angus Deayton, Ian Lavender, Paul Merton, Alexei Sayle, Ruth Madoc and Steven Berkoff.  Matt, who served with the Royal Marines in Northern Ireland, has already completed a music production with National Museums Scotland for a new exhibition on Scottish pop from the 1950s to present day. The classical music enthusiast and trumpeter has also worked on a documentary about Felix Mendelssohn and is currently working on one on Fryderyk Chopin.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier. He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.  Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done.

We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7067548.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"huge-realistic-sandcastle-unveiled-to-promote-britains-real-castles","story":"  The sand sculpture, which took five days to make, has been created at Dover Castle in Kent ahead of a sandcastle building weekend at English Heritage castles across the country.  As part of a #LoveCastles season, English Heritage is also calling on members of the public to send it photographs of their own sandcastles and is revealing its top tips for building a successful castle on the beach.  English Heritage\u0026rsquos ultimate sandcastle features defensive measures including crenellated outer walls with towers and battlements, and an inner bailey protecting the great tower which reflects the power and strength of the owners.  It also features a gatehouse with portcullis and drawbridge, and a ditch and bank around the outside to stop enemies approaching the walls directly.  Roy Porter, English Heritage Senior Properties Curator and creator of the ultimate castle, said: \u0026ldquoA castle is surely one of the most awe-inspiring sights but if you look closely, all is not what it seems.  \u0026ldquoThese amazing structures are a brilliant mix of ages and types, reflecting changing threats and fashions over centuries.\u0026nbsp Part of the fun of visiting them is using a Sherlock-like eye to tease out their secrets!  \u0026ldquoBy studying hundreds of years of trial and error by the real castle builders our ultimate sandcastle contains everything you\u0026rsquod like to see, with each element showing off castle-building \u0026lsquoperfection\u0026rsquo from a different era.          From the later 12th century, the focus of castle-building shifted from keeps to outer defences and gatehouses often became mini-castles in themselves! #lovecastles https://t.co/uLyLQNIdjn pic.twitter/VfCnK1kQe4          \u0026mdash English Heritage (@EnglishHeritage) July 11, 2018  \u0026ldquoI hope people will be inspired to build their very own ultimate sandcastle this summer \u0026ndash and support English Heritage to care for all our real castles so that they can continue to inspire us all for centuries to come.  Jamie Wardley, Sand in Your Eye sand sculptor, added: \u0026ldquoAt Sand in Your Eye we\u0026rsquore used to creating great, big sand sculptures all over the world, but this was definitely a once in a lifetime experience.  \u0026ldquoTo be able to build and sculpt the most perfect castle, not only from a visual point of view but also historically, using Roy\u0026rsquos research into hundreds of years\u0026rsquo worth of castle building history, was a real first for us.   Top sandcastle building tips include using wet sand, using hands to compact and sculpt and a ruler to carve the sand into shape and make the drawbridge by covering one hand with wet sand, pat it with other hand and then carefully slide the hand from under the sand leaving a drawbridge over the moat.  Sandcastle building workshops are being held at eight castles around England on Saturday and Sunday, and the castle at Dover will be on display until mid-August."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7537892.jpg?htype=29\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"alan-longmuir-hundreds-bid-final-farewell-to-bay-city-rollers-legend","story":"  Bay City Rollers star Alan Longmuir was laid to rest at Allan Church in Bannockburn, Stirling today.

But Mr Mundell hit back, branding Labour \"just Nicola\u0027s little helpers\" as he attacked the \"once proud unionist\" Scottish Labour Party for \"repeatedly voting\" with the SNP in Holyrood.  Speaking during Scotland Questions in the Commons, Mr Sweeney said: \"I feel I ought to congratulate the Secretary of State on achieving a new milestone as the longest serving member in one role in the Prime Minister\u0027s Cabinet, though I fear it may be a virtue of his invisibility rather than his invincibility\u0026hellip  \"The Secretary of State is failing to stand up for Scotland\u0027s interests when it comes to shipbuilding and his 12 Scottish Tory colleagues and himself have failed to stand up for Scotland\u0027s devolution settlement.  \"So, will he use the influence he should have developed over these last few years and condemn his Government\u0027s handling of the devolution settlement, demonstrating he isn\u0027t just Scotland\u0027s invisible man in the Cabinet?\" asked the MP for Glasgow North East.  Mr Mundell responded by saying: \"What I condemn is the once proud Unionist Scottish Labour Party repeatedly voting with the SNP in Holyrood.

She said: \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos economy is heavily reliant on services and thousands of my constituents work in the services sector, yet the Prime Minister is determined to make a deal, taking services out.  The Edinburgh MP asked the Scottish Secretary: \u0026ldquoHas he worked out yet what the impact of the PM\u0026rsquos decision on the Scottish economy and what is he going to do about it?  Mr Mundell said the heart of the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos document, which was \u0026ldquofed in to the Chequers summit, was that the SNP administration did not want the country to leave the EU.  \u0026ldquoWhat the PM is focused on is leaving the EU on the basis that does best for British business but also respects the outcome of a referendum of the whole of the United Kingdom.  After the SNP\u0026rsquos Hannah Bardell also accused Mr Mundell of being \u0026ldquoinvisible and \u0026ldquoineffective in his role and called for him to resign, the Scottish Secretary accused her of \u0026ldquoreheating the same old stuff and declared: \u0026ldquoAt the heart of this is the SNP don\u0026rsquot accept and don\u0026rsquot like the representations I make on behalf of Scotland that is to keep Scotland in the UK.  His Tory colleague Steve Baker, who resigned earlier this week as Brexit Minister in protest at Theresa May\u0026rsquos Chequers Plan, denounced the \u0026ldquoludicrous theatrics of the SNP. \u0026ldquoThey are a disservice not only to the people of Scotland but to the people of the whole of UK for the detrimental effect they had on the passage of the EU Withdrawal Act, he said.  Mr Mundell went on to accuse the Nationalists of not being interested in Britain\u0026rsquos withdrawal from the EU, claiming: \u0026ldquoBrexit has been weaponised purely to take forward the cause of independence and have another independence referendum.  Later, Whitehall rubbished Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos claim of a \u0026ldquopower-grab in the Government\u0026rsquos new Brexit Act. A UK Government insider said: A UK Government source said: \u0026ldquoThere is no \u0026lsquopower-grab,\u0026rsquo it is just an SNP invention.  \u0026ldquoNicola Sturgeon expanded her ministerial team to record numbers to handle her Government\u0026rsquos additional responsibilities.

Millions tuned into the eagerly anticipated match, with sorrowful scenes up and down the country after days of singing \"It\u0027s coming home\".  Crowds gathered in London\u0027s Hyde Park, Millennium Square in Leeds, Nottingham Castle, Birmingham\u0027s Archway outdoor cinema - and even Los Angeles.  England came to a standstill as the 7pm kick-off approached, with roads deserted and shopping centres abandoned as fans dashed home to catch the historic game.  The 23-man England squad, which has an average age of just over 26 and was the tournament\u0027s third youngest, had the hopes and expectations of a nation on their shoulders.  But place in the World Cup final against France was not to be.  Within the first five minutes, English fans were given cause for celebration when Kieran Trippier scored a free kick, giving his side a dream 1-0 lead.  The crowd in Hyde Park went berserk as England scored, and those watching on the huge screen were drenched in beer as plastic cups flew through the air amid wild celebrations.  Some fans had tears in their eyes as they could not believe the dream start.  In Leeds, the crowd leapt up as if a goal had been scored when the half-time whistle blew.  But there were stunned reactions as Croatia scored the equaliser through Ivan Perisic.  It would have been the nation\u0027s first final since they won in 1966 but an extra time goal from Mario Mandzukic left dreams shattered.  Many fans had their heads in their hands, while others shook their heads in disbelief.  Police estimated as many as 10,000 England fans were in the Russian capital for the game.  Among them were father and son Joe and Andrew Settle, from Bolton, who have never travelled away with England but decided they could not miss the chance to see the national side in a World Cup semi-final.  For Joe, 62, it was his first live England match.  \"I think it\u0027s our year this time.  \"There\u0027s no out and out stars and everybody just looks at them as young lads, making their way out, they\u0027ve not got above their station.

Ten of thousands of fans took to London\u0026rsquos Hyde Park and other venues across the country to watch the semi-final on a huge screens.  However, in Scotland, the reaction was more mixed, with thousands backing England\u0026rsquos opponents throughout the World Cup as part of the \u0026ldquofriendly rivalry between the two countries.  In Glasgow, shops said they were swamped with requests for the distinct red and white chequered first kit of England\u0026rsquos Croatian opponents.  A spokesman for the Nike shop in Glasgow said they had been \u0026ldquoabsolutely inundated with requests for Croatia shirts, while Greaves Sports said it had completely sold out the tops before the crunch match.  Managing director Sandy Greaves said it showed the fun rivalry that \u0026ldquonormally happens any time England plays.  \u0026ldquoLast Saturday morning all the die-hard Scottish fans wanted the Swedish jersey, he added.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a Scottish thing. I\u0026rsquom sure the same thing happens down south.The rivalry was on open display in some pubs in Glasgow, where there were loud cheers as Croatia took the lead in extra time.  \u0026ldquoI was supporting Croatia, said Jonny Cowan, 29, from Kilmarnock, who was watching the match in the Waxy O\u0026rsquoConnors pub next to Queen Street station.  \u0026ldquoI mean, it\u0026rsquos all about the friendly rivalry.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos all good natured, but we\u0026rsquore the auld enemies.

However, there may have been more Scottish support for the England side abroad.  Royal Bank of Scotland said it had seen a 70 per cent increase in the number of debit card transactions in Russia over the course of the World Cup, compared to  a normal day outside of the tournament.  Haydn Williams, from RBS, said it was either a matter of Scotland fans secretly supporting England \u0026ldquoor perhaps they have been there supporting Tunisia, Panama, Belgium, Colombia, Sweden and Croatia.  There was also irritation for some Scottish viewers, with reports that the STV Player had gone down just minutes before the end of the cliffhanger semi-final.  Jamie and Ruth Aitken, from Peterborough, in Glasgow on holiday, said they were a \u0026ldquoa bit apprehensive about watching the game in Scotland.  Ms Aitken, who the saw the game at Waxy O\u0026rsquoConnors, said: \u0026ldquoWe asked people in the hotel where we should watch it and they said \u0026lsquoin our room\u0026rsquo.

And when Ivana suggested the name Donald Jnr, his dad countered \u0026ldquoBut what if he\u0026rsquos a loser?  The point of these little revelations is that they reinforce our opinion of a man capable of displaying utter contempt for creeds - his Moslem entry ban nations - Mexico persons of colour - the African-Americans barred from renting his apartments. We\u0026rsquore reminded of his tax avoidance, and the small businesses the man with the small hands refused to honour his debts to.  We know President Trump\u0026rsquos integrity to be as thin as the hair covering left after his failed scalp reduction operation.  But that doesn\u0026rsquot mean our political leaders (if the FM and her cohorts are granted an audience) should not treat Trump\u0026rsquos arrival with respect. London Mayor\u0026rsquos Sadiq Khan\u0026rsquos sanction this week of a giant nappy-wearing Trump balloon was capital balloonery, ersatz State-sponsorship. (Wonder what would happen if anti-London Mayor lobbyists floated the idea of a diapered Khan?) And it was also hypocritical, given the UK\u0026rsquos ability to set aside human rights concerns over Saudi Arabia and Turkey.  Donald Trump may well be the Mad Hatter of World Politics, who can switch effortlessly to becoming the Queen of Hearts, killing off careers and opposition voices with a single Tweet. His administration puts children in cages. And as a political leader he makes our own clown Boris seem competent by comparison.  But The Donald represents the White House, and he bridges our relationship, so vital in the Second World War and during the Cold War, with the most powerful nation on Earth. The Leader of the Free World is coming to town (albeit to play a round of golf) and we have to treat him as such.  We have to push aside the fact he is the modern-day representation of WB Yeats\u0026rsquo 1919 poem, Second Coming \u0026ldquoThings fall apart, the centre cannot hold, mere anarchy is loosed upon the world. What is this strange beast slouching towards Bethlehem. (Holyrood?)  Indeed, our leaders have to understand and embrace the fact Trump singularly represents Yeats\u0026rsquo fear, when the poet anticipates the confusion, the terror of modern day politics, the growth of the far right across Europe, all confirmed by the fact that the venally ambitious Trump has been allowed to triumph in the first place.  For that reason we need to play the golfer. It would be all too easy for the FM and co to greet him waving Mexican flags or posting pics of little Guatemalan girls. That\u0026rsquos the job of student protesters and trades unionists and women\u0026rsquos rights groups, to take to the streets or the beaches of Troon or Aberdeenshire.. (Let\u0026rsquos hope predicted violence doesn\u0026rsquot ensue Trump won\u0026rsquot be looking out of the windows of Air Force One worrying about the havoc he\u0026rsquos provoked.)  But the reality is public name-calling won\u0026rsquot matter to this man who didn\u0026rsquot wish to have his son named after him in case he grew up to be a numpty.  Yet, he can be worked at a personal level. Like all petulant bullies he can\u0026rsquot handle face-to-face confrontation. So we can learn from French President Macron how to put Trump\u0026rsquos verbal gas at a peep. We can even learn from the \u0026ldquoLittle Rocket Man in how to lessen the likelihood of nuclear confrontation.  Our leaders, if they can get in a room with the man, need to be cleverer than Donald Trump, (which shouldn\u0026rsquot be hard.)They should feed him up on flattery and artery-hardening fudge, and then ask what he can do for our country?  It doesn\u0026rsquot matter that Nicola Sturgeon once refused to take calls from the man. Jaw-jaw is always better than war. So bring him onside, reach at least a vague understanding on trade economics and then try to get human rights onto the agenda.  And let\u0026rsquos bear in mind the upcoming Brexit chaos, (Trump\u0026rsquos declaration of a Britain being in turmoil is on the money), bear in mind too it could well open the door to Scottish independence - and the need to realign this country\u0026rsquos position on the world stage.  Trump\u0026rsquos arrival in Scotland in fact has its positives (if we can push aside the \u0026pound5m policing cost). He single-handedly represents the denial of democracy, the return of the despot to the West. He threatens the freedom of the press.  So let\u0026rsquos play with Ms Midlefart\u0026rsquos ex, but remember this isn\u0026rsquot a Chamberlain-Hitler scenario we\u0026rsquore dealing with. For not to do so could be dangerous. And in taking this pragmatic stance, by not endorsing giant balloons floating over Holyrood, we get to hold on to the string of dignity."},{"url":null,"title":"ariana-grande-i-felt-upside-down-after-manchester-bombing","story":"  The pop star had just finished performing on stage in Manchester on May 22 2017 when a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device, killing 22 people.

Sorvino has now said that during an audition for a horror movie when she was a teenager, she was tied to chair by a casting director who then shoved a condom in her mouth.  She did not name the alleged culprit.  Speaking on the Hollywood Foreign Press Association podcast, she said: \u0026ldquoIn looking back over at my career, I realised that one of my very first auditions when I was 16, I was completely treated inappropriately by the casting director.  \u0026ldquoIn order to scare me for this horror movie scene, he tied me to a chair, he bruised my arm and, I was 16 years old, and then he gagged me, and I was all game because I\u0026rsquom trying to be scared for the scene.

It was so inappropriate. And what the heck was a casting director doing with a condom in his pocket?  Sorvino, 50, was one of the first actresses to go public with allegations against Weinstein. In the New Yorker magazine in October last year, she said that Weinstein had chased her around a room after he started massaging her shoulders in a Toronto hotel in 1995.  Following the flood of allegations against Weinstein, Lord Of The Rings director Sir Peter Jackson revealed the producer had waged a smear campaign against the actress after she rejected his advances.  Weinstein told the filmmaker Sorvino was a \u0026ldquonightmare to work with, leading to her name being taken off his casting list.

Having announced earlier this year that the Homeward Bound tour would be his final farewell to the road, Paul Simon went out in some style, with a valedictory two-and-a-half hour trip through a songbook rivalled only by Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen.  At 76, Simon\u0026rsquos powers showed little sign of waning. Backed by a big, brilliant band packed with horns, strings and percussion, capable of surfing every curve of these remarkable songs, his boyish voice was in remarkably good nick. He even threw a few faintly funky shapes during the frenetic Cajun gumbo of That Was Your Mother. A glorious Me And Julio Down By The Schoolyard, the sharp, urgent Can\u0026rsquot Run, and sparse slap of Wristband were all reminders of what a rhythmically inventive writer he is.  Radiating all the glamour of a retired baseball coach, Simon proved a wry, amiable raconteur, sharing memories and creation stories. Yet there was little room for nostalgia. Indeed, at times the set flirted with downright irreverence. His radical \u0026ldquoreclamation of the hymn-like Bridge Over Troubled Water bordered on the sacrilegious, proof of an artist still bent on evolution. Elsewhere, celebratory romps through Diamonds On The Soles Of Her Shoes, You Can Call Me Al and Kodachrome proved that, for all the cerebral words and painstaking craftmanship, so often Simon\u0026rsquos music is at its most potent emitting sheer kinetic joy.  Towards the end, the mood became more reflective, revealing new resonances. Homeward Bound, written as a young man\u0026rsquos anthem of displacement, now communicated a more spiritual need to belong. A deeply moving solo take on his 1973 immigrant song, American Tune, had added heft in the age of Trump, while he sang \u0026ldquoI am leaving, I am leaving on The Boxer with a knowing emphasis. Earlier he had promised, \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not stopping, and there will be more recorded music to come, but if this was indeed the last ever sighting of Paul Simon on a Scottish stage, it was a departure entirely befitting a master."},{"url":null,"title":"only-1-in-4-back-sturgeon-calling-for-second-independence-referendum-this-autumn","story":"  The Daily Record survey found only 23 per cent of people thought the First Minister should push for a new vote, 19 per cent who wanted one later, while 49 per cent opposed it full stop.  The remaining nine per cent were don\u0026rsquot knows.  The findings increase the pressure on Ms Sturgeon as she considers her next move in the escalating constitutional fight with Westminster over Brexit.  The First Minister called a second referendum in March 2017, then \u0026ldquoreset her plan three months later after the SNP lost a third of its MPs in the general election.  She had promised to update MSPs on a \u0026ldquoprecise timescale on a second referendum this autumn, once the shape of the final Brexit deals becomes clear.  Earlier this week, her Brexit Secretary Michael Russell suggested a second EU referendum could double as an independence vote if the 2016 result was repeated and Scotland backed Remain and the UK voted Leave.  There is fight between the UK and Scottish governments at the Supreme Court between now and the autumn, which could end in Westminster trampling over Holyrood\u0026rsquos alternative Brexit Bill, a huge moment the SNP would add to their case for independence.  But the lack of popular support for a second plebiscite will be a concern for the First Minister.  Nevertheless, the poll also found support for independence slightly higher than in the 55-45 No vote of 2014, with 53 per cent opposed and 47 per cent in favour, excluding don\u0026rsquot knows.  The Scottish Parliament voted last year in favour of Westminster transferring the power to hold a referendum, but the request for a \u0027Section 30 order\u0027 was rebuffed by Theresa May.  If Ms Sturgeon pushed again for a referendum, the Prime Minister would almost certainly refuse again, but the SNP could cite the snub in the 2021 Holyrood election as evidence of Westminster arrogance, as they try to win a clear-cut mandate for a new vote.  Professor Sir John Curtice of Strathclyde University said the poll showed that, despite SNP hopes of a shift in opinion, Brexit was still having little impact on the independence question.  He said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the SNP have had somewhat the better of the argument in the row about the impact of Brexit Withdrawal Bill on the powers of the Scottish Parliament, there\u0026rsquos still no sign of any significant change in the level for support for independence \u0026ndash or much evidence of enthusiasm for an early ballot among the party\u0026rsquos supporters.  The Unionist parties said Ms Sturgeon should drop an idea the public didn\u0026rsquot clearly want.  Scottish Labour Leader Richard Leonard said: \"The people of Scotland want the government focused on jobs, schools and hospitals, not another referendum campaign that creates false divisions between working class people when the real divide is between the richest and the rest of us.  \"The chaos at the heart of the Tory government has focused people\u0026rsquos minds on the extreme challenges of leaving a political and economic union, and it is clear that there is not strong support for Nicola Sturgeon to try and force another referendum onto the agenda.\"  A Scottish Tory spokesman said: \u0026ldquoThis poll again shows the majority of people do not want a second referendum - and they overwhelmingly don\u0026rsquot want one any time soon.  \u0026ldquoNicola Sturgeon should use this research as motivation to take the threat of another divisive vote off the table.  The SNP highlighted the narrowing between the Yes and No sides on independence compared to 2014.  MSP Derek Mackay, the party\u0026rsquos business convener, said support for independence remained at historically high levels, \"with a Yes majority within the margin of error and well within touching distance\".  Dropping a hint that Ms Sturgeon was minded to push for a second vote, he said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore not - yet - in the heat of an independence campaign.  \u0026ldquoBut as Westminster moves from chaos to utter shambles, proving beyond doubt it is incapable of protecting our interests, the case for independence becomes ever stronger.  \u0026ldquoLittle wonder that since last year there has been a marked rise in the number of people who back giving the people of Scotland that choice over their future.  \u0026ldquoWith the full powers of independence we could make better choices in Scotland\u0026rsquos interests and avoid the damage of a Tory Brexit.  Scottish Green MSP Patrick Harvie added:\u0026nbsp\"It\u0026rsquos remarkable that support for independence remains so high given that the Yes movement hasn\u0026rsquot done a single bit of formal campaigning.  \"The status quo will no longer exist in March 2019 and I suspect that voters in Scotland will come to demand a say on whether we should be dragged along with this Brexit mess.\"  Survation interviewed 1002 Scots online between July 5 and 10."},{"url":null,"title":"salt-marshes-could-start-to-disappear-in-south-east-by-2040","story":"  Studying samples from sediments, experts have tracked sea levels over the past 10,000 years to study how changes have affected salt marshes.  Durham University researchers estimate that marshes in the south east of England could start to disappear from the year 2040, and across all of Great Britain by 2100.  The lasting effect of ice removal since the end of the last Ice Age means most of Scotland is rising and southern England is subsiding, which explains the difference in timescales.  The study, published in Nature Communications, shows that rising sea levels over the last 10,000 years has led to increased water-logging of the salt marshes, killing vegetation that protects them from erosion and resulting in the marshes retreating landwards.  Salt marshes are coastal wetlands that are flooded and drained by salt water brought in by the tides and can be found along the British coast.  They are a transitional area between water and land and are home to delicate ecosystems.  They also protect coastal areas from\u0026nbsperosion\u0026nbspby acting as a buffer for waves in storms and reducing flooding by slowing and absorbing rainwater.  Extensive marshes occur along major estuaries around Britain including the Thames, Solent, Bristol Channel, The Wash, Humber, Mersey, Solway Firth, Firth of Forth, Clyde and Cromarty Firth.  Co-author Professor Ian Shennan, from the Department of Geography at Durham University, said: \u0026ldquoSea level rise is inevitable over the next 100 years, as it has been over much of the last 10,000 years.  \u0026ldquoThe rates differ across Great Britain and we can model these differences.  \u0026ldquoQuantifying the vulnerability of marshes to sea level rise is essential if the threat is to be mitigated over the coming decades.  Professor Shennan said the Environment Agency has plans which include allowing new areas to flood.  The research involved scientists from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands, University College Dublin, College of William and Mary, and Rutgers University, both in the US, and Durham University."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-hails-plan-to-deliver-principled-and-pragmatic-brexit","story":"  The 98-page document \u0026ndash which prompted the resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis from her Cabinet \u0026ndash contains much to enrage Eurosceptic members of her own party.

Five of the firms’ 14 employees have been made redundant with immediate effect, while the remaining employees have been retained to assist the administrators to realise the companies’ assets, including four sites currently being developed in Peterhead, Burntisland, Keith and Kemnay and Peterhead.Deveron Homes was established in 2002 and the construction arm was incorporated in 2008. In recent years, both businesses encountered challenges and delays on a number of development projects.The resulting additional costs, combined with difficult conditions in the sector and the wider challenges in the Aberdeenshire housing market, left the firms with reduced margins, significant levels of debt and a lack of funding to acquire new sites.Following an assessment of the immediate funding requirement, the directors determined they had no choice but to place both companies into administration to protect the creditors’ position as best as possible.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Friday 13 Jul 2018 1:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Cremation costs more in the north","story":"GRIEVING families from Caithness are paying more than the national average to have their loved ones cremated, according to a survey out this week.The survey, conducted by comparison site Beyond, showed that out of all the public crematoriums in the United Kingdom, Inverness was the fifth most expensive.A cremation at Inverness costs \u0026pound904 \u0026ndash \u0026pound130 above the national average \u0026ndash while the highest rate is charged by Thorncliffe, in the Cumbrian town of Barrow, at \u0026pound959.Inverness crematorium is the most accessible to Caithness.

Its total value was said to be between \u0026pound150 million and \u0026pound300m.Work on that contract is expected to get under way in September with three launches due to be completed by November next year.The orders will see the company\u0026rsquos local workforce increase from around 30, at present, to up to 160.\u0026ldquoThis will give us continual work in Caithness until 2020, although there will be peaks and troughs along the way \u0026ndash but this is great news all round, Mr Watt added.Jonathan Tame, company vice president for the UK and Canada, said: \u0026ldquoWe are pleased to have the opportunity to bring our extensive expertise to a project of this importance.\u0026ldquoIn doing so it demonstrates Shell\u0026rsquos confidence in our value-adding solutions, and continues a successful North Sea collaboration that has been in place since 1984.The Penguins field was discovered in 1974 and first developed in 2002.The three pipeline bundles for Statoil will involve the largest diameter pipe assembled in the far north.The bulk of the fabrication will be done in Caithness, with design and project management work due to be undertaken at Subsea7\u0026rsquos premises in Aberdeen and at Stavanger in Norway.At the time that order was announced in December last year, Mr Watt said: \u0026ldquoIt is good to have Statoil back. The last bundle we did for them was in 2003.\u0026ldquoIt is an important project and shows pipeline bundles are the preference for developing the North Sea sector. It is the right product at the right time.The Statoil order will include pipeline bundles and control umbilicals required for the development.The Snorre field is sited within the Tampen area of the Norwegian North Sea.Since the last pipeline was launched in Caithness in March last year, the company has refurbished the rail track which is used to transport the bundles to the sea and on to the tugs before being taken to their destination.Friday 13 Jul 2018 1:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116401.jpg","title":"Sunny conditions set to continue all week in Caithness","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCAITHNESS and other parts of the north are set to enjoy more dry and settled conditions under gin-blue skies coupled with virtually unbroken sunshine for the remainder of the week and beyond.On Sunday afternoon the air temperature in Wick peaked at 21.6C (70.9F).\u0026nbspLast Thursday morning the town witnessed a high of 22.5C (72.5F), making it the warmest day in the burgh for any day in June since 2011.The highest temperature recorded in Wick since 1910 is currently 26.7C (80.1F), witnessed on June 6, 1939.

Pupils at Wick High could also miss out on extracurricular activities, it was stated.At present, Stagecoach runs a service to Gills Bay three times a day, Monday to Saturday, but from next month it will operate twice a day, Monday to Friday. There are additional journeys between Wick and John O\u0026rsquoGroats but they vary according to school hours.A Stagecoach spokeswoman said the company recognised the feedback from the community over its plans. \u0026ldquoThe revised proposals represent a significant investment by Stagecoach, and work will continue to promote these links to encourage a sustainable level of demand. A review will take place 12 months after the start of the new timetable in order to establish the long term future of the bus service to Gills Bay.Trudy Morris, who chairs the Caithness Transport Forum, said: \u0026ldquoWe are very pleased to see that Stagecoach has listened to the local community and agreed to secure the bus link to Gills Bay for a further 12 months. Not only will this bring benefit to local bus users, who would otherwise be isolated in their communities, but it also has potential to benefit the tourist market, providing services to link with the Gills Bay ferry.However, she is concerned about the review in 12 months time and said: \u0026ldquoWe will be working with Stagecoach and the local community to see what can be done to promote usage of the route, and will also be discussing with public sector partners such as Highland Council to see what might be done to secure the route on a non-commercial basis in future.Bill Mowat, the chairman of Gills Harbour Ltd, claimed public pressure had an impact on Stagecoach and pointed out there was strong opposition to the plan.Friday 13 Jul 2018 1:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July 12, 2018 at 4:28 pmNo roads surface dressing work is planned for Friday or Monday, July 13 and 16.

This could run into millions of pounds and put at risk the future viability of the business.The company have also met with local Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur, to express their concerns about the delay.As the start of this month, as Mr Matheson stepped into the shoes of the previous minister for transport Humza Yousaf, it was announced that lack of agreement between the Scottish Government and Pentland Ferries had led to no discounted fares being introduced in Pentland Firth ferry routes, by the Government\u0026#8217s self-set deadline of the end of last month.Andrew Banks, Managing Director and Owner of Pentland Ferries said: “We want these passenger subsidies implemented as soon as possible but we need to be 100 per cent sure that the scheme complies with state aid rules.  We have never had any subsidy from the government and even though this scheme gives money to the passenger, not the operator, the minister has told us that we would be liable for any repayment if at a future date the scheme is deemed illegal. This could run into the millions and could finish us off.“We cannot take that risk and we have a responsibility to our staff, our community and family to make sure the scheme works for everyone. We want to work with the Minister and his team to discuss a way forward so that we can all benefit from reduced fares. This scheme will be fantastic for our business, attracting more visitors to the islands and making it cheaper to travel to the mainland for residents. So we want this unlocked as soon as possible. We welcome the Minister’s willingness to gain a full understanding of the detail and very much hope to be able to meet him in Orkney soon.”The minister, Mr Matheson, was asked for a response to the comments from Pentland Ferries and Mr Banks. At the time he replied, Transport Scotland said the invitation had not yet been received so the minister could not comment.However, Mr Matheson did say: “The Scottish Government remains committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles. I am conscious that there is a great deal of interest in this issue amongst users of the services. As I begin my new role as Transport Secretary, I want to ensure that I gain a full understanding of the detail — it is already very clear to me that planning to introduce reduced fares on the Northern Isles network has been a complex and challenging piece of work.“As a first step, we will cut fares on the Aberdeen-Lerwick and Kirkwall-Lerwick services from June 30. These reductions will be around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.“On routes to Orkney, it has been necessary to engage with commercial operators on the Pentland Firth. We set out a very fair and reasonable proposal that would maintain competition, enabling them to protect their existing market share. Unfortunately, not all the commercial operators have felt able to agree to our proposals. This means we cannot currently implement reduced fares on any of the routes to and from Orkney without the risk of legal challenge.“This is both disappointing and frustrating, but I am determined to work through the issue to see what more can be done.

This will help reduce the initial barrier of connection for a defined period of time.Two events are planned at the St Magnus Centre in Kirkwall, from 6pm to 8pm on Wednesday July 11 then from 10am to 12pm on Thursday July 12 with a further event at the Doubletree by Hilton, Glasgow Central, from 10.30am to 12.30noon on Friday July 13 and finally, a webinar will take place on Tuesday July 17 from 10am to 12pm.Registration is required for the Alternative Approach consultations via the following link: https://www.ssen-transmission/news-views/articles/2018/6/solving-orkney-s-catch-22/Commenting on the Alternative Approach consultation events, Lauren Milligan, commercial policy manager, said: “As a customer-driven initiative, stakeholder engagement has shaped the Alternative Approach proposal to date.“We want to ensure that we develop a solution that not only works for network companies but also the wider industry and other connection customers and would therefore encourage anyone with an interest in our proposed Alternative Approach trial to register for one of our consultation events.”The final stage of consultation is planned to take place in Autumn on the various components of the transmission reinforcement project in advance of submitting planning applications to the relevant planning authorities, the Scottish Government, Marine Scotland and Orkney Islands Council.The progression of the project is subject to all necessary planning consents and securing regulatory approval from industry regulator Ofgem, with the Alternative Approach trial also subject to regulatory approval.For more information on the proposed Orkney transmission reinforcement, including links to both consultation documents, click here.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It\u0026rsquos not an easy decision.\"We\u0026rsquove listened to customers, colleagues, communities and elected representatives and we continue to do so.\"We\u0026rsquove committed to making no further changes to the size of our branch network in Scotland until at least 2020 \u0026ndash and not to remove or replace, at a suitable nearby location, the branch ATM if there\u0026rsquos no other free-to-use ATM within 1km of the closing branch.\"The way our customers are banking is changing and it is important that we respond to that change. Across Scotland, usage of our branches is down 42 per cent since 2014. Only one per cent of our customers in Scotland visit their branch on a regular weekly basis. Seven in 10 customers are using mobile or online banking.\"\"We recognise that every customer will have different banking needs and we are committed to ensuring all our customers receive the best possible service.\"We\u0026rsquove invested to provide more ways to bank with us now than ever before.\"He added: \"We\u0026rsquove committed to keeping 10 branches open until the end of 2018.\"Johnston Carmichael has been appointed to carry out an independent review into these 10 branches and are meeting with local customers, representatives, employees and stakeholders in all ten communities to understand the impact of each individual closure.\"We have committed to accepting the recommendations of this review in full.\"Friday 13 Jul 2018 1:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It is not clear why the paving moved but the extreme heat is suspected to be the cause.\"Meanwhile, emergency services were also called into action to tackle wildfires, including one in the Coulhill area of Alness on Tuesday.Firefighters were called to the scene of the 1000sqm blaze at around 10.30am, and remained on the scene for several hours before the fire was brought under control.And farmers in the area have voiced concerns that straw supplies could be set to run out amid the ongoing dry spell, with the National Farmers\u0026rsquo Union urging members to be proactive in negotiating reasonable prices.Friday 13 Jul 2018 1:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4766391.1531416694!/image/image.jpg","title":"oldest higland bagpipes in existence to be played at clan meeting","story":"        The oldest Highland bagpipes in existence, and which rang out at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, are to be played for just the fourth time in 200 years.                The Faery Pipes of Kinlochmoidart, reputed to be more than 800 years old, are normally kept in a special case at the West Highland Museum, Fort William.            It is said that they are “enchanted” and have never been played on the losing side of a battle.            They will be taken out of the case for a clan gathering, the World Gathering of Macintyres, which takes place in Oban and Taynuilt next week.At the clan’s banquet in the Argyllshire Gathering Halls on Friday, 20 July, the pipes will be played by Andrew Macintyre from Edinburgh.They will be played again on Sunday, 22 July, by Ruaraidh Petre, nephew of Archie McIntyre, a descendant of the MacIntyres who formerly possessed them.This time they will be in Glenoe, the ancestral lands of MacIntyres, at Loch Etive between Oban and Taynuilt. A ceremony will be held at a cairn to the chiefs of Clan MacIntyre. In addition, the chief’s son will be at this gathering –the first time the family has returned to Scotland since emigrating to the US in 1822.            The pipes were handmade by a MacIntyre piper more than 800 years ago and are reputed to be the first pipes ever with two holes.According to legend, the MacIntyre piper had made his own chanter, and then in a dream a “faery” came to him and said: “Heat up your poker until it’s white hot and pierce the bottom of your chanter side to side and it will make the sweetest sounding pipes in Scotland.”These days, the chanter is the only part left of the original Faery Pipes and the holes do look as though they were burned in by a poker.Dr Alison Macintyre, organiser of the gathering, said: “The pipes have been out three times in 200 years. The last time was at the 2008 MacIntyre banquet when they were played by Archie McIntyre.            “The West Highland Museum is being very gracious in letting us use the Faery Pipes.“They are enchanted pipes and we are really excited to have them at the banquet and on the Sunday. We think that with having the Faery Pipes played at Glenoe with the son of the chief present, we should be able to stir up some ancestors.”Other highlights of the clan gathering include attending Taynuilt Highland Games, hikes, ceilidhs, boat tours and Gaelic workshops."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4767571.1531416189!/image/image.jpg","title":"kevan christie jeane freeman makes good start as health secretary","story":"        Scotland\u0026#8217s new Health Secretary appears to have got off to a flyer in terms of addressing the range of issues that weighed down her predecessor, Shona Robison, leading to her inevitable resignation and creating a siege mentalilty in the higher echelons of Holyrood.                 Jeane Freeman certainly brings a wealth of much-needed life experience and a degree of pragmatism to this most difficult of roles.            The former nurse has made all the right noises in terms of pledging to increase the speed at which the opaque health and social care services need to be brought together to address the country’s delayed-discharge problem – also known as bed-blocking – a nightmare that keeps people waiting in hospital when they’re fit enough to leave.            Here’s hoping she bangs a few bureaucratic heads together and manages to navigate through the coalition of local health boards and councils tasked with providing social care – a flagship idea from her own government built on an integration pipe dream. Good luck with that one Jeane. READ MORE: Nicola Sturgeon pays tribute to NHS staff as health service marks 70 yearsHowever, what may prove even more difficult for the nascent Cabinet Secretary is her vow to cut waiting times – a weekly Groundhog Day for Robison that proved to be her Achilles’ heel. A\u0026ampE waiting-time targets have been missed for a ninth month in a row and bed-blocking has risen eight per cent in a year. And those problems make up the tip of an iceberg that also includes almost 500 cancelled operations in May alone due to a lack of hospital capacity, an ongoing GP recruitment crisis and cancer treatment waiting times at their worst level in six years. Hopefully, Freeman doesn’t fall into the trap set by the Scottish Government’s own Information Services Division, which brings out a fresh raft of statistics every Tuesday to the delight of opposition parties who are provided with their weekly open goal. The early signs are that the new Health Secretary has no difficulty acknowledging there are problems in providing free healthcare to an ageing population and this is to be welcomed.             A situation developed over the course of Robison’s tenure in which the media would (over) report on the latest missed waiting time target, the likes of Scottish Labour’s Anas Sarwar would call for her head, and the under-fire Health Secretary would ignore the problem. Instead she would tell us, again, how much her Government had spent on improving the nation’s health. READ MORE: 500 operations cancelled due to ‘non-clinical’ reasonsNotable figures like the chair of the BMA in Scotland, Dr Peter Bennie, and a former chief medical officer, Sir Harry Burns, have consistently argued that waiting-time figures should be scrapped and are counter-productive to providing the best healthcare. This was blatantly ignored by Robsion and her Cabinet colleagues who developed the frankly annoying habit of constantly comparing statistics in Scotland to the rest of the UK, most notably England, in a politicisation of the health service that isn’t helpful to someone waiting 37 weeks for a knee replacement.  I may be over-optimistic but if Freeman can bring her own stamp of authority to the job and tackle critics head-on, while admitting problems exist, then we may be moving forward. The first publication of the monthly financial performance of all NHS health boards is an encouraging move towards greater transparency and Scotland’s GPs are on record as saying Freeman can help rebuild general practice. So, the goodwill appears to be there and the current mood music is favourable – let’s hope it lasts."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4767570.1531335460!/image/image.jpg","title":"tom peterkin honour of carrington contrasts with boris s ambition","story":"        The late Lord Carrington set an example that modern politicians would do well to follow, writes Tom Peterkin.                There was a fearful symmetry about the passing of Lord Carrington at a time when the British body politic is still reeling from the resignation of one of his successors as Foreign Secretary.            On the most superficial level, the late Lord Carrington and Boris Johnson would appear to have quite a bit in common.            When Mr Johnson quit on Monday, he became the first Foreign Secretary to resign since Lord Carrington left Margaret Thatcher’s Government over the invasion of the Falklands by Argentina in 1982. And on that same day, by a strange coincidence, Lord Carrington died at the age of 99.Both men, it could be said, come from traditional Tory backgrounds with Mr Johnson, an old Etonian and a product of Oxford University and the Bullingdon Club. Also an Etonian, Lord Carrington’s background looks distinctly anachronistic by today’s standards. But it was not that unusual in a bygone political era. He was a hereditary peer, who was never elected yet held some of the great offices of state. Both men, like many politicians, could be charm – even panache – itself. Although Mr Johnson’s unique breed of charm, based on oafish buffoonery, seems to have lost some of the lustre that made him such a draw on the Have I Got News for You circuit.But, the closer one looks at the two characters, the similarities are harder to find. The contrasts become more evident and are not greatly to Mr Johnson’s credit.            Yesterday’s fulsome obituaries of Lord Carrington recalled a patrician, paternalistic old-school “One Nation” Tory.READ MORE: Lord Carrington, who resigned over the Falklands, has died aged 99Unlike Mr Johnson’s gaffe-laden courting of celebrity and love of a photo opportunity, Lord Carrington was reticent to a fault when it came to self-promotion.He was so self-effacing that when writing his memoirs he didn’t bother to mention that he had won a Military Cross in the Second World War. Some thought it should have been a Victoria Cross. But when asked in an interview how he won it his answer was “pot luck”.            As a civilian member of a post-war generation, Mr Johnson has never had the chance to win a military decoration. But while Lord Carrington drove a tank on to a bridge over the Rhine and held the enemy at enormous personal risk, Mr Johnson is known for being filmed stranded on a zip-wire. They may have both resigned as Foreign Secretary, but the circumstances surrounding their departures could hardly be more different. Lord Carrington resigned as Foreign Secretary three days after Argentina invaded the Falklands. He felt he had no option other than to go, taking responsibility for the Foreign Office’s collective failure to foresee that trouble was on its way. “The nation feels there has been a disgrace,” he wrote in his memoirs. “Somebody must have been to blame. The disgrace must be purged. The person to purge it should be the minister in charge. That was me.”Despite Mrs Thatcher trying to persuade him not to go, he went and, to this day, it is seen as the act of an honourable man.            READ MORE: UK Government to start stockpiling food for no-deal BrexitHistory, one suspects, will not judge Mr Johnson quite so kindly. Given his ability to conjure up a memorable turn of phrase, it was no surprise that his resignation letter was a classic of its kind.In it, he complained that Brexit was “dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt”.Needless self-doubt is not something that has troubled Mr Johnson when it comes to his own ambition and it is difficult to escape the impression that his decision to quit was all about him. In fact, it would appear almost every political move he makes is all about him.The former Foreign Secretary’s critics believe his decision to embrace the Brexit cause before the 2016 EU referendum was more to do with his own Tory leadership ambitions than any matter of principle.Similarly, those self-same critics believe his departure to be driven by exactly the same motive – his own desire to end up in Number 10 Downing Street.Mrs May had installed Mr Johnson in one of the most crucial posts in her Cabinet on the basis that, as a Brexiteer, he should shoulder his share of the heavy lifting in these difficult times.In fact, Mr Johnson was more of a hindrance than a help – a disruptive influence at a time when politicians should be pulling together. In the world of Boris, as soon as David Davis leapt off Mrs May’s increasingly precarious ship, he had little option but to do likewise.Had Mr Davis been the only Cabinet minister to disembark that would have made him the only figurehead for disaffected Tory MPs to rally round and mount a challenge to Mrs May. Had Mr Johnson stayed in the Cabinet and been bound by collective responsibility (inasmuch as Boris Johnson can ever be bound by collective responsibility), Mr Davis would be given a free run when it came to stirring up trouble for the Prime Minister.Now Mr Johnson also lurks on the sidelines making himself a focal point for Tory dissatisfaction with the current leadership. We will never know how Lord Carrington would have viewed this state of affairs. But he did once say: “I had no desire whatsoever to lead the party – nor ever had.”Were Mr Johnson to say something similar, one suspects it would not bear much relation to the truth."},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al.

He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday.

Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s most extreme weather.\n\"We decided to put our meteorological skills together and chase the storms ourselves.\"\nThe group of Reading University graduates rented a car and travelled 7000 miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nFriday 13 Jul 2018 1:38

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nFriday 13 Jul 2018 1:38 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/advert_whfp.jpg","title":"former sabhal mor ostaig chairman","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nFormer Sabhal Mòr Ostaig chair Duncan MacQuarrie was celebrated this week with the first road in the new Kilbeg Village development, Rathad MhicGuaire (MacQuarrie Road) named in his honour during an official ceremony held on Monday.\nThe ceremony was carried out by Kate Forbes MSP and recognised the key role which Mr MacQuarrie has played in the college\u0026#8217s development over many years. Sabhal Mòr Ostaig principal Prof Boyd Robertson said, \u0026#8220This is a richly-deserved honour for Duncan which recognises the hugely important contribution he has made to the development of the college over many years and the vital contribution he has made to the development of the Gaelic language and culture and to the advancement of Gaelic and Gaelic-medium education, both as a teacher and as a former HM Inspector.”\n“Duncan\u0026#8217s critical input to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig’s development in its challenging formative years was marked by his steady stewardship, as a former chairman and his pioneering work, alongside that of his fellow trustees, demonstrated an exemplary vision and commitment without which what is now the National Centre for the Gaelic Language and Culture would not have existed.”\n“For that, all who have benefited from this wonderful and inspiring place, over the intervening years, owe him a great debt of gratitude and it is for that reason we celebrate with him here today.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve.
